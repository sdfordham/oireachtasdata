The minutes of the meeting of 20 June 2013 have not been finalised.  They will form part of our agenda for the next meeting.  Discussion of matters arising from the minutes does not apply until they are provided.  Item No. 3 is correspondence received since our meeting on Thursday, 20 June 2013.</p></speech>

The Chairman offered to consider inviting the office to appear before the committee.  Can we make that request as soon as possible?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-27a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013062700003#B00400"><p>Yes, we are doing that.  When did the Deputy have in mind for this meeting?  I would like to know what kind of pressure we are under.</p></speech>

It is clear that many will go out of business.  This is relevant to the work of this committee and the taxpayer because of the massive amounts of commercial rates being written off and the massive arrears in local authorities, which are going up.  There is an association between what the Valuation Office is doing and how much money is effectively not being collected.  Issues arise from the general administration of the Valuation Office and how it goes about its business.  There is a loss to the taxpayer.  We need to examine this because economic times have changed and some say it is not going to get better any time soon.  We need to consider the effect the valuations being put on businesses and the ratings involved are having on business.  Can we invite the representatives of the Valuation Office on that basis as soon as possible?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-27a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1011" speakername="Robert Dowds" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013062700003#B00600"><p>I support that request and would be interested to see the difference in impact in counties in which the new system has come in compared to the old system.  I know that will not give a full picture because they were different economic times, but it is important to have a decent system of commercial rates and it is important that businesses can survive.</p></speech>

Some of those matters might be taken up in a general way today with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p></speech>

This completely changes the way in which businesses are assessed.  We are moving towards a system of self-assessment and the Valuation Office will have views on that and when and whether it should be expedited through the Government.  What will it mean to have two separate systems of assessment once that Bill is enacted and how will their administration work, in some cases in two different parts of the country?  All of those issues need to be teased out with the Valuation Office.</p></speech>

This is to be noted.</p><p>  No. 3B.3 is correspondence dated 11 June 2013 from Mrs Barbara Bradley, Nurney, County Carlow, forwarding correspondence with An Taoiseach regarding Kilkenny College.  This is to be noted.  We have had previous correspondence from Mrs Bradley on this issue.  It is not a matter for the PAC and as we are only being copied with the correspondence, we do not have to take further action on it.  We did have previous correspondence with her and issued a reply.

This is to be noted and a copy forwarded to Ms Farrell.</p><p>  No. 3B.6 is correspondence dated 24 June 2013 from Michael J. Staines and Company Solicitors, concerning an invitation to Mr. Se&aacute;n Fitzpatrick to appear before the committee in connection with the committee's examination of Special Report No. 77 of the Comptroller and Auditor General.

Responsibility for heritage matters also transferred from the Department to the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in May 2011.</p><p>  The Department had gross expenditure of &euro;1.6 billion in 2011.  The most significant reductions year-on-year related to spending on social housing provision and support which fell by &euro;291 million, or 37%, and spending on the water services investment programme which fell by &euro;66 million or 13%.  The payment from the Vote to the local government fund fell by &euro;66 million or 28%, relative to 2010. </p><p>  The local government fund has been in operation since 1999 and it had income of &euro;1.19 billion in 2011.  The most significant sources of income in the year for the fund was motor taxation income of &euro;1 billion and Exchequer funding from Vote 25 of &euro;175 million.  Expenditure in the year was &euro;1.15 billion. </p><p>  Payments from the fund included just under &euro;400 million to assist local authorities in meeting costs associated with a programme of works on regional and local roads.  The other main area of expenditure on the fund in 2011 was payments of general subventions to local authorities amounting to &euro;700 million, as a contribution toward funding of other activities.</p><p>  The environment fund accounts for 2011 are also before the committee today.  The fund was established in 2001.  The resources of the fund are mainly used to finance waste management initiatives, environmental enforcement measures and research in the environmental area.  Income of the fund in 2011 amounted to &euro;62.6 million.  The main sources of income were receipts of &euro;46 million from the environmental levy on the landfill of waste and &euro;16 million from the plastic bag levy. </p><p>  Chapter 27 presents the results of a review of the arrangements for collecting the landfill and plastic bag levies.  It also considers the processes in place to detect and deter non-compliance. </p><p>  The plastic bag levy was introduced in 2002.  Up to the end of 2011, &euro;182 million had been collected.  The Department has overall responsibility for the levy.  The Revenue Commissioners were assigned responsibility for collection and enforcement.  Local authorities also have an enforcement role. </p><p>  The levy is collected from individual consumers by retailers when they supply certain plastic bags.  A key aspect of maximising compliance is ensuring that all those who supply plastic bags are registered.  A 2008 random review by Revenue of 215 retail stores found that one in five of the retailers surveyed should have been registered but were not.  Further such reviews have not been carried out.</p><p>  Revenue completed 70 audits of registered retailers in the five years to 2011, resulting in an additional &euro;2 million being collected from just over two thirds of those cases.  A court appeal by a large multiple retailer against a Revenue assessment of a plastic bag levy liability of &euro;36 million has been ongoing for a number of years. </p><p>  The results of inspections undertaken by local authorities are not collated centrally.  This makes it difficult to assess the adequacy of the inspection programme and the overall level of compliance. </p><p>  The examination also found that Revenue and the local authorities do not share the results of the compliance work that each undertake.  Sharing of information would facilitate a more focused national inspection strategy.  This should help maximise compliance but there may be data protection issues to be resolved. </p><p>  The landfill levy was also introduced in 2002.  By end 2011, around &euro;321 million had been collected.  The Department is responsible for the administration of the levy with the local authorities having responsibility for its collection.  The levy is payable in respect of waste disposed of at landfill sites whether the site is operated privately or by a local authority. </p><p>  The landfill levy regulations require that levy collection in each private landfill be audited at least twice each year but this requirement is not being met.  At the time of my report, periodic audits had been carried out in the period 2006 to 2011 in respect of only two of four private landfill sites.  Even in those two cases, the number of audits carried out was just over half of the number specified in the regulations.  In contrast, the regulations set no target or requirement for the frequency of audit for local authority landfills.  So far as we could establish, no local authority landfill had been audited in that respect.</p></speech>

We were again assigned the second largest capital allocation of any Department to implement major housing, water, rural development and other programmes.</p><p>  In the housing area, the housing policy statement published in June 2011 outlined the Government&rsquo;s approach to addressing rising demand for social housing through a restructured investment programme, the use of more flexible funding models, the standing down of affordable housing schemes and a continued focus on meeting the most acute housing needs.  A key development in this area was the publication in October 2011 of a national housing strategy for people with a disability to support people with disabilities in living more independently in communities.  Total spending from the Vote on the various housing programmes, including the provision of social housing and improvement and regeneration measures, amounted to over &euro;740 million in 2011.</p><p>  During the year, nearly 1,200 housing units were delivered through leasing and more than 6,300 units were delivered under the rental accommodation scheme.  Some &euro;117 million was invested in regeneration programmes in Dublin, Limerick, Cork, Waterford, Tralee, Dundalk and Sligo.  Approximately 12,000 households benefited under the housing adaptation grant schemes through combined Exchequer and local authority funding of over &euro;76 million.  The total spend from the Vote in this area in 2011 ensured the needs of over 23,000 households were met from the full range of housing measures.</p><p>  Department expenditure of &euro;429 million on water services infrastructure in 2011 allowed completion of 61 major water services contracts and the continuation of work on a further 61 contracts.  In addition, work commenced on 33 contracts in the course of the year.  Some 200 km of public water supply pipes were rehabilitated.  Between 2000 and 2011, we added 1.526 million population equivalent to the capacity of water treatment systems and some 3.96 million population equivalent in wastewater treatment capacity.  In terms of programme planning, a review of the Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012 was carried out and an additional 39 contracts were added to the programme, mainly to meet key environmental requirements.</p><p>  As reflected in the appropriation account before the committee today, 2011 saw the assignment to the Department of community-related functions which were the responsibility of the former Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Heritage spending became the responsibility of the new Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.</p><p>  During the year, funding of &euro;47 million was provided under axes 3 and 4 of the Leader rural development programme, resulting in the creation of 634 full-time jobs in 2011 and infrastructural enhancements in 658 villages and communities across the country.  Under the local and community development programme, which benefited from &euro;62 million in funding in 2011, support and guidance was provided to almost 62,000 young people and children through youth actions.  Almost 39,000 adults received advice and information under the programme, while a further 39,000 received one-to-one supports, mentoring, training and employment supports.  Up to 8,000 people were progressed into labour market training as a direct result of the programme&rsquo;s interventions.</p><p>  The environment fund was established in 2001 and its income derives from levies on landfill waste and on plastic bags.  These levies are first and foremost economic instruments which have as their objective the encouragement of more environmentally sustainable behaviour.  However, the fund is used to meet important expenditure requirements in the waste management and other environmental areas.  For example, the fund is used to support the operation of local authority recycling centres and bring banks, as well as the enforcement work of local authorities and the EPA.</p><p>  The fund accounts for 2011 show that the surplus in the fund was reduced from &euro;36 million at the end of 2010 to &euro;14 million at the end of 2011, demonstrating the increasing pressures on the fund.  This reduction reflects the support from the fund to priority areas, such as water quality monitoring and assessment, for which Exchequer funding was unavailable due to decreasing resources in the Vote.</p><p>  Chapter 27 of the Comptroller&rsquo;s annual report concerning environmental levies reviews the arrangements for collection of the levies.  Local authorities are responsible for collection of the landfill levy, while the Revenue Commissioners are the collection authority for the plastic bag levy.  The chapter outlines four recommendations for the plastic bag levy, of which two relate to procedures that are in the control of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  One recommendation is made on the landfill levy.  My Department has taken measures to address the issues raised in the relevant recommendations and will continue to work to implement them to the greatest extent possible.</p><p>  The local government fund was established in 1999 as a dedicated source of funding for local authorities to meet general purpose spending needs, as well as a range of other local spending requirements.  Motor tax is the principal source of income for the fund.  The fund accounts for 2011, which are also on the committee&rsquo;s agenda for today, detail income and expenditure in that year.  The accounts for 2011 show income of &euro;1.189 billion, down almost 6% on the 2010 figure.  Some &euro;737 million was allocated directly to local authorities, with a further &euro;411 million being allocated to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  This includes &euro;398 million to assist local authorities in meeting costs associated with the programme of works on regional and local roads.</p><p>  In 2012, the Exchequer contribution to the fund was replaced by revenue from the household charge.  On the spending side, a payment of &euro;46.5 million was made to the Exchequer from the fund in respect of proceeds arising from increases in motor tax in budget 2012.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-27a.39" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Laura Burke" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013062700006#E00500"><p>I thank the Chairman for giving me the opportunity to attend this meeting.  </p><p>  The mission of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA is to protect and improve the environment as a valuable asset for the people of Ireland.  The objective is to have a clean, healthy and well protected environment supporting a sustainable society and economy.</p><p>  The EPA performs a wide range of statutory functions for the protection of the environment.  In May 2011 an independent external review of the agency was completed.  The report of the review group states that, overall, the EPA has provided &quot;considerable benefit for Ireland's environment and for the health and well-being of its people&quot; and that the environmental expertise within the agency is a significant national resource.  I take the opportunity to recognise the contribution of EPA staff in delivering the objectives of the agency.</p><p>  While it is understood the focus of the committee's session is on the EPA's financial statements for 2011, I have also included updates on developments during 2012 and 2013 throughout the briefing document provided for committee members in advance of the meeting.</p><p>  The EPA has a key role in licensing facilities with the potential to cause significant environmental pollution to ensure their emissions do not endanger human health or harm the environment.  In 2011 we issued 163 licences and 467 certificates of authorisation.  We also carried out more than 1,000 inspections and audits and took 23 prosecutions in the District Court.  One licensee was issued with a notification of intention to revoke a licence.  In 2012 we took 16 successful prosecutions in the District Court and a further case, taken on indictment by the Director of Public Prosecution on foot of a file prepared by the EPA, resulted in fines of over &euro;1 million being awarded for odour nuisance.</p><p>  In 2011 the national waste prevention programme, NWPP, led by the EPA, continued to deliver substantive results in preventing and minimising waste through its BeGreen resource efficiency programmes.  The 2012 results from the BeGreen programmes such as Green Business, Green Hospitality and Green Health care identified economic savings in excess of &euro;10 million, with further potential savings of &euro;5 million, from an investment by the EPA of <i>circa</i> &euro;1.2 million.</p><p>  With regard to climate change, greenhouse gas emissions figures released by the EPA in 2011 showed that Ireland's emissions had fallen by 1.1% in 2010.  Our latest figures show that Ireland will comply with its Kyoto Protocol obligations for greenhouse gas emissions; however, there continues to be a significant risk that Ireland will not meet its EU 2020 targets, with Ireland projected to breach annual limits by 2015-16.</p><p>  The EPA's report on air quality in Ireland in 2011 found that air quality met all EU standards.  Clean, healthy and well protected water is essential to maintain viable and vibrant communities across all areas of Ireland, urban and rural.  The EPA's drinking water report for 2011 showed that public water supplies serving more than 80% of the population continued to improve, with results indicating that the quality of our larger supplies was equivalent to similar supplies elsewhere in Europe.  By the end of 2011, 100% of public drinking water supplies had chlorine monitors installed, up from 30% in 2008-09.</p><p>  With regard to bathing water, while over 97% of bathing waters met the minimum EU mandatory standard in 2012, only 67% met the more stringent EU guide values.  This is significantly down on previous years but similar to reductions observed both in Scotland and other part of the United Kingdom as a result of the high levels of rainfall during the summer of 2012.</p><p>  Since the EPA was established in 1993, the Comptroller and Auditor General has issued a clean audit report in respect of each year's financial statements.  The EPA's 2011 annual accounts were signed off on by the Comptroller and Auditor General on 12 July 2012.  The total budget available to the EPA in 2011 was &euro;59.8 million.  The EPA's budget has reduced from &euro;65 million in 2009 to &euro;53 million in 2013, while staff numbers have reduced from 343 to 309.  During the same period the statutory functions assigned to the EPA have increased.  In spite of these changed circumstances, the EPA has carried out and will continue to carry out its key roles in environmental regulation, the provision of knowledge, in advocating for the environment and delivering the valuable societal outcomes for which we are recognised.</p></speech>

I will begin by addressing questions to Ms Tallon.</p><p>  The local property tax kicks in on 1 July and becomes a new funding method for the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The Department was charged with introducing and collecting the household charge for the past year.  May I have an update on the levels of payment and the preparations being made by it to hand over responsibility for the charge to the Revenue Commissioners?</p></speech>

I can give the Deputy figures for the household charge up to 25 June.  As of that date, 1.253 million households had paid the household charge.  Some 24,006 households had registered for a waiver.  The compliance rate these figures represent is approximately 79%.  At that point the sum of &euro;133.4 million had been raised by the household charge.</p></speech>

We did not know what the position would be in terms of the numbers that would apply for a waiver.  Our target was roughly &euro;160 million, if there was full compliance.</p></speech>

In reality, we are budgeting in a context in which we are very strongly driving efficiency and cost reduction in the local government system.  We expect year on year that authorities will be capable of operating with lower levels of resources.  I would not say the level of collection we have achieved represents a significant deficiency or shortfall from the local authorities' point of view because we have made efficiency savings.  Ideally, we would like to see full collection.  As the Deputy knows, final collection moves to the Revenue Commissioners from 1 July.</p></speech>

As the Deputy will recall, this issue was discussed at considerable length at a meeting of this committee last year.  We started from a standing start.  There was no database of properties that were potentially liable.  A database has been rather painstakingly constructed over the course of the year in the context of the implementation of the household charge.  That database has been given to the Revenue Commissioners.  I understand it has been extremely helpful for the Revenue Commissioners during the process of preparing for the implementation of the property tax.  There is a close working relationship between the Local Government Management Agency, which has been implementing the household charge, and the Revenue Commissioners.</p></speech>

Is she satisfied with how the process went?  Does she think the local authority system was a suitable place for it to be collected in the first place?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-27a.55" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Geraldine Tallon" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013062700007#F00700"><p>On reflection, it was quite a difficult experience for the local government system.  As members are aware, we have not had this type of tax since the abolition of domestic rates.  It could be argued that our culture has been conditioned in terms of that.  As I have mentioned, there was no database in existence.  We had to construct the entire framework upon which the charge would operate.  The performance of the local government system, in getting from a blank sheet to a position of virtually 80% compliance, has to be seen as positive.  The professionalism associated with Revenue's collection system has come to the fore in more recent times.  Of course, much more significant enforcement measures are associated with Revenue legislation generally.  They tend to have a fairly salutary effect.  None the less, I think the work that was done on the household charge was an important learning experience for the system in terms of the implementation of this kind of measure.</p></speech>

I have heard stories about local authorities across the country that have failed to acknowledge receipt of payment or have taken two or three months to cash cheques.  People were wondering whether they had paid the charge.  It seemed to be a bit of a problem.  Is it a worthwhile learning experience if, one year afterwards, the function is taken away and it will not have to be done again?  What has been learned that is a transferable skill for the future?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-27a.57" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Geraldine Tallon" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013062700007#F00900"><p>I suppose we have learned that a very good communications system needs to be in place initially.  This was introduced.  The legislation for the household charge was introduced in July 2011.  Detailed implementation regulations were brought forward quite late in the year.  The charge almost came into effect in real time.  We were very concerned about communicating information to the public.  Perhaps, on reflection, we could learn from the experience to see if there are better ways of communicating publicly on a change of that kind.  We also learned that it is quite difficult to introduce a universal measure at relatively short notice in the absence of significant database capacity.  If we had to apply that kind of experience to any other measure, we would reflect very carefully on public education, awareness and communication.  We would also reflect on the question of customer satisfaction, which has been raised.  When we reflect on customer relations, we ask whether people feel they get a good and courteous service.  While I have no doubt that the local authorities and the Local Government Management Agency did their best, equally I accept that people felt quite dissatisfied in a range of respects.  I have heard many anecdotes from all around the country.  We have to reflect carefully on the customer relations programme associated with this type of measure.  Revenue's experience and depth of knowledge is in contrast to what we achieved.  Nonetheless, we are reasonably satisfied that getting to 80% is a good performance.</p></speech>

It estimated that the value of the payments they owe is &euro;27 million.  That is before one adds on charges or interest.  After 1 July, who has ownership of that outstanding amount of money?  Is it to be recouped by Revenue for the local government fund, or is it to go to central government?</p></speech>

The Minister intends to introduce full legislation in the course of this year for the full establishment of Irish Water from 1 January 2014.  As members are aware, Irish Water will then be established as a full-scale public utility within the Bord G&aacute;is group.  Irish Water will be entirely responsible for the metering programme and the arrangements for water charging.  Preparations are being made at present for the development of the metering programme.  Active work is ongoing to install boundary boxes for metering.  The Department has assisted with that as an advance measure.  In the case of the metering programme, tendering for contractors regionally and for subcontractors is under way.  I think Irish Water expects to begin the work of installing meters in the course of this year, with a view to pursuing such a programme over two to three years.</p></speech>

As a result, it will not be a Government entity and will be able to borrow on international markets and use its revenues to pay back its borrowings.  This will be all off the balance sheet for the State.  In order to do this, a pretty complex and important financial structure is being put in place.  What projections are being put together currently for the likely turnover, the refinancing costs and the likely investment packages this new public utility company will avail of?</p></speech>

Unfortunately, due to economic circumstances, we have seen a reduction in the level of investment we have been able to make in water services over the past number of years.  Our level of investment is of the order of approximately &euro;320 million for 2013.  This is insufficient investment, both to maintain the existing quality of the infrastructure we have and to invest in new infrastructure, water conservation, etc.</p><p>  PricewaterhouseCoopers conducted an exhaustive advance study on the investment needs for the water sector and its view and ours is that we need to invest at a steady rate of approximately &euro;600 million per year in order to allow for replacement and expansion and to meet economic and environmental needs.  That is the approximate investment that will be required for the foreseeable future on an annual basis.  There is, of course, a very extensive infrastructure and asset base in the local government system currently.  However, there is also a liability associated with that because water services are an area of ongoing capital investment.  Therefore, we have an extensive job of work going on in local authority finance and water departments currently to identify, quantify and extract the asset and liability position of the local government system.  This is relevant in regard to the overall future capacity of Irish Water.</p></speech>

If it seeks to invest &euro;600 million a year in water infrastructure, which I assume will be under a capital expenditure heading and will not be part of Irish Water's regular running costs, it must have a significant income.  What is the initial base case being put together?  How much income does the Department expect Irish Water to have?  What will its cost base be and how many employees will it have?  What level of borrowings does the Department expect it to have to leverage on the asset base being evaluated currently?</p></speech>

They anticipate the future rather than account for things done, so I am not sure I can give the Deputy clear answers at this stage, because this is an evolving process.  Local authorities employ approximately 4,000 people in the water services area, but I cannot quantify the expected figures for the coming years.  We expect Irish Water will operate through service level agreements with local authorities during the transition, so that is the position on staffing currently.  A number of staff in the Department work on the capital programme area and there are opportunities for a number of secondments to Irish Water at present.</p><p>  The overall situation in terms of operating costs will depend very much on the economic regulator for Irish Water and this is an area of active engagement.  We know the level of non-domestic charge on the system, but it will be the job of the regulator to find a balance between the appropriate level of capital investment, the types of operational efficiency that can be secured and the level of charge appropriate to maintain the operation.</p></speech>

I have a couple of final questions that will take approximately five minutes to deal with.  It was announced over a year and a half ago that NAMA had offered 2,000 units for social housing and that these would be available very shortly.  It was anticipated they would come on line quickly.  How did that work out?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-27a.79" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Geraldine Tallon" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013062700008#G00800"><p>It worked out quite well.  There is a close working relationship between the Department, the housing agency and NAMA with regard to opportunities for the acquisition of social housing units, subject to the capital being available.  The backstop is always the question of the amount of money we have for these programmes.  At this point, NAMA has identified 3,900 housing units.  Approximately 980 of those have been deemed unsuitable by local authorities, generally because they are in areas where local authorities do not have an identified need.  Approximately 650 of the 3,900 units have been withdrawn by their owners for a variety of reasons.  Some 2,300 units are in the system for examination and for approximately 680 of these local authority demand has been confirmed.  At the end of 2012, just over 200 of those houses had been provided to the local government system.  A number of them were purchased by local authorities and a number went to approved housing bodies.</p><p>  The areas in which houses are available for social use vary.  They are available in areas such as Dublin, Cork, Galway, Drogheda and Mullingar.  They are distributed around the country.</p></speech>

When we discussed this issue the last time Ms Tallon was here we were given a much more concrete indication that 2,000 units would be made available shortly through leasing and so on, and we were given to understand that process was being managed and was under way.</p></speech>

However, these are complex transactions.  In some cases, such as apartment buildings, they involve insolvent management companies, receiverships or issues with regard to the completion of housing and planning compliance.  In the area of due diligence, there has been significant activity.</p><p>  Earlier this year, NAMA set up a special purpose vehicle to try to get around the complexity associated with dealing with receivers, management companies and different property interests so that the Department and housing agencies could engage with that single purpose vehicle.</p></speech>

There was a common perception that property transferred to NAMA but in fact it was loans that transferred to NAMA with associated property.  In the initial phase we had to work through the labyrinth that was described in terms of NAMA dealing with us and then in turn having to deal with the developers where they were still in control of their properties or, in some cases, receivers.  That gave rise to a delay in terms of the level of ambition for this project.  The thinking behind setting up the special purpose vehicle, SPV, was to short-circuit that by actually transferring property, so the SPV becomes the owner of the property and that in turn makes it easier for local authorities, the non-profit sector or the approved housing bodies to lease properties-----</p></speech>

It has only been in operation for a number of months and more will transfer into it.  There are issues around the properties transferring in.  In many instances properties are not complete, they require finishing works and NAMA is undertaking those works and is bearing the cost associated with it.  That is a further factor in terms of the throughput of units, so to speak.</p></speech>

At least there is some kind of dividend to the State if we were leasing a property from an entity owned by the State.</p><p>  Having regard to the announcements that were made a number of years ago, the realisation in that respect to date has been very slow.  I appreciate that there are legal difficulties and so on but if there is a better way of using public moneys by putting a property into NAMA, which is not the nicest thing to have to do either but at least that would be better than paying a private landlord for leasing it, we should do that as much as we can and we should have the impetus and energy to do that.</p><p>  I have a brief question on an issue the Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned in his opening remarks related to one of his recommendations regarding the plastic bag levy.  It is very unusual for the Department not to agree with one of the Comptroller and Auditor General's recommendations.  It seems his recommendation was straightforward and sensible, namely, that Ms Tallon's Department should collate and analyse the results of inspections of the plastic bag levy to assess the adequacy of the inspection regime and overall level of compliance.  Ms Tallon has not agreed and said that the litter statistics are enough to go by.  This is set out on page 364 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  Why has Ms Tallon not agreed with that recommendation which seems to be an easy, simple and straightforward one?</p></speech>

If non-compliance is found by a local authority, we would like to say it is for the local authority to follow that up.  Ultimately, the revenue accruing from the plastic bag levy is used to the benefit of local authorities and the EPA.  We have issued guidance to local authorities on their enforcement role in relation to the plastic bag levy.  While we might have reacted a bit sharply to the Comptroller and Auditor General initially, we have at the same time issued guidance to local authorities to get on with the job.  As a general principle, on the question of the extent to which the Department waves a stick over local government, the tendency in a local government reform context is for us to say that we put appropriate systems of oversight in place through local government audit or through the planned new oversight and audit commission but the expectation should be-----</p></speech>

He is commenting on a report the Environmental Protection Agency gave him which indicated that there was a considerable decline in the number of inspections by local authorities.  It makes sense to have a national picture of that in order that agencies, other than the local authorities and for purposes other than only inspection, could use that information and compare local authorities to establish those are doing the job best, have peer review and so on.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's recommendation is simple and straightforward and, not to be picky, Ms Tallon's response to it was, "Not agreed."  The Department does not agree with it and it will not do it.  This is the committee that deals with the Comptroller and Auditors General's reports and recommendations.  Ms Tallon still has not given me an answer as to why she will not do what has been recommended.</p></speech>

I have also said that we are looking doubly at oversight and supervision arrangements for local government in the context of local government reform.  We can look at this in that context as well.  We have, as the Deputy will know, a series of service indicators in relation to performance in local government and they will be reviewed in the context of the oversight and audit commission's operation.  I take the criticism that the Deputy is making and acknowledge that the comment we gave back to the Comptroller and Auditor General might have been a little short-sighted but we will be looking very actively at the relationship we have with local government in the context of the approach to local government reform.</p></speech>

I will start by asking Ms Tallon about rates, specifically rates arrears and rates that have been written off.  The most up-to-date figures I have seen have been for 2006 to 2010 in response to D&aacute;il questions I asked about the amounts that have been written off and the amounts in arrears in local authorities around the country.  Figures suggest that it is more than &euro;300 million in both categories.  Between 2006 and 2010 the figures suggest that &euro;311 million has been written off and the amount owed to date seems to be more than &euro;300 million.  Having regard to the different local authorities, town councils, county councils and city councils, there seems to be some disparity with regard to who is writing off these amounts.  In the case of some county councils the figures suggest that no amounts have been written off and the same appears to be the case for town councils.  In the case of some other local authorities massive amounts of money have been written off.   The amount of uncollected rates increased fivefold, for example, in Wicklow County Council in the space of two years, with the amount increasing from &euro;824,000 to &euro;4.1 million.</p></speech>

The position with regard to rates collection has deteriorated a little bit in recent years and that is, perhaps, understandable in the economic climate that we face.  We monitor the rate collection level.  We monitor the level of rates on an annual basis.  We monitor the range of sources of income into each local authority because we provide a general purpose grant to bridge the gap for local authorities and ensure they are all able to provide an equivalent level of service.  We have figures that show us the rates income, the income from goods and services and the income from all local sources, grants, subsidies, etc., and we use them in looking at the general purpose grant allocation from the local government fund to ensure financial viability.</p></speech>

Effectively, Ms Tallon is saying that less money is coming in.  The Department is monitoring the amount of money that local authorities have to actually operate and provide services.  That pool of money is deteriorating as the years go on and the figures prove that.  Therefore, what are the guidelines with regard to writing off these arrears?</p></speech>

Ninety percent of rates were collected in 2008, 85% in 2009, 81% in 2010 and 78% in 2011.  That shows a trend in terms of collectibility.  There is considerable variation from authority to authority in terms of rates collection.  The top performer in 2011 was Offaly, which collected 92% of its rates, while at the other end of the spectrum Donegal collected 57%.</p></speech>

I am going to question whether that actually happens.  I will get to the nub of where I am going with this.  The Valuation Office, as Ms Tallon is aware, is engaged in a revaluation process.  In the case of Waterford City and county it is undertaking a comprehensive revaluation of businesses and their commercial rates levels as we speak.  Certificates are being issued.  In many cases, retailers in particular have received certificates that would suggest they will be asked to pay 200% or 300% more than at present.  The average increase for retailers is 50% to 100%.  What has happened is that the rates base has shrunk in the past five, six or seven years and less money is being taken in by the local authorities.  The figures prove this.  It is arbitrary and it is a patchwork around the country.  They is no consistency whatsoever.  The Valuation Office is engaged in a revaluation.  As it said to a collective group of businessmen in my home town of Dungarvan last week, when asked why the rates were being increased on their backs, the answer was "You are the ones who are left."  Effectively, they are the people who cut their cloth, were efficient and let people go, yet the reward was a doubling and tripling of their rates in many cases.  Even though the Valuation Office has a statutorily independent role, which is underpinned by legislation, there is a very close relationship with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The officials in local authorities levy and collect the rates in towns and counties throughout the country.  What is happening is that the rates base is shrinking, a revaluation process is being undertaken and the ultimate result is that the problem will be exacerbated, resulting in a further shrinking of the rates base in the country.  It is self-defeating.  We are looking at a diminishing return as the years go on.  I wonder whether the senior officials in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government understand this, because people on the ground and in local government understand it painfully well and are very concerned.  They have very strong opinions, particularly about the communications and the relationship between local authority officials and the Valuation Office and how the Valuation Office goes about its business.</p><p>  Does the Department share those concerns with regard to what is happening with commercial rates? Businesses now face the prospect of paying, in the case of retailers, 50% or 100% more in a business environment that probably has never been this bad since the foundation of the State.  The profile of these people is that many have massive levels of personal debt and the footfall is not there.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government must have an opinion on what is happening on the ground with regard to this cohort of people who actually fund local authorities around the country.</p></speech>

I will answer him at a broad level and I will answer him at a more specific level if he just gives me a little bit of time in that regard.  We would be extremely conscious that this is a time of very fundamental change as far as local government is concerned and a lot of that change is impacting on the finance departments of local authorities.  We have a very active programme of local government reform.  We have a very active programme in relation to Irish Water, and I have already mentioned the amount of work being done to extract assets and liabilities and the cost base for Irish Water.  We have a very active programme of shared services development in the local government sector that is requiring very significant work by finance departments to extract costs for payroll, costs for HR, costs for all sorts of back-office functions, costs for functions that could be delivered regionally, etc.  There is the added complexity in Waterford of work related to the merger between Waterford city and Waterford county.  There is a variety of layers of process of significant change involved in the local government system.</p><p>  We have been very conscious, and Ministers have been extremely conscious, of the pressures on business locally in the current economic climate and that has been part of the driver for efficiency gains and cost retrenchments within the local government sector.  We are now in a situation where, under the efficiency programme we have had for a number of years, &euro;830 million in verified savings have been identified in the local government system and that, obviously, has a bearing on the overall cost base and the level of pressure being placed externally on sectors.  Some 9,000 staff have gone out of the local government system to help create that cost reduction.  Rate levels have been contained.  ARV increases have been contained and generally reduced over the past number of years and the strong advice and emphasis from the Department and from the Minister has been, "No rate increases in the system", in recent years.</p><p>  Against that quite complex background, you have this independent exercise being undertaken by the Valuation Office, which does not come into my bailiwick and over which I have no particular control one way or the other, and there may be a discussion that needs to be had with the Valuation Office in terms of the approach there.</p></speech>

Her Department is engaging in a process in the case of amalgamations or abolition of town councils.  In my home town, they have an ARV level which might be lower than the county level.  That ARV level will be, to use the Department's word, "harmonised".  Effectively, there is a risk that ARV level will be increased.  Therefore, the rates within Dungarvan Town Council will be increased as a result.  On top of that, revaluation will add a massive increase to businesses in that particular town council area.  I understand that the Valuation Office is statutorily independent but Ms Tallon is absolutely absorbed in and critical to this process because her Department is engaged in administering part of one of those increases.  There is a serious systemic problem in government here when a Department is so wrapped up in the administration of an increase that it states to the businesses that are affected by the second increases that it is really nothing to do with the Department.  I have gone through this with the different Departments.  I have gone through this with the Departments - Public Expenditure and Reform, Finances, and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation - and no one is taking any leadership on this issue.  Everyone is saying, "It is nothing to do with me".</p><p>  In my opinion, it has everything to do with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and it cannot continue to say that because officials in local government levy and collect the rates that the Valuation Offices applies.  Those officials are the ones who deal with the individual businesses.  They must deal with the hassle that goes with collecting a rate that might have doubled or tripled, and there is a personal issue associated with that.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is critical and integral to this entire system and it cannot say that it has really nothing to do with it.</p></speech>

I simply said the Valuation Office does not come under my Department and, therefore, I do not control and I cannot in a formal sense account for what the Valuation Office does, but in no sense did I say that my Department does not have an interest or does not have a concern.  We have a big interest and a big concern in this area because, as Deputy Deasy stated, not merely in terms of the situation that Waterford county and city finds itself in a local government reform context, but right across the country in terms of the future approach to municipal districts in place of town councils, the rate base and the rating position in rating towns and in counties has to be merged, and there is a complex job of work-----</p></speech>

The Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 was introduced in the Seanad last year.  That Bill completely changes the system of assessment in this country when it comes to commercial rates on properties.  It moves to a system of self-assessment.  Can Ms Tallon tell me what input her Department had in that piece of legislation?  If Mr. Lavery wants to answer that question, he can.</p></speech>

I am sure the Department of Finance has an interest as well.  A number of Departments would have been involved and engaged.</p><p>  Deputy Deasy will be aware, though, that our Minister would have dealt with this issue on a number of occasions because questions have been raised right around the country in terms of the implications for rate payers of local government reform and we have said this is a complex area of work where there will be adjustment over a period.  There is a balance to be struck in maintaining the necessary revenue base of local government.  As I have explained, in maintaining the necessary revenue base of local government, local government has done enormous amounts to try to shrink its costs, and has done that with considerable success.  We have to try to maintain the revenue base without creating excessive pressure for rate payers.  There is a balance to be struck as far as those are concerned.</p></speech>

My understanding of the revaluation exercise is that it is intended to redistribute the rates burden equitably across the rate-paying sectors, that it is not intended to - and does not - increase the total rates payable in the year following valuation.  South Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire have had the revaluation exercise implemented.  Once the notifications go out, there is an opportunity for rate payers to make representations.</p></speech>

The Valuation Office comes in frequently.  The figures are documented.  The theme so far this morning has been communication or lack of it, on the property tax and household charge, as Deputy Nolan said.  There is no communication happening between Departments, particularly on legislation that affects businesses and local authorities around the country.  There was no significant engagement on the drafting of that legislation and the effect it would have on businesses throughout the country and, by extension, the local authorities which collect it.  We have a serious problem.  There is a gulf between different Departments on this issue.</p><p>  Ms Tallon mentioned maintaining the rate base.  The rate base is being eroded.  The ones left are being asked to pay more.  It is unsustainable.  They fund local government and are being asked for more every year.  The business environment is getting worse and everybody is saying that is just the way it is, it nothing to do with them, it must continue.  The Valuation Office is an independent agency and says it is not its responsibility.  I am not singling out the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government on this issue but it is an integral part of government when it comes to this very basic, fundamental matter of administration and the taxpayers who fund the Government.  There is a massive disconnect in Government between Departments as it relates to people who fund the Government.  This is very fundamental and basic.</p><p>  We need to examine the legislation that will be enacted next year to see if it melds with the realities of the economies that exist out there.  Everyone needs to take a good look at this because the more I ask the more I am convinced the Government has forgotten about the realities when it comes to rates and the ability to pay.  There is no linkage between levying people increasing rates and their ability to pay.  That is a fundamental flaw in our taxation system.  We will see our rate base eroded continually.  I have asked the Comptroller and Auditor General to examine these issues, particularly the administration when this Bill is enacted and how we will deal with a case where different counties have different methods of assessment.  I have also asked the Valuation Office to come before the committee to explain the different processes involved.</p><p>  Having spoken to many people in local government, they are not happy.  They think the disconnect between their office and the Valuation Office is unhealthy for Government generally, not just the people in question.  They think the Valuation Office lacks the requisite local knowledge and there is a problem in our system.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has a massive role in this because the officials under the umbrella of the Department think completely differently in some cases from the senior officials in the Department.  They are the ones who have to deal with these businesses.  I am very concerned about this and hopefully the Comptroller and Auditor General will be able to examine it in the coming weeks.</p><p>  I have a question for Mr. Lavery on the household charge exemptions in unfinished estates.

It did not have the level of accuracy one would seek if one was basing it around the collection of the charge.  By contrast, a more recent survey is being used as the basis for local property tax.  With foresight, in this case, of the potential use of it - it will be used for other purposes as well - the level of precision that was brought to bear in that instance was of a different order because it was for a different purpose.</p></speech>

Such things will happen and that is fair enough.  The Department can acknowledge that but when it was pointed out that estates were left off that list, the Department did not step in and say, "Fair enough".  The Department allowed it to go to the Ombudsman.  It is almost as if the Department has been forced to act on this by the Ombudsman and the litany of complaints.  Two or three weeks from now we will have another statutory instrument to clear this up.  We need to act a bit quicker when we acknowledge - as we are doing - that this is a new landscape regarding putting this together.  The list was incomplete, the complaints came in, they were verified, the Department acknowledged this, but it did nothing.  We have had to go to the Ombudsman and we are almost forced into dealing with it.  Sometimes a quick decision in the Department to deal with matters might be better.</p></speech>

I start with a relatively minor issue about which there were media reports last week.  I would like to clear it up.  It is about the cost to local authorities of the new reform measures.  The witnesses will probably have seen in last weekend's Sunday newspapers reports that some local authorities are splurging on the purchase of new furniture, including chairs at prices akin to the price of thrones, to accommodate new councillors.  While we will have fewer councillors overall on foot of the review, which I welcome, some local authorities will see an increase in their numbers.  Has funding been provided by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to accommodate extra public representatives and does the Department join me in urging local authorities to act responsibly in undertaking expenditure in this regard given that one of the purposes of local government reform is to reduce costs as well as to improve the system?</p></speech>

The programme is intended to assist in increasing the efficiency and savings achievable in local government.  There was recent publicity arising from the report of the Local Electoral Area Boundary Committee which has distributed 949 local councillor positions.  A number of authorities feel they have an unexpected increase in the number of councillors and there has been discussion around whether or not council chambers are adequate to accommodate the increased numbers.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has been a case in point.  There is a significant increase in the number of elected members in that authority and we understand that the existing chamber is not adequate to accommodate them.  There is restricted access while D&uacute;n Laoghaire Town Hall is a protected structure.  There has been debate in the local authority around finding a solution and the cost of any solution.  There are a number of local authorities in the greater Dublin area where the increase in the number of elected members is significant relative to the size of the council chamber.  That has given rise to discussion.</p><p>  The Department is not paying additional costs of any kind.  That is entirely a matter for local authorities to deal with.  We would expect and hope they would deal with expenditure as cost effectively as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-27a.144" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1106" speakername="Simon Harris" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013062700013#M00300"><p>I just wanted to clear that up.  I want to examine development levies, illegal dumping and the issuing of a waste permit which was subsequently shredded in Wicklow County Council before having to be reissued.  I will explain the last matter in a moment.</p><p>  I begin with the issue of development levies.  I asked a series of parliamentary questions of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government in March 2013.  I was given figures on the outstanding amount of development levies for each local authority categorised under two headings, "current development levy debtors" and "long-term development levy debtors", respectively.  When one adds up the current and long-term debtors, local authorities are owed or expect to be owed a total of &euro;750 million.  The economic collapse has not passed anyone's notice.  I understand that some of the current levies may never have fallen due in circumstances where construction may not have commenced.  However, I was concerned to see that &euro;300 million of the outstanding levies are classified by local authorities as long-term debt.</p><p>  When I published the figures on 15 March 2013, I was surprised and taken aback by the very defensive approach of the Department in responding to media requests.  It seemed to try to rubbish or dispute the figures which it had itself put in the public domain in reply to parliamentary questions.  There was a series of statements from the Department on 15 March 2013 clarifying, reclarifying and explaining the figures.  When I look at the figures, I see that &euro;300 million is owed to local authorities in outstanding levies which have been classified as long-term debt.  How many years must elapse before a levy is classified as a long-term debt?  Surely, &euro;300 million is a cause of significant concern.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-27a.145" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Geraldine Tallon" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013062700013#M00400"><p>Development levies are levied in the context of a planning application.  A figure may be identified as a condition of planning approval.  A planning consent with a condition attached identifying the development levy contribution per house, number of houses or per square metre - whatever the case may be - may never be taken advantage of.  Long-term debt represents a tot by a local authority related to planning consent conditions.  We would not necessarily know whether or not the development has ever happened.  One would expect in a local authority context that once a commencement notice for development is provided, the clock begins to roll in respect of the associated conditions.  Development contributions associated with a development's commencement notice become a current development contribution debtor as, by definition, that development will be built.  Permissions in respect of which no planning commencement notice has been lodged and in respect of which there is no prospect in the current climate of the development going ahead, are classified as long-term development contribution debt.  It may never be realisable as the development associated with the permission may never happen.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that not all of the &euro;750 million that is owed or meant to be owed to local authorities by developers or people going about development will have materialised.  What I have not been able to establish since March is whether we have an idea of how much of it did materialise?  In other words, if I go to build a conservatory today and issue a commencement notice, I am expected to pay my development levy up front.  I understand that in the context of encouraging businesses and development, local authorities arranged for phased payments of development levies with developers.  It is important to establish how much is officially due where development took place but the levies have not been paid.</p></speech>

These indicate that current development levy debt amounts to &euro;425.24 million.  That is the real figure in terms of development levy debt.</p></speech>

What are the guidelines in place according to which a local authority decides whether an outstanding levy represents a bad debt?  If the true figure of outstanding development levies nationally for 2010 was &euro;214 million and it is &euro;425 million for 2011, does that not represent a very significant increase?  That does not tally.</p></speech>

This appeared on the RTE news website on Friday, 15 March.<blockquote><br />The Department of the Environment has said this evening that figures on the level of unpaid development levies that it issued to Fine Gael TD Simon Harris earlier this week do not take account of levies that local authorities have written off as bad debts.<br /><br />  It said when bad debts are take account of the true level of outstanding development levies nationally for 2010 was &euro;214m.<br /><br />  The same figure for the unaudited 2011 accounts is &euro;178m.</blockquote>Our exchange this morning helps to highlight my confusion.  I asked a parliamentary question and I was given the figure of &euro;750 million.  Within the reply to that parliamentary question, there is a figure of &euro;350 million for long-term debt.  The Department issued a clarification to RTE saying that the figures provided to me did not paint the full picture and that, when one looked at the accurate picture, it amounted to &euro;214 million.  This morning, I am told that in the view of the Department the real figure is &euro;425 million for 2011.  This country does not know how much money it is owed by developers.  I am passionate about this because I can give examples in my county, where I served on the county council, of developers going ahead with their developments.  They may now have been declared bankrupt but ten or 12 years elapsed while they were not bust and development levies were not secured in that time for development that had taken place and for houses that had been sold.  From experience I know that councils did not take such a lax approach to individuals trying to build a two-storey extension.  It gives an insight into the cosy relationship that existed at local authority level between developers and local authority officials in some instances.  We must establish how much is owed.  We must acknowledge that the economy has changed and some of the levies will not be recoverable, but we must get to the true picture.  Does Ms Tallon have any insights she can give me on that or information she can provide to me?</p></speech>

Some of the time we are talking about figures compiled in our planning section.  Ultimately, we want to rely on the figures as audited by the local government auditors in the context of the annual financial statements.  I have provided a figure for 2011 that is not absolutely complete because a couple of annual financial statements for 2011 are still to be finalised in the local government audit system.  I want to give a position that is accurate.  There is some commentary in the activity report at county council level, which the local government audit system has already issued.  I will come back to the Chairman with a note of clarification.</p></speech>

It would be a useful exercise.</p><p>  With regard to illegal dumping, an example from County Wicklow may be applied to a broader national discussion.  Ms Tallon is well aware of the situation in Whitestown, Baltinglass.  In Whitestown, there was illegal dumping at a sand and gravel pit.  In 2001, it was estimated that 300 lorry loads of material were illegally dumped.  The lorry loads consisted of domestic waste, commercial waste, construction waste, demolition waste and hospital waste.  A landmark judgment was made against this country by the European Court of Justice as a result of action taken by the European Commission.  It found that Ireland had quite seriously infringed the waste framework directive.  On 20 April 2005, the Department issued its response to the judgment and the actions it proposed to take.  On page 32 of the document, the Department refers to the Whitestown situation.  What is the situation with regard to the remediation of the Whitestown site to comply with the European Court of Justice judgment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-27a.159" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Geraldine Tallon" time="11:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013062700014#N00900"><p>This has been a long drawn out situation, as the Deputy knows.  The Whitestown illegal dump was discovered in November 2001 and there appeared to have been systematic and large-scale dumping at Whitestown quarry from 1996 to 2001.  A High Court action was initiated in 2005 but it came to a substantive hearing only in 2009.  A whole variety of issues concerned discovery in the case so the court finally ruled on proceeding in December 2010.  There was a mediation process in 2011, ultimately without any settlement.  We have serious legal action from the European Commission in the waste area and we were conscious of the concern of the European Commission that illegal waste remained on site in Whitestown in 2011.</p><p>  The Department, because of the EU compliance aspect, felt it had no option but to ask Wicklow County Council to consider remediation of the site.  I understand work is ongoing.  The cost is estimated at &euro;6 million to &euro;7 million.  Waste has been removed from one area and other areas are being capped.  The programme of works being undertaken is to be completed in 2014.  As of now, we have provided &euro;740,000 to Wicklow County Council to support the cost of the work it is undertaking.</p></speech>

The legal action is one of the longest-running High Court cases in history of the State, which is frustrating for everyone involved.  There seem to be significantly different figures emerging.  The figure of &euro;50 million was provided by the county manager to councillors at a county council meeting.  Ms Tallon is saying she expects that figure to be much lower.</p></speech>

Whitestown was not unique and unfortunately there is also the case of Stephenstown and illegal dumping on the Wicklow-Carlow border.  My colleague Mr. Ronan Mulhall may have broader figures and the EPA may have a comment on illegal waste dumping, because it is a serious and costly issue for the State.</p></speech>

It is also subject to tendering so it is not a question of saying it will cost X and tendering for that amount.</p></speech>

An understandable letter of comfort has been written to Wicklow County Council and, one can only presume, other county councils.  To be clear, I am very supportive of the proactive approach the Department is taking to rectify the illegal dumping situation and to respond to the European Court judgment.  However, on 24 June 2011 Wicklow County Council would have received a letter signed by the assistant principal officer of the waste policy section, effectively stating that the Department was going to pick up the tab for these remediation costs.  How much has the Department estimated it is going to have to spend on picking up the tab for illegal dumping in various counties?  Where is that in the budget?</p></speech>

We have significant costs for remediation of closed landfills and significant costs associated with dumping, particularly in the Wicklow-Carlow area.  In particular, we have significant costs associated with a difficult site such as Kerdiffstown in Kildare, where the EPA is dealing with landfill legacy problems of a very serious nature.  We also have difficulties associated with cross-Border movement of waste and illegal dumping of waste in Northern Ireland, for which we are now responsible.  This issue of mending our hand in regard to our landfill legacy is an increasing burden on the decreasing resources of the environment fund.  With regard to our costs, in 2013 we have &euro;12 million in our Vote for landfill remediation.  Mr. Mulhall may be able to give a broader figure on the costs associated with the various elements of the legacy.</p></speech>

As the Deputy will have seen, the projected expenditure into the future to deal with the final issues associated with that was &euro;105.6 million.  This includes not just remediation of sites but also some key pieces that had to be put in place to deal with our structures and how we respond to enforcement of the legislation, including enforcement grants for the support of local authority enforcement officers.  That is another piece within this, and it also includes addressing some very significant sites, such as the former Irish Steel plant at Irish Ispat, Haulbowline.  These add considerably to the overall total.</p></speech>

Again, I want to acknowledge and put on the record of this committee the good work I believe the Department is doing in dealing with these serious issues at a European level.  I will now move to an area in which I do not feel it is doing as good a job, which is, again, an issue I was directly involved with during my time on Wicklow County Council and which I have continued to pursue during my time in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, with no satisfaction whatsoever in regard to the response I have received from the Department.  This is the issue of Ballybeg, which long predates my involvement in public life.  To remind the witnesses of some of the details, in 2003 a waste permit was granted for lands at Ballybeg in Rathnew.  This permit was subsequently shredded, and I believe the EPA will be aware of this because it was directly referenced in the comments after the permit was shredded, which were to the effect that whoever shredded the permit, for whatever reason, realised they had better re-issue it because the original copy had been lodged with the EPA.  Since then, this has been an issue of significant concern for all public representatives in County Wicklow.  It gives me a worrying insight into how the Department has not picked up on concerns when they are fed up the food chain, if one likes, and passed on from local authority level to the Department.</p><p>  In January 2010, which is seven years after this waste permit was granted, shredded and re-issued, I attended a special meeting of Wicklow County Council where I and my colleagues on a cross-party basis voted to ask the then Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, under the Local Government Act, to conduct a local inquiry, which is a pretty speedy and cost-efficient way of establishing what happened.  There was widespread support for this.  My predecessor in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, Deputy Liz McManus, raised the matter in the D&aacute;il on 1 February 2010.  She was told on the record of the D&aacute;il by a Minister of State that the issue would be examined carefully.  Time moved on and nothing happened other than that the council received an acknowledgment from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government stating it was looking into the matter.  When I was elected to the D&aacute;il, I tabled parliamentary questions on the issue on a number of occasions, and I most recently tabled a question in June 2012, when I was told the Department had not made up its mind and would consider it in due course.</p><p>  My question is not even about Ballybeg, although I am pretty disgusted at the way these issues, having been passed up the line by local representatives, have been sat on, in my view, by the Department.  My question is about a broader issue.  We were meant to have local government structures.  We have a Local Government Act, we have a Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government that obviously interacts with local government and we have very official ways in which that interaction should take place.  We are all about reform at the moment and are talking a lot about local government reform.  Yet here is a situation in which a local authority passes a democratic motion under the Local Government Act to ask the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to consider setting up an inquiry, and that takes place in 2010, seven years after this issue was first highlighted - the EPA will be aware of the issue also, so I may ask Ms Burke for a comment shortly.  A special request was put in, but nothing happened.  Next, a Deputy raised it in the D&aacute;il on 1 February 2010 and it was said the matter would be looked at, but nothing happened.  Then we had a general election and new Deputies were elected, and I asked the question and got fed up asking the question because I knew the answer.</p><p>  I am not sure the Department is ever going to arrive at a conclusion.  First, in regard to this issue, my view is now as it was then, namely, that something seriously questionable happened in Wicklow and needs to be looked into.  However, the broader point is that even if the Department vehemently disagrees with me and the local representatives who passed that motion, does Ms Tallon not find it utterly unacceptable that, ten years after the alleged incident happened and more than three years after the council sent correspondence to the Department, the Department has still failed to respond on the matter?</p></speech>

I am not entirely clear on what the issue actually is and I will have to look into it on the Deputy's behalf.  I would say generally that if this is an issue of environmental enforcement, we would expect the Office of Environmental Enforcement in the EPA to be aware of it because that is where the oversight of enforcement of environmental legislation happens.  My understanding is that the Office of Environmental Enforcement is open to looking into issues on behalf of anyone who has a complaint in regard to the implementation of environmental legislation.</p></speech>

There is something in my head and I am unsure whether it is the same issue, but it is a detail I have not covered in preparing for today.  Did Deputy Simon Harris refer to the local government audit?  There was an issue in County Wicklow where we asked the local government auditor to investigate whether there was a problem from his point of view in its handling by Wicklow County Council.  I cannot remember whether this is specifically the issue.  Because I have not covered the specifics of this local issue in preparing for today I cannot usefully add much.</p></speech>

Under section 19 of the waste facility permits regulations, the EPA is responsible for holding a register of all permits; therefore, we would have a record of that permit.  Regarding any other issue relating to Ballybeg, I would have to look into it and come back to the Deputy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-27a.177" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1106" speakername="Simon Harris" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013062700016#P00600"><p>That is perfect.  My understanding of the EPA's involvement or knowledge is exactly as Ms Burke said, that it hold a registers that indicates that this permit has been issued.  Therefore, if it was destroyed, removed or disappeared, it would still be lodged in her offices.  The Ballybeg issue concerns me, but the broader point is that these are serious issues and allegations and everybody involved deserves clarity.  At the level of a county council passing a motion, if somebody suggests something untoward happened or something deserves consideration about issues on which the country is paying a heavy price as a result of a failure to address them properly in the past - dumping, waste permits, etc - that there could be such a time lag is of concern.  I am interested in knowing whether structures are in place or could be put in place in the Department in order that if it receives a request under the Local Government Act asking it to initiate a public inquiry, it would respond, positively or negatively, within a set period.  If the response is no, it is up to people to consider how to proceed after that.</p></speech>

There is something in my head and I am not sure if it is precisely the same matter we are discussing.  There was an instance in County Wicklow in respect of which we asked our local government audit service to establish all of the steps and facts associated with it.  To the best of my recollection in former Minister Dick Roche's time we released all of the papers we had on the issue.  I cannot remember whether it was on the Ballybeg or another issue.</p></speech>

To draw this matter to a conclusion, when former Deputy Liz McManus raised it in the House, the Minister of State of the day said the Department had arranged for all departmental records recently released under the Freedom of Information Acts to be furnished to the then cathaoirleach of Wicklow County Council with the strong recommendation that they be circulated to all members of the council without delay.  I presume that happened.  The then Minister of State also said the public inquiry requested would be considered.  A specific provision in the Local Government Act empowers local authorities to make this request of the Department.  From my parliamentary questions, then Deputy Liz McManus's raising of the issue and the correspondence Wicklow County Council sent to the Department, unless things changed and nobody told us, that issue has never been adjudicated on.  When I have asked the question on a persistent basis I have been told the Department has not made up its mind.  It would be great if it could make up its mind.</p></speech>

Already in place under the legislation on local authority loans and the mortgage resolution process that has been rolled out is considerable flexibility for local authorities to deal sensitively with individual households in difficulty.  Our information is that they do.  That, in part, is reflected by a very low level of repossession in respect of local authority mortgages in distress.  This further iteration will ensure there is parity of treatment, regardless of whether one is a commercial mortgage holder or a local authority mortgage holder.  We will be rolling out that but then it becomes a matter of the lender dealing with the customer in each case.  There are a number of options.  This involves agreeing with the customer, if possible, a solution that works for the household in question.  Elements of the solution can include for example, warehousing a portion of the loan on a spectrum to mortgage to rent, which is the circumstance where somebody ceases to have ownership of the property but can continue to remain in it.  There is a range of solutions, depending on the individual circumstances.</p></speech>

We have been doing what I describe in Westmeath and Dublin successfully and, in the coming months, it will apply right across the system.</p></speech>

There are varying stages of stress in the system in terms of debt on the revenue account, and we are monitoring that very closely.  We are in contact with local authorities on a quarterly basis in terms of their financial indicators for the purpose of EU-IMF monitoring.</p></speech>

There are a number of areas where there is accumulated debt but one can see on an annual basis that it is being eaten into because there have been very active debt-management and cost-reduction strategies put in place.  As I identified earlier, there was &euro;830 million in savings in the local government system over the past couple of years and a very dramatic reduction in the staffing number.  That is helping to contain costs.  The local government reform programme will have further cost containment associated with it.  The shared services programme that we are engaged with is designed to increase efficiency and contain costs.  Therefore, there are a number of different strands to what we are doing that will change the financial situation from authorities' points of view.  However, in a couple of cases, there is accumulated debt that we need to be conscious of.</p></speech>

With regard to the kinds of figures we have already identified here, including those pertaining to rates collection, housing loans and commercial water charges, the local government auditor identified the trend in collection is an issue.</p><p>  On the question of debit balances on capital projects, historically in the Department it has sometimes taken quite a long time to settle final accounts and have final account data in the Department in terms of capital projects.  The auditor looks at the capital account at local authority level.  There are some very large projects in the local government system, for example, Ballymun and Limerick regeneration projects.  The auditor looks at the quality of performance in large capital areas.</p><p>  The auditor has also commented on the number of companies established by local authorities for specific purposes, including limited companies controlled by local authorities.  He has raised a question for local authorities to consider in respect of the proliferation of companies, the governance of companies and the need for companies for specific purposes.</p></speech>

A considerable number of houses are currently boarded up and not allocated.  Therefore, there is a loss of rent and potential accommodation for the thousands of people on the housing list.  How does the Department monitor that in each local authority and ensure there is a turnover in the housing stock, so when houses are vacant they are allocated quickly?  Is there a trend whereby local authorities are finding it difficult to provide the funding to refurbish these vacant houses as they become vacant and therefore cannot let them within a reasonable length of time?  Is that an issue?</p></speech>

We monitor vacancies on an annual basis through the service indicators report, so we have figures year on year for the vacancy rate in the local government system.  In the last service indicators for 2011 the rate for vacant housing was 3.15% or approximately 4,000 houses in the system.  In 2012, we spent a significant amount of money under our energy efficiency and remedial works programme targeting vacant dwellings to try to bring them back into service.  We allowed a grant of up to &euro;18,000 per house or 90% of the cost.  Under that scheme over 2,500 houses were improved to be brought back into effective use.  We are now investing in insulation and draught proofing.</p><p>  However, it is a reality that there is that level of 3% to 4% vacancy in any year, according to our service indicators.  There are a variety of reasons for that and they are not always related exclusively to inefficiency on the part of the local authority.  It can be the case that housing estates become unpopular.  There has been some media coverage in recent times of the extent to which prospective tenants refuse offers of accommodation or can have unrealistic expectations in terms of the choice of accommodation.  It is a live issue in the local government system as to how many offers of accommodation one can have without suffering a penalty in terms of one's position on the list.</p></speech>

For example, significant investment is needed for urban wastewater treatment plants.  In the context of Irish Water up to &euro;600 million a year is very welcome because there is an infrastructure deficit.  An element of capital investment is needed but significant operational improvements are also needed.  Last year of the incidents reported from urban wastewater treatment facilities to the EPA, approximately 40% were due to the management of the facilities.  Local authorities under those licensing regimes are required to improve the management of facilities and I believe they are doing so.</p></speech>

Under our water services investment programme our priorities relate to environmental compliance and economic development.  To comply with the EU action we had over a number of years in regard to water quality we have invested in a remedial action list.  Identified schemes on the list include water supplies identified by the EPA through its monitoring and oversight.  We target them in investment terms.  That has been a positive development. </p><p>  We would accept that, as I said, investment in water has had to reduce over the past number of years.  A number of plants are operating at full capacity or over capacity.  There is a pollution risk in those circumstances.  We have quite a large number of wastewater facilities which are new and modern, and provided under design, build and operate contracts.  They tend to be well operated.

There are authorities which we would watch very closely in terms of their financial position.  This is not a secret.  Sligo County Council, Limerick County Council, Offaly County Council and Donegal County Council have had problems historically in the debt area.  Meath has had a problem with debt.  A number of authorities have had capacity over recent years.  One can see on an annual basis that they are not continuing to dig a deeper hole.  I put Meath and Donegal in that category.  On an annual basis one can see a small operating surplus, but if one looks at the historical base one will find they still have significant millstones round their necks from accumulated debt over a longer period of time.</p></speech>

We have made very significant progress on this issue.  Referring back to an earlier part of the discussion, that progress is evidenced by the decline in the number of estates eligible for the local property tax waiver compared with the corresponding figure for the household charge.  This is testament to the work that has been done in the meantime.  Our public safety initiative was designed to deal with immediate problems where there was an actual risk to individuals living on these estates.  The emphasis now is on developing site resolution plans and bringing estates to the point where their position can effectively be regularised.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, will be launching a programme of support in this regard in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

The Mahon tribunal has cost the Department &euro;101 million so far, but we estimate the overall cost to be &euro;196 million or thereabouts.  Since the publication of the report of the tribunal, the chairman has been ruling on the eligibility of third-party cost applications for the 2003 to 2008 period.  We understand he has ruled on some two thirds of those applications.  The number of claims the Department has received, at 22, represents approximately 14% of the claims that have thus far been deemed eligible, which, as I said, is some two thirds of the total.  We can expect, therefore, that a significant number of bills are yet to be submitted.  To reiterate, Judge Mahon has, as I understand it, ruled on two thirds of applications, of which less than one fifth have actually been presented to the State at this point.</p></speech>

Ms Tallon has narrowed the terms of reference of my question in a very helpful way.  When we discussed this issue on the previous occasion, the point was made that the State cannot be invoiced for costs which have not yet been ruled upon.  Ms Tallon has indicated that of the two thirds of claims in respect of which rulings have been made, we have been invoiced for less than one fifth of them.

Until a year or so ago, we automatically sent such claims for review by legal cost accountants, because there is a legacy to be dealt with from a number of tribunals.  The Department of the Taoiseach then reviewed the process and it was decided that the legal costs unit of the State Claims Agency would deal with the legal costs arising from all the tribunals.  As such, the standard procedure now is to transfer all claims from the Department to that unit.</p><p>  Of the 22 claims received, seven have been settled.  We are very happy with the service from the State Claims Agency in this regard.  It is working quite quickly on the claims, perhaps at a better pace than we had previously been experiencing.  Moreover, it has achieved a 52% reduction in costs on the claims it has settled.</p></speech>

With regard to whether one can ask for them to be sent in quickly, I understand that once a ruling on eligibility is made, there is a period of six years within which people are entitled to make their claims.  I wondered whether we could impose a time limit, but was told "No" that a period of six years is allowed.  I might be taking a flyer on this, but I would tend to say that the longer people delay sending in bills, the more sceptical the State should be when the bill finally comes.</p></speech>

It is quite conceivable that an invoice exists for work that was done in 2003 and the bill has not come in for that yet.  That is a decade ago.  When that bill comes in-----</p></speech>

The rulings were given for the period 1998 to 2002, but at that stage the tribunal decided to park the remaining costs, from 2003-2008, until the final report was completed.  Therefore, in fairness to people who worked or who feel entitled to claim costs, their eligibility has only been adjudicated on within the past year.</p></speech>

We do not tend to like to feel that things are unquantifiable or cannot be nailed down within a reasonable time horizon.  The State has experience of this kind of legacy from past tribunals, such as the beef tribunal where bills drifted in many years later.  I would like to see an orderly conclusion as far as this is concerned.  Therefore, I would like to put it on record that the longer the delay in submitting bills, the more sceptical the State should be.</p></speech>

Somebody somewhere in the Department must inevitably think the cost could be X and because that could be the cost, that money cannot be spent on something else or used to reduce our deficit.

The Department, in note 6.2 of its appropriation account, has put a figure of &euro;99 million as a contingent liability figure at the end of 2011.  Therefore, work has been done in this regard.  At the prompting of the committee, over the past number of years all Votes have strived to include estimated outstanding liabilities.  However, what is not known is the timeframe over which that contingent liability will be met.</p></speech>

Obviously, it takes the same view as I do on the issue.  My point is that it is better for everybody if we can move from a contingent liability to an actual liability.  Therefore, the Department needs those invoices to come in, now that the ruling has been made that will allow that.</p><p>  On an unrelated matter, I would like to comment on the superb work that is going on currently in regard to dealing with private rental accommodation throughout the country.  I raised the issue previously that the State is making rent supplement payments available to people who need them, but that there are concerns with regard to the quality of accommodation in which some of these people live.  I wish to draw attention to the fact that the environmental department of Dublin City Council is doing great work currently on implementing the new guidelines put in place in this area.  While some of the statistics on this area are disturbing, where in parts of the city up to 80% of rental property does not meet standard regulations, I wish to recognise the fact the work is now being done and being funded by the Department and that progress is being made on understanding the issue.  This is about ensuring we are getting good value for money in the area of rent supplement payments and about ensuring people have access to decent quality accommodation.  I commend that work and urge that it be rolled out across the country.</p></speech>

From our point of view, it is very important work.  We are in a transition period now, moving from rent supplement towards the new framework of the housing assistance payment.  We are also seeing implementation of the housing standards regulations that were made a couple of years ago.  Sub-standard bedsits, in particular, have been an issue in Dublin and other urban areas and it is good to hear that public representatives feel the work is being done in a worthwhile way.</p></speech>

I took it from what he said regarding private companies working at local authority level that the auditor had asked for the local government audit section to look at the situation.

It is wholly appropriate that both institutions are jointly represented as a tangible expression to the committee of our joint efforts at collaboration which we will together outline.  Our presentation is organised in the following manner: policy context for collaboration in teacher education between St. Angela's College and the school of education, University of Ulster; strategic cross-Border relationship between St. Angela&rsquo;s College and the school of education, University of Ulster; memorandum of understanding between the two institutions; and our conclusions.</p><p>  I will, first, address the policy context for collaboration in teacher education between St. Angela's College and the school of education, University of Ulster.  The committee will be fully <i>au fait</i> with the importance of cross-Border co-operation across a range of sectors - economic, trade, tourism, health, employment, regional development and, of course, education.  Education is identified in the Good Friday Agreement as a key area for North-South co-operation.  This is reflected in the North-South Ministerial Council's agreement to progress educational themes, including special educational needs, educational under-achievement and teacher education. We will address the latter theme, in particular.</p><p>  The Minister for Education and Skills, supported by his Department, and the Northern Ireland Minister for Education, John O&rsquo; Dowd, and the Minister for Employment and Learning, Dr. Stephen Farry, and their officials, are positive in their commitment to strengthen and develop cross-Border initiatives in education.  The Minister for Education and Skills in his recent address to the committee, in the context of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s success in the progress in international reading literacy study, PIRLS, indicated that there was a real opportunity for learning and co-operation in the area of literacy.  In his opening address to the recent conference on the professional identity of teacher educators in Dublin Castle the Northern Ireland Minister for Education indicated his commitment to the further development of cross-Border co-operation on educational issues.  He highlighted, in particular, the importance of continuing professional development, CPD, for teachers and ongoing development of school leaders.</p><p>  The current higher education strategy for Northern Ireland entitled, Graduating to Success, encourages higher education providers to collaborate on an all-island basis on teaching and learning.  Specifically, it stresses that higher education providers should strive to &quot;facilitate student flows between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland; to minimise the obstacles to Cross Border undergraduate mobility and to collaborate on an all-island basis on teaching and learning&quot;.  Similarly, in this jurisdiction the national strategy for higher education to 2030 states there is &quot;significant potential for institutional collaboration on a North-South basis to advance Cross Border regional development and strategically advance Irish higher education on an all-island basis&quot;.  Graduating to Success also outlines the intent to support such cross-Border collaboration, particularly where it is &quot;geographically advantageous to do so and where there are benefits for the institutions involved and for students&quot;.  Furthermore, the recent report of the international review panel on the structure of initial teacher education provision in Ireland stresses the importance of investment in the continuous improvement of the quality of teaching, the role of research in teacher education and international co-operation in all of its teacher education institutions.</p><p>  The current strategic plan for St. Angela's College aims to establish key partnerships and engage in strategic collaborations with other educational institutions.  The plan specifically highlights the importance of establishing partnerships with cross-Border institutions.  The school of education, University of Ulster is also committed to the establishment of collaborations and partnerships with other institutions and organisations locally, nationally and internationally as part of its corporate plan.  The parties present are succeeding in operationalising a framework for collaborative teaching, learning and research in teacher education on an all-island basis.  Both institutions are translating these political objectives into specific operational aims, strategies and plans relevant to their respective teaching and student bodies.  We do so for a number of key reasons: to strengthen teaching, learning and research within and between both institutions; to benefit our students and enhance student learning; and to strengthen and build regional and cross-Border development.</p><p>  I would like to stress the importance to St Angela's College, in particular, of positive regional development.  The strategic significance of the location of the college in the north west for the past 60 years, with its established and emerging cross-Border co-operation and potential for undergraduate mobility, places the college in a unique position in this jurisdiction.  Furthermore, it is the only indigenous higher education institution providing initial teacher education, ITE, and CPD programmes for teachers in a Border county.  Similarly, the school of education, University of Ulster is fully committed to supporting and engaging in cross-Border collaboration in the areas of ITE and CPD.</p></speech>

The two institutions have engaged in significant formal and informal collaboration in respect of both teaching and research at an individual academic and institutional level throughout the past two decades.  Collaborative work has taken place in the area of ITE of religious education teachers.  In the mid-1990s St Angela&rsquo;s College, through funding from the EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation, formed a partnership with the school of education.  This project involved student teachers from both institutions and promoted dialogue, understanding and reconciliation between educators from the Protestant and Roman Catholic traditions within Ireland.</p><p>  In 2005 the two institutions were key partners in the establishment of a cross-Border collaborative initiative funded under the European Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border region of Ireland - Peace II.  The purpose of the initiative was to enable teachers, educational psychologists and other professionals from the Border counties to build on peace and stability by coming together and exchanging experiences and models of best practice.  Arising from this, these participants formed three North-South cluster groups and based their joint programmes of work in the key areas of autism, dyslexia and marginalised youth.  Academic staff members in the special educational needs team at St. Angela's College and colleagues from the school of education were involved in the steering committee for this project and in all three cluster groups.</p></speech>

We are fully aware of the extreme budgetary pressures impacting on Government expenditure.  We are subject to such pressures and associated challenges on a daily basis.  Cognisant of the committee&rsquo;s overarching remit regarding the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement as it pertains to education, we would welcome any advice and assistance it may offer in this area.</p><p>  The commitment to continue to progress closer collaboration between St. Angela&rsquo;s College, Sligo and the school of education at the University of Ulster will facilitate greater understanding and sharing of expertise and afford further access for practitioners in the region.  Through this collaboration, it is possible to progress educational and research opportunities in teacher education in the region and on an all-island basis.  I acknowledge the significant effort my colleagues in the school of education at the University of Ulster and St. Angela&rsquo;s College have put in to promoting and progressing the initiatives we have outlined, to which both institutions are fully committed.  It would be encouraging were our joint efforts to receive the endorsement of the committee in respect of the cross-Border collaboration to which both institutions are committed.</p></speech>

It is a fantastic college and its record in home economics is second to none, not only in Ireland but also further afield.</p><p>  I have been reading the various reports from the HSE on cross-Border links.  They remind me of the story of Hugh de Lacy asking Henry II how much land he could have in Ireland and being told he could have as much as he was able to conquer for himself.  These cross-Border links need funding and support.  How can we help specifically with funding and who can we lobby?  The committee has good moral authority when we communicate on these issues.</p><p>  How have the colleges found the experience of collaborating?  My former school was involved in a link with a school in Markethill.  On one occasion teachers from both schools were sitting down together with an inspector from Belfast in attendance.  The inspector said she was doubtful about the project until she overheard the teachers having a chat.  Sometimes the gaps between sentences contain the meaning.  Have the delegates found the experience useful in terms of strategies for teaching and learning and comparing notes?  Dundalk Institute of Technology and DCU have drawn up a memorandum of understanding which is leading to shared degrees and other research links.  Where do the delegates see the memorandum of understanding between their institutions proceeding?</p></speech>

What possibilities are there for the strengthening of collaborative research between the two partners and what role might SCoTENS play in this regard?</p><p>  My second question concerns the Border region in general.  Senator Jim D'Arcy referred to the link between Dundalk Institute of Technology and DCU.  What cross-Border links could be developed to benefit students on both sides of the Border?  I come from County Monaghan which lacked a third level campus until the VEC recently developed one.  We are seeking to develop linkages with universities across the Border because it is important that students in the region, whether from Fermanagh, Monaghan, Cavan or Armagh, are served by a university.  We need an outreach programme from Queen's University Belfast or the University of Ulster.  I am interested in hearing the delegates ideas on how we can develop cross-Border linkages.</p></speech>

They all are welcome to Leinster House.</p><p>  Deputy Crowe extends his apologies.  He cannot attend today.  The truth is that I asked him whether I could come in his place because this is a special day for me and for those in the area I represent.  I am so proud to be here today.  It is an important day.  I am so proud of St. Angela's College, its work, staff and students.</p><p>  Undoubtedly, with regard to North-South co-operation, there continues to be distrust between individuals and between communities, and, hopefully, we are working our way through that.  It is less well recognised that there is institutional or organisational distrust.  Perhaps it is more self-interest, with every institution and organisation jealously guarding its budget in these tight financial times.  If we are to make a serious inroad in North-South co-operation, we need to be breaking through those walls of self-interest and distrust.  What has been described today is exactly that.  The winners from the memorandum of understanding presented to the committee today will be their students and those whom their students will teach.</p><p>  I also hold the view that there are two borders in Ireland, not only the one between the Six Counties and the Twenty-six Counties.  If one looks at an infrastructural map of the island of Ireland, there is an east-west border as well.  This memorandum of understanding is redressing some of the imbalance towards the west coast as well.  It is a wonderful example of co-operation.  I am most familiar with St. Angela's College.  Any committee member who has not been to St. Angela's should visit it.  It sits on the shores of Lough Gill and one will not see a more wonderful location for a college anywhere in Ireland or in any other country.</p></speech>

This issue and that of North-South collaboration are dear to all of our hearts.  I compliment Dr. Taheny on the evolution of St. Angela's.  The two colleges share a unique specialisation in home economics and advancing into the important modern area of diet, health and well-being.  I attended a superb presentation by the Alzheimer's Society on how important all of these issues are in preventing the onset of Alzheimer's disease.  I encourage them both in their continuous collaboration in the north west and commend them on signing a memorandum of understanding.  Gabh mo leisc&eacute;al.

Dr. Taheny stated she would welcome any advice and assistance that the committee may offer in dealing with the financial pressures and challenges caused by enhanced co-operation.  No doubt the committee will use its every influence with the Minister but if there are specific projects within the memorandum of understanding that they can document and put forward, that might be a good way to leverage funding and support for it.  For example, I am aware that St. Angela's offers Irish as an elective subject.  Are there possibilities of student exchanges between the Irish departments in both colleges, North and South?  That might be one such venture.  There may be others in which they would be interested.  As I stated, it has been a great privilege to be here today and I am very proud.</p></speech>

We will probably share the answers to some of the questions across the group.</p><p>  I thank Senator D'Arcy for his positive comments on St. Angela's College and our reputation for home economics teacher education.  I can affirm for the committee that not only do we have a national reputation, we also have an international reputation for our home economics teacher education.</p><p>  On funding, as I mentioned earlier, we certainly would welcome the advice of the committee as to how best to move forward in terms of being able to access funding.  In the initial stages, the committee might be willing to write to the Ministers in both jurisdictions to alert them to this new area of collaboration that has developed between our institutions and to encourage them to look at providing funding towards this type of collaboration, which will hopefully continue to develop - there will be more examples in the future between other institutions.  I would like to think that in some ways we are pioneering something that could develop between other institutions, north and south of the Border.</p><p>  To date, our experience of working together has been excellent.  Much of it is down to the key personnel who are working together.  I think it always does come down to people at the end of the day.  There is an excellent working relationship between the school of education in the University of Ulster and my two colleagues here, the head of home economics and the head of education, and they are the key drivers of this collaboration.  Through the various deliberations they have had to date, they have had discussions on many positive ideas that could emanate from this collaboration, and perhaps they might speak on some of those specifics.  The potential through this type of collaboration for the sharing of academic expertise to the benefit of our institutions, and, more particularly, to the benefit of our students, is enormous.  Do any of my colleagues want to contribute at this point?</p></speech>

It is noteworthy that the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, in a recent letter to the HEA regarding its advice to the him on system governance, stressed that there is significant potential for institutional collaboration on a North-South basis to advance cross-Border regional development and strategically advance Irish higher education on an all-island basis.</p><p>  This particular memorandum of understanding has highlighted three aspects that we particularly want to explore.  There may be others in the future.  The three are student and staff mobility, the shared delivery of programmes in initial teacher education, and a strategic programme of collaborative research and dissemination.  On student and staff mobility, some possible models are being explored by the heads of departments in St. Angela's and the head of the school of education and colleagues in the University of Ulster.  The initiatives are in their infancy but the possibilities of summer schools and exchanges during term time, where student teachers can participate in mutually acceptable modules or sub-modules and even accumulate European credit-transfer system credits, are being explored.  It is also envisaged that an action plan will be established to make progress on these initiatives, including project development, implementation of the initiatives and evaluation of the initiatives.  Obviously, funding will be helpful in progressing these.</p></speech>

Our graduates are highly sought after and they are qualified to teach Gaeilge to leaving certificate standard and they are employed in secondary school and Gaelchol&aacute;ist&iacute; throughout Ireland.  It makes perfect sense to explore collaboration in this area in terms of student staff exchange, sharing of resources, expertise and research because Gaeilge is also delivered in initial teacher education at the school of education in the University of Ulster.  For example, it is a requirement that student teachers who are preparing to teach Irish in the South have to spend some time in the Gaeltacht and there is a possibility of exploring joint periods in the Gaeltacht for students, North and South.</p></speech>

He pointed out both areas, the collaborations around research and the communication on both sides of the Border with people who would not normally necessarily have worked together in the past.  SCoTENS has been a great success in terms of cross-Border communication around research.  We would like to build on the strengths of SCoTENS and build collaborative projects and build capacity for research because capacity building research can be very complex to establish.  A further important area is building the dissemination process because it is no good if we as researchers conduct the research and keep the findings to ourselves; the findings need to be disseminated both within Ireland and further afield in order that we build international reputations in research.  If our appearance here today can further establish research and research funding on an all-Ireland basis, that would be very helpful to institutions across all the areas of interest that we described.</p></speech>

He has made some very valid points in terms of the changing era in higher education on both sides of the Border.  We are now at the stage where there is a realisation that stand-alone institutions are no longer going to be the order of the day as we move forward and that we will all be looking at new ways of doing things and certainly new ways of exploring the sharing of resources to the mutual benefit of collaborating institutions.  The Deputy's points were very valid.  We have answered his point on the Gaeilge issue.</p><p>  Returning to the issue of funding, if and when we have specific projects, we will be more than happy to bring those back to this committee and if there are opportunities to seek its advice on how to move forward with them, we will be more than happy to do that.  </p><p>  Senator White has left the room but I want to thank her for her positive comments about St. Angela's College and the University of Ulster.</p></speech>

We spend a good deal of time trying to find ways to bring about situations where people can work together and it is very encouraging that the two institutions represented are signing a memorandum of understanding and are well on the way to creating the type of co-operation and collaboration that we as a committee are about.  I wish them well.  I have never seen Deputy Colreavy so happy; they should come here more often.  He is a proud man today because all week he had been telling me and everybody else who was prepared to listen that we had to be here and rightly so.  Fair play to him.</p><p>  The three areas the representatives mentioned of staff mobility, sharing and research and development and collaborative programmes in research is an excellent way to go about this process.  We all share support for this project and its vision.  The representatives mentioned that funding could become a problem but she also said that there is good co-operation between both jurisdictions and both Ministers in regard to the funding aspect.  I hope they will use this committee at any time they need to in the future.  If funding is necessitated for any type of a project, we will put our shoulder to the wheel and try to deliver it as part of the implementation of the wider remit of this committee.</p><p>  What are the next steps?  Will the representatives of the University of Ulster outline any similar work it is doing with other institutions on cross-Border co-operation in education or on an all-Ireland basis?  There is no doubt in my mind that as we break down barriers many of those barriers were perceptions in people's minds and in the minds of those in different communities.  As we break them down, we open up a whole new world of co-operation and collaboration.  That has a huge role to play in education and education can be to the forefront in creating that type of co-operation as we move forward.  I wish the representatives well and thank them for coming here.  Hopefully, everything they are attempting to do will come about and will be much bigger and better as we move forward.</p></speech>

I wish to ask a few questions but first I congratulate St. Angela's College on its 60th anniversary.  The witnesses have clearly outlined new Border initiatives within teacher education.  However, St. Angela's College is also recognised for its excellent achievements in nurse education.  Is there any likelihood of developing cross-Border collaboration in this area with the University of Ulster?  Given obesity levels on the island of Ireland, home economics education has never been more timely.  My understanding is that home economics education is mandatory for all second level students in the North.  What needs to be done to ensure access for all students on the island of Ireland to home economics education?  It is commendable that the memorandum of understanding has been signed by both HEIs.  However, it is often the case that policy agreements of this nature take some time to be implemented.  Have the delegates got specific examples of how the initiatives they have mentioned will operate in practice?</p></speech>

In terms of links with other institutions on both sides of the Border we have links through SCoTENS to other institutions and quite often those projects which have to have Northern and Southern partners will have partners from more than one institution.  Therefore, we do have links.  I would say that some of our long-standing links have been around home economics with St. Angela's College and other areas of its work.  We do have other links and we would seek to enhance links throughout and across this island.  We have also got considerable quality assurance links because universities provide quality assurance for each other's courses via the external examiner system.  Those are very important in relation to teaching and the quality of teaching and ensuring that quality is maintained.</p><p>  I wish to address Deputy Se&aacute;n Conlan's question in relation to links in Monaghan, if we may change counties for a moment.  We have links to Monaghan Education Centre where we deliver a part of our masters in education as an out centre and further afield to Athlone, particularly in the area of leadership but we would like to enhance that.  We are looking at developing work around TESOL, teaching English to speakers of other languages, in particular, but there are other areas also that we would like to develop with Monaghan and Athlone.</p></speech>

The main source we have used has been SCoTENS seed funding for smaller projects.  As outlined in our earlier presentation we would have availed of PEACE funding and also the EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation for projects already completed.  We will continue to make application through the various bodies.  However, what we are seeking is a broader commitment from the Ministers in both jurisdictions.  If this is a project to which both are committed, perhaps they would potentially consider a stream of funding for the development of such cross-Border collaborations as we are presenting today.</p></speech>

Currently, 70% of men and 52% of women are overweight or obese on the island which is a significant cost, estimated to be in the region of &euro;1.64 billion annually.  As the Deputy correctly outlined, home economics as a subject on the curriculum is mandatory for all students up to key stage 3 in Northern Ireland.  This is not unusual on the international front given that in countries such as Iceland, Finland and Japan home economics is also compulsory up to a similar age group.  Unfortunately, in Ireland, home economics is still an optional subject and yet institutions such as the World Health Organization would show that mandatory food education and nutrition education is extremely important for young people as a key health promotion strategy.  In Ireland, home economics is on the curriculum.  It is an established subject and, therefore, making it mandatory would help alleviate some of the issues around the lack of culinary skills and the lack of nutrition education which we are witnessing in our young people.</p></speech>

I am happy to report that preliminary discussions are already under way between the heads of the schools of nursing both in St. Angela's College and in the University of Ulster.  The memorandum of understanding as outlined earlier is step one in regard to what can develop into a much greater collaboration between our two institutions.

Reverend Mason is joined by Professor Peter McBride, CEO of the Northern Ireland Association for Mental Health.  We have met with Reverend Mason many times and are delighted that he could formally meet the committee today.  Professor McBride is also welcome.</p><p>  Before I invite Reverend Mason to make his presentation I advise him that he is protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances at this meeting.  However, if he is directed by the committee to cease making remarks on a particular matter and continues to do so, he is entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of his remarks.  He is directed that only comments and evidence connected with the subject matter of this meeting are to be given and he is asked to respect the parliamentary practice that, where possible, he should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas or a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I call on Reverend Mason to proceed with his opening statement.</p></speech>

I will set what I want to say today in the context of my life.  For seven years I was based in Springfield Road Methodist church right on the interface at Workman Avenue, which, as many of us know will be open this Saturday to facilitate the Whiterock parade.  In the 1990s I and a Catholic, a Dominican nun, Sr. Noreen Christian, spearheaded a cross-community project called ForthSpring.  I remember walking through the interface one wet November night and a little Protestant girl saying to me &quot;Hey Gary, I'm dating a wee boy from the other side&quot; which simply meant that she was dating a Catholic.  I guess this kid was 15 or 16 years of age and I remarked &quot;Isn&rsquo;t that great?&quot; and walked the 50 steps to the ForthSpring centre and into my church and said to myself how normal yet how abnormal, that sectarianism has created a society where the most basic human emotion, falling in love, is actually wrong in some people's eyes.  I am not asking people in this room to put up their hands but I am sure that all of us have been in love.  Hopefully we all are in love to some degree or another.  I want to show how vile and difficult it is to deal with that concept of sectarianism in which the basic human emotion of being in love is also categorised as being wrong.</p><p>  A couple of weeks ago Francis Teeney used a fascinating phrase on the blog of the Institute for the Study of Conflict Transformation and Social Justice, the new centre that has just been set up  at Queen's University.  He said we have been pretty good at ending the war but we are not so good at building the peace.  I want to tease that out in conversation with the committee today.  I am a Methodist clergy person, and have been for 26 years, and reconciliation seems to me to be pretty difficult to achieve.  A Dutch Reform professor commenting on South Africa said:<blockquote>. . . reconciliation is no cheap matter.  It does not come about by simply papering over deep-seated differences.  Reconciliation presupposes confrontation.  Without that we do not get reconciliation but merely a temporary glossing over of differences. The running sores of society cannot be healed with the use of sticking plaster.  Reconciliation presupposes an operation, a cutting to the very bone without anaesthetic.  The infection is not just on the surface.  The abscess of hate and mistrust and fear, between black and white, nation and nation, rich and poor, has to be slashed open.</blockquote>There is no question that the flags issue brought to the surface how deeply divided and sectarian a society Northern Ireland still is.</p></speech>

I want to paint a picture for the committee.  When people refer to trauma, most of us think of our own ideas of what it means.  I will discuss some specifics.  In Northern Ireland trauma is discussed a great deal.  It is particularly related to the experiences people had around the Troubles.  I want to broaden it out.  Of the population of Northern Ireland, 66% have at least one experience of trauma.  When people were asked, half of them identified an experience associated with the conflict.  "Trauma" is a word that is bandied around and I want to challenge to an extent its medicalisation.  If I were a medic, which I am not, I would provide the committee with a list of the diagnostic criteria people would need to meet to justifiably describe themselves as traumatised.  I acknowledge the view, but it limits our understanding of the relationship between what Dr. Mason has just described and the situation we face in Northern Ireland, which involves a process and a society which are stuck.  The experience of trauma is a material component of that stuckness.  I intend to paint a picture for the committee of the different groupings of people we have and their interactions with each other.</p><p>  The first group I refer to in relation to trauma is those persons who describe themselves as victims and survivors of the conflict.  They are drawn from both sides of the community and all parts of these communities and identify their experiences of trauma with the Troubles.  They are people who were combatants and involved in the conflict actively and who were hurt by it.  They are people who saw themselves as the victims of these combatants, people in the security forces and on other sides.  They identify themselves as victims and survivors.  For them, trauma is a profound psychological experience in which their lives have been deeply disrupted.  Apart from the experience of physical injury many of them have, there is also the psychological damage they have experienced, which they argue is disrupting their lives.  This is a huge political issue in the North and one that political parties are bandying around.  Phrases used include "legitimate victims", which is usually associated with the security forces and the Protestant side of the community.  It is a highly contentious issue.</p><p>  For many of the people concerned, the experience of trauma is perpetuated by the reinforcing of their identification as victims.  Due to the politicisation of their experiences, the fact that they are victims is a material part of the importance of what they have to say.  Therefore, there is a disincentive for many to move through their experience of trauma, to recover and get back into what might be termed "normal life".  There is a sense in which there is an incentivisation.  It is almost as if a career can be made out of being a victim or survivor of the conflict, given the importance and significance of that status in the dialogue which is ongoing in Northern Ireland.  A new victim and survivor service has been set up, a significant component of which is psychological therapy.  The service endeavours to provide support for people who have lived disrupted lives for 20 or 30 years as a consequence of the impact of the Troubles.  It is shocking to me that many of the people concerned have not previously accessed services and support, which would have helped them.  This says something about the nature of trauma.</p></speech>

Delving into what Professor McBride was saying, memory and how we tell stories is crucial when we deal with the past.  I have often illustrated this going back to the late 1980s.  I will take the committee members to the Balkans and paint a little story.</p></speech>

There is an assumption that we have done a great deal of work and many conversations have been had.  The phrase "heavy lifting" is used frequently.  There is no doubt a great deal of work is being done but for many people, it is 25 or 30 years after the event that they are able to begin to connect emotionally with what happened.  One of the challenges we face is we need to go back and have some of the conversations again and hear them differently.  We think we know what the other side thinks.  There are many assumptions about understanding the position of loyalists, republicans and various different factions whereas there is not an awful lot of listening going on at the minute and what is being said now is different.  The emotional content in a strange way is more raw and, therefore, there is a need for a different kind of conversation and dialogue and if the focus is on reconciliation - and it has to be - then the content of that is an emotional engagement rather than simply intellectual fighting.</p><p>  With regard to what Dr. Mason described in terms of PEACE II and PEACE IV, there is something to being able to say that with all the work that has been done, we need to revisit some of it, have some of those conversations again and see if we hear something different.</p></speech>

The issues they raise are difficult and they involve significant effort and dialogue to confront the reasons there was so many difficulties in the past.  Religious orders and groupings have never taken responsibility for their influence on certain people during conflict.  Bono was interviewed on television by Gay Byrne earlier this week and he spoke about the fragmentation of a church.  I do not agree with much of what he says but I assume he was referring to the use by various religious orders of a mechanism or control over their flocks to advance their own agendas.</p><p>  As part of a reconciliation process, one has to deal with the past.  If one does not deal with the past, one will not arrive at the intellectual or emotional need.  In dealing with reconciliation, one must start at the beginning - the reasons one was in conflict, the motivating factors behind conflict in general, one's influence in getting people to be part of the conflict and so forth.  I watch Al Jazeera and other television networks every night.  There is religious connotations to most conflicts throughout the world, including in Syria and the Balkans.  People kill themselves because of religion, God, Allah and so on.  If one looks deep enough, the religious grouping to which people belong in conflicts becomes the excuse but behind that are inequality, poverty, a state's treatment of its peoples, denial of identity and so on.  All these aspects must be dealt with.</p><p>  With regard to the reasons for the Six Counties conflict, we are 15 years on from the Good Friday Agreement and we are in a much better place.  A great deal of hard work has gone into it.  I disagree with Dr. Mason in so far as I think there is a relationship between combatants on both sides, particularly in formerly republican and loyalist communities.  There is a relationship, understanding and dialogue.  That dialogue has kept a lid on everything but it has not addressed why just under the surface there is the ability to push us back to where we were.  That is what we have to address.</p><p>  I refer again to effects of trauma and conflict.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-27a.396" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/970" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="13:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2013062700012#L00200"><p>I welcome Reverend Dr. Mason and Professor McBride and thank them for their stimulating presentations.  They contained much food for thought regarding the particular challenges for society.  Professor McBride's concluding comments refer to the transgenerational trauma.  All of what both witnesses said is a cause for concern.  Issues must be addressed in a very meaningful way.  Time is not on our side to deal with those issues, and we do not wish to go backwards in any respect.  As Deputy Ferris said, there has been huge progress and we are in a much better place than we were prior to 1994 or 1998.</p><p>  With regard to transgenerational trauma, surely as a society and within the public system in particular there must be a targeting of resources and support for that generation.  I presume that many of the people who are vulnerable are in the more disadvantaged areas, as Deputy Ferris said, and come from the less advantaged estates and homes.  Professor McBride said there is less listening taking place now.  Who is listening less?  Is it the public service or the people who are supposed to be delivering services or is it all of us as a society?  When the committee visited east Belfast it met a number of different groups but it struck me that nobody raised with myself and my colleagues the area of education and the need for extra investment in education, from preschool through to tertiary education, for those people who would have seen nothing but disadvantage, lack of job opportunities and lack of educational attainment.  If we do not target children from preschool onwards, we have no chance of making a better society for the next generation.  I realise that will not ease the pain for current adults, but for a family where there is progress for the next generation in regard to educational attainment, which should give the person the skills to get meaningful employment, it is particularly important.</p><p>  It struck me that day that nobody from the very good community groups and the people we met raised the lack of targeted investment in education.  In the RAPID, revitalising areas by planning, investment and development, programme in the South there was a whole-of-government approach, whereby the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the local authorities, education and health were involved.  In some areas where there was good leadership of that programme it was very effective in targeting estates and communities where there had been a legacy of under-investment and, unfortunately, under-achievement by children in education and so forth.  We know that a one-cap-fits-all approach does not always work.  I gathered from Professor McBride's comments that he thinks there must be a specific approach to dealing with these issues.  Communities, individuals, churches, political parties and voluntary organisations can be doing very meaningful work within their communities, but perhaps an overarching approach and framework is required.  It will not be easy to put together the architecture for that approach, but if we do not try to do it we will not achieve it.</p><p>  I compliment the witnesses on their contributions and on the work they both do in their respective roles working in difficult areas.</p></speech>

We have visited Reverend Dr. Mason in the Skainos Centre previously.  This is the first time Professor McBride has appeared before this committee and he is very welcome.  His contribution to the discussion today has been very helpful.  Like Deputy Smith, the reference to transgenerational trauma struck a chord with me.  As I listened to the witnesses speak I was reminded of a couple of issues we have been dealing with over the last number of years.  They are not necessarily related directly to the conflict but they are part of the package of problems we face.</p><p>  One of them was the debate in the Assembly a couple of years ago about early intervention and the argument about when early intervention starts.  One of the MLAs made the point that early intervention must happen as soon as the child goes to school, but I made that point that if one leaves it until a child is five years old, one will have missed his or her formative years and a huge opportunity to make a positive difference in the child's life.  If one waits until the child is five years old, it is too late.  One will never fix some of the problems or build a resilience for that child for further down the line, be it social, economic or whatever.  There was a lack of genuine understanding within the chamber about how that early intervention makes a difference to a child's life and helps to put the right building blocks in place for them to cope later in life.</p><p>  Another issue that has arisen in this committee is the bill of rights.  Again, there is a lack of understanding of the concept.  Nobody should be afraid of rights or of equality.  There is resistance to the bill of rights.  We heard about the bill of rights from the trade unions and from others in the North who appeared before this committee months ago, but 15 years after the Good Friday Agreement we are still in a position where a bill of rights is considered a bad thing in certain circles.  If people do not accept that we all have rights and entitlements and we should all accept and enjoy equality, that transgenerational trauma will be perpetuated into the future.  My question to Reverend Dr. Mason is how do we persuade people that nobody should be afraid of rights and that we should start building a society that can cope - I am deliberately not using the word "normal" - and build acceptance and understanding of each other?</p></speech>

We understand everyone is trying to deal with victimisation, trauma and psychological effects.  What happened in Bosnia was outlined.  How is it moving on?  While not undermining the scars on the island of Ireland, the scars in Bosnia were much deeper.  Did we sometimes have an acceptable level of violence which became normalised in society despite the major issues which resulted?  Former combatants were imprisoned and many people's lives were deeply affected.  There were sectarian murders.  How did countries deal with the psychological turmoil of the First and the Second World Wars?  For example, were people in Germany able to move on or are there still fissures?</p></speech>

This has by no means been resolved in Bosnia and places like that  There is still disruption in post-apartheid South Africa.  There was a honeymoon period but there are still fundamental problems.  </p><p>  The Second World War is interesting.  It is linked to Ms Gildernew's question.  At the end of the Second World War there was a winner and a fairly generally accepted shared narrative of what had happened.  There was universal condemnation following the exposure of what had happened in the concentration camps.  With a few exceptions around revisionist historians which are very minor, everybody agreed that was a terrible thing and that Nazism was wrong.  With that shared narrative, people very quickly identified what was right and what was wrong. </p><p>  There was a sense of due process and justice seen in the Nuremberg trials and that was worked out in a very public way.  Germany went through a period of contrition which was reflected in art, literature and poetry and which acknowledged the horrors of what had happened in the Second World War.  There was a reaction by the German people to acknowledge that it was wrong and they were a peaceful people.  There is evidence of that through art and literature. </p><p>  I do not think there is a shared narrative in our conflict.  One side of the community will articulate its history and story in one way but another part will tell a completely different story.  They will not recognise each other's validity.  To put it bluntly, for the loyalist and Protestant community the Good Friday Agreement was the end of something.  The attitude was, "Thank goodness we have sorted that out, the union is secure and we can breathe a sigh of relief."  For the Nationalist and republican community it was the beginning of something and the next phase of a process.</p><p>  The fundamental narrative difference is important when we come to talk about transgenerational trauma.  I had an uncle and grandfather who were killed in the First and Second World Wars.  That is talked about in a very matter of fact way in our family.  It is not a case of what the damn Germans did to us.  The issue is not about storytelling, rather it is about the passion the stories have and the ongoing sense of victimisation. </p><p>  The impact of trauma is not intellectual.  It is not that the stories being retold are the problem; it is the emotional content behind that and the sense of hurt.  There is a sense in both communities that they are not understood and one story is not validated by the other side.  There is a feeling one side does not accept the fact that the other was abused, alienated, not allowed to take jobs and suffered profound injustice which does not just go back 30 years but 200 or 500 years.  There is also a feeling on the other side that one part of the community does not accept that there is a rule of law and it has a particular identity.  There are narratives, but there is also sentiment and passion underneath them. </p><p>  On the question of how we target groups in society, we need to target children and young people and be able to build resilience.  Ms Gildernew is absolutely right.  I would argue that the process starts pre-birth in terms of preparing parents for parenthood.  If we do not deal with this huge social issue, namely, the narratives and sense of injustice which still exists within people's perceptions of themselves, no matter how we change the support that is given the sense of hurt and violence which has been done to people will come through in parenting.  We cannot avoid it, it is unconscious. </p><p>  The sense of being victimised or having a story in which the pain of trauma is still alive in the family cannot be hidden.  Children will pick up on it very quickly.  This is a complex issue.  There is something to be said for getting people to begin to talk in a different way and understand that when we talk about the role of memory in society it is not simply about a different way of telling stories.  It is about understanding that the sentiment, passion and emotional experience behind that is where the power lies. </p><p>  The emotional experience of victimhood, persecution and pain are transmitted.  The stories are simply the vehicles for that and have no impact if there is no passion behind them.  Every now and again in my family we talk about the relatives who died and it is no big deal.  Yet, in many families the stories of family martyrs and the things which were done are alive and it is as if things happened yesterday.  </p><p>  That experience of the present is an absolute consequence of trauma.  There is a sense that things do not become a memory but remain alive.  That is one of the core attributes of a traumatic experience and that is with what we are struggling.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-27a.401" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Gary Mason" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2013062700013#M00400"><p>I will dip in and out of the comments.  Older clergy would often say to me that the churches were full in the 1950s and 1960s as if that was something to be proud of.  I often tell them their gift to my generation was a sectarian war.  I want to ask them what they were doing in the 1950s and 1960s, as people allegedly of faith, to address sectarianism.  There was no prophetic stance by the Catholic or Protestant churches to address sectarianism. </p><p>  I have said before and I am quite happy to say publicly that what Unionism did post-partition was fundamentally wrong.  It was a justice issue.  As a person of faith I believe in equal rights, justice and the bill of rights, as Ms Gildernew said.  The problem is how both communities of faith - what I call toxic faith - have interpreted scripture in a sectarian rather than an inclusive way.  That is something with which the churches still have not gotten to grips.  </p><p>  Sometimes we see peace processes as economically driven.  There is a perception that if a wee lad living on the Shankill Road or the Falls Road gets a job everything will be okay.</p> <p>I am an economic animal, as are Professor McBride and Ms Gildernew.  We all have an economic component, but I also have a psychological and a pastoral component.  The failure to recognise that dimension has been the massive weakness of the peace process.  There is no sense, for example, in me giving an ex-member of the UVF living on the Newtownards Road a job and saying everything will be okay.  The reality is that many people in that situation, in their relationship with their partner or wife and their children, have learned to deal with difference through verbal or physical violence.  As Professor McBride observed, there are some who have never been taught another narrative, whereby one deals with difference through conversation, dialogue and debate.  For many, there is an unreconstructed narrative in their psychology which has not been addressed and has not changed.  One sees this in the way things spill out after parades.  I attended a stag night some weeks ago and my wife decided to do something on the same night on the Newtownards Road.  When I heard that a parade was taking place there, I telephoned to advise her to stay where she was until I could collect her.  At 10 p.m. people were urinating, vomiting and fighting in the street.  The language used on such occasions is appalling, yet children are there observing all of it.  Much of that behaviour is coming from the post-Troubles generation.  The reality is that Northern Ireland is, at times, an aggressive society in which we deal with difference through physical or verbal abuse.</p><p> We can see parallels in other post-conflict situations throughout the world.  South Africa, for instance, is a mess.  I have spoken about this with Peter Storey who was one of the two key church figures, together with Desmond Tutu, during the conflict in that country.  We have all heard about the heavy alcohol abuse, rapes and violence in the townships.  Reference has been made to the prophetic observation that although we have been good at ending at the war, we are not good at building the peace.  Many of these post-conflict situations are exactly the same.  The Balkans area, just like Northern Ireland, is still a deeply divided society.  In South Africa black people generally have not seen a sufficient peace dividend.  Apartheid may have ended, but, economically, the country is still pretty much a wasteland for many.</p><p> Committees such as this have a key role in ensuring we are not storing up problems for future generations in Northern Ireland.  Even I was stunned by the reaction to the flag issue and I have been doing this stuff for 25 years.  It was a very difficult week, as several people in this room, including the Acting Chairman, know.  I negotiated with the UVF for a solid week.  It took 50 hours to bring the valid aspects of these protests to an end and get people over the line.  Many of those involved are of the generation to which Professor McBride referred.  As I said, we must consider the pastoral and psychological aspects.  A book I often recommend to couples before they have children is called <i>The Power of a Parent's Words</i>.  Everybody in this room will know what I am saying.  A colleague told me recently that a young man he was counselling still remembered his father's words to him as a child that he was &quot;pathetic, pathetic, pathetic&quot;.  This successful businessman aged 38 years, with a 7 series BMW and a life that seems to be going superbly still hears his father telling him he is &quot;pathetic, pathetic, pathetic&quot;.  How we tell our stories and what we say to the other side is a crucial aspect of reconciliation efforts.</p><p> What then is the way forward?  What I propose is that we bring together a number of senior republicans and loyalists, with people like Professor McBride and several key church people, for discussions on how we might get to grips with these problems.  Mr. Martin McGuinness recently threw out a challenge for that type of engagement.  There were no loyalists at the Sinn F&eacute;in conference and I ended up speaking on their behalf in some respects, in so far as I gave my reading of the temperature within that community.  There must be dialogue, of that there is no question.  There is a chasm between loyalism and republicanism at this time.  I am not disputing Deputy Martin Ferris's observation that there are sometimes good relationships on the ground, but the bottom line is that the two communities are further apart now than they were two or three years ago.  We must address that issue.</p></speech>

I do not like to make a complex situation even more complex, but there are two additional factors that should be taken into account.  Dr. Mason has mentioned that the war is over, but we are making a poor job of winning the peace.  Is it not more the case that the politicians and former combatants have won institutional power?  Is there a sense in which people, instead of addressing the real hurt that is felt, are dancing around it because they are concerned that to do otherwise might damage the institutions of peace, which include not just Stormont but also the institutions that flow from it?  In other words, is there a sense that containment of anger is better than dealing with it because we do not know which way it will go if it is opened up?</p><p>  Second, there has been a great deal of work done within the political system and at the military level, but the real problems are closer to the ground.  Certain people got to sit around tables and have discussions and had, therefore, at least some control over their own future.  On the other hand, the people who were learning from them and were inspired by them had no such input.  The key question then is about the type of people and organisations that should be assuming leadership of the process.  In other words, is it good enough to fall back on political leaders and former military leaders or should we be looking to other types of people to lead change?</p></speech>

As I said, if we could get some key republicans and loyalists into a room with representatives of key NGOs and politicians who are willing to take risks - not those who are prepared only to play a safe game - there is a possibility to make progress.  I would be interested in having a conversation on the way forward in that regard, as I am sure would Professor McBride.  There is no avoiding the difficult conversations, in which politicians have a role.  It is sometimes observed that reconciliation presupposes confrontation, which is another way of saying one must ask the hard questions.  It is the same in any relationship.  If a couple go for counselling without ever mentioning that one of them is abusing alcohol, they will not get anywhere.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-27a.405" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Peter McBride" time="13:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2013062700014#N00500"><p>I agree that the real question in all of this is how the difficult stuff is handled.  There is a case to be made that one of the outcomes of the peace process was the end of the careers of both John Hume and David Trimble.  One analysis has it that these individuals pushed their own constituencies too far, which resulted in the end of the Official Unionist Party and the SDLP.  An important point to make is that the skills and attributes which assist in bringing an end to war are not necessarily the skills and attributes which help to create peace.  We are talking about different things.  There is something to be said for creating a safe and secure environment which might encourage people who will not be seen publicly to be doing something to take some risks below the radar.  There is conflict and it has been institutionalised.</p></speech>

When one is brought up in an environment, a geographical area that is divided along sectarian lines, the way to deal with this is to deal with sectarianism.  Sectarianism has been supported by the churches and used historically as a position of supremacy in that way and economically.  Therefore, one must deal with it, but how is that to be done?  One deals with it through integration, including in education.  One cannot change people who have lived through the past 60, 70 or 80 years and have an entrenched position.  One must look beyond this if one is talking about creating emotional reconciliation.  That will only start with early intervention, at a very young age.  That is how one deals with sectarianism.</p><p>  I disagree with Dr. Mason.  Perhaps things have slipped back in certain parts of Belfast, but, overall, the situation has not been too bad.  Last year the committee was on the Newtownards Road and met Jimmy Birch, Denis Cunningham, John Bunting and Jackie McDonald inside UDA headquarters.  That was a huge step.  Four years ago one would probably have ended up on the bonfire if one had picked the wrong night to go there and <i>vice versa,</i> but that visit demonstrates how far we have come.  There is an onus and a responsibility on both the churches and political representatives to go along the road towards early intervention to deal with the root cause of the problem in the North - sectarianism.</p></speech>

On the ground it is sometimes easier for loyalists to meet people in Dublin than it is to meet them across the interface.  In the past two years, particularly in parts of Belfast, there has been increasing isolation among some of the groupings.  There is still work to be done, but that does not minimise the achievements.  However, we need to map a way forward.  The flags protest demonstrated this for all of us.  It was a shock and said to all of us that we should pause and take a breath and ask where we should go from here.</p></speech>

I concur with Deputy Martin Ferris that when we saw former combatants from both sides hugging one another there, this showed how far we had come.  The role of education is vital in addressing sectarianism.  Cross-Border and cross-community integrated schooling and early intervention have been mentioned.  Dr. Mason's commitment to the idea of getting together senior loyalist, republican and clerical leaders and leading NGOs and politicians for an overnight debate and dialogue is important.  As a group of politicians from all parties committed to the Good Friday Agreement, we would like to work with him to secure that agenda and move things forward.</p><p>  This meeting has been very positive.  I come from a background in the west of Ireland, not far from the Border, where this issue was sometimes seen as not being our problem.  However, psychologically, it was our problem and it is clear that across the island of Ireland everybody has suffered psychologically during the years.  I again thank our guests for what has been an excellent discussion.  I look forward to working with them and the members of the committee.</p></speech>

The title of our presentation is, Best Health for Children in 2013.  I thank the committee for this opportunity.  We wish to raise some critical issues regarding child health services in the community.  The Institute of Community Health Nursing, ICHN, is a professional organisation established in 1985 for public health nurses and community registered general nurses, RGNs.  In light of the planned child and family support agency Bill, the ICHN wishes to discuss with the committee the role of the public health nurse, PHN, in child health and well-being and that it is essential in the best interests of children that a dedicated, health-promoting, preventive nursing service for children and families be developed as a matter of urgency.  A PHN child health service is not included in phase 1 of the new agency.</p><p>  Census 2011 identified the number of pre-school children aged 0-4 at 356,000, an overall increase of 17.9% since 2006, and the population of the primary school age group at 504,000, an increase of 12% since 2006.  The PHN has an opportunity to assess all these children and families.  The dual role of the PHN in clinical care and public-population health and well-being is prioritised towards clinical nursing care as a result of Government policy, the primary care and implementation processes, the moratorium on the recruitment of nursing staff and the absence of a national workforce plan for primary and public health nursing in the future.</p><p>  The ICHN has been advocating for a number of years to convince policy makers of the gaps and challenges that exist in implementing Best Health for Children, which was first published in 1999 and revisited in 2005.  This programme sets out a clear, evidence-based health programme for pre-school and primary school children.  The recommended 0-4 years contact by the PHN with the children and family commences with a visit approximately 48 hours after discharge from the maternity hospital and four subsequent pre-school visits.  We are the only health professional group who visit the home of every newborn child and mother in Ireland.  This places us in a unique position to build relationships with families and their communities.</p><p>  Performance indicators on early years health screening is limited to quantitative data in the first year.  There are no national data performance indicators measuring outputs and outcomes at the 18-24 month screening and the 3.25 to 3.5 year screen.  The HSE health staff performance report of 2012 reported a variation of 38% to 100% of children reaching ten months who had received their 7-9 month screening on time, demonstrating an inequity of service delivery to this population group across the country.  A recent review by the institute of the school health service demonstrated that the recommendations from Best Health for Children on school health screening are not uniformly implemented.  This has resulted in variance in the timing, programme content, equipment and referral criteria and pathways across the country.  There are no national key performance indicators on the delivery of school health nursing service.</p><p>  The ICHN strongly advocates for the provision of designated school health teams for the school health and well being surveillance programme and promotion.  The Monageer inquiry 2009, which considered child abuse and protection, recognised that the public health nursing service provided to pre-school children was critical to the identification of children in families in need of early intervention.  The institute strongly advocates for improved systems for the further professional development of PHNs to address this need.  The child and family needs assessment framework is an assessment tool developed by public health nursing in the midlands.  It facilitates early identification of vulnerable children and families, mobilises appropriate early identification and prevents the need for child care and social work services except in cases of serious concern and risk of harm to children.  Evidence shows it is possible to prevent abuse and neglect with effective systems and interventions.</p><p>  The parent-held record is a record held by the parent, which allows it so be shared with other health professionals working with children and their families.  The parent-held record is in use in only eight former LHO areas of the country.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-27a.428" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Hennessy" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013062700004#F00500"><p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to attend the committee to discuss the issue of public health nursing.  I am regional director for HSE West.  I am accompanied by Dr. Michael Shannon, director of nursing and midwifery services in the HSE, and Ms Martina Queally, area manager for HSE Dublin South East.</p><p>  The delivery of community nursing services that effectively meet the health needs of the population within a primary care setting is the primary aim of the public health nursing service.  The continued development of primary care teams is also being progressed, focusing on increased emphasis on care in the community and integration of services as outlined in the HSE 2013 national service plan.  Multidisciplinary primary care teams provide health and personal social services as well as being the first point of contact for patients and clients in a local setting, which and ensures continuation and co-ordination of services.  In the context of care and reform and the current drive toward an integrated health system, treating and delivering care to patients in more appropriate settings is an integral part of the role of the public health nurse and the registered general nurse working in the primary care teams.  Public health nursing in Ireland is continuing to evolve in response to the growing demand for health care services in the community, as mentioned by Ms O'Dowd in her presentation.</p><p>  The public health nursing service provides an extensive range of services within the Irish health service - for example, it provides children&rsquo;s health services, including post-natal visits and developmental screening up to six years of age.  The role of the public health nurse in safeguarding and protecting the health and well-being of children is also provided for in legislation, in the Child Care Act 1991 and the Children First guidelines 2011.</p><p>  Immunisation programmes are provided as part of the school health service.  The school health screening programme, as outlined in Best Health for Children, and immunisation programmes are currently available to schoolchildren in accordance with the national immunisation guidelines of 2008.  Public health nurses are involved in the assessment of need and the provision of services to children and adults with disabilities.  Health policy also endorses maintaining older adults in their own environment and in their own homes, where possible.  Older persons receive assessments and are provided with services including home care packages in accordance with need.  The public health nursing service is extensively involved in palliative care and the support of terminally ill patients in community settings.  Patients with long-term illnesses are supported in the home setting.  Patients with hepatitis C receive services, including the support of the public health nursing service, in accordance with assessed need. </p><p>  Most important, public health nurses are often a key conduit for the dissemination of information and advice on health to all sectors of the population, often as the first point of contact.  In conjunction with its core services the public health nursing service has expanded its remit to include the following: the development and expansion of community intervention teams whose primary aim is the avoidance of unnecessary hospital admission and the facilitation of early discharge from hospitals; the development of the school immunisation programme to include the education of public health nurses to oversee immunisation under medication protocol; and the schools vaccination programme, which is currently being delivered by immunisation teams including area medical officers and public health nurses in many areas of the country.  It is anticipated that this programme will be nurse-led in the future.  Support is also provided for clinical care programmes which help to facilitate the timely discharge of patients from hospitals.  The aim is to allow patients to receive more rehabilitation at home, to remain at home in the long term and to regain independence in daily activities.  Support for the national<b><i></i></b>newborn blood spot screening service is another function of public health nurses, who are responsible for ensuring that the test is carried out following notification and that all babies residing in their areas have been offered screening.  Public health nurses are involved in the expansion of clinic-based services where appropriate, including assessment and treatment of wound care, continence care, child health, adult health checks, diabetes clinics and parenting programmes<b><i>.  </i></b>The delivery of more complex care to patients in the community undergoing oncology treatment is also a developing area, and this is currently in place in a number of areas in the west of Ireland, including Donegal and Galway.</p><p>  There are currently 3,312 public health nurses on the register with An Bord Altranais, of whom 2,402 are on the active file.  In March 2013 the total number of nursing staff employed in the public health nursing service was 2,067 whole-time equivalents, broken down as follows: 15 directors of public health nursing; 122 assistant directors of public health nursing; 1,512 public health nurses; 418 registered general nurses; and 43 student public health nurses.  Since 2006, in order to streamline the sponsorship of student public health nurse training, the HSE and four participating training colleges, UCC, UCD, NUIG and St. Angela&rsquo;s College, have undertaken a process of joint entry and recruitment.  For the past number of years the four regional directors in the HSE regions were requested to identify their annual sponsorship requirements based on service need.  Sponsoring local health office areas provide clinical placements to public health nursing students while they undertake the full-time higher postgraduate diploma in public health nursing.  This year, a total of 85 student public health nurse sponsorship places have been allocated, with 14 in the west region, 14 in the south region, 27 in Dublin north east and 30 in the Dublin mid-Leinster region.</p><p>  In 2013, primary care development funding of &euro;20 million will be invested to support the recruitment of prioritised front-line primary care team posts and to enhance the capacity of the primary care sector.  The 2013 national service plan has prioritised the appointment of approximately 250 primary care posts, including public health nurses, registered general nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and speech and language therapists.  The recruitment and appointment of people to fill these posts is currently under way.</p><p>  Analysis has revealed considerable variation across the 17 integrated service areas in the ratios of health care professionals to population and to population numbers in areas of high deprivation.</p></speech>

I thank Ms O'Dowd and Mr. Hennessy who led the delivery of the presentations and who are very welcome.  </p><p>  Most of us, in one capacity or another, have had experience of the public health nurse service.  As a father of five children, I had a very happy experience of it many years ago.  A friendship developed from it which remains to this day.  I am sure that is replicated in the experience of many all over the country.  To the delegation's professional cohort and colleagues I extend sincere thanks.</p><p>  I have a number of brief questions which were triggered by Ms O'Dowd's presentation but apply to both.  The delegates can offer any illumination they are happy to provide.  </p><p>  There are no national key performance indicators for the delivery of the school health nursing service.  I ask for clarification on the issue.  Does it also take on board oral health through dental care service provision for schools?  Is it part of the general range of services encompassed within school health nursing services?  I raise this matter because I am very conscious that another group of young people has moved from primary to second level education and there are significant levels of failure in the service to provide for the necessary public dental service checks.  In one school cancellations have taken place for the second time for the same class which are now outside the system in second level where the provision longer applies.  This is a very serious matter and in a way indicative of other problems, but I am particularly aware of the issue, given the closure of the primary school system last week or this week.  Parents are both disappointed and concerned and many of them will not be able to afford private dental checks.  I ask the delegates to elaborate on this issue.  </p><p>  What is necessary for the introduction of national key performance indicators?  Who will be responsible?  How can such a system be brought into being?  What would the delegation's recommendations be to us, as elected voices in the committee, on how we can help to bring it about?  I accept that it would be hugely beneficial in informing us in the future.</p><p>  The delegation indicates that the parent held record, PHR, is only in use in eight former local health offices across the country.  Would it be able to advise us where they are located?  If the information is not included in Ms O'Dowd's notes, I understand, but perhaps she might advise us through the secretariat and Chairman for circulation to us.  I am sure the delegation would recommend that we pursue that issue because clearly it is something that would be of great benefit.</p><p>  I refer to the dual role of the public health nurse in regard to clinical care and public population health and well-being.  The delegation is probably aware that in the context of the promised child and family agency, the role of public health nurse has been a point of discussion here.  There is some difficulty in recognising how the transition will come occur and whether it will lead to a dislodgement of psychologists in the child and family agency from their peers in terms of theprovision of general psychology services across the community.  Will Ms O'Dowd and Mr. Hennessy elaborate on the concerns, if any, they have in that regard?  From our deliberations in recent months, I understand public health nurses are designated solely to address issues affecting children, but perhaps that is a city experience.</p></speech>

What is the number of public health nurses per head of population in Ireland and how does that compare to other countries in Europe?</p></speech>

Yesterday, the hospice movement gave us an overview of the huge variation in hospice care across the country.  The issue that comes to mind regarding children is the recent report on obesity which shows that 25% of children under three years of age are overweight or obese.  It is obviously a problem created at a very early age so we must plan to deal with it now.  What must be done at national level?  The witness spoke about setting up proper structures relating to public health nurses and children.  I am asking about dealing with that issue here and now.  How has it been allowed to develop so fast in such a short period of time?  What are the witness's observations on that issue?  It will be a major health problem for all of us over the next ten years because of the way it seems to have developed.  Perhaps the witness would discuss that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-27a.435" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1038" speakername="Eamonn Maloney" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013062700006#H00400"><p>I thank the contributors.  All of us value the role of the public health nurse.  While we value it, we must also be honest with ourselves because in many respects I believe it is largely taken for granted.  Public health nurses never got public recognition for their role as somebody who monitors not only the health of children but also their welfare.  It is an unspoken fact that in some of the cases I am aware of the public health nurse was the first person to go to the authorities about welfare issues for children.  That is seldom acknowledged.  We know what we are talking about here, given our hidden past and the abuse cases that have been highlighted.  That must be said.</p><p>  I wish to refer to something that was brought up by public health nurses in my locality.  There was great hope with the 1999 report, and Ms O'Dowd referred to the report in her contribution.  As politicians can say, it was high on aspirations and recommendations but, without putting Ms O'Dowd's future nursing career in jeopardy, there is a very strong feeling among public health nurses that nothing substantial came out of it.  It should have.  The report was well intentioned, but it did not enhance the role of public health nurses in terms of recognising the work they did.  It is disappointing, and we are playing catch-up since.  Is that a view she would share about the 1999 report?  It referred to preschool children as well as others.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-27a.436" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1029" speakername="Catherine Byrne" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013062700006#H00500"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  I recall when I came home with my first baby and the fear and anxiety I felt when the public health nurse first called to my door.  It is something most young mothers experienced at the time.  When one closed the door after the public health nurse left there was a sigh a relief that one was taking care of one's baby properly and doing all the right things.  One felt capable of taking on this new challenge.</p><p>  I thank the public health nurses.  As a public representative I have occasionally had to call upon them for a number of different things in the community.  For me, the link is on a daily basis with the people living in the community, not only the children the nurse deals with but all the people in the community and the generational links among families.  That is very important.  I know people who are having their babies now who still have the same public health nurse their parents had.  That is an indication of the commitment of the public health nursing community.  A few days ago I spoke to a new mother who had just arrived home from hospital.  She spoke about the excellent care she had received within the first three days during the visits from the public health nurse.  She was overwhelmed by the fact that somebody took the time to visit her and her new baby.</p><p>  I was struck by the comment in the presentation that there are no national performance indicator measures.  I am not sure what that means but who has the responsibility to do that?  How is it done and how is the information collated?  That is important.  What links do the public health nurses have with women's groups in communities?  Are there times when they might visit them or link with them on certain things that happen in communities?  That is important as well.  Many young mothers who are parents for the first time can be very intimidated by somebody calling to their home, but if there is a link to a community, women's or young parents group they are involved with it could be important.</p></speech>

For that reason we thought it opportune to meet with the committee to discuss the current programme for Government and the introduction of the new agency.  The politicians' constituents are our constituents as well.  We serve the same group of people in the local towns and villages.  John's presentation clearly demonstrated the length and breadth of the role of the public health nurse.  The main point of our presentation is to inform the committee of the breadth of the role of the public health nurse and what we see as an opportunity to have a dedicated child health workforce and the need for it.</p><p>  To refer to the members' questions, two members raised the matter of key performance indicators, KPIs.  Key performance indicators are common within the health services and there are many of them.  There are two within the child health service at present.  One relates to that critical first visit.  We are very proud that it ranges between 87% and 100% in respect of being on the person's doorstep within 48 hours.  The second relates to the seven to nine months visit.  As I said, that ranges from 38% to 100%, so obviously there no equity there.  Both members asked where they emanated from.  John can answer this better than me but there is a group within the HSE that examines and determines what should be the key performance indicators.  There is none for the four subsequent visits, the preschool visits and the school visits.  Again, it requires somebody to focus on that and develop those.  However, we have systems for two of them.  Hopefully, that answers that question.</p><p>  With regard to the dental service, that is a separate service and I am not in a position to answer Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's question.  I would not be familiar with it.</p></speech>

It was a very good document which recommended a screening programme and, subsequently, a package was developed.  I wish that I could sit here and say to the committee that the report was rolled out in every area in the country since 1999.  Sadly, the report and the recommended training has not been fully implemented.</p><p>  The Deputy asked me to identify the eight areas that have the scheme.  Off the top of my head I recall that the programme was originally in Limerick and was subsequently launched in Donegal, Sligo and Kilkenny.  I can only guess the remainder but I know that there are eight areas.  </p><p>  Under the scheme a parent holds on to the record and when he or she visits a GP or goes for a hospital appointment the visits by the public health nurse and any developments are recorded.  The record is shared, comes in electronic form and provides lots of data.  People may argue that the system needs to be updated but it is a good system.</p><p>  A question was asked about the dual role of a public health nurse.  A public health nurse is assigned to a geographical area.  Did Deputy Crown ask a question?</p></speech>

Public health nurses are assigned to geographical areas and the literature states that the recommended ratio is one nurse per 2,500 people.  As I speak there are many nurses looking after between 7,000 and 10,000 people due to a colleague being on maternity leave, the moratorium or whatever.</p><p>  Let me explain the workload of a public health nurse.  She will have a clinical caseload but must also deal with child health.  Her clinical caseload will be the priority.  We argue that child health will be squeezed out of the system unless we focus on the child health part of the public health nurse's role.  I hope I have answered the Senator's question.</p><p>  Models vary and the model used here is not unique.  Most other countries have split the service into two groups, child health and adults and older people.  I hope that answers the question on health models.</p><p>  Senator Colm Burke asked a question on hospices. </p></speech>

The Senator asked if there are programmes to address the problem and I can confirm that there are national groups and strategies to address the problem.  The public health nurse is the most ideally placed to address the problem.  Some areas screen for obesity but there is no national screening programme in schools.  There has been a debate about rolling out such a scheme and the most appropriate time to do so.  The public health nurse can contribute to the scheme and she is ideally placed to enhance it.

A public health nurse is one of the first to refer a case.  Statistics show that over 47% of children referred to the child care system are referred by the public health nurse.</p><p>  The 1999 document Best Health for Children was not so much a policy document as a blueprint for screening.  There was investment in the scheme at the time because it was during the Celtic tiger years.  However, the scheme was scattered.  The parts that were implemented were really good in some places.  There are areas that still have not had the full training recommended in the report and the Deputy was right to point that out.  The report recommended a screening programme.</p><p>  I hope that I answered Deputy Catherine Byrne's question on key performance indicators.  She also mentioned women's groups.  I can reassure her that most public health nurses are aware of the women's groups.  The public health nurse is the central person in any community and links people with all care groups in a local area.</p></speech>

She has covered most of the questions on the issue.  The indicators that crop up on the HSE's routine performance monitoring system are the 48-hour visit performance; the immunisation and child development check metrics which involves the percentage uptake achieved in each of the areas around the country; and the performance and delivery of child developmental checks within the prescribed period.  The monthly performance metrics reach the management team's table where they are monitored extremely carefully and variances that emerge get escalated to the national management team.  I am aware of some particular variances that are of concern.  </p><p>  With regard to future of the service, I do not disagree with the point made by Ms O'Dowd that a task needs to be done.  As the incoming primary care director I will engage with the various stakeholders in the system, including the patients and users of the service, in order to discover the appropriate performance measures and metrics for the public health nursing service.  The ones that we use are useful and provide a good picture of how the system performs.  The performance measures are probably inadequate and not comprehensive enough so we must do more.  That will be a priority for me.  The consultation process with stakeholders in the system, including the institute, will assist in developing a more robust set of performance indicators for the public health nursing service.  </p><p>  I will briefly mention dental health and answer the question on oral dental health.  Dental health does not arise in public health nursing but forms part of the primary care dimension which has performance metrics that are monitored on a very regular basis.  The latter entails the delivery of dental checks at primary school takes place at the commencement and end of the primary school term and the follow on treatment, including orthodontics, that ensues from those oral health checks.  Children are monitored.  If there are delivery problems in local areas due to staff shortages, etc., then they are addressed in the monitoring process.  We publish the details in our monthly performance review which can be found on the HSE's website.</p><p>  I shall ask my colleague, Dr. Shannon, to comment on child health records.  A record is very important and the scheme is a great opportunity.  There have been pilot schemes in the past five to ten years and I am sure that  there will be questions on why it did not progress into a national system.  I will be happy to explore that issue as the incoming primary care director and it will be a major priority for me.  Dr. Shannon will comment more on the subject at the end of my contribution.</p><p>  Senator Crown raised the issue of numbers per head of population.  Do we have the numbers, Dr. Shannon?  </p><p><b>Dr. Michael Shannon:</b> Yes. </p></speech>

I think we have numbers per head of population, which we will publish as well.  It is probably worth noting that there are variables in regard to crude numbers in that issues of population age and deprivation indices have a significant factor on the numbers.  I think we have the numbers here and we will be able to share them.</p><p>  Ms Queally will comment on Senator Colm Burke's question on obesity and this major health issue.  I see early intervention as an important priority for the future public health nursing service, to which we are moving.</p><p>  Deputy Maloney acknowledged the value of the service and the fact it is probably taken somewhat for granted, with which I would not disagree.  As to whether the role has changed, I would disagree with that point.  The role has changed and the public health nursing service has taken a very robust role in the development of community intervention teams over the past five years.  It has been hugely proactive in the immunisation programme and in moving towards a leadership role in that process.  It is heavily involved in the clinical care programmes, which have been a significant success across the health service and which are achieving results.  I agree with the Deputy on being taken for grant but not on the change.  </p><p>  Deputy Byrne acknowledged an issue, which relates to the core issue the institute raised in regard to spectrum of service, namely, pre-natal care through to old age and whether that should be separated out to sub-specialties.  That is the key point being raised here, that is, whether we split the service or whether we devise suitable mechanisms within the service to specialise in important areas such as child health.  </p><p>  We have an oversight committee in place, addressing the transitioning of the child and family services from the HSE into the new agency.  I would be keen to refer this question for consideration and further attention.  We have new directorates commencing very shortly in areas such as primary care and health and wellness and this will be a key issue for those two directorates and an important factor in whether the programme of work for those directorates will be successful.  I acknowledge the point and the reasons for it being raised but we need to tease out some of the implications of that and I would be happy to do that with the institute and the other stakeholders in the system.  </p></speech>

In the context of the record public health nurses keep, I am in this position two years and it has struck me on visits to public health nursing services throughout the country that there is some uniformity in the record system and that there is a variety which has been developed locally to meet local needs.  Over the past year, we have commissioned, in partnership with the Institute of Community Health Nursing, a pen drive which is working in Dublin north and which is a universal system to gather data around records and information for public health nursing that will feed into the performance indicators of the HSE but, importantly, for patient care and client outcomes and, specifically, for indicators for the public health nursing service itself.  We have just evaluated that very successfully and, in consultation with Mr. John Hennessy in his new role, we will look to roll that out.</p><p>  Senator Crown asked for figures, etc.  The total public health nursing service, which excludes the student public health nurses, is 4.51 per 10,000 of population.  He asked how it compares internationally.  My colleague, Ms Mary O'Dowd, made the very valuable point that the public health nursing model here - I am very proud of the public health nursing community in this country - is very different to that in other countries, including the UK and Sweden, so it is very difficult to make comparisons because the actual function and role of public health nursing in Ireland is somewhat different from other models internationally.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-27a.455" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Martina Queally" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013062700008#K00300"><p>Senator Burke's point is well made.  The obesity issue is a very serious one facing the country.  The public health nursing role is crucial to that because many of the issues around obesity arise very early on and, indeed, prevention is much better than cure.  While there is not a formal screening programme, elements of screening are done by the public health nursing service - in terms of developmental screening - and weight measurement is one of the important parameters of that screening.  At each developmental screening from birth, the child's weight will be monitored.  Initially, the concerns would be failure to thrive or insufficient weight gain but as time goes on and as the child grows, it is monitored.  Issues such as breast-feeding, which public health nurses promote, are crucial to maintaining correct weight.  We now know from some of the evidence that babies who are breast-fed are less likely to become obese.  Weaning practices are very important in terms of weight management later on, as are early childhood nutrition and family nutrition.  All these education issues are within the remit of public health nursing, so they are crucially important.  Sometimes it is very easy to identify the things we do not prevent but if we are preventing things well, it is harder to measure.  The public health nursing role is critical to that.</p><p>  There is also the new clinical care programme around obesity.  The public health nursing role in that clinical care programme is crucial.  Their work as part of the primary care team, as Mr. John Hennessy said earlier, is critical because there are other elements to that.  Many of the dietitians in health promotion are moving across to the primary care teams.  We have some very successful programmes, such healthy food made easy, of which Deputy Byrne has been very supportive over the years, with health promotion and public health nursing.  That is a community-based nutrition and advice education programme, which has been very successful and has shown very good outcomes.</p><p>  Equally, our interventions with the broader population, such as schools, are very important because children must maintain participation and activity in order to maintain a certain weight.  Nutrition is one element but obviously physical activity is another.  Issues, such as playground markings or local sports partnerships, which the Government has supported, are crucial to maintaining a healthy active young population which grows into a healthy active adult one.  It is critical that public health nurses are part of that broader primary care team and work in that integrated way with community partners and internally with health professionals.</p></speech>

There is only so much public health nurses can do.  Is there something else we, the Department or the HSE can do to give a level of support to public health nurses to deal with this issue, even if it is providing more information?  It is a frightening problem given that 25% of children are obese at three years of age.  What is the witnesses' view on that?</p></speech>

Like other members of the committee, I acknowledge the valuable work done by public health nurses.  We have all had experience of them and all have been positive experiences.</p><p>  I hope I will not be repetitive.  I had written down a number of questions, many of which have been dealt with, so I will skip over some of them.  The ICHN's briefing document indicates something of an issue in regard to accurate data for public health nurses work in terms of child health services.</p></speech>

I pay particular tribute to public health nurses because of my experience of the public health nurses in the Dunshaughlin health centre who are outstanding.  I have had four children and they have been absolutely magnificent to me and I am now dealing with them on the issue of elder care provision.  They are second to none and, as Deputy Caoimgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in said, the relationships built are not lost.  I met the lady delegates a number of weeks ago.  As a result of that meeting, I was prompted to have a conversation with my mother and her sister on public health nurses.  Deputy Catherine Byrne touched on this point.  The reputation of public health nurses in the past was very different from my experience.  I view the public health nurse as a person with expertise who will respond to a telephone call and will come and visit someone.  I looked forward to their visit because I had at least 15 questions for them.  My mother and her sister were absolutely petrified to see a public health nurse coming to the door for a number of reasons.  They were probably much younger when they had babies than my generation was.  They did not know what they were doing.  They were probably in fear of criticism and critics, but obviously they now see the service in an entirely different way.  </p><p>  My fear about the establishment of a new child and family agency - I would like this point to be elaborated on - is that if it is established without the complete co-operation and support of the public health nurse system and not in collaboration with PHNs, it could be perceived and may well be perceived by the general public as a child protection agency, as opposed to a family agency.  We may find ourselves going back to a stage where people were fearful of the public health nurse.  We could find ourselves going back to having women and families fearful of the public health nurse coming to the front door.  That would be a significantly retrograde step.  What can this committee do to change the establishment process and bring the public health nurse into phase 1 of the establishment of the child and family agency?</p></speech>

In relation to the data to which Dr. Shannon has alluded, there are really good systems being developed within the public health nursing service.  Dr. Shannon referred to the population health information tool which was developed by a nurse, Ms Ann McDonald, who has progressed it to what we call a "digifit".  That certainly addresses the need in relation to data, if it is accepted and rolled out.  There are plans afoot to improve the data and really good data could be extracted in the use of this tool.</p><p>  I refer to children with complex needs.  Children with very complex needs are being discharged from paediatric hospitals.  They will require specialised nursing care.  Again, it favours the argument for a specialised child health nursing service.</p><p>  We are all aware that the health profile of and life expectancy among marginalised groups is much lower.  Again, there are pockets where there are really good programmes for marginalised groups.  In so far as they can do so, their needs are addressed locally.  However, there are variations.  Again, the public health nurse is the key person who is aware of the families concerned and can address some of their health issues.</p><p>  l was delighted to hear the comments on nurse-led clinics.  We are making ground in the community and the benefit for clients is that they do not have to attend hospital but can stay at home</p></speech>

There are good examples where it is working really well.  I know it is a work in progress; some work has been done, but there is a lot more to be done.  Mr. Hennessy referred to some examples of nurse-led services, with clients being able to access oncology services at home.</p><p>  Deputies Catherine Byrne and Regina Doherty referred to the relationship with the public health nurse.  That is a piece of magic which one cannot write in policy.  It takes investment in the way the relationship evolves.  The critical question concerns the new agency.  We must be creative.  The institute is quite interested in working with the HSE and the agency to see how best we can deliver child health services.  We are not included in phase 1.  We can argue why we are not a priority because it was recommended by the task force that we be a priority.  We are here to familiarise ourselves with the current issues.  We must go back to the drawing board and see how best we can deliver child health services.  It may be a mix and match that will link people between the agency and primary care services.  The debate needs to start on what will happen next.  My fear is that because we are not included in phase 1, the debate on child health services will be delayed again.</p></speech>

It will give us an opportunity to take a careful look at what is counted and reported, and at how performance is measured within the system.  There is a balance to be struck between asking people to count, report and spend their time compiling data and asking them to treat patients and deal with their priorities.  There is a role for technology in this respect.  It is clear to me and others that what we have at the moment is not an accurate or comprehensive reflection of the scale and scope of what is carried on in the school health programme.  I would like to make it more robust by adding some qualitative metrics to the crude number-crunching and number-counting that is taking place at present.  It is easy to say that, but it is more difficult to do it.  Somebody has to compile it and prepare the statistics.  There is a fine balance between deploying staff to do that and deploying them to deliver front-line care.  We have to strike that balance.  I acknowledge that we need to demonstrate performance and activity in a much more effective way than we are doing at present.  I hope to make inroads in that regard in the 2014 plan.  This process will involve engagement with the stakeholders in the system, including the institute and our own staff internally.</p><p>  I would like to respond to the important points made about the child health record.  It is a huge opportunity for parents to own and hold the child health record for their child.  It is probably the most appropriate and safest place for that record to be held.  I see an opportunity to expand on those pilot areas.  I am conscious that if this were easy, it would already be done.  Obviously, there are difficulties.  A number of technology issues are probably associated with the extension of this.  I am happy to explore it further</p><p>  The critical question of access to services for minority groups and disadvantaged groups arises in particular in the context of the issues of health care outcomes and equity and fairness in the system.  I will ask Ms Queally to tackle that issue and make some comments on this critical area.  The achievement of outcome equity as well as access equity is an important objective.  This means focusing on disadvantaged groups in the design of health care systems.  I am aware of a number of pilot projects around the country that aim to address this issue by examining how the design and delivery of the service can suit the needs of particular groups, as opposed to the vast majority.  I am well aware that Travellers, for example, can fall through the gaps in the generic delivery system.  Ms Queally might comment a little more on that.</p><p>  One of the future primary care priorities is to ensure primary care becomes a far more productive part of the bigger health system.  For practical purposes, that means moving an awful lot of activity that is currently conducted in hospitals out of that environment and into primary care centres.  I am particularly focusing on areas of diagnostics, particularly primary diagnostics such as ultrasound and endoscopy.  There is also a focus at the other end of the spectrum on chronic illness.  Significant amounts of activity in both areas can be conducted safely and appropriately in primary care settings.  It is pretty inevitable that this will increase the workload.  It is more appropriate.  In the future, it could determine whether hospitals and community settings work effectively and productively.  The objective of the exercise, as far as I am concerned as the incoming director of primary care, is to reduce the number of routine patients who turn up in acute hospitals every day and every week and transfer that activity to primary care.</p><p>  I acknowledge the good experience mentioned by Deputy Regina Doherty.  It is good to hear that she has availed of our modernised public health nursing service.  I appreciate her concern, which is shared widely, that the children and family agency may become a child protection agency only.  I acknowledge the concern that the public health nursing service may engender fear in households rather than receiving a supportive reception.  It is a hugely important point.  I will have to discuss it with my colleagues in the new department and in the HSE.  We have to ensure we avoid that risk.  I would see it as a retrograde step.  I note the Deputy's concern about this critical issue.</p><p>  Before I ask Ms Queally to speak about equity in the system and Dr. Shannon to take on the questions about obesity, it is worth repeating that the HSE and the institute have shared objectives in respect of a number of issues that have been raised today.  It is useful for us to explore the model of public health nursing and service delivery.  It is pretty clear to me that we have a shared objective in improving the health of children.  Major emerging issues such as obesity have been raised.  It is important for us to get good value for money.  The public health nursing service is an expensive service but it is also a well-qualified, well-trained and well-focused service.  It is important for us to get good value and good productivity from the resource and a good return on the investment.  I will not make any excuses in that regard.  This will be a priority for me.  It is also hugely important for us to get consistency across the country.  It is fine to have good pilot projects and models in certain areas, but we need to ensure that is applied consistently across the country.  Likewise, we need to achieve fairness in the system in terms of equitable access and equitable outcomes from the input of the entire health service but particularly the public health nursing service.</p></speech>

Since I qualified as a nurse in 1985, a great deal has changed with regard to the role of nursing, the education of nurses, how nursing fits into health care governance structures and how nursing supports the broader disciplines.  When I took up my current position two years ago, we compiled a report on the current public health nursing services - it was in our brief to do so - in partnership with key members of the public health nursing community, including our colleagues at the Institute of Community Health Nursing.  The report, which was published in 2012, outlines the current roles and governance structures within the national public health nursing teams.  Since then, I have been working closely with all the directors of public health nursing in Ireland.  We have been working on the development of a position paper to clarify the roles and functions of those who support primary health care teams and, critically, support patient care in the community.  There has been a discussion in that context on the role of a universal health care public health system, a specialised public health nursing system such as the child health care system, or other best practice international models.  When the paper is presented to me at the end of the month, we will talk to Mr. Hennessy and our colleagues about models and options for best practice in public health nursing.</p> <p> I would like to mention that what has evolved over public health nursing services over the years is that we have very competent and well-educated professionals.  These are supported now by registered general nurses, a new evolution in this country over the past number of years in the context of skill mix.  We must also ensure that we look at a national educational model for registered general nurses and the public health nurses for the future.  We will bring proposals on that to Mr. Hennessy and his colleagues in early July in the context of suggestions on best practice for the future role of public health nurses.</p><p> Members also mentioned the issue of diabetes.  In the context of nursing and the diabetes clinical care programme, we are very fortunate that we have employed quite a number of clinical nurse specialists in diabetes over the past year to support patients, both within the community and acute services.  We have a shared care model that is evolutionary and follows the patient from hospital to community or community to hospital.  The linchpin or critical point is that we now have a clinical nurse specialist in diabetes working with our public health nurses, acute hospital nurses, practice nurses and with the wider teams, such as GPs, primary health care workers, etc.  I am very confident that the shared care practice for nursing and diabetes has developed significantly over the past year.</p></speech>

The issue with regard to these sub-groups relates to quality of service and outcomes.  Some specialist programmes have been put in place to ensure Travellers, asylum seekers and others can access the services in the same way as does the mainstream population.  There is also significant peer-led education to get across the difficulty of any cultural boundaries there might be.  This is an important area for development because we do not want to see the statistics improve for the services but for the gap between the mainstream population and these sub-groups to widen.  In this regard, Mr. Hennessy referred earlier to looking at resources and how they are deployed and taking some of the social indicators into consideration in terms of deployment.</p><p>  Senator Byrne asked what the solution was to the question of obesity.  I believe we must develop a multiple strategy that is multisectoral.  The new Healthy Ireland strategy indicates that the responsibility for some health promotion activities must be shouldered by the health sector, but other sectors must also show a much greater interest in this area.  Ireland is probably good in regard to doing this because as a smaller country it is easier to build relationships between sectors.  The issue is not just related to one sector.  It is about public policy, the choices available in terms of food and the education and health sectors working together.  Our farming community and public policy on pricing are also factors.</p></speech>

I am delighted he said the gates are not closed and that he will talk again to his colleagues.  The agency will be set up this year, so, no pressure, but will Mr. Hennessy do that sooner rather than later?  Will he come back to us shortly with his thinking on that?</p></speech>
