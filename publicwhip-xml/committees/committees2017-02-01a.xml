I am accompanied by Ms Mindy O'Brien, who is a member of the Public Water Forum representing the environmental sector; and by Mr. Keith Hyland, who is a member of the forum representing domestic users.  There are 20 representatives of domestic users and 12 representatives of sectoral groups on the Public Water Forum.  The background to the structure of the forum is outlined in the documentation that has been supplied to the committee.  My involvement in the water sector began in 1998, when I chaired the National Rural Water Monitoring Committee.  During the ten years I spent in that role, the European Court of Justice found that the drinking water supplied by group water schemes in Ireland was defective.  Members of the committee will recall that the court imposed daily fines on Ireland but ultimately did not trigger them.  The monitoring committee spent ten years looking at the rural water investment programme, which involved expenditure of approximately &euro;2 billion on rural group water schemes, which supplied approximately 500,000 members at the time.</p></speech>

Arising from that experience, I began to get an understanding of the scale of this country's water supply problems, certainly in a rural context.  The group sector had become so debilitated and degraded over the years that the European Commission ruled positively and definitively against Ireland in its court ruling.  The other thing I gained from that experience was a conviction that there was a need for a national water authority.  One of the issues we were confronted with at national level during that period was the fact that the State did not have the authority at local level to implement the changes that were necessary in group schemes even though it was picking up the responsibility for the fine which had been imposed on Ireland by the European court in its adjudication.  I became and remain convinced of the need for a national authority.<br/><br/>I would like to set out the background to the Public Water Forum.  Having been asked in 2015 to chair the new forum, I was subsequently asked to work with the CER to recruit its membership.  The forum was established essentially to give a voice to the public on the issues affecting Irish water consumers.  That is the primary responsibility of the forum.  As I mentioned at the outset, there are 20 representatives of domestic users on the forum.  When we were recruiting them, we deliberately selected people who had registered with Irish Water and people who had decided against registering with Irish Water.  We tried to ensure we were not creating a community of believers among domestic users.  We have also drawn 12 sectoral representatives from a variety of consumer groups, as noted in our documentation.  The Public Water Forum has met on eight occasions since its establishment.  Our secretarial service is supplied by the CER, but we are not supported by any particular technical or other resources.  Nevertheless, we have managed to produce a number of consultation documents in response to a variety of calls issued by the CER, Irish Water, the Expert Commission on Domestic Public Water Services and this committee.<br/><br/>I wish to give the committee a sense of what the forum would like to happen as it goes forward and to set out a vision for our development.  We have been <i>in situ</i>for a year.  We have probably learned a bit about how the public voice might be better engaged when deliberations are taking place on the issues of water supply and quality.  Two statutory forums on water services are operating at present: the Public Water Forum, which I am representing here today as the chair; and the National Rural Water Services Committee, which has replaced the old National Rural Water Monitoring Committee on a statutory basis.  The Irish Water Stakeholder Forum is one of a number of other forums.  The CER has a number of such forums in place.  I suggest that if we were starting again - this might still be worth considering even through we have already started - it would be desirable in a general sense if there was just one forum that would be responsible for engaging the public in a meaningful and involved way with all matters relating to water services and water quality.  My own sense is that the water debate in Ireland needs to be looked at in the context of wider debates on climate change, environmental management, the degradation of fresh water and groundwater sources and the overall sense that water is a barometer of the environmental health of the corpus of the country in which we live.</p><p>To the extent that we protect it, we protect the wider environment.  A national forum should try to comprehend both the issue of water services and the issue of water quality.  In structure, I would like to see a new forum.  On an administrative basis this could evolve out of the existing two fora and in the first instance be established with representatives from both, and maybe some others as well.  The role of the forum as I see it would be to monitor and evaluate water supply services and the protection of the fresh water resource with reference both to the wider social, economic and environmental aspirations of the country and to the European requirements.  It would advise the Minister accordingly with regard to all initiatives under way or planned in this regard.  If we were to put in place such a structure we would need to resource it.  The entire expenditure of the public water forum last year was something in the region of &euro;30,000.  This is a very small-scale project in terms of drawing on the resources on the State.  To give it meaningful presence in the context of staffing, it would obviously need a chief executive officer.  It would also need an education and engagement specialist, who would deal with the public on consultational issues such as the river basins strategy, Irish Water's strategies, the strategy of the group water scheme and the wider debate on the protection of the environment.  This education role would partner with the universities, the institutes of technology and schools on the subject of water in the environment.  The forum would need technical expertise to support its thinking, policy development and commentary role.  It would need a role in commissioning research, either to support its own thinking or to support the development and application of new knowledge on the priorities which it selects.  Obviously it would also need a secretariat.</p><p> I am drawing here on the model which has been used in other such entities.  The one I am most familiar with is the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, which I chaired for six years.  All of the education stakeholders were involved on that council.  It had the support of a very active technical and research expertise and had a budget of approximately &euro;4.5 million per annum.  I should say by way of closure that I have begun a process of discussion with project officials on these matters.  I have a strong sense that the Minister is minded to move in a direction somewhat along the lines of what we are discussing, though of course I have not actually had any discussions with him on the matter.</p></speech>

I will be very conscious of time for questions and answers.

We appreciate the fact that they were waiting for an awfully long time.  We had a private session which ran for longer.</p> <p>  I thank Dr. Collins for his excellent presentation.  I would like to follow up on one or two things.  The first area I would like to tease out is how what he is proposing and has sketched in outline fits in with the experience in other jurisdictions.  Are there particular organisations in other jurisdictions with comparable remits which he would cite as fitting his outline neatly or as having best practice?  </p> <p>  Dr. Collins has touched initially on some of the functions and areas which he would envisage moving to this body.  It does seem to me that a very large body is being proposed with the secretariat, support services and structure mentioned.  Obviously if one puts something on the scale and size which Dr. Collins has proposed into the mix, there will be a distortion in terms of the existing regulators and groups operating within the areas.  Has he had any thoughts as to how he envisages the new forum fitting in with the current structures, particularly river basin management, the Office of Public Works and such things?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-01a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tom Collins" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FFJ2017020100002#N00400"><p>I can respond quickly.  I have visited Scotland and looked at the public water forum there.  It is a very different context though.  In Scotland the broad parameters are agreed, so the role of the forum is really one of deciding on a fair price to charge.  That is the one I have looked at most closely and it does not really resemble what I am proposing here.  I am not aware of a similar structure in any other jurisdiction.  I am drawing more on experience from the Irish context in other areas rather than from other jurisdictions in this area.</p> <p>  It is a large body but we could evolve into it.  I think this an iterative process and it will evolve over time.  It is a problem but I do not envisage the body we are suggesting as in any way encroaching, for instance, on the work of the regulator or the EPA.  They are two very significant bodies in the field.  Carving out the distinct roles for each is actually a challenge and would need to be given some more detailed thought.</p> <p>  The programme for Government also envisages the appointment of an external advisory group.  We need some clarity as to what its roles will be and where the different roles fit.  At the moment, the expert commission notes that the role of the public water forum is poorly understood.  I think there has to be a role for public consultation.  I believe this from a citizenship point of view and from a democratic point of view.  Somebody needs to carry that and to be a vehicle for the public voice as it interacts both with the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, and with Irish Water.  Whether this entity should also have that wider advisory role or not is open for debate.  My own view is that it should because it has a holistic perspective.  </p> <p>  I have specifically discussed the river basin and we would see this new forum embracing the river basin plans and the water services issue.  I do not think it would be helpful to separate them.  They interact at the front line, as the quality of water going into the tap in the first instance has been determined to some extent by what has happened in the fresh water supplies, in lakes and rivers around the country.  As part of the national rural water monitoring committee, I was involved in a project run for fresh water studies in Dundalk Institute of Technology involving the protection of a catchment area in Monaghan.  I can see enormous possibilities in these kinds of initiatives but they need to be in synergy with the needs of the supply side, not to mention with the needs of water treatment services at the other end.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-01a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1310" speakername="Colm Brophy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FFJ2017020100002#N00500"><p>Can I very briefly focus on one thing?</p><p>At the heart of it, what Dr. Collins is saying is that the Public Water Forum's key priority area is in regard to the supervisory voice or input voice into the Ervia-Irish Water decision.  We are all aware of the bad mistakes Ervia and Irish Water have made and the poor management in certain areas.  I presume what the Public Water Forum is looking for is the ability of an authority to clearly voice public concern at that point, as a first step.  The other things Dr. Collins has alluded to would be a building-on stage for the authority as it would grow in size, budget and stature.  Obviously, that key initial role is the ability to interact on behalf of the public when Ervia goes off the tracks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-01a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tom Collins" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FFJ2017020100002#O00200"><p>That is a necessary if not a sufficient condition.  The consumer - the citizen - needs a voice but the forum needs to be able to interact directly with the public on these matters.  It needs to be out there, hearing what the public position is and relaying that.  It is not merely a conduit, however.  There is also a feeding of the public debate and of introducing the experience from abroad, as well as introducing the wider issues regarding the factors that are impacting on water quality at source.  Consumers need to have a sene of this.  I believe they need to know this in order that the citizens can themselves become environmental managers, whether they are schoolchildren, parents in schools, farmers or otherwise.  Ms O'Brien has a lot of experience in this field.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-01a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mindy O'Brien" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FFJ2017020100002#O00300"><p>We need to look at this in a holistic manner.  What we are drinking out of the tap is coming from the source water and we have to protect that source water.  We have to get our people out in the areas to understand that.  The problem with Irish Water was that it was a diktat and people were told what to do - they had to pay.  They did not feel part of it, they did not feel engaged and they did not feel ownership of the water.  People need to have that sort of ownership and guardianship over water and source water protection.  By creating this Public Water Forum with a grander remit than Irish Water, and one that reaches over the whole water resource, this can feed into the Government approach.  Right now, the Government has many different Departments handling water, including the Departments of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the OPW, which deals with flooding, the fisheries bodies, the local authorities and the ESB, with all of them dealing with the one resource.  To have just one organisation could unify the communication so there would be a holistic approach to water protection.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-01a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1325" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FFJ2017020100002#O00400"><p>I thank the witnesses and join in the apology regarding the delay.  I want to tease out a little further the question of the role of the Public Water Forum in regard to the public.  The witnesses might share my view that there is not a lot of wide public knowledge of what the forum does, and they might be able to answer as to what can be done about that.  Do they feel there should be public deliberations?  How could there be better transparency, given one of the issues we are supposed to look at today is public engagement and transparency?  How could the Public Water Forum provide more of that?  Obviously, one way is to give the forum at least a secretariat so it can do the work it is tasked to do.</p> <p>  Our role is to look at the future funding of domestic water services.  Perhaps the witnesses do not discuss this as a group, but do they have a view in regard to how water should be funded, particularly in view of the wider role Dr. Collins and Ms O'Brien indicated in regard to protecting the environment, security of clean supply, safe removal of wastewater without damaging our rivers and so on?  Do they have a view as to whether funding should be, for example, through ring-fenced general taxation or otherwise?</p> <p>  On a question to the regulator or to Irish Water, given the fact there is an Irish Water national stakeholders forum, as well the Public Water Forum, should there be some kind of rationalisation in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-01a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tom Collins" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FFJ2017020100002#O00500"><p>With regard to the role, I agree the forum does not have a huge profile and we have not sought that, although we are beginning to do so.  It is such a deeply contested area that, as a forum, we ourselves needed to engage in the interrogation of positions.  We have 20 representatives from among domestic consumers.  As I mentioned at the outset, people had to apply to be members but those 20 do not represent anybody in that sense.  That is probably a weakness in the structure.  There would be some value if the domestic consumers were reporting in to a wider constituency, whatever that constituency is.  Of that group, at the time about one third had not registered with Irish Water, so we are sure about one third of the membership are not registered, which means we had a mixed position.  I believe we need to engage much more actively now at local level, where there is an amount of interest.  There is obviously a huge level of interest in the wider issue of water in Ireland.  Where it comes home is on issues where there is a failure in the system, such as in regard to boil water notices and lead in pipes - in other words, if the thing is not working, people become animated by it.</p> <p>  I personally believe the best way we can become involved is in a wider public education role.  We could become involved with schools and the community sector and we can partner with the various water groups in the NGO sector, which have become very active.  That is a strategy that waits to be developed and is one that requires resources, as the Deputy said.  A new forum needs to ensure that the public is actively inserted in the debate as water affects them, however it affects them.  There will be many other contentious areas in water once the domestic water issue is resolved.  For example, there are 500 different tariffs in non-domestic charges and we are about to look at these.  I could see us actively involving ourselves with the Irish tourism sector, the farming sector, the ICT sector and the food industry in exploring with them how the water resource impacts on their plans.</p> <p>  Regarding the future funding of domestic water services, we accepted the report of the expert commission.  We took the view that water begins as a public service, that there is a citizen entitlement around water and that the issue of affordability should never interfere with a person's right to water.  That is the forum's position.  The only other point I will make on funding is that the debate on the funding of domestic water has struck me on a personal level as being about a relatively minor part of the total cost structure.  When water charges were suspended some months back, although Mr. Grant may correct me on the figure, I believe &euro;232 million was the projected figure for domestic charges at that time.  In 2014 Irish consumers spent &euro;215 million on bottled water, and they got 25 litres per head for it and spent &euro;47 per head on it.  If Irish Water was charging for water at that rate, we would certainly have funded the domestic water bill issue.</p><p>My point is that, clearly, we have gone for the general taxation route on the basis that the expert commission examined that route and decided it was its preferred one.  We can see arguments for both, but saw no reason to second guess the expert commission.</p></speech>

I am conscious of time but since you asked the question the representatives of the regulator and-or Irish Water can make a brief comment if they wish.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-01a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Paul McGowan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FFJ2017020100002#P00300"><p>First, we welcome the establishment of the Public Water Forum and obviously we worked with the chairman, Dr. Tom Collins, on its establishment.  It represents the voice of the consumer and our role in everything we do as an economic regulator is to act in the public interest.  Getting that consumer voice is key to us being able to undertake our function.  We provide secretariat support and funding to the Public Water Forum in its current structure.  It is important to recognise that our focus in on ensuring that Irish Water delivers customer service to its customers.  We set the minimum standards for that, so we must engage with consumers to understand what they should be.  We also hold Irish Water to account, along with the EPA, particularly from an economic perspective in terms of its ability to deliver service quality improvements whether it is in the water or the wastewater services it delivers.  That is the performance assessment framework I have spoken about on previous occasions.  Finally, it is about holding Irish Water to account to deliver all of this efficiently at the minimum cost.</p> <p>  In all of that process we have reason to engage with consumers or consumer representative bodies at different levels of detail, be it through public consultation or hearing the voice of the consumer through the Public Water Forum.  For example, we publish our documents for public consultation, so we may hear the voice of the consumer through different routes.  The point is that different groups interact with us on different aspects of the work we do, at a considerable level of detail on very narrow matters or on much broader issues.  We have had a consumer consultative group over the last number of years across our energy and water functions which allows non-governmental organisations, NGOs, that have a particular interest, whether it is representing people with disability, the voluntary sector or the environmental pillar, to engage with us so we can give them briefings to enable them to respond to our public consultations.  We are aware of the need for a continued diversity of means by which we access the public voice.  At the same time, we believe the Public Water Forum has a very important role to play in representing the voice of the consumer.  Dr. Collins has alluded to a potentially wider role but that is a matter for discussion between the PWF and the Government.  Under legislation our focus is on regulating Irish Water, so our engagement with the Public Water Forum is in respect of our statutory functions and the statutory functions of Irish Water.</p></speech>

The role of the Public Water Forum as outlined by Dr. Collins could be very valuable in terms of catchment management.  It must be emphasised that the quality and safety of drinking water can be hugely influenced by what people do in the catchment.  Pesticides are a very good example.  We can deal with that either by controlling them or we can try to retrofit a very expensive treatment into our plants.  That is an important point.</p> <p>  On Deputy O'Sullivan's point, we established a cross-sectoral forum for bouncing ideas.  That has been very useful.  It is quite specific.  It includes people from agriculture, various commercial sectors, NGOs and so forth.  It has been useful for bouncing ideas and plans.  That said, we will not duplicate anything that exists.  I believe those involved have found it useful for communicating around fairly narrower issues.</p></speech>

On his comment about the water charges of &euro;232 million, the actual cost of domestic water is significantly higher.  It was set at a deliberately low price to try to entice people to pay for it, so it is not really reflective of the actual cost.  If water charges had been accepted, they would have increased significantly over the coming years.</p> <p>  The regulation that established the Public Water Forum in 2015 stated that members of the forum had to be registered customers of Irish Water.  That was subsequently amended and the witness alluded to that in his presentation.  I take it that it was Dr. Collins's point of view that it should be amended.  Obviously the Government's view was that it had to be registered customers.  Will he expand a little on that process?</p></speech>

I am trying to recall it.  When the forum was being established I was very keen for it to have as broad a representation as we could manage.  To be honest, I had forgotten that non-registered users were excluded, but I never encountered any opposition to including unregistered users in the group.  I was very clear that they had to be included as otherwise it would simply be people from one side talking to themselves.  Keith Hyland might wish to comment.</p></speech>

It probably takes up a full day between preparation, the meeting, thinking about it afterwards and digesting any reading one might wish to do.  It is time I am very willing to give.  It is fascinating.  I came to it with a particular point of view on the issue, but through education, experience and listening to the CER, Irish Water and other people who have spoken to us my view is changing and evolving.  I believe I have a good role on the forum and I am delighted to be able to contribute.</p></speech>

Dr. Collins said that at this stage the forum has not carried out much engagement with the wider public.  Is there a plan to roll that out further to develop awareness?  I note that all the meetings are held in Dublin.  If there is a plan to reach out into the regions it might help to build awareness of the work of the forum.</p></speech>

We have gone for Dublin because of the transport links but I see an absolute value in moving out.  We have a commitment to beginning to engage with the public, but we must do two things on that.</p><p>We need to find a theme about which the public will get animated and we would like to see the charges issue dealt with before we can move into the next one.  We also need personnel to do it.  As we speak, we are in the process of making two appointments.  One is for an executive to give, in a sense, executive leadership to the forum.  The other appointment is for an education and engagement specialist.  We will be appointing somebody.  We have agreement in principle from the Department for those two appointments.</p></speech>

I repeat  the apologies for the delay earlier.  I appreciate that it was probably difficult for the witnesses sitting outside, but it was much more difficult in here.  The witnesses probably had the better location for the time.  I wish to make a couple of general points and I also have some questions.  I believe the Public Water Forum is a good idea but, through no fault of its own, it has fallen victim to the broader political and policy arguments we have been having around water policy for the last while.  There are two issues.  The first is around the term "consumers".  I always get nervous when we talk about consumers in the context of water because part of the disagreement is that when one starts to commodify something such as water and refer to people as consumers, it does change the relationship between the user of that service and the service itself.  We do not speak of consumers in education or health; we talk about parents, patients or children.  I know that is not the language used by the Public Water Forum water, which chooses its language very carefully, but it is important to acknowledge that it is not just an accidental choice of word.  In the context of citizens&rsquo; engagement it is very important that we are talking about people, families, households and the person as the user of something, not as a market consumer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-01a.50" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tom Collins" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FFJ2017020100002#Q00400"><p>I agree.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-01a.51" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FFJ2017020100002#Q00500"><p>The other issue is around the representing of the voice of the consumer or the user.  Of course, they do not have a voice or a single voice as there are a variety of different views out there.  For me, the real value of the forum is if it becomes a facilitator for all those different voices to get access to the information they need and have that voice, which is something the Public Water Forum has not been able to do up to this point.  Again, this may have been through no fault of its own.  I would be interested to hear the witnesses&rsquo; ideas, beyond what they have said already, on how that voice can be brought to bear with the high level advocacy and education activities that Dr. Collins has spoken of and in the day-to-day issues.  Members of the Houses receive many complaints, and I am sure the other members of this committee would emphasise the same point, that for all of the faults of the old system - and I am not arguing for a return to the old system of delivery of water services - there was at least a local point of connection when it was council staff and elected council members to engage face-to-face with people about concerns around delivery of water services.  That is not there anymore.  Dr. Collins spoke of the higher levels of education and advocacy, which is really important, but we must also consider the people who are accessing water in their communities.  How do we involve those people? Is it through the public participation networks in the local authorities or through some other mechanism?</p> <p>   My other point is relevant to all three groups here today.  The expert group recommends four actions.  I am interested to hear if the Public Water Forum agrees with each of those actions, how the witnesses believe they could be actioned and if having more direct public involvement and greater access to information from the water utilities is a good thing.  The actions are all eminently sensible, even for those of us who are strong critics of Irish Water &ndash; and Mr. Grant knows all about that.  If this committee is going to make recommendations on how to implement those four key actions we would welcome hearing any thoughts, ideas or suggestions the witnesses have on those. The summary recommendations of the actions are listed on page two of the report and that is part of what this committee is trying to deal with. </p></speech>

The forum has had a lot of debate on language and has consistently argued against the use of the word &ldquo;customer&rdquo; in terms of water users, on the basis of our philosophical position which is that, as citizens, we have a citizens&rsquo; entitlement and that access to water should not be based on marketplace capability.  I believe that there would nearly be consensus in the forum on that issue, regardless of where people were coming at it from.  I accept that language is always important and the language being used here does mean something.</p> <p>  On engaging the voice of the public at local level I certainly believe there are opportunities there through the existing structure such as the public participation with the local authorities and I would also consider structures such as the citizen information centres and a variety of other public information venues at local level.  The problem is that our forum has not utilised those kinds of structures up to this point, but it probably should do and probably needs to look at doing so and engaging proactively with people who have direct upfront face-to-face interaction.  Part of this debate relates to people's capacity to access information.  Obviously, people who are uncomfortable with information technology or who may have certain disabilities or who are otherwise locally confined will have greater needs in this area than other people.  These are possibly the people on whom we should be proofing all our work.  I will take on board Deputy &Oacute; Broin&rsquo;s point and bring it back to the forum to see how it can engage more effectively.  I now invite Ms O&rsquo;Brien to address the committee as she has some further ideas on engaging with the NGO sector, on the same point.  I will then come back in on the issue of the four recommended actions.</p></speech>

There is the Local Authorities Water and Communities Office, LAWCO, that was developed under the EPA and the local authorities for the river basin catchment areas.  One can also consider The Rivers&rsquo; Trust and StreamScapes who are existing groups out there.  During the roll out of Saorview I know that the Wheel was very involved in getting in to the local communities and engaging existing communities.  That might also be an avenue to tap in to existing groups.</p> <p> With regard to open access data, I am a member of SWAN, the sustainable water network, and we had a think day on how we could approach this.  We asked: If we are not going to use them for charging purposes then how we can use the existing meters that are in place?  We asked if they could be used for information gathering.  Not only do they track leakages they also allow consumers to see what amounts they are consuming, so even if they are not charged for what they are using they can see what they are using compared to their neighbours.  This could be an education process.  The meter could also potentially be used to create a pilot programme for research to see what type of measures would encourage a reduction in consumption.  That could be done through meters and existing communities.  The meters could be used for other purposes and the committee may be able to tap into that. </p></speech>

The first time I saw Dr. Collins was on television at the height of this and his presentation and contributions today reinforce the view I held then - and that I still hold - that if the process of water metering had started with him then we might have ended up in a completely different place.  Dr. Collins has come across as a trustworthy voice.  I have two or three questions to ask but first I must refer to a number of things that Dr. Collins said that really made an impact on me.  One of the phrases he used was that water is a great barometer of the health of the nation, but also of the health of the nation's land.</p><p>If we had started at this point and had taken our time, leading in with the education aspect for a few years, we would not have ended up with people educated about Garda powers, the fabrication of water meters and what they are or are not made of, and what are the rights of individuals as protesters.</p></speech>

I insist on it now.  He has extended the meetings and we made our points earlier.  I really want to make my point and I am the only member of my group who is contributing.  These are important issues.  If the process had started with education, people like me, who favoured the idea of metering, until a hames was made of it, would not be here in the committee.</p> <p>  I compliment Dr. Collins on running his outfit on &euro;30,000.  The Public Water Forum's ability to take on board everybody's views is vital.  I cannot stress the educational function enough.  Many people do not realise what happens to a drop of water from the moment it drops from the sky to the moment it comes into their taps.</p></speech>

Dr. Collins mentioned &euro;215 million being spent on bottled water.  As a student in France at the age of 14, I found it hilarious that French people drank bottled water.  What caused the shift among Irish people towards the consumption of bottled water?  Dr. Collins's point was hinting that although we were not prepared to pay water charges, look how much we pay for bottled water.  Why do we use bottled water?  When I was a kid, one filled a bottle with water and brought it somewhere.  What does that say?</p> <p>  Dr. Collins said the forum had discussions with a Minister.  Which Minister has the forum discussed it with?</p></speech>

In the confidence and supply agreement that underpins the Government, there is a commitment to establish an external advisory body on a statutory basis to build public confidence in Irish Water.  How does Dr. Collins see the role of the Public Water Forum in the future with the establishment of the external advisory body and the commitment that legislation is forthcoming on it later this year?  Does he think the Public Water Forum and the external advisory body can complement each other or does he have any concerns about duplication?</p><p>The expert commission's report, which is the basis of our work here predominantly, stated the Public Water Forum should be extended.  I admire the work it does on &euro;30,000 per annum.  Has Dr. Collins a figure in mind for the increase he would need to expand its role?  I had to do some research about the Public Water Forum.  Even as a public representative, I was not very <i>au fait</i>with its work.  There would be merit in the marketing element and looking to expand this work.  There is much valuable work and input the Public Water Forum could have in making us aware that the activity we do around our water courses impacts directly down and how it is all interlinked.  When we talk about water and water charges, the constant rebuke we get from people of a certain view is that water is free because it falls from the sky.  However, we are talking about treated water, which is a very different matter and which involves a very significant cost.</p></speech>

From the forum's point of view, it is not clear to us where the CER's role begins and the external advisory body's ends.  Duplication in this field is an issue and this is part of the reason we are working on the notion of a national forum which would replace some of the existing consultative mechanisms.  We have extended, submitted and got approval for a budget of &euro;170,000 this year.  This will allow us to move on the appointment of both a manager or chief executive and an education person.  It is very clear to me, both from the expert commission's work and from this conversation, that we need to build the forum into the wider community and into constituencies which we have not gone into just yet.  The 12 sectoral groups are all there representing their sectors in the forum.  They represent the position of whichever sector they are holding.  We are deficient in engagement with the wider, non-affiliated public and we need to work on it.</p> <p>  The forum will consider taking on the consultation that is required of the country around river basin management plans.  We are developing the term Ms O'Brien used, a "holistic perspective" on things.  Local consultation will be a requirement.  There will be a requirement for consultation with local users in the river basins, whether they be farmers, tourism operators or fisher-people.  They are all stakeholders.  Somebody will have to take on the task of engaging directly with those users, and this national forum, with an eye on what is coming out of the tap at the other end, is probably the best placed vehicle through which to do it.</p></speech>

Obviously the Public Water Forum has to be independent and to be seen to be independent both of Government and Irish Water.  Is there a need for a legally independent source of funding for that organisation?</p> <p>  Mr. O'Brien mentioned the possibility of using local authorities as contact bodies locally.  Is he aware that local authorities are prevented from dealing with questions about Irish Water from the public at the moment, by instruction of Irish Water?</p> <p>  My other questions are for Irish Water.  Mr. Grant told us on 12 January 2017 that the water metering programme would stop yesterday, 31 January.  Can he confirm that it has stopped and that contractors have been instructed to stop installing meters as of yesterday?</p> <p>  With regard to public engagement, I am very clear that in my experience and the experience of the vast majority of my constituency is that there is a complete lack of engagement, indeed a culture of disengagement, from Irish Water with water users generally.  Why, for instance, does Irish Water not have local offices where the public can engage with the company, or at least local officials with whom the public could engage?  When a pipe bursts and there is a disruption to supply, why are the public not notified as they would have been in the past by local authorities by way of radio advertisements, leaflet drops or other means?  Currently the only engagement is by notification on a website.  Other than that water users and householders are in the dark.  In relation to planned maintenance, other entities such as ESB would notify their customers in advance.  Why would Irish Water not use something like this?</p> <p>  Will Mr. Grant tell us why Irish Water is cutting off supply to premises without notice?  Why is it cutting off supply anyway, and why is it being done without notice?  Very recently in Clonmel, water users were left for between nine hours and two days when supply was switched off without any notice.  It was not the first time, and indeed the local service engineer said he had made an official complaint to Irish Water on behalf of the people affected and on behalf of the county council.  Why would Irish Water not put in place local offices or local officials through which or whom water users could make contact directly with Irish Water about all the issues arising.</p></speech>

I would like to make the point that our call centre handled 700,000 calls last year from the members of the public in connection with the work we do.  A reason that people suffer shortage or loss of supply is because 80% of all the interventions in the network we make at the moment are unplanned interventions.  In other words, they are failures.  We have to get to a point in this country where our system is 80% planned and 20% unplanned.</p></speech>

The question I asked was why Irish Water does not make available local offices or local officials where water users can contact Irish Water when these issues arise.  The call centre is not fit for purpose in my view, and that is the view of many people I speak to and many constituents who have come to me.  There is, in my view, little or no engagement with water users by Irish Water, and that is the question.  I accept that there are burst pipes.  We all know that.  In the past, local authorities would have radio advertisements, they would drop leaflets and they would engage with people.</p></speech>

We do all the things we are talking about here.  We do radio communications and leaflet drops in relation to boil water notices.  There is one compelling reason having an effective call centre connected with operations works really well in the medium and long term, and in the short term when everybody plays their part, and that is that all the information is captured, fed back into the system and used.  We decide on our mains replacement programme on the basis of frequency of bursts.  We decide on our interventions and our programmes of work based on precisely the data we collect through the call centre.  It is a really effective way of doing it.  It breaks down when some part of the chain does not work.  I absolutely accept that this is a work in progress.  We had 10,000 calls last year from elected representatives alone, and I get a lot of very positive feedback on that.  I am not complacent and I fully accept that we have a way to go.</p></speech>

In the non-domestic sector there is provision for cutting off supply for failure to pay.  That happens from time to time, and it happened under the local authorities.  It still happens.  We are very slow to do it.  I cannot reference any specific circumstances.  Domestic users are never cut off.</p></speech>

They are providing a valuable public service in terms of what they have outlined to the committee.</p> <p>  The public forum is required to advocate on behalf of consumers and I am sure that technical assistance sometimes is required.  How can the forum access such technical assistance?  Is that resource available to the forum?  When one is dealing with the likes of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, Irish Water or the Department of Health, one must have technical resources available to one.  </p> <p>  My second question relates to public engagement as it relates to both the public forum and Irish Water itself.  Public engagement should be about building trust and transparency and ensuring that the reputation of the national utility is intact.  Obviously, some damage was done to that reputation in the past.  Where infrastructural improvements are made to our public water system, for example, through a lead pipe replacement programme in a town or village or where pollution or leakage issues are resolved, is that reported back to the forum and to the public?  That should be done if we want to build trust and improve the reputation of Irish Water.  A lot of very good work is being done by Irish Water.  It is making a lot of good investments and resolving a lot of problems that have been extant for years, particularly in terms of pollution and substandard infrastructure.  Unfortunately, however, the message is not getting out about that.  As I understand it, Irish Water now has a modern asset management system in place.  Every pipe in the ground, water source, wastewater treatment plant and so on is now recorded, with a maintenance plan and schedule made out for each part.  That information should be supplied to both the forum and the public.  Is there a reporting mechanism in place in that regard?</p> <p>  I now wish to focus on the issue of a customer charter in Irish Water.  I presume, as with any utility, that a customer charter is in place in Irish Water.  How was that developed?  Was there an input from the public forum?  I understand that the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, has a role in terms of approving the charter but I ask the witnesses to confirm if that is the case.  How does the charter compare with other well established utilities in Ireland in terms of performance indicators, compensation in the event of commitments not being met and so forth?  How does the customer charter for Irish Water compare with the charters of other utilities?  </p> <p>  The contact centre was mentioned and I have had very positive feedback regarding how Irish Water is now engaging with the public.  There were teething problems in the beginning but I know from speaking to colleagues in the Oireachtas that there is now a very good two-way communication system available to Oireachtas Members when problems arise with regard to Irish Water.  If Oireachtas Members are honest, they will acknowledge that.</p> <p>  The expert commission report which this committee is currently considering refers to normal usage and this is going to be one of the key points with which this committee must deal.  The report suggests that normal usage of public water should be paid for by general taxation.  I ask all the witnesses to outline whether they have had an opportunity to consider what "normal usage" might mean.  If they have not, why not?  Is this question something that they might consider into the future?  This committee will have to take advice from the very witnesses in front of us on how to define "normal usage".  That will be the crux of our work.  I look forward to hearing the views of the witnesses on that issue.</p></speech>

That said, it is very important to flag it to the CER and ask that the commission revert to the committee with information on that issue.  It will be critical for us in our deliberations.  Is that acceptable to Senator Coffey?  In that way, we are giving the CER the opportunity to work that out for us.</p></speech>

The first one relates to an earlier question posed by Deputy Seamus Healy about how the public forum is funded and how its funding is organised.  Funding is organised through the CER at the moment.  We have a budget for this year of approximately &euro;180,000, which has been approved by the CER.  We made three requests for technical support since the foundation of the forum, all of which were processed through the CER's own procurement system.  The first request related to recruitment and publicity support when the forum began in autumn 2015.  The second request was for technical support for the establishment and maintenance of the website.  The third request was for technical support for policy analysis.  Where we require technical support, we request it via the procurement system of the CER.  Once the forum evolves and matures - it has some way to go in that regard - it would be better if it operated more independently.  Independence is key, not only in the sense of being independent but also that the forum appears to be independent.  The perception of independence is as important as the reality.  From that point of view, ultimately one would like it to evolve and become a statutory body with its own direct line of funding.  There is no debate on that issue at the moment, however.</p> <p>  I agree with Senator Coffey's overall point about building trust.  Certainly trust has been one of the victims in much of the debate over the last couple of years.  We do not have formal reporting mechanisms such as those suggested by the Senator whereby Irish Water reports to the forum on progress made.  However, we have found our engagement with Irish Water to be entirely positive.  We have, for example, asked to be involved with various presentations by Irish Water and have always received a positive response.  The notion of a coherent body engaged in trust building is important but the forum is not an agent of Irish Water or of any other State body.  It is a vehicle for the public voice and maintaining that public voice is important.  If that voice is a critical one, that makes it even more important at times.  I see trust as being built not on marketing but on informed public debate, education and the capacity to take different positions from bodies that may have a particular axe to grind, so to speak.  I do not think it is necessarily in the interests of the forum to be particularly close to any of the bodies in the landscape in which it is operating because independence is absolutely key.  </p> <p>  I think I have dealt with the main questions posed by the Senator.</p></speech>

Our sense is that rather than defining a level of usage and saying that it is reasonable, we should look retrospectively at what has been used and instead of using the word "normal", it might be better to use the word "average".  We would need to determine the average usage, per person, aggregated to household, on some method of self-declaration.  If we can agree that figure - there are already figures in the public domain to that effect - then we can decide that a charge could kick in at some percentile above the average usage-----</p></speech>

Irish Water is not reporting progress to the public forum and I can understand that because the bodies do not want to be too close.

We are measuring them and reporting to the CER with regard to them.  The same thing applies to the customer charter.  I am happy for the officials from the CER to comment on these matters.  The customer charter is very challenging.  We have to comply with many strong metrics and report against them.  The information in question is available.  We will take every opportunity that is available to us to communicate the achievements on a year-by-year or any other basis.</p></speech>

Senator Coffey asked how we developed it.  Obviously, we have been regulating energy and gas supply companies.  In 2014, we developed a customer handbook, which imposes 353 requirements on Irish Water.  We monitor its compliance with those requirements.  As a subset of that, we have identified nine customer charter areas as key requirements.  One of them involves giving vulnerable or priority customers notice in advance of a planned outage or in the event of an unplanned outage.  One would expect these key requirements to be in place.  An automatic penalty is imposed on Irish Water if it breaches one of the nine basic customer commitments.  We produced an information note with respect to that recently.  Eighty-four charter payments were made throughout 2016.  We monitor how Irish Water deals with complaints and publish information in that respect.  All of this is in the public domain.  We have an independent dispute mechanism to assist Irish Water customers who are not satisfied with the service they received or how they were dealt with.  Irish Water accepts that the determination we make after we have looked at a complaint is final.  This means that people who are not satisfied with Irish Water have somewhere to go.  It is important to outline that the information in the documents we published when we looked at how Irish Water performed and what it achieved between 2014 and 2016 is in the public domain.  We accept that more needs to be out there about it.</p></speech>

I would like to focus on one of the expert commission's four recommendations in the area of public engagement and transparency.  It recommended that "an EPA administered research budget on water management and conservation is necessary and should be put in place".  My question relates to the CER's engagement with the forum, which may have happened on instruction or may have been undertaken participatively.  Has the CER undertaken international research on the effectiveness of public awareness campaigns in curtailing water consumption?  I am asking about research that may have been done not just since the expert commission produced its report but since the inception of the CER and the start of its engagement with this forum.</p> <p>  Will the CER play a part in reviewing whether there should be an open data role for Irish Water?</p> <p>  We were led to believe that 300,000 homes were never going to be metered because of technical issues associated with their locations, for example in apartment blocks.  It is not possible to access some homes in this way by virtue of the period in which they were built.  Has the CER discussed a review mechanism with the forum to allow for water conservation in those homes?  If that could be done effectively, perhaps it could be continued into the future.  I remind the witnesses that the expert commission recommended that there should be "district metering" rather than individual metering.  Maybe this is something that could be brought to bear in the forum.</p> <p>  Has the CER explored means of water conservation other than the charging mechanism that dominated the debate and was almost rammed down the throats of consumers as the only form of conservation?  What other form of water conservation has the CER engaged with in recent times?  I remind Mr. McGowan that this committee is responsible for making recommendations for a solution and bringing them to the D&aacute;il for agreement.  Has the CER looked at the harvesting of rainwater as a possible conservation method as it engages with the public about bringing water conservation to the forefront and leaving water charges in the background?</p></speech>

We have said in the past that we will always have premises that are unmetered because they cannot be accessed for technical reasons.  We did not get around to looking at those specific premises when we were delivering the first phase of the metering programme, which targeted the original 80% of premises.  We had flagged that we would have to look at the parameters for future phases of metering and how we might access this cohort of premises.  We have not initiated any particular work in that regard.</p></speech>

The CER is a member of WAREG, which is a body of water regulators across Europe.  We gather experience about research that has been undertaken elsewhere through WAREG and then determine what might be done in Ireland.  In our first price control, we gave Irish Water a research and innovation fund to enable it to approach us with ideas for our consideration regarding innovation and research projects that could be undertaken.  We have carried this into our second price control.  We have set aside a &euro;4 million fund specifically to allow innovation and research projects to be initiated.

I will briefly go through the main points of the submission, but before doing so I will introduce my colleagues.  Ms Orla Hegarty is a lecturer in UCD on architecture.  Her expertise is in the construction industry and its regulatory environment.  Mr. Mel Reynolds is an architect.  He is self-employed and works in private practice.  His expertise is in property development, building regulations and standards, all of which are pertinent to the issue we are here to discuss.<br/><br/>I will outline briefly why this issue is very important.  I will also outline the obstacles in resolving the difficulties, as we perceive them, and some possible solutions, which is probably the most important aspect.<br/><br/>To put the matter in context, out of over 198,000 houses, there are probably 98,000 vacant, which is too many in a total housing stock of 2.022 million units.  Contrary to popular belief, not all of these units are in what we might call the wrong places, in other words, places where people do not want to live or where there is no employment.  There is a lot of vacant land, as well as many underused spaces and vacant houses, in areas in which there is a high demand for housing and places in which there are employment opportunities.  It will be interesting to see the vacant sites register.  It is our understanding a lot of vacant land in Dublin city is owned by Dublin City Council.  To me, it is an issue if the State is one of the main owners of underused land and property.  We need more productive use to be made of existing housing stock and land, or what we call &quot;low hanging fruit&quot;.  That is one of the things we could do immediately to break the current impasse in housing supply.<br/><br/>Why is resolving the issue of vacant derelict sites and underused spaces so important?  First, the numbers are very high.  One would expect the rate of vacant housing to be between 4% and 5% of the housing stock every year owing to the number houses of being sold, subject to probate or the fact that people are just not living in them.  In  Ireland there is a vacancy rate of nearly 10%, a surprisingly high percentage. <br/><br/>Dublin City Council has identified more than 60 ha of derelict land in its bailiwick.  Last December the <i>Dublin Inquirer </i>newspaper carried out a survey of vacant sites, lands and buildings.  It was only able to identify the owners of 179 properties, a high proportion of which, 88, were in the ownership of Dublin City Council.  I was surprised by the result.  <br/><br/>Good planning and sustainability are other good reasons to resolve the issue.  We must use resources in a sustainable fashion.  Therefore, the use of underused spaces, derelict sites and vacant housing should be maximised.  The stock of vacant housing holds great potential as a tool to be used in regeneration, not just in urban areas but also in rural towns.  This issue is on the agenda of the Government and politicians.  For us, it is a no-brainer. <br/><br/>It is important to note that we are not building as many houses as we think we are.</p><p>Many of the houses built will be three-bedroomed, semi-detached units and these will only meet a small proportion of housing demand.  Changing demographics mean that there is a greater need for much smaller units and our existing stock can help plug that gap.  Without actually having to build something, there are a lot of ways to use our existing underused spaces and houses to provide housing that is suitable for the broader spectrum of housing need we have compared to 30 or 40 years ago.<br/><br/>Another reason that this is so important is that we are not building half as many houses as we think.  The Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is being a little economical with the <i>actualit&eacute;</i>as about half of what it calls &quot;housing completions&quot; involves existing stock being counted as new housing.  We did not build 12,666 new houses in 2015, we probably built approximately 7,000.  Last year, we did not build 15,000 houses.  It was probably just over 8,000.  Existing stock that has come back on the market is being included.  It is vacant properties owned by NAMA and ghost estates.  If they are vacant for more than two years, they will require a new ESB connection, which is a measure the Department uses to measure new builds.  That artificially inflates the house completion numbers.  The problem is that Government policy and private sector investment decisions can be made on the basis of these artificially inflated figures.  Due to the fact that we are not building as many houses as we think, it is important to use what we have.<br/><br/>When the construction sector starts to take off, we will have a skills issue to confront.  A lot of people have emigrated.  In the Dublin Institute of Technology, we have closed down apprenticeship courses.  We are not the only one and there will be a shortage of apprentices and skilled people in the industry when it gets back up and running.  This will take years to address.  House-building can stop in a matter of weeks, but it takes years for it to get back up and running again and involves a great deal of strategy and planning.  In the meantime, what does one do?  Not everybody can park in the rental sector.<br/><br/>Obstacles to reusing and maximising the use of vacant housing, derelict sites and underused spaces include identifying owners.  It is a particular issue in the context of land.  The CSO has this problem also.  It is very difficult to manage properties when we cannot even find out who owns them.  Raising finance is a bit of an issue for those who own land and we have to acknowledge that.  Not everyone who is sitting on land is doing so out of avarice or a desire to see the value inflate.  Sometimes, they just cannot get finance to develop it.<br/><br/>There is a lack of any meaningful incentive to develop and to move land onto the market.  John McCartney, the director of research in Savills, has shown that if house prices rise by 10%, the value of the underlying land rises by 35%.  Where is the incentive there to shift one's land onto the market or to develop it?  Land hoarding could also be an issue, as such.  Conscious that I am in Leinster House saying this, I perceive a lack of political will to do something about this matter.  The first-time buyers' grant and things like that put everything onto building rather than reusing our own stock.  If one talks to the market, the expectation is that the way to make a profit is to flip land.  It is land transactions as the value of land increases.  Why would one bother to develop anything when one can make good money by simply selling the land on, with the planning permission attached, at a higher price?  All the change in standards to reduce apartment sizes did was increase the value of land without any meaningful increase in new apartments.<br/><br/>There is a huge issue with the regulatory costs associated with converting underused spaces into productive use.  We use the example of a 35 sq. m. upper floor of a commercial unit in outer Dublin where it would cost &euro;10,000 to &euro;12,000 in regulatory fees and costs alone to start to convert it.  That is prohibitive for anybody.  One thinks of a small newsagent with potential to develop upstairs.  To find &euro;10,000 to &euro;12,000 to start doing that without any guarantee of securing permission is prohibitive.  Then one has the regulatory process.  We highlight in our written submission the three approvals from planning, fire and disability access, four statutory appointments, all on different timescales, submission requirements and fees.  If one fails one, one fails them all.  It is a convoluted and cumbersome process which could easily be streamlined to help those who have underused spaces get back into the game and maximise use.  The most important thing is identifying solutions to the problems.  We are probably very well aware of some of the problems but the regulatory one has probably gone under the radar.  I hear very few people talking about the problems of regulation.<br/><br/>I will not go through the whole table on vacant housing.  We have outlined it there.  We have a huge problem with collecting accurate data in the same way that we have a huge problem outlining the number of houses we are building every year.  We are not the only country with that problem.  The CSO methodology is what we call &quot;horizontal&quot;.  It looks at the ground floor of every unit but not vertically where there is a great deal of available space which does not get counted in the census.  That is not a criticism of the CSO, it is simply a methodological issue.  Discovering ownership of properties is a problem as is accuracy and transparency in the data.  Dublin City Council estimates its vacancy rates at less than 1%, but if one uses a different methodology, the vacancy rate rises to nearly 7%.  We have issues around that.  The fair deal scheme currently offers no incentive to rent out properties.  We see a rent-a-room allowance of up to &euro;14,000 tax-free for people in the fair deal scheme.  There are also taxation solutions of a carrot-and-stick nature that could be used, in particular around annually incrementing property tax.  Also, the commercial rates rebate it is possible to get from local authorities does not actually act as an incentive to redevelop properties.<br/><br/>We suggest reform of the regulatory process to make it easier and more cost-efficient for those who own commercial property to convert it to residential use alongside a full rates rebate for a couple of years increasing incrementally as we go along.  There are huge issues with the vacant sites levy.  Below half a hectare, there is no tax.  Half a hectare would accommodate 14 or 15 houses.  That should be brought down to 0.05 of a hectare.  Most of the sites one sees if one walks along the Luas line in Dublin are far smaller than half a hectare and are therefore exempt.  One would fit a lot of housing on them, however.  The 3% tax, as we call it, is derisory.  It is not going to impact on anybody who owns land.  There are a lot of exemptions in the vacant site levy that should be removed and it should be applied until the building is occupied.  If a refund is required thereafter, that is fine but it would prevent people getting planning permission in order to obtain an exemption from the levy.<br/><br/>Bank financing is an obvious issue.  Mezzanine finance is very expensive.  There is potential in the structural investment fund to consider establishing a State-backed fund aimed at vacant building refurbishments.  That would not be that hard to do.  There are also issues around construction costs and viability.  One can pick up property very cheaply in places like Longford and regional towns that could well be used for this, but the constructive costs make it prohibitive.  On underused spaces and the rates rebate, perhaps there could be a zero rate for a couple of years and then annual increments until it becomes perhaps not punitive but in the owner's interest to better use upper floors in commercial buildings.<br/><br/>The regulatory burden needs to be examined.  It is the Achilles heel in all of this.  The amount of money people who own property and land have to expend just to get permission and the time it takes are significant problems.  There is no guidance and information for owners on how to do any of this, which is a serious impact.  One cannot expect a grocer or a butcher to understand this.  It is difficult enough for professionals in the industry to understand how this works never mind having an ordinary businessman trying to get his head around building regulations, costs, fees, disability certificates, fire and planning.  The Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 require absolute compliance before a building can be occupied.  That precludes people from doing what has traditionally been done, which is that people move into a building and, as they get more money, they finish it out.  They can improve the building incrementally as they go along, which is important.  There are many flaws in the regulation system, but that is a considerable barrier to what we call &quot;staggered usage&quot;.<br/><br/>The final problem is one about which I have been banging on for quite a while.  We now have what the Minister called &quot;mandatory guidelines&quot;.  Instead of a ministerial guideline, mandatory guidelines were issued.  There is a centralisation of planning functions towards the Department and away from local authorities.  That means planners in local authorities do not have the flexibility needed to negotiate properly with people coming in with ideas to convert their upper floors or use their spaces better.  It was a very backward step to start to centralise a lot of planning functions within the Department and to take the power away from those who know the situation on the ground in the local authorities regarding the maximum use of space.</p></speech>

As part of our call, we sought an immediate audit of our built environment to determine accurately the number of empty residential and commercial spaces, assess the condition of these units, establish ownership and understand why spaces remained empty or underused.</p> <p>  Peter McVerry Trust launched that campaign with a strategic focus on buildings in private ownership.  This is an important point to stress because the figures clearly showed that even if every empty local authority house was brought back into use, it would only meet a small proportion of the social housing and homeless need.  We also felt it was critical to move to tackle vacant buildings, derelict sites and underused spaces as a means of rapidly securing additional housing supply to counter the growing housing and homeless emergency.</p> <p>  In May 2016, when the Housing Agency and Peter McVerry Trust, presented to the then Committee on Housing and Homelessness, both organisations raised the potential of vacant housing stock in private ownership.  The 2016 census has given us an updated but incomplete picture.  Census information shows that approximately 198,000 residential units, excluding holiday homes, are vacant across the State.  While many of these units are located in rural counties and in small towns and villages, it must be stressed that there are almost 50,000 empty residential units in our cities.  That equates to 13 empty homes to every one homeless adult in our cities.</p> <p>  It is also important to stress that the CSO figures do not include derelict sites or underused spaces such as those above commercial premises.  Dublin City Council believes that by tackling spaces above commercial premises, 4,000 units of accommodation could be generated.</p> <p>  In this presentation Peter McVerry Trust has set out what we believe to be a framework to realise the unused and underused spaces in our built environment for the purposes of residential accommodation.  The committee should note many buildings and spaces could also be used for other badly needed community resources and services.</p> <p>  We require a partnership approach and a balanced combination of incentives and sanctions to achieve the desired outcomes of greater availability of residential accommodation and more efficient use of our buildings and land.</p> <p>  Regarding political prioritisation and financial resources, we hope that policy-makers and legislators will recognise that investment in empty homes and other vacant buildings is the most cost-effective and sustainable way of realising new housing supply.  To take advantage of the low-hanging fruit that these units represent, there must be strong political support from the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and his Department right down to local government management and public representatives.  This must be coupled with the funding needed to tackle vacant units at scale beginning as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  We need a real-time database on housing and other buildings.  One of the biggest challenges the State faces in tackling vacancy rates is that there is no real-time data to ascertain how many empty units there are, the conditions of the units, who owns them and the reason so many buildings remain vacant.  The lack of accurate and detailed information clearly prohibits the development of fully evidence-based policy responses.</p> <p>  Peter McVerry Trust recommends the fast-track development of an holistic built environment monitoring and evaluation system that allows local authorities to track, analyse and better manage the built environment in their areas.  This would begin with the collation of data on empty properties and derelict sites of all types and sizes.  Local authorities should be directed to move to a more holistic, integrated and interventionist model of property management, one that delivers better social and economic outcomes, and stronger and more vibrant communities.</p> <p>  We need to overcome planning barriers.  To ensure planning legislation and building control systems support upgrading of vacant buildings and the conversion of commercial spaces to residential use, amendments to legislation and planning systems are necessary.  To this end the planning and building controls regulation should be amended, to create an on-the-spot approval and exemption for certain categories of upgrade or conversion.</p> <p>  Strong consideration should also be given to creating a panel of building control certifiers made up of private and public experts who could operate a fixed-charge, on-the-spot system.  Such expert teams to would need the power to take decisions and grant exemptions, where appropriate, to planning permission and building control.  These changes would help speed up delivery, reduce costs and remove administrative barriers for building owners.</p> <p>  To drive action on the ground, local authorities must create and resource dedicated teams of empty homes officers.  These officers would be charged with proactively reducing the number of vacant properties, engaging with the various stakeholders and offering a clear point of contact for property owners.  They would also be responsible for creating local one-stop-shop platforms for advice and support.</p> <p>  There will be individuals in possession of vacant homes who need to sell and have no wish to oversee renovation works or people who continue to own what has become an unwanted burden.  In these instances, the Government should create a matchmaker scheme whereby approved housing bodies or local authorities purchase vacant homes from owners to return them to use for social housing or affordable rental schemes.</p> <p>  It is important to recognise that Peter McVerry Trust, like other organisations, has successfully raised millions of euro for major renovation projects which have brought disused units back into the housing system at no cost to the State.  This information is set out in information note the trust has provided to the members of the committee today.  A formal and State-backed matchmaker scheme could allow the work of approved housing bodies to be scaled up, thereby returning more units to the broader housing system at a faster rate.</p> <p>  If we are to push the required number of vacant units back into the housing system, the Government must move beyond incentives and bring balanced and effective sanctions into play.  Sanctions must be included because not only will these address the tens of thousands of empty buildings in existence, but they send a clear message that will help prevent other buildings becoming vacant in the future.  A vacant property tax on non-principal dwelling houses vacant for one year or more is extremely important.  It would push owners of vacant buildings to act.  It would prevent speculative investors from buying and leaving properties empty, and it would encourage developments which involve empty properties or buildings to move faster.</p> <p>  If funds raised from the tax were ring-fenced for the purposes of vacant home regeneration, local authorities would also have a significant revenue stream at their disposal.  A vacant property tax exists in many jurisdictions and has recently been introduced in Vancouver which, like Dublin and other parts of Ireland, is experiencing a major housing crisis and spiralling accommodation prices, and yet has thousands of vacant properties in the urban environs.</p> <p>  For local authorities to take a more proactive role, they must increase the strategic use of compulsory purchase orders, CPOs.  This measure must be used to acquire units which represent value, are of strategic importance and are located in areas with high housing need.</p> <p>  Peter McVerry Trust also favours the use of a compulsory leasing scheme, CLS, where ownership would not change but local authorities have the ability to take over the management of a property under certain strict criteria for the common good.  The owner would receive rent minus the cost of upgrading and managing the building.</p> <p>  To date, there has been a reluctance to compulsorily purchase units of accommodation, but a stronger approach would, at the very least, push owners to act rather than having their properties purchased.  Consideration should be given to an automatic CPO or CLS process for any unit empty for five years or more as a means to discourage and prevent people, who can afford to pay fines and taxes, from leaving properties vacant.  This would protect communities from abandonment and dereliction.</p> <p>  Peter McVerry Trust believes that the threshold at which the vacant sites levy applies should be lowered.  The current threshold means many viable sites go untaxed.  Local authorities should also be directed to register all derelict sites and land parcels regardless of their size.  This is to ensure we manage and use available resources in the best manner possible.  Not all derelicts sites and vacant plots will be best suited to residential needs, but may be suitable for community services and other resources.</p> <p>  It is difficult to quantify the exact residential potential that exists by converting empty commercial spaces into residential settings.  The only publicly available statistic is that from Dublin City Council which estimates that 4,000 units could be generated.  Peter McVerry Trust has converted underused spaces, including those above shop floors and commercial spaces into residential accommodation for people in homelessness, and the organisation is progressing plans to deliver over the shop apartment developments in Dublin.</p> <p>  There is a clear need for a national co-ordination unit to manage responses to the issues of vacant homes, derelict sites and underused spaces.  It would offer an important overarching view on the performance of local authorities and create a platform through which to share best practice.  This unit would also provide technical expertise to acquire, renovate and put back into use vacant buildings.</p> <p>  We thank the Chairman and committee members for the invitation to present on this issue and urge the committee to engage with the Minister and his Department on the proposals and actions outlined.</p></speech>

I very much welcome the contribution from Dr. Sirr and his colleagues, as well as the Peter McVerry Trust.  We need their strong and clear voices on these issues.  I support practically everything that was said and I do not disagree with anything.  I am trying to think about how we can effect the change being called for, and it seems it will come by putting pressure on the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and the relevant Ministers.</p> <p>  I presented a draft Bill to the Oireachtas on an empty homes tax and it was ruled out of order because only a Minister may introduce legislation imposing a financial penalty or incentive.  Although I cannot present the Bill, I will articulate its aims at my party meeting next week.  We all need to listen very carefully and articulate the views expressed by the witnesses.  In Dublin, there are 36,000 empty homes, according to the last census.  That is a huge number of empty homes.  I support the comments of the witnesses that if such homes are vacant for one year or more and if they are not the principal private residence of the owner, there should be a penalty that would lead to them being put on the market.  There are incentives.  If the house is in bad repair, there can be support to refurbish it, and one can make deals with local authorities to lease such properties.  There is no excuse in this crisis for any such home that is not a principal private residence not being taxed.  In my Bill, I proposed a rate that would have a double rate of property tax for the first year, triple the tax for the third year and so on.  We must take very hard decisions.  It is a disgrace to allow a position where a home could lie empty if it has the capacity to house a family.  I feel very strongly about that.</p> <p>  I have looked at what they have done in Britain and the UK has approximately 350 local authorities, with approximately 260 having used the empty home tax.  The penalty is 1.5 times the property tax if it is empty after a year.  We cannot just leave this untouched.  The witnesses argue that such action would effect immediate change and it is cheaper to get these houses as they are there already.  The services already exist so this is a no-brainer.</p> <p>  I also support the comments of the witnesses regarding empty commercial properties.  The Apollo House occupation made me consider how many vacant or derelict commercial premises are in my area.  It is a large number and we should use them for habitation.  In the UK they have some very good programmes.  I note from the Peter McVerry Trust contribution that it is possible to take over properties that would never again be used for commercial purposes, restore them and turn them into habitable dwellings or apartments.  Again, it is a no-brainer.  The Apollo House occupation has demonstrated that it is a way forward with a legal process and fast-tracking the planning.  There is no reason it should require a change of use application, provided the parties meet basic fire and other requirements, in order to have a commercial property change to domestic occupancy.  That would come with common sense and the support of local authorities.</p> <p>  I keep making the point but it is telling.  The vast majority of local authorities failed in their duty of care with the houses offered to them by NAMA.  They were offered 7,000 homes but they took 2,500, which is scandalous.  Even in the city of Dublin, there were enough properties offered so that every family in a hostel or hotel tonight could be in an apartment or home.  That is not the case.  We need greater pressure on local authorities.  I feel very strongly about this, as do my constituents and people around the whole country.  I welcome the continued involvement of the witnesses.</p> <p>  When we finish today it is not about walking away, leaving it all here at the committee with the issues on paper in nice print.  We must act.  I welcome and acknowledge the help of the Oireachtas library service in researching the matters.  Our committee could commission a proper report on these and other matters that people might give us for action rather than discussion.  We must identify the nuts and bolts of the actions we need to take.  I suggest it would be useful for us to do that as a committee.  We have the funds to do it and it would be a direct follow-up to what we hear from the public and the witnesses before us today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-01a.163" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1379" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017020100002#E00200"><p>I thank Dr. Sirr and Mr. Friel for their excellent presentations.  They overlapped and said very similar things.  I thank the witnesses for submitting the presentations in advance, which I read, as that was very helpful and important.  To stay focused, we are dealing with vacant housing, derelict sites and unused spaces.  My colleague to my right is correct.  There are 31 local authorities in this country and they have statutory obligations.  They are also the housing and planning authorities, with a wide range of functions.  Where we are today is an indictment of the local authority system.</p> <p>  The local government auditing services are carried out by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  That is a problem for another day as, frankly, local government should not be audited by its parent Department.  I took a random look yesterday at a number of the local government audit reports for 2015, which are the most recent examples on-line and which one can inspect.  Clearly, the local government auditors for a number of local authorities, including that of which I was a member, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, singled out for criticism local authorities that had not complied with the obligation to keep a computerised record of properties within their ownership.  I am not talking about the private sector but rather within the ownership of the local authority.  The response from the chief executive, which is always requested in the case of comments that are good, bad or indifferent from a local government auditor, is there was a lack of resources to carry out the work.  That has been going on for years and it is something we should bring to the Minister's attention at some point.  Maybe the local authorities should not have this responsibility and if they are not capable of doing it, someone else should do it.  We are talking about public assets and property.  The local authorities are the guardians of these.  The witnesses shared a shocking statistic today about Dublin City Council and the amount of space that is empty.  Serious questions must be asked about it.  Perhaps at some other stage we should bring in the chief executives of local authorities in order to ask those questions.</p> <p>  In Dr. Sirr's presentation he mentions land hoarding and the lack of meaningful measures to counteract vacant sites.  I know he has gone into this.  I am really interested in solutions and I know he is too.  In his submission he also argues that Government policy is geared towards inflating the price of houses on which the viability of NAMA's residential portfolio depends.  That is a very profound statement with which I do not necessarily disagree.  Will Dr. Sirr tease that out and give some substance to that argument?</p> <p>  The witness made a very good case with regard to the fair deal scheme and it is something that should be pursued.  In my part of the world and all over there are many empty houses because people have gone into nursing homes having availed of the fair deal.  These are solid houses with three and four bedrooms but the families are not renting them out because of taxation issues.  The witness made the valid point that a person may rent a room in a house for &euro;14,000 without paying any tax.  Perhaps there should be a threshold or cap so such houses could be rented if they meet standards and are safe.  Renting rooms in this way is a good and positive suggestion.  In particular parts of Dublin city and county, it is a real problem so this is worth discussing.</p> <p>  Mr. Friel spoke on behalf of the Peter McVerry Trust.</p><p>He made some good points on a vacant property tax, with which I fully agree.  He also made a valid point on compulsory purchase orders.  Local authorities argue that they do not have sufficient funds to proceed with compulsory purchase orders for derelict properties and buildings that are falling down.  People have a right to private property and taking private property creates problems.  Valuations are also an issue.  The Government must establish a fund for compulsory purchase because many local authorities do not have sufficient funds to make such purchases.  Officials from a number of local authorities have informed me that they will not proceed with compulsory purchase orders because they will not waste money, resources, staff and legal expertise on them.  This problem needs to be addressed. </p><p> My colleague, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, asked how the committee could be productive rather than sitting in this room talking into a jar.  It was suggested a report on our deliberations today be used to feed into the national vacant housing reuse strategy which is part of the Rebuilding Ireland programme.  The various papers and our deliberations should be summarised in a report for submission to the Minister and incorporation into the national vacant housing reuse strategy.  The Minister intends to deliver the strategy in the first quarter of the year and it is now February.  I thank the delegates for their contributions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-01a.165" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017020100002#F00200"><p>I thank the delegates for their presentations.  A number of them have been prominent in keeping the issue of vacant properties and sites in the public arena and I urge them to continue to do so because it will add to the pressure many members are trying to put on the Government to have this issue resolved.  All of us are greatly frustrated that thus far, of the five pillars of Rebuilding Ireland, the one that could be delivered quickest has received the least investment.  In this respect, the Government's response is the wrong way around.  If the Minister was here, he would defend Rebuilding Ireland and point out that three initiatives had been included in the programme to try to deal with vacant properties.  They are the allocation of &euro;70 million to the Housing Agency to deliver 1,600 units over three years, the provision of &euro;6 million in funding for a repair and lease scheme being piloted in counties Carlow and Kilkenny and changes to the living city initiative.  I am interested in hearing the delegates' views on the detail of these schemes and whether the funding provided is sufficient.  Clearly, these are three areas in which Government action is under way and it would be very helpful if we could push for greater outcomes from them. </p> <p>  The Housing Agency is producing an overall plan to tackle the issue of vacant properties.  I am sure Mr. John O'Connor, with whom we will speak afterwards, is furiously writing notes in the Visitors Gallery.  The delegates provided a menu of policy options and while they would clearly like all of them to be implemented, I ask them to outline what their key priorities would be and what headline items would really make a difference.  We know from the good research the Housing Agency has carried out that it is equally concerned to achieve progress in this area.  </p> <p>  A third issue which was not discussed is cost.  Not only is use of vacant properties the quickest way to increase stock, but they are also cheaper than new builds.  The Minister issued a press release on Friday on some of the new rapid build projects in south County Dublin, specifically in Tallaght and Clondalkin.  The figures he has provided show a three bedroom rapid build unit will cost &euro;245,000.  Sinn F&eacute;in's will not oppose the provision of rapid build houses, provided they are well built and provide good quality homes.  However, according to the Department, the average cost of a standard council house is &euro;180,000.  How much would it cost per unit to bring voids back into use?  I am particularly interested in hearing from the Peter McVerry Trust about its experience of bringing voids back into use.  What are the costs involved in doing so?  This information will clearly strengthen the argument for taking action. </p> <p>  On a vacant property tax, what is the rationale for the timeframe of 12 months?  Do the delegates have examples of vacant property taxes in operation elsewhere?  Are they similar to what has been proposed here? </p> <p>  I am also interested in the idea of a register.  What is the most effective way to establish one?  Should it be a statutory requirement that property owners register their properties and should penalties apply to those who fail to do so?</p> <p>  Mr. Reynolds has raised the issue of completions on numerous occasions and Dr. Sirr wrote about them recently.  The Department is working on a building control Bill and we expect to see the heads of the Bill soon.  Would this legislation be an appropriate place in which to insert a statutory requirement that local authorities collate accurate statistics for inclusion in a house completions register?  If not, where should such a requirement be placed?</p> <p>  Unfortunately, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd has left the meeting because every time he refers to the National Asset Management Agency and local authorities, someone has to step in to defend the local authorities.  Local authorities can only do what the Department allows them to do.  It is important to note that while some of them turned down good properties linked with NAMA, they often did so either because they were not given funding by the Department or for other reasons.  It is important, therefore, that we consider the culpability of the Department in the matter.  This is not a question, but I make the point because it is important to do so.  The reason I do so is that one of the issues that will arise when we meet representatives of the Housing Agency is that of the properties banks are offering for purchase to the State.  These properties are not for sale on the open market.  If we are to learn the lessons from the lack of take-up of NAMA linked properties, we have to apply them to properties now available, namely, those being offered by the banks.</p></speech>

I will give three examples of this practice.  About 18 months ago the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, stated prices needed to rise a little more.  My take on that statement is that it reflects on the viability of selling off banks.  In terms of NAMA, at the launch of pillar 3 or 4 of the strategy in the Green Isle Hotel, Mr. John Collison, the head of the agency's residential portfolio, stated the viability of the agency's residential portfolio depended on rising house prices.  I was in the room and Mr. Collison's statement surprised me.  Pennies begin to drop, however, as one realises measures such as the first-time buyer's grant will do nothing but increase prices.</p></speech>

We are dealing with derelict sites and units and it would be unfair to cross over into other schemes such as the help-to-buy scheme in the context of value and inflating or not inflating prices.  As we all know, there are many pieces to this jigsaw which must fit together if Rebuilding Ireland is to work.  We are dealing with one piece of the jigsaw today.  I do not want to get into the issue of massaging figures.  The help-to-buy scheme relates only to new builds; therefore, it is not inflating prices and a differential applies, for example, to properties costing &euro;400,000 and &euro;500,000.  I do not want to get into that aspect.  We are dealing with derelict sites and vacant units.</p></speech>

In terms of interpreting the market and interpreting policy and recent changes, both in the private and public sector, most of the measures I can think of from the development side have increased the value of sites.  That is contributing towards what many of us believe to be land hoarding and site flipping.  That is what we referred to in our submission, and Savills did it last year.</p><p> The basis of its statement was in an eight-page PDF document recommending people to buy shares in REITs.  It is a commercial strategy at the moment and for us to accurately interpret the market we must look critically at measures that procyclically inflate new build prices, irrespective of the source.  When the sale price of a new dwelling is increased by 10%, the site value increases by 35%.  The windfall profits in the private sector as a result of policies that inflate sale prices are extraordinary.  In terms of large-scale land holdings of &euro;200 million and &euro;300 million, if the Government or anybody else brings in a policy that increases the sale price of a unit by 10%, that portfolio will increase by &euro;100 million.  The people or the company that owns the land do not have to build anything.  They just have to wait for things to get worse and these policies to be introduced.  That is definitely a factor we are seeing currently in the private sector.</p></speech>

In terms of the lack of money in local authorities, not all the solutions involve money.  It is not always about money, particularly in areas around the regulatory framework; that is about reducing costs.  Some of the solutions to this are cost neutral and a more efficient use of what might be local authority resources.</p> <p>  The key priority for me would probably be guidance and information, and a one-stop-shop for people who want to do something about this issue.  That is critical.  My colleagues might have a different priority.</p> <p>  I will come back to one or two of the other questions.  One of the reasons local authorities have refused so many NAMA units is because of the build quality.  They are of poor quality and the local authorities would have to spend so much money to rectify the build quality.  They saw that this will be a never ending issue and decided it is not worth their while taking on the properties.  The reason they would do that is perfectly understandable.  My colleagues, Ms Hegarty and Mr. Reynolds, might like to comment on the cost of housing or how we would create a register of ownership.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-01a.180" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Orla Hegarty" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017020100002#G00400"><p>I might take up two points, one of which was to do with a register of completions on new build.  We have a register, which came in under the building control (amendment) regulations, BCAR, but it is not available in a very readable format.  We have a register that captures most new build with the exception of one-off housing, which was exempted in 2015.  Some corrections to that probably could be done relatively quickly under regulation to capture all new builds.  That would give accurate data and would be location specific.</p> <p>  On the second point about regulation and change possibly being cost neutral, it would be more efficient on the local authority side in terms of resources and also on the owner's side in terms of the outlay to make a unit viable or to bring space, be it commercial or residential conversions, back into use.  Again, that could be done under regulation without the need for primary legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-01a.181" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mel Reynolds" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017020100002#G00500"><p>I will come in briefly on the issue of cost.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned &euro;245,000 for a new rapid build unit.  That excludes the site cost.  We know that the site cost on the Drimnagh site in particular is &euro;120,000 per site so the overall cost to the State of a rapid build unit there will be more than &euro;360,000.  If one gets onto <i>daft.ie</i>one will see perfectly habitable houses for about &euro;220,000.  A broader question arises as to whether a cost benefit analysis has been done on any of these schemes.  They certainly seem to be 25% to 30% more expensive than standard local authority homes at &euro;180,000, a figure confirmed by the Minister, Deputy Coveney.<br/><br/>In terms of the cost for refurbishments, the Peter McVerry Trust has direct experience of that.  Accounts that I have seen in a number of local authorities indicate that the cost for very heavy void refurbishments of State-owned stock is &euro;30,000 or &euro;40,000.  In the private sector, as a rough rule of thumb, the hard cost of a building up to roof level, including the structure, windows, walls and foundations, is approximately half that.  The remaining cost of, say, new kitchens, new bathrooms, redecoration, etc. would be about half that also  The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland's hard cost for a three-bedroom house is approximately &euro;150,000.  Approximately &euro;70,000, excluding VAT, would be an extensive refurbishment cost for a house that was completely wrecked inside.  That would be the cost for all the bits and pieces.  That would be a good rule of thumb to start with, and that is for a 100 sq. m three bedroom property.  It would be less for a two-bedroom property.  It might be slightly more expensive if two properties were being knocked into one and if some structural work was being done.<br/><br/>There are many apartment developments that are earmarked for regeneration that have been vacant for years.  It might be half the cost to do a good deal of work to them.  We would be looking at a build cost of, say, &euro;240,000 for a rapid build.  One could do four, five or even up to nine void refurbishments that needed work for the same price as one rapid build, and those could be brought on very quickly.  There would be no delays in terms of planning.  They are already in place, and all the services are in place also.  As the Peter McVerry Trust and others have pointed out, it is a no-brainer to do it and it should be done.<br/><br/>The Deputy mentioned the register of completions.  As my colleague, Ms Hegarty, pointed out, we have a register under the building control management system, BCMS, although it is not published in a readable format.  The disparity between the official completions data and what we are actually building is significant, at over 40%.  For example, if we examine more accurate indicators we see that we completed fewer than 7,500 new homes last year as opposed to 14,500 previously.  There are approximately 11 indicators of new build activity.  The Department and the Government always seem to concentrate on the indicators that over-inflate that figure massively and, unfortunately, what are termed completions by the Department are meter connections to ESB Networks.  That is not a criticism of ESB Networks.  It is excellent to deal with, as is the Central Statistics Office, CSO.  They are very helpful when questions are put to them.  ESB Networks requires any unit that has been vacant for two years or longer to be reconnected to the grid.  The old meter number is cancelled and the unit is allocated a new meter number.  The significance of that is that upwards of 14,000 NAMA vacant units have been reconnected to the grid in the past five years; we know it is possibly more than that.  At one point, 69,000 ghost estate units needed some form of finishing out in 3,000 estates also.  These numbers are enormous.  To give members an indication of it, the five-year total completions figure the Department claims were done between 2011 and 2015 is 50,951.  Using more accurate indicators such as stamp duty transactions, new build and once-off commencements, the actual number of new builds is less than 30,000.  Ironically, NAMA has been propping up the housing sector for the past five years by virtue of these vacant units gradually coming back into stock.<br/><br/>It also means that the capacity of the new build sector is much lower than we are led to believe.  Last year, we completed 7,500 new homes within, say, an 18-month period.  That is an increase of 22% on the year before that, which was 5,827.  It is a 22% increase but the number is still very low.  For the industry to grow safely and without the same quality problems we experienced at the end of the boom when we were building a massive amount of housing very poorly, we need to grow the new build sector slowly.  New standards are coming in.  There is a skills shortage.  There are no apprenticeship programmes so the 100,000 vacant units Dr. Sirr mentioned are the buffer we need for the next five years to grow the sector.  We have stood back and allowed the sector fall apart and wither.  If we doubled output this year, we would be at 15,000 units, which is still much lower than where we need to be.<br/><br/>Longford was given as an example.</p><p>If it is going to cost one &euro;10,000 or &euro;12,000 just to obtain permissions and five months to sanction the change of use of an upper floor, and if one must then spend &euro;20,000 or &euro;30,000 to do up the unit, one must realise one can buy a ten-year-old two-bedroom unit in Longford for &euro;42,000, as can be seen on <i>www.daft.ie</i>.  The system is just not working at present.  We need to reduce the costs and timescales involved in bringing vacant units back into circulation.  We also need to be more honest about the figures and use them to inform policy.  Quite simply, if we assume we are currently building 14,000 to 15,000 new homes per year, we are absolutely wrong.  We are building approximately 40% to 45% fewer.  With the skills shortages and the problems we have with new homes delivery, the effectiveness of policy to date has to be questioned.  One must ask why we are concentrating on such a small part of the market?  To put it in context, there were only about 1,000 first-time buyers of new homes last year.  The total number of new homes built and sold last year, based on ten months of data, is estimated to be 3,434.  That is all.  Fingal County Council has 12,000 on its housing list.  The numbers simply do not work; yet there are 98,000 vacant units, many of which are State owned, sitting there.  They could be refurbished at a very low cost. <br/><br/>With regard to privately-owned stock, the simplification of the regulations could be achieved with three statutory instruments tomorrow.  Primary legislation is not needed and nor is it necessary to produce another report.  I started looking through Housing 2020 and lost the will to live after page 30.  That is a 72-page report.  It was like reading Rebuilding Ireland again.  It uses all the same terminology.  All the targets have been missed.  For a practitioner and non-politician, or somebody not involved in this arena, it should be noted that Housing 2020 was launched in May 2014.  It allocated &euro;3.2 billion for social housing.  The target is to have 25,000 social houses by 2020.  In 2015, we built 64 local authority houses.  In 2016, we built 117.  Plans, reports and strategic targets are absolutely meaningless unless there is some sort of follow-through.  This can be done very quickly.  These three statutory instruments could free up an awful lot of privately-owned stock.  If local authorities and the Department are playing pass the parcel regarding who did this, who said that, and who got funding, we could have 9,000 on the homeless list before the end of this year.  We need to get moving on this really quickly.</p></speech>

It is unfortunate that NAMA is being debated in the D&aacute;il when we are having a meeting of the housing committee on a matter so important.  It is not that I am not interested but I am trying to prepare to speak in the D&aacute;il shortly.  Can we try to ensure these clashes do not happen again?  I know it is difficult.

We have always said the homeless and housing crisis is complex and so every and any instrument should be investigated to alleviate the pressure on homeless people, particularly families in hotels.  Rapid build was mentioned, as were the various associated prices.  The trust has been a supporter of rapid build.  Even with the prices being far higher than once expected, the whole idea of rapid building is to have housing constructed rapidly now to get people out of hotels now.</p> <p>  We were to the fore in bringing local authority voids into use, particularly in 2015 and early 2016.  That initiative is now almost exhausted.  The number of voids has decreased significantly so it is only right and proper that we now consider the vacant properties in the private sector.  We took two particular voids in the Dublin City Council area in partnership with the council and were delighted to do that.  One contained 11 units in St. Agatha's and the other contained 17 units in Townsend Street.  Those units were in such a bad state of repair that planning permission had to be sought.  There were all sorts of consultations and procurement issues.  The voided units in St. Agatha's, which we took on in 2015, will come into use in February this year.  The process took a year and a half.  In that context, even given the higher prices of rapid build, rapid build is important because it will get people out of hotels this year if the units are built this year.  We welcome the rapid build initiative.</p> <p>  With regard to private stock, we gave some examples of some properties we have taken in.  Some were taken on in partnership with the Housing Agency, the OPW and Dublin City Council.  At the private end, we have a monastery in Kildare that we will bring back into use this year.  We will turn it around in approximately five months and it will yield four family units and three single units or units for couples.  This amounts to seven units for &euro;350,000.  The capital assistance scheme will fund it.  The building was one from which one of the religious orders pulled out.  We are currently doing a search of buildings owned by religious orders to ascertain whether some of them can be brought back around.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about pricing.  We opened six units on Pim Street for about &euro;124,000 in partnership with the Housing Agency and the local authority.  Eight units were brought in for about &euro;300,000.  Vacant buildings can be brought around much more cheaply and quicker.  There are still obstacles to which we need to pay attention, however.  If the building has been unoccupied for over two years, there is a reconnection issue.  We had seven units in another local authority area that we were trying to bring back into use.  We had done the work on them and wanted them ready for Christmas.  We only barely got them ready for Christmas based on the connection.  The time for connections was very long.  The work was greatly delayed, by about three months, based on the connection.  We have had numerous cases of this.  Although we can turn the units around in a couple of months, there are issues over fire safety and disability access.  We need more support and co-ordination in this regard.</p> <p>  With regard to the monastery, the commencement order was delayed for six weeks.  It was partly attributable to our not having learned how to fill it in.  Rather than picking up the telephone to point out an error in the way an order is filled out online, some local authorities just state it is non-compliant and that a fresh application must be made.   I acknowledge some do ring.  Where a fresh application has to be made, it causes a delay of another two or three weeks.  We could speed things up by having a little more co-ordination.</p> <p>  One of the deputy directors of Dublin City Council came out with us last night to look at two derelict basement units.  We took them from a private landlord, asked for a long lease on them and stated the trust would refurbish them at no cost to the landlord.  We welcome the scheme being introduced that will give landlords up to &euro;40,000 per unit.  We reckon we can bring the two units in question back into use for approximately &euro;60,000.  They will be ready in two weeks.  We have a long-term lease on them.  Their refurbishment regenerates the street.  They looked to be in bad repair.  The initiative offers more than just housing but the primary issue for us is the housing.</p> <p>  We welcome the schemes being introduced for vacant units.  We would like to see the city of Dublin, for example, divided by a grid and the Irish Council for Social Housing having a part in asking the voluntary housing associations to take on a section of the grid and target the properties therein rather than competing with landlords and making multiple inquiries.  The cities should be divided by grids, with each voluntary housing association taking on a particular area with the support of the local authority.</p><p>That is something that I would like to see in that report.  Let them off and they could then work with the local authority and the Housing Agency to get those units brought back in.  That is all I really wanted to say in this regard.</p><p> As one must register for property tax, we should be registering vacant or disused sites as well even though there is not a payment.  People may be reluctant to do that because they think a payment may come but that is a form on which we could capture some of the derelict or vacant sites.  While we are saying 12 months, Vancouver has said six months and one is hit with additional taxes after six months.  We suggest the carrot-and-stick approach.  If people are offered a scheme for a year, that allows the Housing Agency, participants in the voluntary sector and the local authorities to engage with the landlord for up to a year.  Thereafter, if there is no engagement, maybe the tax can be brought in.</p></speech>

While I acknowledge Dr. Sirr wishes to come in again, I will take the next round of questions.  I call Deputy Casey.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-01a.189" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1357" speakername="Pat Casey" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017020100002#J00300"><p>I thank both organisations for their presentations here this morning.</p> <p>  I want to focus mainly on the vacant properties.  While it has been identified as one of the immediate solutions, my fear is we might move too fast on vacant properties, especially when we look outside the Dublin area at more rural towns.  I am concerned that we might not plan for such conversions and would get the wrong type of conversions for over-the-shop accommodation or would get poor-quality accommodation.  Equally, when one considers towns like these, no community infrastructure or facilities are in place to support town living any more.  That needs to be brought along with converting these vacant properties.  The public realm aspect of it is not there in the smaller towns around the country where there are significant, if not huge, vacant commercial properties.  In my native county, one developer who sought to convert his commercial property into residential was refused because the plan for that town wanted to keep the streetscape commercial on the ground floor.  However, there is no realistic future for that.</p> <p>  If we are looking at vacant properties, especially in the more rural towns, there is a need for local authorities to get actively involved in trying to create a plan for the town.  It has to be a relatively quick plan that would identify key residential areas and areas that would suit continued commercial development.  Along with that, we must bring that community infrastructure and that public realm with it as otherwise, it will fail as an option to live in.  That plan needs to be in place, especially if fast-tracking planning for conversions is being considered.</p> <p>  I agree the regulatory framework has got so complex at this stage that it needs an overhaul.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin is going to tackle this in the next few months.  The self-regulation part of it needs to stop now and that needs to be brought back into local authority control.  As somebody noted, a one-stop shop is needed within the local authority framework that deals with fire, disability, building control and compliance.  At present, three different departments deal with three different compliance matters in Wicklow, which is madness.  Moreover, it happens at different times.  It needs to be one process under one organisation.  I believe the local authority could be the vehicle to provide it.  Self-regulation should be taken out of it and the assigned certifiers should be taken out of the equation because that is only a circle of ongoing lack of responsibility.</p> <p>  I mentioned skills and the skill shortage in one of my first committee meetings here.  The skill shortage undoubtedly is already here.  Is there a difference in the training for traditional build as opposed to rapid build technologies?  Is it quicker to train somebody for rapid-build technologies where people will work within a controlled environment?  Will they have a much more social aspect to their lives where it is controlled and they know where they are going to each day between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.?  Is there a difference in the level of training within that?</p> <p>  On the carrot and the stick, Wicklow County Council tried to target the vacant commercial rate properties which were getting a 100% rebate.  The problem was that it had to be given to everybody.  One could not focus on the town streetscape, decide particular properties could be converted to residential use and state that unless they were converted, a charge of 50% of the commercial rate would be levied.  If one wanted to do that, it had to apply to the whole county.  We all know that with the best will in the world, there are commercial properties that will never be converted no matter what is done.  It is a complex area and is not simple.  There may be some ways in which we can address that issue in the future as a committee.</p> <p>  I have one final point on NAMA properties that were offered to local authorities.  I was brought to one site, which was a half-finished estate and one would have to be mad to even think of taking that on.  Some misinformation is being given out as to the quality of sites that were offered to local authorities in respect of suiting their needs.</p></speech>

It is unacceptable that local authorities do not take some of these properties.  I know of four or five houses in my native Carlow that could be taken back.  This concerns the bigger picture on properties and sites that are either half-finished or are nearly finished but which have gone back into NAMA.  They should be taken back because they bring so much anti-social behaviour to an area.  It is unreal.  I spent last week in two houses trying to get rubbish taken up.  Carlow County Council spends more time, like other local authorities, taking rubbish out of houses that are derelict and that are causing anti-social behaviour.  They are in an area where good-living people are fed up with having the hassle of having bought their house in an estate, whether a local authority estate or a private estate, and all they have is this anti-social behaviour and rubbish that is being littered.</p> <p>  I do not suggest that all houses will come back but when houses are given back, it is the duty of every local authority to take them back because it is unfair for everybody who is living in those areas.  If one takes town centres, for example, Carlow is one of the new areas for the repair and lease scheme.  I monitor this closely and while 22 people were interested in it, only eight qualified.  Consequently, the scheme needs to be examined.  As Deputy Casey asked, who is putting these plans in place such that when 22 people want to qualify for a scheme, they cannot?  Eight people will qualify but the rest will not.  When we put a scheme in place, we must make sure that the people that need to qualify for it do.  I do not suggest there will not be more because the scheme has only just started and many people have only just become aware of it.  I highlight it myself when I go to different places.  I always tell people this is a pilot scheme which is for &euro;40,000 and which entails a lease-back to local authorities.  I think that in the long term, it could be a good initiative but it appears to have issues that must be considered.</p> <p>  I have major concerns.  While I acknowledge and welcome the passing of the rapid build programme for Dublin, that does not affect rural counties like Carlow.  We would love to have rapid build.  I firmly believe there needs to be a focus on areas that are not focused on.  I suppose everybody has something he or she believes to be unfair I will repeat a point I have made previously.  I was a councillor - like most members present - for 20 years and I find that in my local authority, a lot of people are falling in between.  They do not qualify to go on the local authority housing list because Carlow has the lowest income limit of &euro;26,500, which is another issue.  We have more people.  One is talking about people buying houses.  I welcome the new incentive on the 20% on newly built houses.  The reason people are not buying houses is because they are not getting mortgages.  The Government needs to put a system in place where local authorities, and Carlow is the only one I can focus on, can give out mortgages.  We have the lowest mortgage rates in local authorities all over Ireland because there is no promotion of it.  They are not provided to the people who are getting refusals from the banks and building societies for mortgages.  There are loads of people who would not be on the housing list but would love to go for a mortgage.  The reason they are not getting it is because the banks and building societies are not getting it and the local authorities are not pushing mortgages.</p> <p>  The last time I brought this up, I really have serious concerns about this, I was told we are not an agency for lending but we are.  We are what we are, that is, we are the taxpayers.  We handle the taxpayers' money.  We have a duty of care to people who need housing.  One of the duties of care is for people who cannot get on their local authority housing list and need to have a home.  In the future, if nothing else happens, we need to look at giving mortgages to those people who do not qualify to go on local authority housing lists.  That is why we are in this position.</p><p> I wish to discuss properties in town centres.  Discovering who owns them, be it NAMA or whoever, in my area is my main issue.  I am forever trying to find out who owns this and that.  Something must be put in place to allow local authorities to do this.  We are painting derelict buildings because they are an eyesore, but this is not just about derelicts.  We all want our areas to be lovely and we want to provide good environments for those whom we represent and who we feel need them, but nothing is as bad as entering a town centre where five or six shops are boarded up or a housing estate where, through no fault of the residents, there is anti-social behaviour, rubbish, etc.  This is the bigger picture and, until something is in place, it will not work.  It is unacceptable.</p><p> Money is a greater issue.  One of the witnesses stated that local authorities did not take on the people they needed.  Funding, staffing, resources and the timescale are his main issue.  It does not matter what he says - local authorities need to start taking these.  The money is there.  We are being told by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, that there is money.</p><p> I will cite a final example.  Last week, I dealt with the case of a house that had been boarded up for months.  The engineer and I were in contact with the Department.  It took us a year and two months to get funding - we got it yesterday - for a derelict local authority house.  That is unacceptable.  Funding is there.  I cannot say whether this is down to information being handled the wrong way, but someone needs to be accountable for what is happening.  I am not saying that everyone is not doing his or her best and I do not want to be negative, but major issues are not being addressed.  In any job, one must do it right and be accountable.  People need to be accountable for this funding.</p><p> We receive reports weekly, but could they contain figures on where the money is being spent?  It was mentioned that properties in Dublin had been examined.  That is fine, given that Dublin probably has more issues than any rural area, but there are homelessness and derelict houses everywhere.  The reports we receive mention that houses are being built - not that we are building many - but please give us the statistics.  We need to consider those areas that are covered by the programme.  We are falling down in that regard.  What investments will the programme make and which local authority will get what?  I could then tell my local authority what the Department will be doing this year.  That information is missing.  Perhaps Dr. Sirr will revert to me with clarification.</p></speech>

I am a Green Party Senator and this issue - providing homes as quickly as possible in times of crisis - is core to us.  I have taken Dr. Sirr's comments on board and I will introduce legislation on vacant and derelict housing in the coming two weeks.  It is a crisis.  Building in towns and urban regeneration are critical given that, contrary to Deputy Casey's point, infrastructure is already in place in many cases.  We need to move quickly and should not be sitting back.  The witnesses have given us a great deal of substance and super suggestions with which to do so.  The onus is on the Government to move as fast as possible and, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin stated, to put vacant and derelict sites to the fore, not to No. 4 or No. 5 in the Rebuilding Ireland policy document.  We can get the impetus going as soon as possible and start providing homes for those who need them.</p></speech>

Each local authority has submitted its works programme and information on its housing supply, the zoned and non-zoned sites that it owns, where there is infrastructure, etc.  For various reasons, it would not be financially viable to purchase many of the vacant units in question.  In D&uacute;n Laoghaire, it costs 20% more to purchase, build or rent than anywhere else in Dublin.  We must tackle this issue.</p> <p>  Although I am solution driven, I recognise that not all of the units are suitable and it will take time to work through them and produce results on the ground.  I welcome the repair and lease initiatives and I agree with Mr. Doyle's grid proposal.  The committee has proposed to take what we learn today and put a report together.</p> <p>  As we have approximately ten minutes to conclude this section, I will ask Mr. Doyle and Dr. Sirr to contribute again.</p></speech>

Not every property will be suitable for housing.  Some derelict sites will be suitable for community facilities.  A vacant property tax could add to that.  In Kildare, the local authority purchased a complete site.  We got the monastery and the church area will become a county library.  There is a good balance between housing and community facilities.</p> <p>  The vacant property tax could be invested in a community resource.  We are sensitive to this issue.  With the OPW, we considered a property a while ago.  Since it was an OPW building, it had been in community service.  We wanted to say "Yes", but we said "No" because the community did not want to give up that service.  People would only have accepted another community service and might not have viewed housing for the homeless as such.</p> <p>  However, there is a great deal of low-hanging fruit.  Getting even one in ten of the properties that we surveyed and costed would go a long way.  This week, we examined two properties in Drumcondra with one of the deputy directors of Dublin City Council.  We will examine more in Cabra and Inchicore on Friday.</p> <p>  I have not seen any local authority housing department that is just sitting around doing nothing.  They are all very busy and stressed and are under significant pressure to deliver.  For local authorities, it may be a matter of more staff resources.  I have not met any housing official who has not been run off his or her feet.  We are receiving great co-operation.  I hope to be invited to Carlow shortly.</p></speech>

The Senator's point about anti-social behaviour was well made.  There is an economic cost.  Research often gets derided in the built environment, but research can quantify the cost of vacant housing and anti-social behaviour.  We can put a number on it.</p> <p>  The repair and lease scheme is a wonderful idea and should be rolled out further.</p> <p>  The Senator made a good point about local authorities and mortgages.  A cohort of households earn &euro;35,000 to &euro;50,000 per year, which is too much to qualify for State help and too little to buy their own homes.  They will fall into a wide gap.</p></speech>

It bought property at &euro;5,000 per unit by means of CPOs.  A &euro;50,000 spend provided what was essentially a refurbished house.  It can be done around the country, but my problem with this is that the Department counts it as a new house even though the house is 30 years old.  It inflates the figures artificially.</p> <p>  Local authorities can work through CPOs.  Louth County Council is a good example of how it can be done.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by my colleagues, Mr. David Silke and Ms Isoilde Dillon.</p> <p>  The Housing Agency was founded in 2010 with the vision of enabling everyone to live in good quality, affordable homes in sustainable communities.  In this pursuit, we provide a wide level of expert advice, support, research and training for local authorities, the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, approved housing bodies, NAMA and many other public and private sector organisations.  The many activities that we are involved in, together with our research, provides the agency with a unique vantage point from which to offer the committee information, advice and observations on addressing the issue of vacant housing and sites.</p> <p>  We have been asked to address vacant housing, derelict sites and underused spaces.  In doing this, I wish to cover the issues of vacant housing, Housing Agency acquisitions through the vacant house purchase initiative, NAMA acquisitions and leasing for social housing, unfinished residential developments and derelict and vacant sites.</p><p> In May 2016, the Housing Agency&rsquo;s discussion paper, Overview of Vacant Housing in Ireland, highlighting the level of vacant housing and possible actions to address this, was submitted to the Oireachtas Committee on Housing and Homelessness.  Following that, pillar 5 of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness &ndash; Rebuilding Ireland, focused on utilising existing housing stock.  The key objective identified is to ensure existing vacant housing stock throughout the country and across all forms of tenure, in both the private and public sectors, is used to the optimum degree possible.  The key action from this is to develop a national vacant housing re-use strategy.  In order to prepare a draft strategy for consideration by the Minister, a working group, was established, which I chair.  This working group is examining ways of addressing vacant housing and is consulting with organisations and individuals in this country and abroad, including organisations such as the Empty Homes Network in England and the Scottish Empty Homes Partnership.</p><p> The key areas being examined by the working group include priority, that is, the question of how to ensure bringing vacant homes back into use is taken as a priority at national and local level.  Another key area is information; how best to identify and compile registers of vacant properties and their owners.  The group is examining various sources of information required to build an understanding of the scale of the problem, or the potential, which will indicate if actions and policies can be tailored to ensure effective use is made of existing resources and assets.  Another key area being examined is the response structure.  A critical factor informing the success of bringing vacant homes back into use will be the role played by local authorities.  The immediate focus needs to be on ensuring local authorities are in a position to identify and actively engage with owners and that they have the necessary support to do this.  Support at national level is critical to success.</p><p> We are consulting others, researching and analysing various approaches and actions.  If committee members would like, we can discuss this in more detail during the open session.  Two initiatives are being implemented, namely, the repair and lease scheme and the buy and renew scheme.  These are important measures in addressing vacant housing.</p><p> In the context of the vacant house purchase initiative, the agency has been engaging with the banks on their portfolios of properties throughout the country.  The objective is for the agency to utilise a &euro;70 million rolling fund to acquire 1,600 properties by 2020.  The majority of these properties would be former buy-to-let properties.  To date, the agency has had bids accepted on 305 dwellings with a total value of &euro;46.75 million.  Of these, the agency has signed contracts for 217 dwellings, and 29 of these purchases have closed.  The dwellings acquired will be sold to approved housing bodies to provide homes for those in need of social housing support.  Under an earlier initiative in 2015 and early 2016, the agency acquired 171 properties from banks which were transferred directly to local authorities.  When we engage with the banks and identify other properties suitable for local authorities, we also put in place a system to acquire them.</p><p> The agency has been working with NAMA, the Department, local authorities and approved housing bodies since 2011 to utilise properties that were part of the security to loans taken over by NAMA.  To date, 2,378 properties have either been delivered or contracted for delivery to the social housing sector.  It is important to note that many of these properties were vacant properties and, in most cases, required significant investment by NAMA through the property owners and receivers to make them suitable for provision as homes.</p><p> Significant work has been ongoing to resolve the main proportion of unfinished housing developments since 2010.  The number of these developments has decreased from 2,846 to fewer than 500 in that period.  A key aspect of the process was to identify and collect detailed data and undertake surveys on an annual basis on each development.  In addition, significant time was required to engage with developers, receivers and banks on resolving the specific issues for each development.  The lessons learned from this process are the need for good data, ongoing monitoring, stakeholder engagement and co-operation, and results orientation.  These lessons are important in informing the approach to dealing with vacant housing and sites.</p><p> Regarding derelict sites and underused spaces, the effective implementation of the vacant sites levy is critical.  This was introduced under the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015 and imposes a levy of 3% of the market value of sites that are identified in a register of residential development sites and regeneration sites.  Each local authority is preparing a register of relevant sites that meet certain criteria, including whether the sites are serviced and viable and there is a demand for housing in the area.  The findings from other countries indicate that a site tax is an effective way of promoting housing supply and utilising vacant sites.</p><p> The two most important actions in addressing vacant housing are to identify vacant properties and to engage property owners.  I cannot overemphasise this.  We are pleased to elaborate on or discuss the points raised and provide more information to the committee as it sees fit.  Again, I thank the committee for this opportunity to make a contribution on these important issues.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for the invitation.  I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Joe McGuinness from Louth County Council, and Ms Catherine Keenan from D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  With the Acting Chairman's permission, I will not read the full written statement.  I might comment on and elaborate on some of the topics that have arisen here already.  Regarding voids, we in the local authorities are more aware of the reality than anybody else.  We are at the interface, along with some of the non-governmental agencies, of the distressed housing situation.  We are working to significantly improve the voids situation regarding our stock.  We are satisfied that significant measures have been implemented during recent years, and they continue to be implemented.  During the past two or three years, the Government and the Department have made available funding of approximately &euro;30 million of &euro;40 million per year, which has been particularly helpful in void recovery.  It is bringing about significant improvement and will bring further improvement this year.  All local authorities are moving towards choice-based letting, which will bring a further improvement in tenanting.  We are satisfied that by the end of the year we will have a good handle on the overall voids position.</p> <p>  Sometimes, the voids situation is presented in a facile manner.  A number of matters are certain.  Our statistics on return of voids in 2015 showed it took around 20 weeks to return voids.  The figure is very significantly skewed by long-term regeneration projects.  There is no such thing as a zero-week return, given that we must go through the letting process at a minimum.  We have to do basic inspections on the properties and even when we get back a really good property, it takes some weeks to re-let it, no matter how we go about it.  We are satisfied that we are getting a handle on it.  We are not for a minute saying we are there, but we are getting there.  We are in a better position and we will be in a better position by the end of the year.</p> <p>  In the written document we submitted, I have commented on some of the matters of consequence regarding the timeframes.</p><p>When it is broken down, we are spending an average of &euro;13,000 per individual unit.  In a way, we are not getting back normal vacancies for re-letting.  With the private rental market the way it is, people are not leaving local authority housing to go to the private sector.  They may have done so historically through moving job or other factors.  There is a slightly different scenario than used to exist previously.  We now tend to get back older stock, often due to the demise of the tenant.  Some of that stock can be 60 years old, reflecting the age and longevity of the tenants involved.  We are also getting back some stock which is fire-damaged or otherwise significantly damaged.</p><p> Local authorities have a statutory obligation to house everyone.  A cohort of our tenant population has a difficulty in capacity terms of managing the houses.  As a consequence, significant interventions must be made.  Our position is that when we are re-letting those houses, we are actually re-letting a home for a long-term proposition to meet not just people&rsquo;s housing needs but to give them a home.  We are conscious of returning a unit to a standard which will allow them a good quality of life for 30 years.</p><p> In terms of doing work which averages at a quantum of &euro;13,000 and doing it in the context of health and safety around people in the home, that is not viable.  We are concentrating on getting the time down significantly.  We are beginning to succeed with that.</p><p> Capacity in the construction sector was referred to earlier.  I would not go any stronger than to say we would like to see more competition in the marketplace.  In some instances, we are not seeing massive competition.  In our view, it impacts only a little bit on price but it impacts more on time.  No more than a private householder will find, getting a contractor to turn up when they say they will, and do what they said they will in the time they said, is becoming a little more difficult.</p><p> Significant concentration needs to be placed on vacant properties in the private sector because there is low-hanging fruit to be got at.  I am not trying to be negative but I will point out some difficulties which were not encountered previously.  Over the past six months, Waterford City and County Council is involved in a repair to lease scheme while Louth County Council is involved in the buy and renew scheme.  While the period might not provide substantive statistics, we have some experience in this area.  Waterford city is not in the worst position in that it is an old historical city centre with small streets and older properties.  On the edges of that, we have housing of different standards and ages.  Our experience is that we have had significant interest.  We will deliver 40 units this year and could easily end up delivering 80 to 100 units.  If we were to do that over several years, it would add to a substantial number of units.</p><p> I agree with Mr. John O&rsquo;Connor from the Housing Agency in that we need to get more data quickly.  We would have done some work on the ground in the electoral districts reflected in CSO's census reporting on vacancies.  While I would not extrapolate the Waterford figures to the national position, we found there were fewer vacancies than suggested in the CSO figures.  We used local knowledge and sources, even knocking on the doors of houses next to vacant sites, to ascertain what the case was.  In some cases, the figures were 50% less than the census data.</p><p> We were finding two primary causes.  First, in the older areas of the city, houses or over-the-shop units were unfit for occupation and needed physical intervention.  They could range from substantial dereliction requiring major renovation in some cases to adaptation for disabled access.  The second reason was financial or legal distress.  Legal can involve probate or intestacy issues while financial involves a bank trying to recover a property or abandonment due to financial distress.  Some of those houses affected were historical buy-to-let properties.</p><p> The instruments available to county councils to deal with derelict or underused sites include the Derelict Sites Act and compulsory purchase powers, attendant on either the Derelict Sites Act or general planning and housing legislation.  Sites which are derelict, or lying idle for long enough to become derelict, are generally in distress in terms of ownership or otherwise.  Historically, we have found that the derelict sites levy, a 3% levy which can be applied to the valuation of the property which tends to be low on derelict sites, is non-functional.  We cannot collect it and it places a burden on properties which are already burdened by distress in some form or other.  That is not insignificant in the context of considering a tax on vacant sites.  I would separate that from the vacant site levy, which is targeting viable sites that should not be hoarded and kept out of the marketplace where there is clear ownership, resources and so forth.  That is a different matter to distressed properties which have legal, financial or ownership issues.  One is actually adding more elements to the equation to try to solve the problem.</p><p>We need to be careful.  Like the Housing Agency, I would love to see greater detail because we need it.  Even if we say there are not as many vacant properties, there are still a lot of them by any stretch of the imagination and we agree that we need to get there.  The committee can be sure that we see ourselves as having a role.  We would be worried about the resource demands because we are coming off a base of very little data.  About 30 or 40 year ago, property rates were there and we held all the data in terms of the ownership of property but that data is not there now.  The work we have done locally involves literally knocking on doors and doing the legal searches and all the other things that are required to get there.  </p><p> For all that, we welcome the repair and lease scheme because it allows us to get at the low-hanging fruit reasonably quickly.  In respect of the ad in the newspaper, if people are suffering a capital deficiency and if the figure of &euro;30,000 or &euro;40,000 allows it to be brought back, it gives us an instrument that did not previously exist.  My understanding is that the Minister intends to make it a national scheme straightaway and we would recommend accordingly because there is a reasonably quick win there.  In respect of following through with some analysis of vacant sites, there are other instruments but simply taxing them may be a bit simplistic because there are issues to be considered.  </p><p> Another area I would like to address is the compulsory purchase order, CPO, powers we have.  We certainly have CPO powers.  There are a few difficulties with them.  It is one of the reasons local authorities only pull the power when there are compelling reasons to do so.  Some of it derives from our historical constitutional position on property because down through the years, our court cases have been based on the right to ownership of property.  The CPO scenario has a few features.  Yes, we can carry out compulsory purchase but it leaves uncertain cost and a timeframe difficulty in terms of arbitration processes that seriously compound things.  In respect of compulsory purchase, you push the button - in fairness, An Bord Plean&aacute;la is very good in terms of the timeframe for making decisions - it is a two to three-month process and you come out it, conclude and serve notice to treat.  The valuation of the property is to be fixed at the valuation of the date when the order is completed.  However, you are uncertain about what that valuation is because until the statutory property valuer concludes the process, every owner is entitled to go to arbitration and we generally have to carry their costs, which is the other issue here.  The timeframe in respect of the valuation process is significant and runs into a year or over a year generally speaking.  In budgetary terms, this makes it very uncertain about what you have to pay and when you have to pay it.  The other very significant element here is that there is a really significant cost associated with the CPO process.  I can give the committee examples.  One example involved us doing a CPO where the valuation was defined at &euro;500,000 but the costs ran into the middle part of between &euro;100,000 and &euro;200,000.  That makes that property really expensive.  Where you have complexity around the ownership, marriage values and any other things that go with it, it is an uncertainty in valuation and budgetary terms that retards people from pulling that trigger.  I am sorry for using that term but that is the reality.  There has been a bit of resistance to using it unless a compelling reason exists.  If you were to take it in the extreme, even though I cannot cite an example, you could be looking a derelict house that would be only &euro;30,000 or &euro;40,000 but the same costs or half of those costs could accompany it so that what was a reasonable value could end being significantly more expensive once you carry out the refurbishment.  I would like the committee to understand that.  </p><p> I thank the committee and assure it that our people are at the coal face of this, a point I was very glad to hear somebody reflect earlier.  We are very aware of the pressures in society in terms of this problem.  We are not right all the time.  We do not say that for a minute.  The way I would put it is that we are doing our best in difficult circumstances but I welcome the opportunity to present to the committee.  </p></speech>

In particular, I welcome Ms Catherine Keenan, who is director of services in Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, a council with which I am more familiar.  I again thank the witnesses for submitting their presentations in advance.  This gives us the great advantage of being able to read them and in some way prepare the questions we may put to the witnesses.  In his submission, Mr. O'Connor talked about Part 5 of the Government's action plan.  We all know that the priority in Rebuilding Ireland is to focus on utilising existing stock, particularly in Pillar 5.  Local authority representatives appeared before us.  We are focusing on vacant houses, derelict sites and underused spaces this morning.  There was a lot of repetition in all the presentations because we all know it is the same problem.  There are different suggestions as to how we might address it.  Based on my own experience and on talking to a number of local authorities, there is a lack of hard facts and hard data.  I am talking about public housing.  Dublin City Council was mentioned this morning.  I do not want to go into that but the amount of property on the books of that council was shared with us earlier and is quite alarming.  I would like to hear, particularly from the CCMA, about how they are centralising their registers for their property and land assets.  In 2015, the Local Government Audit Service raised a number of issues relating to a substantial amount of the 31 local authorities in terms of the transfer of that data from paper files and registers to an electronic system and the mapping of all of that.  That is an important aspect of fully understanding what is needed.</p> <p>  Mr. Pat Doyle from the Peter McVerry Trust spoke here this morning.  He said that his experience with local authorities was always very positive.  That was really interesting.  He spoke about the enormous goodwill, expertise and specialist resources and commitment in local authorities.  I thought that was really encouraging and I wanted to share it with the witnesses.  It is not a criticism of local authorities but perhaps we need to hear whether they have the necessary resources and funding because it is about funding and resources to do the job really well.  Perhaps the witnesses might share their views on this.  </p> <p>  The witnesses spoke about compulsory purchase.  I am also aware that this is a huge burden.  I am hearing that local authorities are very reluctant to proceed with compulsory purchase given litigation issues, issues relating to the constitutional right to property and proper legal mapping of title of properties.  There are family legal issues surrounding some properties, which is why they are vacant.  We know about the fair deal scheme.  There are short-term properties in certain parts of Dublin - very good and well-maintained properties that are empty for reasonably long periods of time.</p><p>Could the witnesses please share that information with us because it is an important issue?  Looking at the register of the National Oversights &amp;amp; Audit Commission and the league table, if one likes, for 2015, I wish to again single out D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council as it is the lowest in terms of the directly provided dwellings that were vacant as of 31 December 2015 with 0.66%.  It is the local authority with the lowest level of all local authorities, which is encouraging.  It is closely followed by Kilkenny County Council and South Dublin County Council.  However, there is a huge gap after those three.  I accept it is a case of horses for courses and things are different in different areas.  I wish to refer to one or two issues before I conclude.</p><p> The Housing Agency has a &euro;70 million fund which is available for the acquisition of vacant sites.  What is the source of the funding?  How has that come about?  Figures have been set out for the amount of houses that have been acquired.  Could we have a breakdown in terms of the 31 local authorities as to where the houses were purchased and how they are distributed within local authorities?  We need to have more facts and evidence-based information.  It would be very helpful for the committee if we could see where the properties have been acquired in the 31 local authorities and how the properties have been distributed among the local authorities.</p><p> I talked about derelict sites and I accept there is a challenge in that regard.  On local authorities preparing a register for the relevant sites, that is really important for the private sites but, first, let us face it, local authorities have vast amounts of sites on their own books and we cannot be judge and jury in all of these matters.  We need to see a definitive register of those sites.</p><p> Turning to the CCMA, I am struck by Mr. Walsh's practical, hands-on approach in his commentary today.  Many of the issues ring a bell.  It is very interesting to hear it as it is, and he put it over really well in terms of some of the challenges.  It is clear we will see another report soon for 2016 on letting times.  I hope we will be able to compare it to 2015 and see further improvements.  I do not think anyone is delaying matters.  Mr. Walsh set out very eloquently and clearly the complexities and the need to get houses right.  They must be right and appropriate for people as they are their homes.  It is not all a numbers game.  The houses must be high quality and compliant with the regulations.  That is really important.</p><p> Previous speakers, including Deputy Casey, spoke about the potential for identifying sites especially in urban areas.  There has been much talk about empty space.  I spoke to someone recently in Athy, County Kildare, which is a place that is full of empty properties on the main streets that have been consistently refused planning permission for residential, and in some cases it was only sought for the upstairs.  There have been derelict shops on the main street for up to ten years.  There are about 14 pubs empty in the town and a use cannot be found for them.  There is a reluctance on the part of local authorities to change the use, based on rates.  It is clear that there are other factors such as the streetscape, urban design and the public realm.  One is especially conscious of that in the case of heritage towns or market towns but a lot more could be done.</p><p> The more information we can get the better on the 31 local authorities, and it should be broken down as tat would be really helpful.  We also need some reassurance on the current position of each local authority in terms of the register.  We also need a commitment from local authorities to provide information at a later date on where they are in relation to their own property assets.  It is good corporate governance and makes sense that every local authority would be able to produce a detailed, definitive and comprehensive register and mapping system of its property assets, if the local government auditor were to arrive in any county hall.  That would provide enormous potential for new social and affordable housing.  I thank the witnesses for their presentations.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the work the Housing Agency has been doing in highlighting this, both from the report last year and ongoing work.</p> <p>  I also wish to make a point on local authorities because there are occasions when some people, in particular when they get into the Oireachtas, forget where they have come from and have a tendency to treat local authorities as a whipping boy in terms of the difficulties that exist.  I know, not only from the local authority with which I am most connected, namely, South Dublin County Council, but also in other local authorities that have large housing needs that their housing departments are under enormous stress.  They are dealing with higher levels of demand with lower levels of staff.  I accept that budgets are beginning to improve but it is very important for the committee when we are considering those issues not to conveniently point the finger of blame at local authorities.  That does not mean we should not question or criticise when it is appropriate but some people seem to think, simplistically, that it is a problem for local authorities when very often it is not.</p> <p>  I have some questions for the Housing Agency and then for the County and City Management Association, CCMA.  Could Mr. O'Connor give an update on when he hopes the strategy will be ready and some other information beyond what is in the report?  What I am really interested in is the acquisitions programme.  On 1 December, Deputy Noonan replied in response to a parliamentary question that 922 vacant properties were being considered by the Government.  I presume he meant the Housing Agency.  A total of 500 properties were from Bank of Ireland and 422 were from Permanent TSB.  He said funding approval had been granted for 200 of those and contracts had been signed on 20.  That was the content of the reply to the parliamentary question but my understanding is that the figures are very different from that.  I am interested in three figures.  What is the total number of vacant properties, whether from banks or other sources, that the Housing Agency has been considering since the &euro;70 million fund was announced?  The Housing Agency has told the committee how many properties it is in the process of acquiring.  I want to know how many the agency has rejected as being unsuitable, in particular on the grounds of leading to an over-concentration of social housing.  I wish to come back in on that question because this is quite important.</p> <p>  I am also interested in those properties that have not been deemed unsuitable and where bids have not been made.  How many more are in that category and what is the reason they have not been actively pursued?  Is it because the &euro;70 million fund does not allow the agency to pursue more properties than it is currently doing and that it must sell them on and wait for the money to come back in or is there some other reason?</p> <p>  I will now turn to the CCMA.  When the strategy comes out a whole new set of demands will be put on local authorities in terms of the register and pursuing properties.  Mr. Walsh has already given us an outline of the level of work that involves.  The Minister keeps telling us there is no problem with money or staff.  Is Mr. Walsh confident that with the existing staff complement, in particular for those local authorities like Waterford County Council where there is a high level of vacancy and housing need, there are sufficient resources to do the work that will come down the line?  If, for example, the repair and lease scheme or the repair and buy scheme are rolled out, that is another layer of activity that is required.  Could Mr. Walsh give some sense of the resourcing requirements?</p> <p>  On the derelict and vacant property tax, I do not think anybody in the previous part of the meeting, or those of us who have called for this before, think it is something that can just be applied very quickly and will resolve the problem.  However, to go back to what the Peter McVerry Trust said, it suggested a 12-month window would allow the owners to engage and try to work out solutions.  Is Mr. Walsh's point that something like that is required or is he just against the idea because of the experience he had?  I would be interested in hearing more from him about that.</p> <p>  I accept that compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, have additional costs but it is important that we offset potential additional costs with the cost of, for example, keeping a family in emergency accommodation for two years, which is the case currently in Dublin city.  The cost is &euro;35,000 a year per family and in the Dublin City Council area that amounts to the State spending approximately &euro;70,000 for the average family in emergency accommodation.  Are CPOs a more efficient way when one knows the property is derelict and the owner cannot be traced, as opposed to where it is a probate case or a case of financial distress?  Is Mr. Walsh making the case for legislative change or that CPOs are the wrong instrument and we need to look more at providing a carrot in the form of engagement through the Housing Agency, voluntary bodies and local authorities to incentivise that percentage of the stock that we can get back into active use?</p></speech>

For clarification, I have spoken about staffing and resources in local authorities on several occasions.  Local authority staff do good work in spite of being understaffed.  In my local authority in the past five years we lost 110 staff who have not been replaced.  That is unacceptable.  If someone is on holidays there is no one to replace him or her.  Most staff in all local authorities are put to the pin of their collar.  The position on staffing needs to be clarified.</p><p>I believe the local authorities are doing their best.  Funding is a big issue but staffing is a bigger one.  In respect of derelict sites, a local authority needs to have a timescale for doing up a house.  A local authority house is often left for six months because the authority is understaffed.  That is unacceptable.  A system needs to be put in place to ensure that no local authority house is left vacant for more than six or eight weeks.  There is no need for that.  Sometimes work is done that does not need to be done.  Balance is needed.  There is a protocol in place for houses that come back to local authorities.  It is not the fault of the staff.  </p><p> Many of the problems with derelict houses, whether owned by the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, or the local authority, are health and safety issues.  No one today has brought this up.  Some houses in private or local authority estates which were bought in the Celtic tiger days and repossessed by the banks have to be boarded up.  The local authority has to do this.  It is a health and safety issue because young people gather there and people dump rubbish.  If NAMA is handing houses to the local authority, the authority needs to consider the big picture.  They will house families, which is crucial but they are an eyesore.  They draw anti-social behaviour and rubbish because people are not paying for bin collections.</p><p> People come to me because their house has been repossessed by the bank and I have to find out who owns it but the witness is right that years ago local authorities had far more powers.  We need to give them more powers to do things like that.  My local authority held a meeting a few nights ago about St. Patrick's Day.  We are trying to make sure the derelict buildings on the main street look good.  I believe the local authority is doing its best.  Carlow, like Waterford, is part of the repair and lease scheme and there have been concerns about it because 22 people have expressed an interest and eight have qualified.  Like everything it has teething problems but I hope the Housing Agency will address this problem and see why those other people did not qualify.  The scheme will house people and the houses will go back to the local authorities.  I do not know what the uptake in Waterford is but 12 in Carlow did not qualify.  The timescale for local authorities to repair houses, their funding and staffing need to be addressed. </p><p> The rapid build programme is good for Dublin, Cork and Limerick but it does nothing for rural counties.  We would love to have a rapid build programme.  The Housing Agency needs to come up with an overall plan because there are many problems.  I know the witnesses are doing their best but the simple things they are not addressing are causing the friction.  That is where we are falling down.</p></speech>

The Minister's intention is to publish the vacant housing strategy in March.  A working group is working on it but it is up to the Minister and the Government to decide what initiatives they will take.  It is very important to identify the properties.  There is the issue of the data and the hard facts.  We have been examining the various sources of data, some from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, although it will not give us addresses.  We are working on the geodirectory which has the data for the whole country because postmen identify vacant property.  We have been talking to the Revenue Commissioners about the local property tax because they have names and addresses which they are prepared to share with the local authority.  In the first instance we will provide lists of addresses to each local authority in the country to work on and see how good their data is.  Engaging with property owners is critical to finding out why properties are vacant and whether they can be brought back into use.  The legal and financial issues that Michael Walsh raised are often major issues for property owners.</p> <p>  As for what might be in the vacant home strategy, the measures outlined by the Peter McVerry Trust are sensible with the exception perhaps of introducing a property tax too soon.  Michael Walsh highlighted that.  Many property owners are in financial distress or have legal problems.  Receivers have been appointed to a vast number of buy to let properties.  Introducing a property tax at this stage, without knowing the detail, might not be wise because the people we try to impose it on might not be in a position to pay.  All the other measures the trust mentioned were sensible. </p> <p>  It is very important to give the local authorities the resources to deal with vacant homes and that their staff engage with, and talk to, property owners and get properties back into use.  </p> <p>  I will ask Ms Dillon to outline what we have learned from our engagement with England, Scotland and Wales.  </p> <p>  The fund for acquisitions comes from the Exchequer but it is to be used as working capital.  Approved housing bodies will use a payment availability agreement and capital advanced leasing facility, CALF, funding, a combination of current and capital funding.  Our fund is a recycled fund.</p> <p>  We started work on this last September and have screened 1,485 properties from various providers.  We have seen 690 properties owned by the banks, primarily the Bank of Ireland and AIB.</p><p>The information regarding Permanent TSB might not be correct.  We have not had a major engagement with it during this initiative.  Together, Bank of Ireland and AIB have offered 690 properties and we made bids on 347 of those properties.  Sometimes, even when we are making bids, the bank may have appointed receivers or the properties might have already been sold on.  That is the kind of scale.</p><p> We are looking at properties from other providers and developers.  With those we might often decide it would be best for the local authorities or approved housing bodies to engage directly in acquiring properties.  We act when it is important to act quickly.  In some cases it is better for a local authority or approved housing body to undertake the transaction.  In some cases we are just buying in trust for the local authority so the local authority is actually the purchaser.  We can provide details of that.</p><p> The Senator asked where the properties are.  We will provide the committee with a county-by-county list of the numbers of properties.  We are happy to provide that detail on our website.  There are properties all around the country.</p></speech>

The rapid-build homes that local authorities are approving are all in areas with a high concentration of social housing and the same applies to the new builds.  Are different criteria being applied for overconcentration here?  I would assume that some of those 221 properties, which are in areas that are deemed to be overconcentrated, are in private estates which probably do not have more than 10% social housing.  I ask Mr. O'Connor to allay concerns some politicians may have that properties that are suitable in terms of the unit may not be deemed suitable because of political or community sensitivities because it would be over the 10% or 20% social housing, whereas in other areas of social housing provision that is not a criterion that is applied.</p> <p>  Of the properties that the Housing Agency has not bid for and which have not been deemed unsuitable, how many are still there?  Is the problem that it does not have enough money to move to acquire those at this stage or is something else going on?</p></speech>

At the moment it is not an issue.</p> <p>  The properties being offered under the acquisition initiative are primarily buy-to-let properties dotted around the place, so we are not dealing with a concentration issue.  The local authorities have been very responsive in giving us quick feedback on whether the properties are located in an area suitable for social housing.  The main reason a local authority would deem a property unsuitable would be if it is remote from a city, town or village.  The local authority might have some specific information about an issue with the development, but that does not arise much.  We carry out inspections and valuations of the properties, and sometimes we do not proceed with them because of the condition of the property.  On the acquisition side in our view local authorities have been acting reasonably and have been very helpful because of their local knowledge.</p> <p>  The concentrations would relate more to the NAMA acquisitions.  In our opinion local authorities have taken a reasonable position on the NAMA acquisitions.  We talk about a figure of 7,000.  The number offered to local authorities was more of the order of 5,000 because 2,000 had already been sold or let.  Local authorities typically took about 50% of the properties.  We are happy to provide all the information on the acquisitions to the committee.</p> <p>  I will ask Ms Dillon to give the committee a flavour of the vacant housing strategy and her engagement with the UK in particular.</p></speech>

We particularly focused on the UK because it has been actively engaged and it has been a priority for the past 25 years to look at vacant properties.  In England there is a 2.5% vacancy rate.  Many of the councils in England have their own action plans and much of the work done on vacant homes is based within the councils.  Many of the councils have empty homes officers.</p> <p>  For example, Kent has a so-called "No Use Empty" scheme, which is a support mechanism for the local authorities there.  The "No Use Empty" scheme supports home owners and councils, and it administers grants.  Councils in England can also apply an increase in the property tax.</p> <p>  In Scotland the housing charity, Shelter, runs the Scottish empty homes partnership.  That provides advice and support to owners and local councils, and it administers loans.  It also very effectively operates a networking scheme that has buy-in from the local councils.  Shelter claims that 80% of homes in Scotland have been brought back through the use of advice and support given either through Shelter or directly by the councils, which is significant.</p> <p>  In Wales all local authorities are obliged to have action plans and identify targets.  Wales has a house to homes scheme offering interest-free loans for a period of two to three years.  Private owners can apply for such a loan to bring homes back into use.  That seems to have been very effective.  Empty Homes Wales is an organisation that supports home owners.  Other actions in Wales include a VAT reduction on materials for owners doing up vacant homes.  Interestingly in Wales many of the grant schemes are tied into providing added value.  For example, there are grant schemes that help first-time buyers to buy vacant properties and also to improve the sustainability of properties.</p> <p>  The lesson to be learned from that is that it is a holistic approach, with the emphasis on providing information.  It is about identifying vacant homes and providing support to owners.  In certain cases they have a number of grants available and in exceptional cases they bring in enforcements.  That type of holistic approach will inform the strategy.</p></speech>

We know our own but we do not necessarily know the collective.  I would not conflate the property register and the broad issue.  We have an obligation to maintain an asset register and every property across the board is supposed to be on that.  There is an issue of transferring historical paper records into that.  While it might be slightly different in the bigger local authorities, in my case I think I would personally know every potential site for housing in the local authority area.  If I did not, certainly one of our staff would know that.</p><p>I do not think it is a major issue.  Certainly, it can be an issue to get the land for those seeking to buy it or otherwise.  However, I do not believe there is an issue with regard to the knowledge of what is available in terms of our internal property holdings.</p><p> Reference was made to derelict shops, rates and change of use.  I would not disagree with the point made.  As the law stands, there is an obligation to apply for change of use.  In general terms, I would be open to some way to mitigate the process, perhaps by designation of a particular area, in some towns and villages, because it is something of an issue.  Some commercial units are unlikely to return to commercial use in the medium term.  In many of these instances, they need to transition to residential use.  We have discussed the idea of living communities in the middle of our towns and villages.  The idea could and should be considered.</p><p> I was asked whether I was confident that the resources were available.  I will offer what might be considered a clich&eacute;d answer in some respects.  As chief executives and directors of services, we have to designate resources as required.  Certainly, we will approach the Department on some elements and we engage in continuing dialogue.</p><p> I have a slight concern on the question of lease and repair, especially with regard to the body of work undertaken by Mr. O'Connor.  It relates to empty home officers and collating or collecting the data generally.  If we are to get a big hit in this area, we would need to commit significant resources quickly.  We need to understand the issue fully.  Certainly, we use all the resources available to us.  Let us consider the vote for the housing budget.  Between the Department, local authorities and the approved housing bodies, last year we spent every cent available and we will do so again this year.  We are ramping up our building programme significantly.  In reality, there is a two-year window.  Ten years ago, we built 6,000 or 7,000 houses.  We will get back to that level again within two or three years.  The figures will be more like 1,500 this year and 2,500 next year.  That is the territory we are in.  Anyway, we will hit the Rebuilding Ireland overall targets, subject to the overall availability.</p><p> We have come through eight or ten years of recession.  Local authority budgets took a hammering at every level in that period.  Are we back following the recovery?  Our staff numbers are down.  Local authorities were among the first affected in the public service.  We were forced to adapt by watching the financial position from day to day.  We are down perhaps more than 20% in terms of staff.  Our ability to increase the levels is limited as of yet in the context of the recovery.  It varies across authorities.  Anyway, we have to manage that at a local level.  Certain pressures come to bear, especially on the staffing side in the housing area.  We are mindful of that at chief executive level.  We will be trying to resource it to the greatest possible extent within our overall resource pool.</p><p> Reference was made to the 12-month window.  I will address the lease-and-repair question in that context.  In some respects, the lease and repair option suits those who have capital or cases in which there is a capital problem.  We need to find the stick to use with that carrot.  In that case, a tax could be an option as long as it relates only to the capital issue.  If we put a tax on top of a distressed property, that is to say, where there is financial distress of substance, we only compound the problem &ndash; that has been my experience.  More data is needed, as is more understanding, before we make the jump.  We might be unable to differentiate between the various categories.</p><p> We use CPOs, although perhaps I over-emphasised the point earlier.  We use CPOs and we are happy to do so.  In many instances, it is relatively straightforward to operate the process.  If there is a single owner or if we know the risk is not great, we use the process.  I take the point about the basic cost relative to other costs that arise.  Anyway, we try to manage the overall budget to attain the greatest possible efficiency.  The area is becoming increasingly complex and a wider range of initiatives are in place now than were ever in place previously.  They are all needed in that context - we do not argue about that.</p><p> Reference was made to NAMA and to supply in general.  From our point of view, overall housing supply is the big-ticket issue.  Regardless of where people reside, whether in Louth, D&uacute;n Laoghaire or Waterford, we need more houses immediately.  The question of whether we use NAMA properties or otherwise is something of a different argument.  One point has struck me, although I was not centrally involved.  Many of those properties were offered in blocks of 300 and 400.  We are simply not going there &ndash; that is the end of that story.  Many adjoined existing significant blocks.  The question was whether it was feasible to take those and attain some sense of a sustainable community in terms of mix of tenure and so on.  That was the predominant reason, although there was no demand in some instances.  No local authority would have chosen lightly to refuse to take housing that was readily available.  We need to look at the overall sum.  Last year, we used a number of acquisitions because they represented great value.  This was the case in many areas where we were not distorting the market.  We used every available shilling from the Vote for housing last year and we will do so again this year.  That is the simple reality.</p><p> Reference was made to the eligibility issue for lease and repair.  I am unsure as to what is the position but I will examine the matter.  This issue arose in several instances.  The basic eligibility requirement is that a property has to be vacant for a given period.  A person cannot come in and get a refurbishment job done on an existing leasable property.  Some rules must apply.  Other than that, reasonable discretion applies.  We are only leaning the lessons now on the lease-and-repair provisions.  We genuinely believe a considerable amount of low-hanging fruit is available.  Mr. McGuinness might wish to comment.  I gather the experience of buy and repair arrangements in Louth is similar.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-01a.239" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe McGuinness" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017020100002#S00200"><p>There has been some learning in respect of the buy-and-renew scheme in Louth.  We utilised the CPO process. I will offer some background and link it back to the buy-and-renew scheme.  We have acquired approximately 26 units through the CPO process.  Some were acquired by agreement once we started the process.  When we started, the intention was to deal with estate management issues.  Anti-social behaviour was emanating from derelict houses.  The units in question had to be taken back into stock and put into productive use.  We took advantage of that.</p> <p>  During the process, we learned a good deal.  We took acquired 26 units.  In approximately 60% of those cases, ownership was held by finance houses.  It is interesting that none of these houses were offered to the Housing Agency.  They are not on the market and we have taken them back into productive use.  The balance of the units are similar to the units Mr. Walsh referred to earlier, that is, they are subject to will disputes or legal disputes.  Other cases may involve an owner sitting on a property where there is a substantial structural issue and the property requires significant investment in order to bring it back into use.  We have learned from the process.</p> <p>  Mr. Walsh is perfectly correct about CPOs.  There are occasions when we have backed out of the CPO process because of significant cost issues.  We are charged by An Bord Plean&aacute;la for the hearing of any CPO cases.  That arises even before we get to arbitration.  Generally, the units we acquire are in the category costing from &euro;5,000 to &euro;60,000.  It is at the lower level.  Each case is treated as an individual case and, therefore, each will attract its volume of cost, etc.</p> <p>  We have learned from the process.  This links back to the buy-and-renew scheme.  It has been suggested that the repair-and-lease arrangement should be limited to expenditure up to &euro;40,000.  All the units we have acquired will have expenditure ranging from &euro;60,000 to &euro;120,000.  The older the property, the greater the expenditure.  If a property was built in the 1940s, we are likely to have to spend &euro;100,000 to bring it up to scratch.  That is a significant issue.  That is a likely impact for us when the scheme comes out.  Moreover, these properties will be new voids for the local authority once we bring them across the line.  In addition, we will be acquiring units that will be in as bad, if not worse, condition as our existing voids.  There will be a resource issue for us in managing the procurement and the refurbishment of those properties.</p><p>It will have a detrimental effect on our service indicators because it will show the number of our voids increasing even though we are increasing the stock.  This is just a factor to bear in mind.  The buy-and-renew scheme being suggested will attract some promotion etc., so it will be interesting to see what comes across the line, but the issue of the &euro;40,000 threshold is a significant one.  I am not necessarily convinced the property owners will be knocking on our door because according to the conversations I have had, people still want to hold onto their property.  They are very interested in the repair-and-lease scheme, but the &euro;40,000 threshold will be an issue.  Our experience is that in the cases of the bad properties, a significant amount of money needs to be expended to bring them into proper, effective use.</p></speech>

That is interesting and is below the 6% base rate expected in a functioning market due to rental gaps, debts etc.<br/><br/>I will address some of the matters brought up.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has concluded Part 8 consultation for a scheme of four units under the living-over-the-shop scheme.  We hope this will provide a model of good practice, which can be replicated in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown area.<br/><br/>Regarding re-letting times, on average, more than 90% of our dwellings are repaired and returned to our allocation section within five weeks at an average cost of &euro;9,000.  We have frameworks in place which have provided us with good value for money.  There can, however, be significant delays in allocating them, and we have a high rate of refusal of almost one third, which brings me to choice-based letting, on which we are working and which we will have in place by March this year.<br/><br/>We have had a planned preventative maintenance programme in place for the past ten years.  In most cases, major upgrade works are carried out on properties with some tenants <i>in situ</i>.  We also use the opportunity of vacant dwellings to upgrade their condition before re-letting.  This can involve rewiring, windows or any other works necessary, as referred to by Mr. Walsh, to provide a home for people.  It is about providing a home.<br/><br/>Regarding Senator Murnane O'Connor's concerns about CPOs, we did acquire one property by way of CPO last year and we have initiated a new CPO this year due to anti-social behaviour.  We are in the process of starting that.</p></speech>

The witnesses might say there are some vacancies, but we now have what we never had before, namely, homelessness clinics, which are chock-a-block.  People cannot find housing, whether rented accommodation or whatever.  Most people do not want to go on housing assistance payment, HAP.  There are the two stories here.  It would be lovely to have people in my local authority to refuse houses because something like six local authority houses were given out last year because none were bought or for whatever other reason.  The perception is that money is available and I am delighted to hear that.  The witnesses were talking about houses.  I will give the committee an example of which I know they are all aware.  The grant given last year for local authority houses, that is, for the builds that had to be done, is gone.  The local authority has spent more than &euro;300,000, so this year it will go back to the Department to look for an extra &euro;500,000.  At least now I can go back and tell those concerned not to tell me no funding is available.  I do not mean this in a bad way and I do not wish to be negative all the time but I find myself constantly making representations for people and going back to them to say there are no houses.  I know there are 2,500 on our local authority housing list.  It is hard when one then hears that money is available.  It is good to know it is available.  All of us here, Senators and Deputies, deal with our local authorities. I know we will not get everything and I know we can only get a certain amount of houses, but it is good to know we will now have extra funding coming in.  Things are starting to change.  I had never seen homelessness clinics until recently.  As I said, I was a councillor for nearly 18 years.  In the past five years, there have been such significant changes.  People are not making the housing list.</p> <p>  I will finish on what I know is probably a different line of comments.  The witnesses are falling down on mortgages.  I have a massive issue with this and I have said it before.  I know the local authorities are not a body of lending agencies but this is where they are falling down.  People will buy these houses and do them up.  Other options need to be considered as well.  I think the repair-and-lease scheme will work, as will the buy-and-renew scheme.  I do not know what the uptake will be on the buy-and-renew scheme.  It must be teased out.  Major issues are not being resolved and work is not being done but, overall, I acknowledge everyone is doing their best.</p></speech>

In Deputy Michael Noonan's reply to the parliamentary question - I have it to hand - he referred to Permanent TSB and stated that it had 466 units it had repossessed in stock and that 422 were vacant.  Mr. O'Connor has stated the units he is looking at primarily involve AIB and Bank of Ireland.  Does this mean he has not been assessing these 422 vacant units?  Are they part of what he has been considering or did I hear him right when he said those figures may not be correct?</p></speech>

For some properties, if there is a second refusal, the process literally must start again.  It is important people understand that there are a number of stages to the process.  Even in the case of choice-based letting, one must advertise the property for a couple of weeks, offer it, get a response from the people and manage Garda vetting at the same time.  This takes a number of weeks, no matter what way one does it.  The process must be followed.  I am sure Ms Keenan is not there yet, but our experience since we have started choice-based letting is that there has been significant improvement in this context.</p></speech>

It is very good.  Do the local authorities intend to buy back many more local authority housing units?  They have bought in both areas: private housing and local authority housing.  Will that be a big thing this year?  Will local authorities have the money again to buy houses rather than build them?  Many houses were bought last year.</p></speech>

The situation is that money has become available only in the past two years in substance.  Historically, in policy and otherwise, this was done through leasing and other measures.  Substantial money has been available.  We used acquisitions as an instrument to even it out.  The reality is that, starting from nought to 60 in terms of development, most projects take two years to go from inception to conclusion, or from when one first had the bad thought of moving onto a site to the completion of a house on the ground.  I think we will see next year and the year after, that we will transition to far more builds.  There will still be some acquisitions in the current year and there are still locations in the country where one does not distort the market and one gets serious value for money on purchases.</p><p>That is generally the situation, but equally we will transition more towards own build, and we estimate we will have 1,500 of these this year and perhaps a further 1,000 in the following year.</p></speech>

I thank Deputies Chambers and O'Callaghan and Senator Black for attending on time.  Apologies have been received from Deputies Clare Daly and Mick Wallace and Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee.</p> <p>  I welcome Ms Madeleine Reid from the Department of Justice and Equality who is with us again this morning, and Ms Helen Curley and Ms Deirdre O'Higgins from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  I thank them for their attendance.</p> <p>  The purpose of the meeting is to have a discussion on COM (2016) 723, a proposed directive on insolvency and restructuring.</p> <p>  The committee requested submissions from a number of stakeholders on this proposal and following this engagement and receipt of submissions, the committee will make a decision on whether it is necessary that a reasoned opinion be sent to the D&aacute;il.  Our meeting this morning will help to inform that.  We have received a couple of responses, is that the case?  Excuse me, I am informed it is just one at this time.</p></speech>

Please note that witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. Members should be aware that under the salient rulings of the chair, members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> The format of the meeting is that I will invite both Ms Reid and Ms Curley to make opening remarks.  Is that the agreed position or will Ms O'Higgins be involved as well?  I will leave it open to the witnesses to make any such contribution.  This will be followed by a questions and answers session.  Would the witnesses like to indicate how they themselves would like to proceed?</p></speech>

Both of our Departments are working on this proposal, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on company insolvency and the Department of Justice and Equality on personal insolvency and bankruptcy.  We have prepared a joint opening statement and we believe the easiest course would be if I briefly present the key points of the opening statement and then we will both respond to questions, depending on members' preferences.</p></speech>

The first meeting took place on 16 January.  It was a fairly exploratory meeting.  A lot of member states were still analysing the proposal.  We are expecting eight meetings altogether by the end of the Maltese Presidency at the end of June.  The main activity for our Departments at the moment in preparation of our response has been the launch of a joint public consultation after the proposal came out in mid-December.  We have allowed until the end of January for submissions to reach us but we have had a number of indications that stakeholders would like more time to prepare their submissions.  We are very pleased to have that level of engagement.  We would prefer to get reflective submissions, so we will be extending time to facilitate them coming in to us.</p> <p>  In common with other member states, Ireland has not adopted a position on the Commission initiative as of yet.  We are still examining the proposal and its supporting documents.  Along with other member states in the Council working party, we are clarifying certain aspects with the Commission.  We are anxious to have the results of the consultation with stakeholders before we work on finalising our initial views on the proposal.  We have some initial concerns which will inform some of the questions we are asking and we have drawn attention to those in the scrutiny note which was submitted to the Oireachtas before Christmas.</p> <p>  Looking at the legal context of the proposal, essentially this is a directive to harmonise the substantive law of member states in relation to insolvency law for the first time.  There is existing EU legislation but it is limited to regulating cross-border aspects of insolvency law.  It does not try to harmonise member states' national law.  It is also relevant to note that the Commission produced a recommendation on restructuring and second chance in 2014 which put forward a number of non-binding recommendations to member states covering a lot of the ground now covered in this proposal.  The Commission was not happy that member states did not change their laws immediately in response to that.  Most member states were still heavily involved in negotiations on the cross-border insolvency regulation which was being recast at that stage.</p> <p>  In terms of the scope of the proposal and who is affected by it, it would cover both company and personal insolvency law to some extent and also bankruptcy law in Ireland.  It applies to an individual entrepreneur, which is defined widely and would include any person carrying on a trade, business, craft or profession.  It does not cover what one might describe as pure consumers with insolvency debts, but member states have the option to include them if they so wish.  The directive focuses on substantive insolvency law in relation to restructuring, second chance and the effectiveness of restructuring procedures.  It adopts a fairly detailed, and at times very prescriptive, approach to many of those aspects.  It does not just set out general principles that member states can decide how to apply in practice in their own national legal systems.  The objectives that the Commission's proposal refers to include facilitating capital markets union.  The Commission has stated that it intends to address barriers to the free flow of capital.  The objectives also include the Single Market strategy, which advocates a better second chance opportunity for entrepreneurs, and perceptions that differences between national insolvency laws are creating difficulty for saving businesses that are in trouble and keeping businesses afloat.</p> <p>  I will briefly look at the main issues that we are addressing in our ongoing examination.  The objectives of the proposal, such as avoiding unnecessary insolvencies, saving jobs and promoting second chance, are clearly worthy of support, and Irish law is relatively advanced in the EU in that respect.  The means that the proposal has chosen have to be seen in the context of other member states' insolvency frameworks.  Most members states still have a much more penal approach to companies recovering from debt.  The proposal does not always seem particularly suited to Irish national laws and frameworks.  We are looking at whether the proposal overall would add value or reduce the effectiveness of Irish insolvency law.  We already provide for much of what is proposed but some of the detailed requirements, as currently drafted, do not seem to fit with some important provisions of Irish law which are working well.  We see some difficulties in the approach to organisation of the courts.  The directive sets rules which might be difficult to reconcile with the independence of the Judiciary.  There are some very cumbersome data requirements which would be quite onerous, and we wonder whether they are proportionate in the light of overall priorities in the area of insolvency.</p> <p>  The last point I would draw attention to is that this proposal is based on Internal Market articles of the treaty, so while it is being dealt within the framework of Justice and Home Affairs, unlike most such proposals, it does not afford Ireland the right to opt out of this legal instrument if it so wishes.  This would be governed by the normal qualified majority voting in Council.</p><p>That is our initial presentation, and we would be very happy to respond to questions.</p></speech>

Is that what this seeks to do?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-01a.274" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Deirdre O'Higgins" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017020100002#C00400"><p>I think that they are not looking at this in the context of Irish law, because a lot of what is in the proposed directive is fairly similar to what is in Irish law already, and it would appear that the drafters, in considering this, have looked at Irish law to a significant extent.  They are looking significantly at countries that do not have that type of rescue mechanism.  They want to ensure that all countries have rescue mechanisms and that the rescue mechanisms they have are broadly similar in order that a supplier in one country knows what to expect when trading into a different member state.  That is the reason for European action in this area.</p></speech>

They go to the court because they cannot pay their debts but they do not want to go into liquidation so they get the protection of the court and their loans are restructured, subject to the views of the creditors.  Is this proposed directive similar in terms of an individual availing of that process, or does that process already exist for individuals under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-01a.276" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Madeleine Reid" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017020100002#C00600"><p>Yes.  Under section 115(a) of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 there is a restructuring which can be imposed by the court for individuals in the same way that examinership can.  It has the limitation that it only applies where the person's family home forms part of the debts that are being restructured.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-01a.277" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017020100002#C00700"><p>Am I correct in stating that this directive will only apply to what are defined as entrepreneurs?  An entrepreneur appears to be defined as a natural person exercising a trade, business, craft or profession.  That could exclude a lot of people.  Would that not be so?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-01a.278" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Madeleine Reid" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017020100002#C00800"><p>This is a facultative measure so it would not require us to stop offering the existing personal insolvency protection to individuals.  There is no problem with member states doing more than the directive requires.  Where we might see some difficulties is that the proposal seems to be influenced primarily by Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States.  That seems to have been taken as a familiar model, and I would agree with my colleague that the commission seems to be looking primarily at a large number of member states which do not have anything like this sort of restructuring.  The difficulty is that Chapter 11 does not sit entirely with aspects of our examinership and personal insolvency court review which we think are working well, and we have some concerns about that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-01a.279" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017020100002#C00900"><p>In the presentation it was mentioned that it may impact on the independence of the Judiciary.  Is that because of Article 24, which mentions that they will have to have certain expertise in respective areas?  I may be wrong, but I am just wondering.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-01a.280" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Madeleine Reid" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017020100002#C01000"><p>Even in Irish legislation we do not normally put in provisions requiring members of the Judiciary to have specific training.  It is a little difficult for us to do that.  It is not considered consistent with judicial independence.  There are other provisions which would raise questions as well.  For example, there is a provision requiring cases to be heard in a timely manner.  Again, in Irish legislation, even where we consider that cases are really priority cases, we do not give a direction to the court as to how they are to organise their business.  We put in timelines for the parties, but we do not direct the Judiciary as to how they are to organise their lists.</p></speech>

My understanding of what this proposal would do is to reduce the protections that are currently enjoyed by entrepreneurial people through Irish legislation.  Is that a correct interpretation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-01a.282" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Deirdre O'Higgins" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017020100002#C01200"><p>That is the fear we would have.  There are certain areas of examinership law that we consider offer better protections.  That is our initial view at this point.  We are currently engaging in a consultation and we are interested in what our stakeholders will say to us.  We do have concerns.  We have a viability test at the outset of an examinership where, before we will appoint an examiner, we ask if there is a realistic or reasonable chance of survival.  We brought that in in 1999, when we evaluated how examinership had been operating for the first ten years of its life.  We found out that the success rate was not as high as it should be.  Our view would be that if there is going to interference with the legitimate expectations of creditors to be paid and to be paid on time, it should only be done where it is proportionate.  In the current version of the draft proposals - we stress that they are draft proposals and may not have any resemblance to what will come out of concluded negotiations when member states and Parliament take a view on things - we would be concerned about the testing of viability at the end of a process, which under the current directive may take up to a year.  Creditors could be waiting for a year to be paid.  We have not heard from stakeholders that they share those concerns as yet.  Our consultation closed yesterday.  We will be evaluating what our stakeholders are saying to us and we will be engaging bilaterally with them afterwards to see if it is something that is of concern to them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-01a.283" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1310" speakername="Colm Brophy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017020100002#C01300"><p>There is a key element of having stakeholder consultation, but if there is a perceived risk, that is something that I would be very worried about.  I want to understand where this is coming from.  The gist of the presentation was that due to an underlying, inherently poor system of dealing with this across the EU, the Commission's proposal is a harmonisation proposal . The problem for us as a State is, having progressively implemented in recent years the more advanced process of dealing with it through legislation, ironically the harmonisation process will dilute the value of some of what we have only recently implemented.  Having gone through a process of recently implemented legislation which most of us are happy with and proud of, we are at the risk of regressing, from the point of view of the Commission, to take account of member states who have made no effort to move in this direction.</p> <p>  That to me makes this inherently a very negative proposal for Ireland in terms of how it will impact us.  I am particularly worried in the context of our own national situation on this.  If a large number of EU states with very poor regulation or legislation in this area latch onto this as a step forward, ironically they get their step forward, but we by default get a step back.  That is why I raised the initial concerns about this.  Ms Reid's answer to Deputy O'Callaghan in terms of court and everything else really copperfastened my view that there is very little that is positive in this from an Irish perspective as it stands in terms of enhancing the current legislative way we deal with the situation.  I do not think that there is anything for us in this at all because Chapter 11 is a weaker model than what the EU and Ireland would have looked at in the past.  I am surprised that they have defaulted to a Chapter 11 model for their suggestions.  I just want to confirm that it is a weakening for Ireland, no matter which way we look at this.</p></speech>

In the initial meeting we have had at Council working party level a number of member states that have advanced systems mentioned similar things.</p><p>Given that insolvency is not harmonised at an EU level, the way we all treat it is different.  It is adapted to our own national criteria and requirements.  A number of member states with advanced systems would be concerned that this as currently worded - and I stress "currently worded" - could detract from well-functioning systems.  They would be arguing with the Commission that this should not be the case and inserting proposed amendments to ensure that it changes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-01a.286" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1408" speakername="Frances Black" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017020100002#D00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for coming in.  We know it is vital that companies can continue trading and providing employment across member states.  I wanted to know if the increased priority given to restructuring will result in a higher burden being placed on creditors and employees in terms of wage cuts following restructuring.  Could the lack of court involvement lead to abuse of the new framework?  There was a recent paper published by the Faculty of Law at the University of Oxford.  It raised concerns about this potential abuse where companies are rerouting investment to avail of the favourable conditions of the framework.  It raised questions as to why sale as a going concern where proceeds would be shared among investors was not considered as a favourable insolvency method by the Commission.  What are the witnesses' thoughts on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-01a.287" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Deirdre O'Higgins" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017020100002#D00300"><p>Could we deal with the first issue about wage demands and the situation of workers?  The Commission's intention was that workers' rights are not impacted and their wage demands and entitlements would not be affected by the directive.  In fact, it has excluded this from the final articles of the directive.  We are looking at that in detail to see that that is exactly what has happened because sometimes when one looks at the wording of a piece of legislation and how it interacts with another, one can find that it can have unintended implications.  It is an area that we are examining.  We would be concerned for constitutional reasons about any attempt to remove the courts from the process where any decisions are being made about the rights to private property.  Private property is constitutionally protected, and we would be scrutinising any proposals in that area intently.  The one thing I would point out though is that the directive allows that, where there is a stay on enforcement proceedings,  each member state has a right to ensure that the courts are there.  From that point of view, there is at least some protection in that area.  As the proposal goes forward, it is certainly an issue that we would be dealing with and scrutinising in detail.</p></speech>

If this directive is introduced and transposed into Irish law, is Ms O'Higgins saying then that that will diminish the protections that Irish people have under the legislation on examinership or under the legislation on personal insolvency?</p></speech>

My opinion is that that is wide open to abuse.  It is something many member states will have concerns about.</p></speech>

If we go beyond that as we have done already in the legislation on examinership and personal insolvency, why would that undermine the directive?</p></speech>

If they say that a person in financial difficulty must have access to certain procedures that have the following components in them, one could find that certain aspects of examinership law would have to be looked at to ensure that they were not stopping people going into examinership, which could cause difficulty.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-01a.292" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1310" speakername="Colm Brophy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017020100002#D00800"><p>My understanding is that this is coming in under a harmonisation proposal in the markets area.  So effectively, if we put a proposal, even if we deem it an enhancement in Irish legislation, either further in or as it exists at the present, it could be open to challenge that, effectively under the markets area, we were putting an impediment to the harmonisation process across the markets.  Therefore it could be found to be illegal because it would be a barrier to market or a differentiation between the markets and that is why it is critical that we could get this kickback on our own legislation out of this, primarily because of who is originating this.  One of the key things in Europe is to watch where it comes from as much as what it says, because of how it will be interpreted if it ever goes to the court.</p></speech>

Would anyone like to respond?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-01a.294" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Madeleine Reid" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017020100002#D01000"><p>I suppose there is one concern in the response to the points made by both Deputies.  I agree with the concerns expressed by Deputy Brophy about the possible implications of the proposal.  While a directive normally sets general principles and gives member states the discretion about how they arrive there, the difficulty is that this directive does not take that very general approach.  It is setting quite prescriptive conditions at times and while the mechanisms we have in place offer protection, it is all about how one strikes the exact balance between protecting the situation of debtors and protecting the situation of creditors.  Some of the very prescriptive conditions that are set out in the directive might affect the way that balance is struck in Irish law currently.  It may be reworded as discussions go on but in some situations that balance is struck in a way which refers to specific cultural, social and economic factors within an individual member state.  That is why we would be concerned about some of the possible implications of some of the prescriptive conditions which would be set for the conditions in which a court can decide that a restructure should go ahead, for example.  It seems to change the balance that exists in our legislation at the moment in a way which could create difficulties.</p></speech>

In the witnesses' opinions, would there be sufficient protections going forward for creditors to be able to challenge second chance or restructuring arrangements?  Will there be sufficient protection?  Is there a diminution in relation to the current level of protections for creditors' interests?  For fear we may not ask all the right questions before we conclude this opportunity, I would like all the witnesses to share, in so far as they are comfortable, if there are any other concerns that our questions might not have shone a light on or elicited a response to.  Are there other concerns that the witnesses themselves have that they would like to share with the committee?  We would certainly welcome that.  Proceed in any order that you choose, please.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-01a.296" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Deirdre O'Higgins" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017020100002#D01200"><p> I will start.  The official position on this directive is not yet finalised.  We are still going through it.  We are analysing exactly what is there and taking account of views of stakeholders as they come into us.  We would have some initial concerns in the area that the European Commission is trying to legislate for things that very often we leave to the discretion of the courts or parties.  They are requiring that we put something in our statute to say that new financing is automatically protected.  How it operates in practice in an examinership is something that examiners will be the best people to talk about in detail.  We do not require in law at the moment that new finance is given automatic protection.  If one looks at it practically, with the chances of somebody investing in a company in difficulty and not having any idea that they are going to get that money back, it may not make that much difference in practice but putting it in law straitjackets us into an area that we might not want to be in.</p><p>The second area I would have a concern about is the absolute priority test which is required before one can have a cross-class cram-down.  Again, in practice, we do not know if that makes much difference.  We will be talking to stakeholders about what that actually means.  We will be asked to put something into law to say that in the event of an examinership, one cannot seek to get debt write down from dissenting creditors who are higher up the list of rankings of creditors.  One has to settle their rights before one could look at offering anything to people lower down the line.  We would have a question mark on what impact that might have on examinerships, whether it could force companies into liquidation that might otherwise not go into liquidation.  That is something we will be dealing in detail with the stakeholders.  </p><p> These are two main concerns I would have personally with the directive at this point but let me state that we do not have an official position as of yet.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-01a.298" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1269" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017020100002#E00200"><p>I thank Ms O'Higgins.  Does Ms Reid wish to add to that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-01a.299" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Madeleine Reid" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017020100002#E00300"><p>Coming back to one of the points Deputy Brophy raised when he asked us if there was anything good for Ireland in this proposal, I think elements of the proposal are worth looking at.  There are some elements that we have already considered as additional measures.  One of the possibilities is of access to preventive restructuring before insolvency actually occurs for private individuals.  We do not have that in Irish law at present as the personal insolvency legislation applies from the moment one is insolvent.  I think there is already some visible stakeholder interest in whether it might be worth looking at setting in motion some sort of process to encourage people to be able to start engaging in restructuring before the moment occurs, although the directive is rather vague as to how that would be done.</p> <p>  The difficulty is that to the extent that the directive is putting forward interesting ideas of that sort, we could do all of that voluntarily.  The directive, however, would oblige us to do certain things in a way that would not necessarily sit with our existing legislation and it is for that reason we are scrutinising it carefully, where we feel there might be a negative impact.  I suppose it is also worth bearing in mind that we are a common law member state.  The negotiations on this are likely to continue for some time in Council.  By the time they conclude, we may have no other large common law member state in the European Union.  The continental approach to all of these matters differs quite substantially from ours.  One of the reasons I think that the provisions about courts are more intrusive than what we are used to seeing is that in many continental member states, judges are civil servants effectively.  They are officials of the Government.</p> <p>  Where there might be a negative effect and the Chairman asked about protection of existing rights, I suppose one of the issues we are looking at is the way in which the proposals, as they are drafted at present might change the balance between different types of creditors' protection and between protection of creditors and protection of debtors.  A cross-class cram-down effectively occurs where a court is asked to intervene.  One has a restructuring plan which has been put forward by the individual, some creditors like it but other creditors do not.  It has not got the necessary majority approval under the normal rules.  The court is asked, using criteria which generally refer to the overall good of the economy and society, to decide whether the proposal should be imposed over the objection of some of the creditors.  The absolute priority rule which is being proposed by the proposal at the moment would seem to mean that in that situation somebody like the secured creditors for example would have to be given a priority, which is arguably higher than they would enjoy under examinership, as we know it in Irish law.  That would be quite a significant change but we are looking at the implications of that and what exactly it would entail.</p></speech>

This is the third hearing on the subject which we have included in our work programme for 2017.  Today we will continue our examination of a number of areas, including how governance is supported and promoted by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  We will also continue the discussion on the issue of gender quotas on the boards of State-sponsored governing bodies of sport by seeking the views of the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, and the Minister of State, Deputy Patrick O'Donovan, on how it should be managed.  We have previously heard from the GAA, the IRFU, the FAI, Sport Ireland and the Federation of Irish Sport.  Today the Minister and the Minister of State will have an opportunity to respond to some of their expressed concerns.  I am delighted to welcome the Minister and the Minister of State.  I invite the Minister to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

Before I address the issues outlined by the committee, as this is the first occasion on which I have exclusively addressed sport related issues, I take the opportunity to congratulate all of our sportsmen and women who performed with great success at home and abroad in 2016.  The accomplishments of our athletes at the Olympic and Paralympic Games last summer must be commended.  As well as the two silver medals won by Annalise Murphy and Paul and Gary O'Donovan, Irish Olympians achieved 16 top ten and 14 top 20 finishes.  Our Paralympians won 11 medals and achieved 22 top eight finishes.  Overall, 2016 was an excellent year for elite Irish athletes, with 54 medals won at world and European level in sports supported by Sport Ireland.</p> <p>  I will now address the issues outlined by the committee.  I will be pleased to have a broader discussion on these and other sport related issues.  I thank the committee for giving us advance notice of the topics it wanted to discuss.</p> <p>  It is vital that the highest standards of governance be in place at all levels of Irish sport to ensure accountability, fairness and transparency across organisational activities and to support the integrity of sport, both at home and abroad.  The committee will be aware that Sport Ireland is the statutory body with responsibility for the governance of national governing bodies of sport.  Sport Ireland has an important role to play in governance issues and ensuring taxpayers' money is used to best effect.  It has strong procedures in place for dealing with governance issues and ensuring financial oversight of the national governing bodies funded by it.  In an effort to strengthen good governance practices, we have engaged with Sport Ireland to introduce a mandatory requirement for all national governing bodies in receipt of Government funding through Sport Ireland to adopt the governance code for community, voluntary and charitable organisations.  It will now be mandatory for all national governing bodies funded by Sport Ireland to begin the process of adopting the code during 2017.  The timeframe for progress on a comply or explain basis for the larger sports organisations will be 2019, with 2020 being the timeline for smaller organisations.</p> <p>  Ensuring gender equality in the governance of sport in Ireland is an important objective.  In that regard, a consultation process has commenced with national governing bodies of sport on how best to ensure women's involvement in leadership roles in sport, including the option to require national governing bodies to meet a gender balance target.  A very successful meeting took place on 16 December with representatives from close to 50 sports organisations.  The purpose of the meeting was to discuss approaches to advancing the participation of women in positions of leadership in sport.  This matter is still at discussion stage and a period of consultation is just concluding.  Sport Ireland invited views from the governing bodies of sport, with a deadline of Friday last for the receipt of submissions.  We expect to receive a report from Sport Ireland shortly outlining the findings from the consultation process.  We will then consider the inputs and observations received before decisions are made on how to proceed.</p> <p>  The total amount available for spending on sport this year is just over &euro;112 million.  This includes &euro;6 million in unspent capital which has been carried over from 2016.</p> <p>  On the current side, the budget for Sport Ireland is &euro;49.8 million, an increase of &euro;2.5 million on the 2016 allocation.  This funding will allow Sport Ireland to continue to support participation and high performance programmes in 2017.  In addition, &euro;5 million has been allocated from the dormant accounts fund to my Department to support measures to promote sport in disadvantaged areas.</p> <p>  Sport Ireland's capital funding allocation is for the development of the National Sports Campus.  The allocation of &euro;2.9 million in 2017 is to meet existing commitments.  Members will be aware that the Taoiseach officially opened the National Indoor Arena at the National Sports Campus last week.  The National Indoor Arena is a very significant and welcome addition to the existing facilities at the campus, providing world-class indoor facilities for athletics, gymnastics and a variety of other sports.</p> <p>  The sports capital programme is the Government's primary vehicle to support the development of sports facilities and the purchase of sports equipment.  It aims to foster an integrated and planned approach to developing sports and physical recreational facilities throughout the country.  In particular, its stated objectives are to assist voluntary and community organisations, national governing bodies of sport, local authorities and schools to develop high quality, safe, well designed, sustainable facilities in appropriate locations; to provide appropriate equipment to help to maximise participation in sport and physical recreation; to prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of sports facilities; and to encourage the sharing of local, regional and national sports facilities by clubs, community organisations and national governing bodies of sport.</p> <p>  On 21 December we announced that &euro;30 million would be be made available under the 2017 sports capital programme.  The application process opened on 23 January and will remain open until 24 February.  A previous criticism of the scheme was the number of invalid applications received.  In this regard, a significant effort has been made to simplify and streamline the application process.  Most members will be familiar with the form, but I will spell it out briefly.  The form has been reduced from 14 pages to six.  Other supports for applicants include comprehensive written and video guides, both of which are available on my Department's website.  For the first time, we have also arranged a series of regional workshops to provide guidance for potential applicants on how to complete the form.  The workshops will commence next week and I understand there is a significant level of interest in attending.  Based on previous rounds of the programme, the assessment process takes a number of months to complete and I expect the actual grant allocations to be made some time towards the end of the summer.  The programme has transformed the sport landscape of Ireland with improvements in the quality and quantity of sports facilities in virtually every village, town and city.  We are committed to ensuring this progress will continue.  In this regard, we will be engaging with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform as part of the mid&ndash;term review of the capital plan to ensure the sports capital programme will be opened for applications on an annual basis in the future.</p> <p>  In terms of the challenges we have to face and the possible strategies we might usefully deploy to successfully overcome them, the committee will be aware that in November my Department launched a major consultation process for the development of a new national sports policy framework.  By the mid-January deadline for the submission of comments, almost 50 responses had been received.  The up-to-date figure is 55.  I am very happy with this response level.  We are in the process of examining the submissions and I am confident that the new policy will benefit greatly from the insights of the various sports stakeholders.  Even though the deadline has passed, we will not turn away anyone else who might wish to make a submission even at this late stage.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to extend that invitation, both publicly and to members.</p><p> There are several key challenges which we will have to address and I will briefly run through a few of those.  However, there is one challenge that I would consider should be to the forefront in our thinking, and that concerns how to increase the numbers participating in sport and physical activity generally.  There are worrying trends that point clearly to declining numbers overall.  In the most recent Irish Sports Monitor Report, it was found that 45% of the population participate regularly in sport, which represents a small decline in participation levels in both genders.  A continuation of a situation whereby more than half the population is not participating in sport on a regular basis would have significant consequences for Irish society as a whole in the future in terms of adverse impacts on the health of the nation.  Although other lifestyle choices such as improving diet are important factors that can contribute to a solution, increasing participation rates in sport and physical activity is certainly part of that solution and we will be giving that challenge a particular priority in the period ahead.</p><p> Sports policy overlaps with other Departments and agencies through initiatives such as Healthy Ireland, education, social policy and issues such as regional planning.  Cross-sectoral engagement and a more joined up approach by Government, working closely with key stakeholders, will be one of our priorities for the new sports policy.</p><p> Everyone, regardless of age or ability, should be able to participate in sport.  We will aim, therefore, to ensure that sports policy should support everyone from early childhood play through education and adult life.  For this to happen there needs to be sustained investment in sport.  We will need, therefore, to define the parameters of such an investment programme over the long term, bearing in mind the importance of current investment in people as well as capital facilities.</p><p> There is also the challenge of competing and succeeding on the international stage.  There is an undoubted inspirational effect among young people in particular of seeing their sporting heroes being successful at the major international sporting events, and we will have to consider how best to drive forward.  While we have come a long way in recent times in terms of the world-class facilities at the National Sports Campus, there will be a need for continued commitment to our high performance sector.</p><p> The work of the national governing bodies and local sports partnerships also warrants particular consideration.  They each play an absolutely vital role in the Irish sports landscape.  Ensuring good governance throughout all organisations involved in sport in order to maintain public confidence in sporting bodies is accordingly a key policy objective.</p><p> I have mentioned just a few of our challenges today, and we will be working hard over the next few months to set a clear strategic direction for engagement by Government and Sport Ireland with the sporting sector.  I hope to finalise the new sports policy framework around the middle of this year.  For now, we are looking forward to hearing the views and priorities of this committee, which will help form part of my overall considerations.</p></speech>

I was a member of this committee  in the last D&aacute;il and I am delighted to be here to address some of the questions.  The board of Sport Ireland approved the grant of &euro;520,000 for the Olympic Council of Ireland for administration and programme spending in 2016.  Some &euro;390,000 of this was paid to the OCI in 2016.  The balance was not transferred.  From our point of view, Sport Ireland is the funding body for national governing bodies.  The Olympic Council of Ireland is not a national governing body.  There are 56 national governing bodies for whom the code of governance would extend to.  To answer the Deputy's question, &euro;130,000 has been retained from the 2016 allocation.</p></speech>

Can the Minister confirm when this will be available, as the closing date is fast approaching?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-01a.322" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1267" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017020100002#D01000"><p>The assessment manual is under way at the moment.  Our officials in Killarney have spent much time on this.  Last June or July we started looking at a 2016-2017 programme.  We wanted to change the criteria to make it, as the Minister, Deputy Ross, said, as easy as possible for people in terms of the qualifications.  Mindful of that, we have decided that in advance of the closing date the assessment manual for our officials in Killarney would also be finalised.  To be honest, I do not envisage massive change from the last assessment manual in terms of scoring.  The Department is very anxious to make sure that our sporting facilities at local and regional level have a particular emphasis on as wide a code as possible, so if there are codes that can share facilities and can demonstrate that they are available to local organisations and local schools, have access programmes for people with disabilities, have clear objectives in terms of participation for minorities, new Irish communities, women and so on, obviously that will be taken into consideration.  It can be taken at face value that the assessment manual the Department will use for validation will not deviate much from the last time.  We have made it as simple as we can.  We have reduced the application process considerably.  </p> <p>  This will create huge challenges for the Department because the last time around we had in excess of &euro;150 million worth of valid applications.  Based on the fact that we have reduced the criteria considerably and made it easier we are now engaging with people to an extent we did not before.  We are meeting people in workshops.  We have a YouTube channel.  The Department is receiving a huge number of calls on a regular basis.  I imagine that the number of valid applications we receive will dramatically increase, and that creates its own pressure then in terms of being able to distribute what is essentially a smaller amount of money.  </p> <p>  The one positive that can be taken from that is that we have agreement from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and it is in the programme for Government that this will be annualised.  Every January from now on we will be in a position where we will be able to reopen this, so the element of uncertainty that was there before is removed.  When I was a backbench Deputy I was inundated with people asking if there would be a sports capital programme each year.  We are very conscious of the value of it and we want to maximise it.  The &euro;30 million we have this year is a baseline, and we will try to grow it with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></speech>

The efficiency has improved immensely.  Out of 1,592 applications last time, approximately one third were ruled out.  However, the Department has made extraordinarily detailed arrangements around the country, with workshops, helplines and other information being communicated to people so that will not happen this time.  There will be a massive number of applications but the number of invalid applications will be much lower.  The assessment process has to be agreed among the two Ministers fairly shortly.</p></speech>

Can the Minister of State confirm if a date has been set and outline what issue he intends to raise with Dr. Wu?  Can the Minister give an update on the nomination of a new chairperson for Horse Sport Ireland?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-01a.326" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1267" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017020100002#E00200"><p>The Minister, Deputy Ross, will answer the second question.  I have requested a meeting with Dr. Wu based on Ireland's experience in the Olympic Games.  I have done so in response to commentary in the media and my own interest in it.  As somebody who has a passing interest in boxing, I was left in no doubt that there were serious questions to ask from an Irish point of view in the aftermath of the Olympic Games.  The first thing one would have to ask about Ireland's participation in boxing is whether our boxers were treated fairly.  There was one clear example to most people whereby we all thought our man had won and then, to absolute disbelief, our man had not won.  An explanation is owed to us, because as a Government in the first instance, we fund the Irish Amateur Boxing Association, IABA.  It is channelled through Sport Ireland after being voted by the Oireachtas to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  There is a clear line of responsibility in terms of accountability for what happens to our athletes.</p> <p>  There is an element of fairness.  These are people who are representative of the State.  When they go out there, they are under the Irish tricolour.  We have to be satisfied that they are treated fairly.  I was left in major doubt that our people were being treated fairly.  I have no problem in stating that publicly and have done so previously.  I have requested a meeting with Dr. Wu.  There was one originally scheduled but unfortunately, due to his engagements, it had to be deferred.  I have made it clear that I am prepared to go to Lausanne or if it can be accommodated in Dublin, so be it.  We have to get back to a situation where we can trust, without any element of doubt, that when somebody goes out under the Irish tricolour, they are treated the very same as everybody else.  That is owed to our athletes.  In the aftermath of the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games, a very sour taste was left in the mouths of our participating athletes.  In advance of further international competition, we as a Government, Sport Ireland, and the IABA want assurances that our people are going to be treated fairly.  It beggars belief that when the bout was over, the person who won it was as shocked as the rest of us and could not continue on.</p> <p>  I welcome that this has been brought up in this forum because it comes in under governance.  The IABA have recently gone down the road of looking at its own strategic development.  It is funded by our Department.  The association must be satisfied that when it puts young men and women out into the ring on behalf of Ireland, they are being treated fairly.  I have a big cloud of suspicion there at the moment.  I want assurances.  They are owed to our athletes in the first instance.  Assurances that this is being done properly are also owed to the people who fund the IABA, who ultimately are the taxpayers of Ireland.  That is why I have looked for it.</p></speech>

I was anxious that there should be an open process about this and I wanted to get it past the Public Appointments Service.  The Public Appointments Service said that it was outside its remit to do this because Horse Sport Ireland does not come within it.  There was a further proposal that a Mr. Jim Beecher, who was proposed by Sport Ireland as the interim chairman, should be accepted.  He was approached and agreed to do that.  I had to get the permission of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to do that.  The Public Appointments Service has now advised that although it will not do it, it will assist the Department in appointing a new chair.  Work has commenced in the division of the development of an advertisement in line with my instruction.</p></speech>

It is a brilliant development.  There is no funding for 2017 in the Estimates.  Will it be funded in 2018?  I seek the comments of both the Minister and the Minister of State on the deal on funding with the Gaelic Players Association, GPA, and the Gaelic Athletics Association, GAA, before Christmas because I presume that they are high-performance athletes as well.  However, I presume programmes have been worked out.  On what is the &euro;6.7 million being spent?  In respect of governance, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, mentioned the OCI.  With all that happened in recent events, both the Minister and Minister of State stated that its funding would be reviewed.  Has that happened?</p> <p>  The issue of boxing was mentioned.  One could not make up what happened.  Last week, I asked Sport Ireland how much day-to-day governance it has in this regard.  I note one boxer did not train with the rest of the team and ended up failing a drug test when he arrived in Rio de Janeiro.  From a management perspective, if somebody is not training with the group, why should he or she travel?  I did not get an answer.  I was told many years ago that when drug testing started at GAA level, funding would be withdrawn if the GAA did not co-operate.  There still seems to be a lack of co-operation by some governing bodies.</p> <p>  Where are we at in recognising or regulating mixed martial arts, MMA, as a sport?  We lost a world leader in the boxing area two years ago.   Since the Irish Sports Council appeared before the committee, it has been announced that the high-performance director of rowing is leaving.  Have we developed a habit of losing winning managements?</p></speech>

It is quite a long saga.  I will read out what I have.  A proposal has been made.  There is no agreement on the funding yet.  Sport Ireland submitted a proposal to the Department on 12 June 2015 and again in January 2016 for the development of phase two.  The proposal involves Sport Ireland part-funding the capital cost of the project from the proceeds of the sale of two areas of land at the national sports campus, estimated to achieve &euro;8.5 million after capital gains tax, with the balance of capital funding to be provided by the Exchequer.  This contribution is estimated in the region of &euro;16 million.  The total amount involved is &euro;24 million.  Sport Ireland proposes to secure a bank loan to pay the construction costs pending the sale of land and allocation of Exchequer funding.  They are going to look for the State to fund the balance.  We intend to look for the funding for that in the mid-term capital review.</p> <p>  The matter of MMA was raised.  After the death of Mr. Joao Carvalho in 2016, the then Minister of State, Deputy Ring engaged with the MMA community to attempt to get them under an umbrella and maybe even to become a national governing body, NGB.  They formed a group called the Irish Mixed Martial Arts Association, IMMMA, which is now talking to a Sport Ireland recognised body, the Irish Martial Arts Commission, IMAC, but bringing them under that umbrella has been slow.</p><p>The Department has brought in an expert on this area, Professor Jack Anderson, who is liaising with Sport Ireland.</p></speech>

I congratulate all the people who represented our country in the past 12 months.  It is a great honour and privilege for them to represent the Tricolour and it was a great honour and privilege for us to watch them in their various sporting fields.</p> <p>  On the Olympic Council of Ireland, OCI, months after the Rio debacle, what reports does the Minister have on his desk?  Has anything been published since that debacle, and what actions are in train?  It may not even be a report but a memorandum or any correspondence on the debacle in Rio.  </p> <p>  With regard to the OCI, has the Minister any thoughts on the election of a new president of the OCI?  The process was first opened to the media.  It was then closed to the media.  It is back open to the media again.  How can we have confidence that this election process will be open and transparent?  We are talking about an organisation in which the general public has very little confidence.  Why was &euro;130,000 of the 2016 funding to the OCI retained?</p> <p>  As our athletes prepare to represent our country at the 2020 Olympic Games, how can we ensure that the taxpayers' money that is given to the OCI is spent on player welfare and not on administrative costs?  How much of the OCI budget is dedicated to player welfare as opposed to administration?  That is my first question.</p></speech>

We had a request for an extension, which we gave to it until 31 March.  I understand the Deputy has tabled a parliamentary question on this also.  There is no report, and I have had no contact with Judge Moran at any stage, and do not intend to have until his report lands on my desk.</p> <p>  On the OCI, the election will be on 8 February.  Obviously, we will not interfere with that election in any way.</p></speech>

I wish the contenders well.  No more than is the case for the people who come into these Houses, it is not easy to put one's name on a ballot paper.  I welcome the fact that the election will be held in an open forum.</p> <p>  On the amounts yet to be drawn down, we will get a detailed answer for the Deputy but my understanding is that those amounts are paid on receipt of vouched expenses so if there is an amount that has yet to be drawn down, it is awaiting correspondence perhaps from the OCI to Sport Ireland.  We will get clarification on that for the Deputy and forward it to him.</p> <p>  Everybody will understand that the Olympic Council of Ireland would have to contend with an element of expenses, but nobody would disagree with Deputy Troy's sentiments about player and athlete welfare.</p> <p>  In the aftermath of the Olympic Games and the Paralympics, and it is important we would not forget the Paralympics because our athletes were hugely successful in Rio and did the country proud, we had an athletes forum in Farmleigh for the first time, which I convened, to give athletes from the Paralympics and the Olympic Games an opportunity to come in and give their views on their experience of the Olympics.  Some of the issues raised were not what I would have expected.  They raised issues such as tax implications, access to third level and the way college courses are structured in terms of the cycle of athletes and the Olympic cycle.  The event was not what we, as non-athletes, would have expected or what would have been in the media.  That has fed into the Rio review by Sport Ireland, the report of which it is due to publish shortly.  It will also publish a review of Ireland's performance in boxing and a review of Ireland's participation in the Paralympics.  Those reports are being commissioned under the auspices of Sport Ireland but for the Department, and they will be published.  Once those reports are completed I would encourage the committee members to invite us to come before it again.</p></speech>

What exactly is the job of Minister of State in terms of specific responsibilities?  What delegated powers does he have?  I ask the question in terms of the sports capital programme.  I welcome the clarity that has been brought to that and the fact that the process will be simplified, with regional seminars, but what I do not welcome are the reports that it will be done on a system similar to that of a previous Minister where it will be weighted on a one, two and three basis in preference of the local Fine Gael TD in a particular constituency.  If any organisation puts a huge effort into compiling an application for funding to upgrade its facilities for that community, that should be done in an open and transparent manner.</p></speech>

He asked me a question and I would like him to afford me the opportunity to answer it because it is a loaded question.  The Deputy is making an insinuation that either myself or the Minister, Deputy Ross, would not treat this matter with the utmost seriousness.  I take that very seriously.  We are taking this matter very seriously.  That is why we spent so much time on it.  That is why I opened the discussions with the Department as early as last June.  We have also made it clear that the assessment manual we will employ will be very clear.  It will be finished and ready before the final date for receipt of all of the applications.  The scoring mechanism that will be attributed will be based on the criteria in the assessment manual.  Some applications will be invalid and others will be valid.  Depending on the score they get, the files will come to the Department and the Minister will make the assessment.  It is a function for the Minister because it is the Minister who is ultimately responsible to the D&aacute;il on this matter.</p> <p>  I believe most people across the political spectrum would believe that the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, did his utmost to try to rebalance the division of money on the basis of population.</p><p>The Deputy will recall that prior to his appointment, money was not distributed on the basis of population and funding was allocated in a lopsided fashion.  The Deputy will probably find that his county did not do as well as it would have done on the basis of population.  My county certainly did not do as well as it would have done on the basis of population.  Following his appointment, the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, also built in a redress mechanism to allow counties which had performed poorly in respect of allocations prior to his appointment to recover some of the funding they would otherwise have received.</p><p> In some counties, the number of applications will exceed the money available.  This obviously presents a challenge and means we will have to make decisions in the most clear and practicable manner possible.  The money available will be small relative to demand, which will probably be in excess of &euro;200 million.  The Deputy asked a detailed question and I am providing a detailed answer, irrespective of whether he likes it.  We want to ensure the process is as fair, open and transparent as possible.  Since my appointment, this responsibility has been delegated to me.</p></speech>

Deputy Troy expressed a certain amount of unease about the programme and it is fair enough to do so.  I want to ensure this programme is utterly fair and that no one will come to the conclusion that there has been political favouritism or interference in the process.  The assessment manuals will be made available to everybody in order that they can see the basis on which decisions are made, which is without fear or favour.  All activities under this programme will be subject to freedom of information, which will help make the process more transparent.  There is an absolute determination that this will be done in a completely upfront and above board process.  The Deputy should not have any doubt about that.</p> <p>  I do not know exactly how the process worked in the past because I was not involved in it.  However, if there are worries about the past, I ask Deputies to tell me what they are and I will do all I can to ensure cases that people may have found disturbing are not repeated.</p></speech>

They appear to have forgotten that they addressed the committee on the issue of sport in the middle of the previous session.</p> <p>  The Minister referred to governance and women in sport.  He introduced a timeframe for his decisions in this regard while consultations with women's groups and so forth are ongoing.  Is he not putting the cart before the horse?  Should he not await the various reports on gender balance and from women's groups?  Should we not wait another few months to find out what emerges from the Olympic Council of Ireland, OCI, investigation in which governance will also be a feature before introducing an overall timeframe in respect of governance?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-01a.370" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1267" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017020100002#G00500"><p>The Deputy has confused a couple of issues.  The first issue, the timeframe on governance, has been set out and all of the national governing bodies are fine with it.  They know that they must move from a voluntary to a mandatory code of governance and this is being done to protect them as much as to protect taxpayers.  When I was a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, governance was an issue that arose constantly in reports from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Departments are often criticised for engaging with external bodies that have voluntary codes of governance.  The decision to move from voluntary to mandatory codes was made in advance of the Olympics and does not only relate to governance.</p> <p>  On women in sport, 17 national governing bodies do not have any women members, seven have more than 90% male members, 20 have more than 80% male members, five have 70% or more male members and 14 barely meet gender balance requirements if these are based on the global norm of having approximately 30% female members.</p> <p>  The Minister referred to female participation in sport.  There is no doubt that we have a problem with the perception of sport among women and access to sport for women.  While a figure of 45% participation in sport among women is grand, it is not good enough and must be increased.  One of the ways to achieve this is to have role models both on and off the field.  This issue has arisen in other jurisdictions where it has provoked considerable debate.  It is important to note that in the immediate aftermath of the public commentary on this issue in December last, research carried out by a reputable company was provided to Sport Ireland which found that 60% of respondents believed it was time action was taken on women's participation in sport and agreed with the idea of moving in the direction we had proposed.</p></speech>

The issue is the timeframe provided.  Did the Minister bring this issue before the Cabinet for discussion?</p></speech>

While I welcome his initiative, my concern is the timeframe involved.  I have heard ladies involved in sports say that while the Minister of State's initiative was fine, time would be needed to get the process up and running.  The timeframe is very tight.</p></speech>

The job of a Minister is to initiate debate and discussion and lead policy formation.  It is doubtful whether the tried and tested route of placing an advertisement on the Department's website or on the back page of a broadsheet newspaper would have resulted in a national debate on this issue.  We have a process in place and the national governing bodies are reporting their views to Sport Ireland.  We have, however, a major problem which we cannot run away from, nor are we of a mind to run away from it.</p></speech>

While I did not bring the matter before the Cabinet, I do not need to do so because the promotion of women in sport is Government policy.  We are engaging in significant consultation.  We formed a sports leadership body, which includes 50 of the national governing bodies already, to consider the issue.  We want to hurry up the process rather than slow it down.</p></speech>

Will the Minister explain the selection process used in the Olympic Council of Ireland for president, vice president and other roles on the executive committee?  Nobody seems to know what is the precise process involved.</p> <p>  I had intended to ask whether any details were available from the OCI inquiry but the Minister indicated that nothing had been heard, seen or said since it commenced.  We were originally informed that a non-statutory inquiry would take 12 weeks to complete.  This type of inquiry was selected because of the much shorter timeframe involved but it has subsequently stretched out to seven months.  Perhaps we should have opted to have a statutory inquiry given that the non-statutory inquiry will take seven months to complete.</p> <p>  The Minister of State spoke about the move from voluntary to mandatory codes of governance.  Will he furnish members with the relevant documentation?  Has someone been appointed to oversee this move and ensure mandatory codes are adopted?  If so, who is this person and how often will this work be done?</p></speech>

I have no hesitation whatsoever about doing that.  The Deputy asked whether the investigation is statutory or non-statutory.  We decided that it should be non-statutory.  That was really because there was going to be co-operation among the key players.  I assume that has happened.  If there was any reluctance for them to come forward we left it open to the judge to make the investigation statutory.  I have not heard anything from him since about anything to do with that so I assume he is going ahead on that basis and it is working for him.</p></speech>

Sport Ireland is the statutory agency with which the national governing bodies liaise and it is from Sport Ireland that they derive their funding.  Under the Sport Ireland Act, once a policy statement is made by the Government on specific aspects of the administration of Sport Ireland it then carries out that function through its board and chief executive.  That is the manner in which it is being done.  The bodies have been given a timeframe and they are working towards it.  Many of them have already completed the process.  Some of the larger ones have already moved to the mandatory code.  It is likely that some of the smaller national governing bodies will encounter difficulties because of the lack of human resources available to them and Sport Ireland will mentor them and assist them through the process to ensure they can complete it as quickly as possible within the timeframe.  We have a staggered timeframe.  Those bodies with 25 employees and above will be first and the smaller ones are being given a longer lead-in.</p></speech>

Sport Ireland is already in charge, as it were, because it is a statutory agency established by the Oireachtas.  It is a combination of the old Irish Sports Council and the National Sports Campus Development Authority.  It has power in terms of how funds are distributed and it can also distribute funds according to policy decisions of the Government.  The policy decision in this case is that we move from voluntary code to a mandatory code and the bodies are reacting to that.  In fairness to them, I chaired the grouping in Castleknock on the night when the policy change was brought to the attention of the national governing bodies and there was a broad welcome for it because they view it is a form of insurance policy for themselves.  They do not want to be in a situation where they are before this committee or the Committee of Public Accounts about failures of governance.  They want the assurance that they are being mentored and assisted as well, and that is what we are doing.</p></speech>

My next question is about funding for Sport Ireland.  It corresponds to pages 12 and 30 of the briefing document.  Is it correct that the Department told Sport Ireland that it cannot pay the final &euro;1 million in outstanding legal fees from the astronomical bill of &euro;3.9 million in the Dublin Waterworld case, yet it seems to have granted &euro;1.4 million in additional funding for 2017 for that very purpose?</p> <p>  I welcome the fact that the Minister has given a commitment to annualise sports capital grants from this year.  The grants were not available last year.  Am I correct in saying that, for example, a boxing club that leases or rents rather than owns its property cannot avail of the grant?  I would welcome clarification on that.  In the previous year issues arose to the effect that a club does not qualify for a grant unless it has a particular type of lease or owns the property.  That affects sporting groups in disadvantaged areas in particular and one would imagine it is important to ensure they are included in the process.  Reference was also made to the workshops but I did not hear or see any advertised in County Louth?  Does the Minister know when or where they will take place?</p></speech>

People are either forced to go to the pub or to pay to view them.  When I raised the issue previously, some lip-service was paid to it but could the Minister tell me whether there are any plans to rectify the situation because it is extremely annoying for many?  It seems very unfair that the television rights are sold and that people have to leave the house to watch a big match.  Has the Minister begun to examine how matters might be rectified?</p></speech>

In terms of legal fees for Dublin Waterworld, I wrote a letter to Kieran Mulvey, chairman of Sport Ireland, saying that we would not pay any more in legal costs.

We put it to Sport Ireland that we will not pay that extra &euro;1 million.</p> <p>  The Deputy said there are two vacancies on the board of Sport Ireland.</p></speech>

It will ensure that I do not get 33 names thrown at me from which I have to choose two from people I have no idea about who were selected without interview or any sophisticated process in place.

Not every county will have a workshop.  We have limited resources and a very small unit in Killarney.  I encourage the Opposition spokespersons to go to the Department's office in Killarney and to see the work of the sports capital programme because we have a very small staff.  They do not have the resources.  Following my request, the unit has divided the country up.  There will be three workshops in Dublin.  Dublin was oversubscribed so we have added a third workshop at the Aviva Stadium.  Athlone, Cork, Sligo and Limerick will each have one workshop.  There is also a YouTube channel.  As well as that, local sports partnerships are being empowered to engage with the Department's sports capital section.  If there is an issue in Louth, Monaghan, Cavan or anywhere in the north east, there is no reason the sports partnerships cannot engage with the Department's officials and they can provide the expertise and support.</p><p>In respect of television rights, the listing is there and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment is the line Minister with responsibility for free to air.  The matter is outside the scope of the games and events listed.  It is entirely a matter for the national governing body as to how it wants to deal with it in terms of broadcasting and broadcast rights.  In this case, the body is the GAA.  It is not a matter for the Department.  </p><p> In respect of boxing clubs, local authorities can make applications but the reason we require specific leases is to make sure that if things happen in the future, we do not put capital money into a property that can then be recouped by a landlord.  This is why we have strict criteria for leases.  It is important to point out that where there is an issue regarding leases, boxing clubs can apply for equipment grants.  We are under-subscribed in terms of equipment grants so we would encourage people to do that.  </p></speech>

We had a very serious clarification of that yesterday in respect of people who appear in front of the committee from the courts.  At the meeting two weeks ago, the chief executive of the FAI said that he was told that he would not have to answer that question.  I found it unacceptable that people would come in and be told that they were not required to answer an important question in the public domain.</p> <p>  I will not go into the ticketing issue because the Minister said that he is constrained in what he can say on that.  Very often, the press will hold organisations to account, as we do in this committee.  For example, the FAI does not have a press conference after its AGM.  Yesterday, the OCI stated that it would have a very significant restriction on the press or people attending the upcoming AGM, a position it then rowed back from.  I presume the code of governance will address that kind of issue because it is really important that this public accountability exists.  The Olympic Games last year were overshadowed by a controversy that undermined the very valuable contribution our athletes made.  The Minister of State is correct.  Very often, governance walks sporting organisations into these unfortunate scenarios.  Will the requirement that there be a public component be part of the code of governance?  I believe it should be.  </p></speech>

In fact, I could not have put it better myself.  In return for State investment in anything, there must be probity and public accountability.  This committee has a very important role in that - both in holding the Department to account in terms of how we spend and allocate our money, and how sporting organisations allocate and use it on the ground.  The answer is "Yes".  There must be penalties.</p> <p>  We have seen it in the voluntary and charitable sector and I do not want to see it in the sporting sector.  This is why I decided at the outset, and I know the Minister was very supportive of it, that whenever there is a voluntary code in any element of public life in Ireland, there is the temptation that can cause problems so one must remove them.  This why one needs to move to mandatory codes with penalties.  Without penalties, it is meaningless.  The only penalty a Department can meaningfully enforce is financial.  I agree with what the Deputy has said.  In respect of reaching a situation where everybody is at that stage in 2019 and 2020, it will take a bit of time but we are on a trajectory.  I do not disagree with the Deputy but when Oireachtas committees are charged with probing, they have an obligation to probe and certainly walking away from it is not a good idea.</p></speech>

Anything that can be done to improve that will be important because it has an impact.</p> <p>  Swimming pool funds have been allocated.  The desirable level to get to is one swimming pool per every 50,000 people.  My constituency is probably the worst example or one of the worst examples in the country.  We have one swimming pool for every 110,000 people.  The way swimming pools are funded becomes very problematic in that there must be matching funds.</p><p>Is the Government considering changing this because it is one of the sports that stretch across the age spectrum?</p></speech>

The local authority swimming pool programme "does what it says on the tin", but it requires local authority involvement from the start.  I know about the issues in the Deputy's constituency of Kildare North; we have these problems all over the country.  The amount of money available from the Department in a capital grant goes nowhere near the final cost of providing a swimming pool; therefore, there is a need for a local authority site or local authority finance.  In addition, there is a need for a local authority sinking fund, as well as an operating and management team and so on.</p> <p>  To be honest, local authorities run a mile from these things.  They do not want to be involved in providing swimming pools because they are a drain on resources.  In many cases, therefore, it is up to local authority members to bite the bullet and say they want to have a swimming pool in their area and that they are prepared to put aside so much of their budget and the funding raised from development levies per annum and also provide a site.  In reality, that appetite is lacking.  Some city and county managers are very good at doing this, whereas in the west they are all over the place.  There are big gaps throughout the country where there is no swimming pool infrastructure.  We would love to have a situation where there would be more pools, but there is a reticence on the part of local authorities to make progress.</p></speech>

This is the second in a series of meetings this committee has convened to examine the very challenging situation developing at Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Last week we heard from acting chief executive officer, CEO, Ray Hernan, who set out the challenges as he views them and from Irish Rural Link which expressed concerns about the possibility of diminishing bus services in rural areas.</p> <p>  Today's is an important meeting on the current financial situation at Bus &Eacute;ireann, the future of the Expressway Service and the vital role of the rural transport programme.  I am delighted to welcome the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, and I thank him for giving us his time.  I invite him to make his opening statement.  Given the time constraints, could he please limit it to five minutes and anything not covered can be taken as read because the presentation has already been circulated?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-01a.448" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017020100002#L00300"><p>I thank the committee for inviting me today to discuss the situation at Bus &Eacute;ireann.  I do not for one minute underestimate the challenge facing Bus &Eacute;ireann and I know this committee, irrespective of differing perspectives, does not either.  It is unfortunate that these difficult issues have arisen on the 30th anniversary of the company's establishment in 1987 but in some ways that anniversary reminds us how different a place Ireland now is compared to then and how different the operating environment within which Bus &Eacute;ireann now operates is too.</p> <p>  Today Bus &Eacute;ireann fulfils three different but important roles.  It acts as the provider of taxpayer-funded public service obligation, PSO, services under contract with the National Transport Authority, NTA.  Those PSO services carry approximately 40% of the company's total passenger journeys in any one year.  It continues its role as the administrative agent of the Minister for Education and Skills in terms of the school transport services.  These services carry approximately 50% of the company's total passenger journeys each year.  It also acts as a commercial bus company under the Expressway brand, offering inter-city services across its 23 Expressway routes, often in competition with other operators.  Those 23 routes carry around 10% of the company's total passenger journeys each year, yet it is Expressway, which, despite its small size in the overall context of the company, is the root of its current difficulties.</p> <p>  The taxpayer recognises the company's importance.  That is why just over &euro;40 million was granted to the company last year to provide those socially necessary but commercially unviable PSO services, while in addition the company receives around &euro;150 million per annum of taxpayer funding in respect of its school transport work.</p> <p>  The recently confirmed PSO outturn for 2016 means that last year Bus &Eacute;ireann received 21% more in taxpayer funding for PSO services than the year before.  This year I secured 11% additional funding for overall public transport services, which will see Bus &Eacute;ireann benefit from even more taxpayer funding in 2017.  The &euro;40 million of taxpayers' money in 2016 supported approximately 230 routes across the country, in every county outside Dublin.  From Dungloe in Donegal to Goleen in Cork, from Clifden in Galway to Carlingford in Louth, the Bus &Eacute;ireann PSO bus service is a vital, vast and much-used service across rural Ireland.  That taxpayer funded transport connectivity is at the heart of our public transport system.  Under legislation passed by the Oireachtas, the NTA has the statutory powers to ensure continued public transport connectivity regardless of decisions taken by any individual operator.  The NTA has assured rural Ireland that it can, and will, step into any area, consult with local communities, and assess what public transport services are required and what is the best method to provide them.  It has done this in the past and will do so in the future.  Accordingly, the NTA will ensure that there is no negative impact on the connectivity of rural communities.</p> <p>  As I have said, however, in addition to its vast PSO network, Bus &Eacute;ireann also operates commercial services under its Expressway brand.  Equally, we all know those services lose money.  If a company wishes to operate a commercial service then that service must make commercial sense.  That is a basic concept that I think is well understood, the taxpayer cannot fund the commercial services of one operator and not fund those of all other operators.  That is a basic principle of fairness and also, importantly, a fundamental tenet of national and European law.  Let me be clear &ndash; I cannot provide such funding.  As a company Bus &Eacute;ireann needs to examine how it operates and how the company will be able to not just survive, but thrive in a country and a bus market that have changed for the better since 1987.</p> <p>  In difficult situations such as these, we often see periods like the last few weeks, where accusation and counter-accusation fly back and forth, fuelling media speculation and adding to the uncertainties and upset of bus users and company employees.  We all know that ultimately these disputes will only be settled by open, constructive and realistic engagement between the parties involved, the company and its employees.  I know this might seem strange but I saw some signs of hope last week because amid all the noise, we heard two clear messages.  The first was that trade unions are willing to engage on the basis of no preconditions.  The second was the acting CEO confirming to this committee that nothing he has said or issued in recent weeks constitutes preconditions.</p><p>If the two parties are claiming they do not have preconditions, it makes one wonder why they are not talking.  The State is ready and able to assist in these situations, as it has done since 1946 when the Oireachtas first established the State's industrial relations resolution bodies.  Both parties need to reflect immediately on how these bodies can assist and instigate whatever action is needed to ensure discussions begin.  I cannot understand, in the light of the statements both parties have made, what is hindering them from coming to the table or using the institutions and bodies of the State to come together.</p><p> The word "policy" has been used a lot in recent weeks.  I am clear on whom public transport policy should be about; it is about the ordinary citizen.  When we strip away the rhetoric, everyone in this room who claims to want to advance public transport services agrees with that statement or, at the very least, should be able to agree with it.  In fact, the same sentiment featured throughout the Oireachtas debates in 2009 when the then Minister, Noel Dempsey, introduced what is now the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009.  It is that legislation, as passed by the Oireachtas, that reformed the restrictive practices of the past and hauled commercial bus services into the 21st century.  The Act sought to place the citizen at the heart of these services rather than the vested interests of the past, as enshrined in a law dating back to 1932.  Most importantly, the Act provided a platform for citizens to avail of better services, frequencies and fares.  The ordinary citizen has embraced the reforms introduced by the Oireachtas, as evidenced by the 23 million people all over the country who chose to use a commercial bus service in 2015.</p></speech>

The interests of rural areas are very important.  In that sense one cannot just do away with Expressway.  What we must do is ensure a profitable service is run and a PSO service also.  We have to ensure social needs are met.  This is imperative in the transport system.  The PSO service runs in parallel with a profitable or commercial service.  That is what I am pursuing.  I will not dictate whether Expressway should be closed down.  What I really want to see is a healthy, thriving bus service in rural areas and throughout the rest of the country.</p></speech>

I have to disagree with him in that it is quite clear that the acting CEO of Bus &Eacute;ireann has set out preconditions in his recent letter to workers in which he outlines the actions he intends to take in the coming weeks.  What is the Minister's opinion on the letter sent to workers?  Does he agree that the actions outlined in the letter are, in fact, preconditions to entering negotiations?</p></speech>

What he did do was put out some programme which he was sharing with everybody else.  Obviously, as far as I can see - I cannot read his mind - these are negotiating positions.  He has stated specifically that they are not preconditions.  The trade unions have also stated they would begin discussions without preconditions.  Therefore, let us get on with it.</p></speech>

He stated: "Government will review how best to ensure a sustainable funding model for the free travel scheme."  I spoke directly with the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, last week and received absolute clarification from him that there would be no changes to the free travel scheme.  Can the Minister, Deputy Ross, confirm to the committee that there are no changes planned for the free travel scheme?</p></speech>

This seems to conflict with the conversation Deputy Fitzpatrick had with him.  We will engage in discussions on the free travel scheme.  I confirm that I have been in touch with the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, I will speak to him and my officials and the Minister will engage on the issue of the free travel scheme.  I hope Deputy Fitzpatrick has no doubt about this whatsoever.  It is absolutely unambiguously true that those discussions will commence.</p></speech>

Free travel is so important for Ireland, especially rural Ireland, and the last thing we want to do is scaremonger people that there is a possibility free travel will be taken away from them.  All I ask the Minister is that he give a commitment, as the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, has, that free travel will continue as far as the Government is concerned.</p></speech>

That is not what is at issue, and anybody who makes that suggestion is either being mischievous or misunderstanding what is going on.  This is about how free travel will be funded in respect of Bus &Eacute;ireann and how it gets its share of it.  I have not spoken to anyone in government about removing free travel, I will not initiate any proposals to do so and I would not countenance any proposals to do so.</p></speech>

This country has come through a lot in the past number of years and, in fairness, everybody has put in a big effort to put this country back on track.  The Minister should intervene in the Bus &Eacute;ireann dispute, try to talk to both sides, get the two of them sitting down together and get the situation sorted out.  Nobody will gain anything from the current state of affairs.  There are an awful lot of concerned families in my constituency and, I am sure, throughout Ireland that are very worried by this situation.  The public transport providers in this country, including the private companies, which are doing very well, have been doing a fantastic job over the past number of years.  I ask the Minister for the last time whether there is any chance he, as the Minister with responsibility for transport, can intervene and try to get involved in some way or some capacity to sort this problem out.</p></speech>

I think it arises from a misunderstanding that I have a role to play in an industrial dispute.  I do not have that role.  I repeat that I am a shareholder; I am not a party to this industrial dispute.  There is nothing I would like to see more than a sensible and satisfactory end to this.  It is worrying a large number of bus drivers and staff in Bus &Eacute;ireann, and they are justified in having worries.  They read in the newspapers every day about threats to their livelihoods, and that is awful for them.  There is nothing I would like to do more than to sort out this problem for them.  Let us acknowledge that rural communities also feel threatened and vulnerable, as does the taxpayer.  I assure the Deputy it would not help to resolve this dispute, certainly in any long-term way, if I were to get involved because it would give a misleading impression.  The dispute will be resolved, as were the Luas and Dublin Bus disputes, by my staying out of it and by the machinery of the State.  It has been painful and it is regrettable, but my intervention would do more damage than good.</p></speech>

I ask in light of the fact that the Minister would acknowledge that major change is envisaged, that he get involved.  His predecessor requested a report in late 2015.  This report on proposals as to how the financial challenges could be dealt with was presented to his predecessor in early 2016.  I have asked this question before.  Did the Minister, Deputy Ross, see that report?  A "Yes" or "No" will suffice as it is a simple enough question.</p></speech>

A series of reports are coming through.  If the Deputy is referring to the report of late 2015, which was presented to Deputy Paschal Donohoe, I was briefed on it.  I was not in office at that time.  I was briefed on it as I have been briefed on many of the reports to which Deputy Troy has referred.  I did not send for it because I was not in office at the time so I was not in a position to do so.  However, I certainly was briefed on it at the time.  The Deputy also asked if I will get involved in the dispute because the issues are so intertwined.</p></speech>

A number of plans were put to his Department between 2015 and 2016, namely, a five-year plan and strategy roadmap for Bus &Eacute;ireann and various iterations of an existence plan which were put forward in July 2016.  Something further was put forward to the Minister in August 2016 and September 2016.  Did he receive these?</p></speech>

Several drafts of Bus &Eacute;ireann's proposals were presented to my Department and NewERA, my Department's financial advisers, and were discussed.  These discussions highlighted some shortcomings that existed in the draft proposals.  In September 2016, the board of Bus &Eacute;ireann commissioned its own independent consultants, Grant Thornton, to review the company's proposals and advise the board.</p><p>The consultants' confidential report to the board, which was widely commented on by the media, essentially came up with a similar analysis to the one given over the preceding months by the Department and NewERA.  Arising from the board's consideration of that Grant Thornton report, the report which Deputy Troy would be familiar with, the company has now embarked on developing a new plan to address the company's loss making situation and restore it to a sustainable future.  The company aims to have this plan in the next few weeks.</p></speech>

I have to say to the Minister that there was complete and utter inaction by him, his predecessor and the management of Bus &Eacute;ireann for over one year, knowing that the company was haemorrhaging money.  We now have a situation where, despite what the Minister says, letters have been issued to the workers with confirmation - it is not a threat - that wages will be reduced from 20 February.</p></speech>

The Minister was in office in July and in August in 2016.

I have given the committee the sequence of events of what happened and Deputy Troy is aware of them.  There was a series of business plans and suggestions from the company.  I have said quite specifically that NewERA looked at them and came to a decision on them.  I have given this information quite specifically and also that Grant Thornton, again, looked at the possible options in the management's report and it came to certain conclusions about that.  The company itself recently came up with yet another plan and report, which it is now working on.  If the Deputy considers that as inactivity, then I do not know what he would consider as activity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-01a.508" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1250" speakername="Robert Troy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017020100002#O01200"><p>I do not consider commissioning one report after another as activity.  It has been identified by the acting CEO that &euro;7 million was spent in 2016 on the hire of private coaches.  This is something the company says can be done without in 2017.  Perhaps there is a saving to be made there.  At the committee meeting last week, the Bus &Eacute;ireann acting CEO said that the technology to ensure efficiency with petrol and diesel for the buses was not being implemented throughout the fleet.  An increase in efficiency levels of 1% would save in the region of &euro;350,000.  It has also been suggested that savings could have been made in the whole area of insurance.  Between the Minister's Department and the Bus &Eacute;ireann management these efficiencies were not looked at.  Under the acting CEO, they are being looked at, which is welcome.  What is also being looked at is the slashing of the employees' terms and conditions but when the acting CEO appeared before this committee last week he could not identify the percentage of savings the company would achieve through non-payroll activity.  That is the fact.</p> <p>  I am conscious of my remaining time but I have two further questions.  The Minster speaks of the social protection negotiations with the Minister for Social Protection.  This was identified in the very first report the Minister, Deputy Ross, would have received very early on after taking office but he is only going to start talking to the Minister for Social Protection in the coming weeks or days.  What has the Minister, Deputy Ross, done to date?  What negotiations has he had to date with the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, in order to increase this funding?  In the D&aacute;il last night the Minister, Deputy Ross, said that the Public Transport Regulations Act 2009 had at its very core putting the customer first.  That is right.  While I agree with much of what my colleagues have said, I am not against competition but I want to see fair competition.  Does the Minister believe the competition is fair in how the licences are now issued?  There is a situation, for example, where we have the Bus &Eacute;ireann route between Waterford and Dublin servicing ten stops while the private contractor, which has a similar licence in regard to departure times, etc., services two stops between Waterford and Dublin.  Does the Minister believe this to be fair?  Does he not think that now is the time to address this?  Things constantly evolve and change, and no legislation is enshrined to be in existence for an indefinite period of time.  Does the Minister think that now is the time to carry out a regulatory review on how the NTA issues licences?</p></speech>

The Deputy spoke about the hire of coaches for the figure of &euro;7 million.  He also made reference to insurance costs soaring unnecessarily and difficult to explain.  These are operational issues which is why we have management and people operating the companies.  I am not going to micro-manage any of those semi-State bodies, in which I am a major shareholder, on a daily or weekly basis.  That is not my job.  Mr. Hernan, to whom the Deputy has given a great deal of credit, rightly or wrongly, although it is up to him, has made some statements about what he is going to do.  Those things may or may not be palatable to the Deputy but we must allow the new management and the unions to work out these issues between them.  While there have undoubtedly been problems there in the past, it is now possible to identify what has gone wrong.  The Deputy should not ask me to get involved on a daily basis in the work of management-----</p></speech>

No doubt we shall come to that point.  Those people are there to see management is doing its job, and the management is being monitored on a monthly basis.  That is not up to me.  I take Deputy Troy's point about looking at the annual report and asking about what is happening.  That is very fair indeed but do not ask a Minister to move in on details on a daily basis.</p></speech>

From the time the Minister was appointed and was made aware, as were his predecessor and the officials in the Department, of the serious financial situation pertaining to Bus &Eacute;ireann through various reports, what action has been taken?</p><p>I quoted some of the dates on which the Minister would have received reports.  Did the Minister at any time instruct board members or the then managing director or chief executive officer to take corrective actions?  The point I am making is that the lack of leadership and instruction from the Department for over 12 months - I am being generous in terms of that timeframe - allowed the situation to arise whereby greater losses were generated.  I do not expect the Minister to micro manage what is going on internally in the company but he was made aware of what was going on.  What did he do?</p></speech>

The Deputy said I received a large number of reports.  I did and I was also briefed by my officials on those reports on an almost daily basis.  The Deputy's question is a fair one.  I did not micro manage but I do not know off-hand how many times I have met the chairman or the chief executives of these companies but I can get that information and forward it to the Deputy.  I am speaking not just about Bus &Eacute;ireann but Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus as well.  I have been meeting them regularly since I became aware of the problems arising, if I have not been briefed by my officials.  Some of my officials are pretty fed up trotting up and down to my office because I am monitoring the situation very carefully.  I have had regular reports not just from my officials but from the chairpersons of these particular bodies.  That is what I have done.  That is my job.  It is my job to meet with them if a situation is becoming critical.  As I said, I can provide the Deputy with the information.  I have been talking to them on a regular basis not just in my office but by telephone.  I do not accept that I am neglecting any particular form of communication.  Far from it.  If the Deputy asks them I am sure he will be told that I have been quite demanding about getting answers on certain issues.</p></speech>

I have a copy of the letter that Bus &Eacute;ireann issued.  While I do not propose to outline in detail the list of inflammatory and demeaning cuts mentioned in it, including a reduction in pay of 30%, the following point might add a bit of weight to the pre-condition issue.  The letter states:</p><blockquote>I ask you to give full and careful consideration to this proposal and confirm your willingness to accept the overall objectives that we are both attempting to achieve by confirming acceptance.  We are willing to meet with all the unions to discuss the detail of these initiatives and how they could be best applied to practice. [It then gives the date of the meeting]  If we do not receive confirmation of your acceptance of these proposals then we will, as a matter of urgency, be seeking that the Labour Court would reconvene. </blockquote> <p>What is proposed is clear, precise and targeted.  Regardless of whether the Minister believes these are proposals, initiatives or pre-conditions, the unions are of the view that they are pre-conditions.  That is what they believe and that is what I and everybody else in the public domain believes.  They are precise pre-conditions and they are targeted at the workers.  The Minister said earlier that he would like to see the two parties come together and that there are no pre-conditions.  As I said, the unions believe there are pre-conditions.  I have previously raised with the Minister the issue of having the pre-conditions withdrawn.  Whether what is proposed are termed proposals, initiatives, pre-conditions, given the Minister's statement that he is anxious for the two parties to meet, will he agree to instruct or advise Bus &Eacute;ireann management to agree to set aside these pre-conditions so that the parties can enter into negotiations?  That is not an unreasonable ask of the Minister if, as he said, he is genuinely interested in resolving this matter.  </p><p>Let us accept that these are proposals or initiatives.  Will the Minister ask Bus &Eacute;ireann management to set aside its letter, which has only inflamed the entire situation, and meet with the unions?</p></speech>

I do not want to be partisan in any way either, because I do not believe that is my job.  If either party believes that there are pre-conditions then perhaps the WRC or the Labour Court should be the judge of whether or not they are.  It is my understanding that there are no pre-conditions.  When the chief executive appeared before the committee he said that there are no pre-conditions.  The unions have also said that there are no pre-conditions.  I can understand the Deputy's interpretation of the words but I will not instruct or advise because to do so would be to break the principle of getting involved.  However, I would appeal to management to repeat its claim and commitment that there are no pre-conditions.  I appeal to both sides to say publicly tonight that there are no pre-conditions.  That is all they need to say.  They then need to get around the table.</p></speech>

Given what lies ahead, in terms of the chaos in three weeks' time across our public transport network, will he do that?  The Minister is aware of the unions'' perception of this letter.  I believe it is an ultimatum to workers but the unions, workers and the public believe they are pre-conditions.  If the Minister is genuine about wanting to see this matter resolved will he instruct Bus &Eacute;ireann management to set aside that letter?  Will he agree to do that this evening so that the two parties can come together in discussions?</p></speech>

That was last night.  "The NTA will ensure that there is no negative impact on the connectivity of rural communities" was today.  That is a rather vague formulation, so let us pin it down.</p> <p>  There is a village.  Let us call it Ballykissangel.  Six Bus &Eacute;ireann buses pass through it every day.  As a result of current events, that service is axed.  The NTA brings in a private bus operator, which runs a bus through the village twice per day.  Technically, there is no negative impact on connectivity because there was connectivity yesterday, there is connectivity today and there will be connectivity tomorrow, but the people's service has been slashed by two thirds.</p> <p>  Let us tighten up the formulation.  Will the Minister give a commitment that the level of service to rural towns and villages will not be negatively impacted on irrespective of what happens in Bus &Eacute;ireann and that people will retain 100% of their current service levels?</p></speech>

I do not want myself or the Deputy to send out the message that connectivity is in some way going to be removed.  It is not.  Connectivity is the top priority.

One can argue that what is stated in the letter does not constitute preconditions but a negotiating position, if one stretches it a little.  I will tell the committee what a precondition is.  Mr. Hernan has stated publicly that he will unilaterally cut the driver's allowance for working on a Sunday, overtime, meal allowances, etc. in 19 days if the unions do not submit to something like this plan in negotiations.  Even if talks begin in the morning, unless Mr. Hernan withdraws his statement, he is effectively saying they talks have 18 days in which to succeed or he will slash take home pay.  That does not constitute a blank sheet of paper.  To be blunt, I call it a bloody big precondition.  If the Minister is genuine in the point he made about having a blank sheet of paper, will he call on Mr. Hernan to withdraw this precondition?</p></speech>

I want to ask him about the insolvency of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Mr. Hernan has said that within a year the company could reach a crunch.  He has also indicated that the board will be unable to sign off on reports at the end of March unless a plan is put in place.  He has talked about making unilateral cuts within 19 days, which means, as we all know, that there will be national strike action soon afterwards.  The Minister is in a situation where we are 19 days away from a national bus strike in a company that has a boss who has said the board will not be able to sign off on reports by the end of March and the entire company could be insolvent.  If it was to become insolvent, what would the cost be in terms of redundancies, lost tax revenue to the State and social welfare payments for 2,500 employees?  Can the Minister give us that figure?</p></speech>

If 2,500 workers were to claim social welfare payments at the minimum rate for a single person, it would cost the State &euro;26 million, but the final amount would be way more.  The figure for redundancy payments, with a minimum of two weeks' statutory payments, would be &euro;124 million, but the redundancy packages would be based on a period a lot longer than the statutory minimum of two weeks' payments.  The cost would run into hundreds of millions of euro.  That would be the result from a loss of &euro;9 million per year.  It is economics of the madhouse.  The cost to Bus &Eacute;ireann of meeting the PSO contract is &euro;40 million.  What was the figure for 2009?</p></speech>

The Deputy has made some points about insolvency and produced scary figures.  I do not know whether his figures are right or wrong, but I can probably give him an estimate.  If he likes, I can have his figures looked at and audited.  On what he has said and the scenario he has painted, I have no reason to doubt the bona fides.  It is very much appreciated that he has put these matters on the table because it is important that we hear that view.  If he is right - I am not saying he is - he is making the strongest possible argument for entering negotiations immediately and a far stronger one than I have made in the past few weeks.  If what he has said is true, we are facing a situation that demands attention and he should use his influence to get people to the table immediately.  Does he not see the obligation on him, as a public representative with influence, to say to some of the parties involved, "For God's sake, look at what is going to happen if this scenario occurs"?  I urge him to do so.  I will do it and have been doing so for two weeks.  Perhaps the Deputy might be more effective in saying, "Look at what is going to happen if an insolvency occurs.  For God's sake, get to the negotiating table."  That is what he should be doing.</p></speech>

The two sides will negotiate with that framework in the background.  At what point do the parties get into a discussion about non-viable routes, which are causing the problem?  Who negotiates that particular aspect, as it is not on the table?  If there are routes that are not viable but a service and connectivity must be maintained, does it come under the role of the Minister or the National Transport Authority, NTA?

I want to ask some further questions.  One relates to treating like with like.  For example, there is anecdotal evidence about the number of sick days taken and it was, let us say, a very unfavourable figure.  A number of bus drivers have told me they have been passed fit to go back to work by their doctors or hospital but when they present for work, they are put through a further battery of tests, which means they must stay on welfare.  Is that regime applied on a like-for-like basis?  There is supposed to be a national standard and public safety is the most important aspect.  Is the standard applied evenly, depending on whether the operator is Bus &Eacute;ireann or a private driver?  How is the standard monitored, as there is the suggestion of costs being a factor?  A letter I received also mentioned the cutting of pay.  The point is that sometimes people do not have the option to go back to work and are prevented by the company from doing so.</p></speech>

I am not getting involved or influencing events.  It is a matter of fact and the NTA fulfilling its mandate.  While I can understand why the Deputy is saying it might sound like I am interfering, I am only repeating what the NTA said.</p></speech>

He stated that on the Waterford to Dublin route, the service moves off the motorway in order to stop in some major towns and villages, whereas a private operator can go straight from A to B.  I have a bigger problem regarding funding.  The Minister will hide behind EU regulation.  In my own backyard, within the past week or two, a bus stopped in Mitchelstown on the way to Dublin with 45 passengers on board, of whom only three were cash-paying passengers.  How can we expect fair competition?  We must find a way around the issue of providing the PSO and still maintaining the Expressway service.  Bus &Eacute;ireann carried 42 passengers all the way to Dublin and, because it is a competitive route, got no money.  The matter must be addressed.  There is no point hiding behind EU competition regulation.  There is no fair competition.  The Cork to Dublin route is covered by private operators which go direct, whereas Bus &Eacute;ireann stops in Fermoy, Mitchelstown and Portlaoise along the way.  How is that fair competition?</p></speech>

As a human being and as an objective observer, I understand what he is saying.  There seem to be difficulties sometimes.  The Deputy should not tell me stop hiding behind EU regulation.  It is the law.  We must, sometimes unfortunately, abide by the law when it seems extremely inconvenient.  I see the problem with only three passengers paying.  The Deputy is talking about people benefiting from the free travel, is that correct?</p></speech>

This is behind the motivation for doing so.  What the Deputy mentioned is not uncommon.  I will not talk about his specific route.  Routes are for the operators to discuss with the NTA.  On the broader issue, the Deputy is right and I will discuss it with the Minister, Deputy Varadkar.  Private operators can also apply for free travel and some accept free travel passes.</p></speech>

The Minister acknowledged that the funding the Department of Social Protection is paying is inadequate.  This was identified in some of the earliest reports.  It is disappointing that the Minister still has not engaged with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe.  If we achieve nothing else today, could the Minister put a timeline on when the negotiations would be complete on increasing the subsidy to the Expressway service under a different heading by paying the provider of travel to the free travel pass holders an adequate fee for carrying the people who rely on it?</p> <p>  The Minister did not get an opportunity to answer in respect of the NTA earlier.  He quoted the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009 and powers for which it provides.  Perhaps some Acts can be left alone indefinitely but there is always an opportunity to amend, improve or modify legislation.  Although the NTA is coming in for much criticism, it is doing only what the Act enables it to do.  Is there an opportunity to amend the legislation and would the Minister be amenable to having an independent regulatory review on how the NTA conducts its business carried out?</p></speech>

The NTA has already done a review of bus licensing.  It is obliged to carry out such a review every five years.  I do not think it is necessary to do it.  Given that the review is under consideration in my Department, it would be absurd to do it again.</p></speech>

Given that Deputy Troy is the Opposition spokesperson on transport, I would be very keen to share it with him.  That would only be fair.  I have to examine the implications involved.  I am not trying to be evasive, rather I am seeking to be helpful.  I am not sure it should be made public if it reveals to competitors a large number of facts that they would find useful.  As a matter of principle, I would be pretty happy to share the review with Deputy Troy, particularly in view of the fact that in all my dealings with him, I have found him to be somewhat controversial and colourful but completely honourable.  I would be very happy to share it with him in that sense.  I will ask my Department's advice to see if the information it contains is commercially sensitive.  The review has been done and it is mostly to do with compliance and techniques and how the system is operating rather than any big decisions on routes.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked me for a date by which the free travel negotiations would be settled.  This morning, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, said it could not happen before 2018 because all the money involved is tied up.  I will not give an absolute date.  However, it is something we would all appreciate and the Deputy can see exactly why I would like to conclude the negotiations as soon as possible.  I regard this as a matter to be dealt with urgently.  The commitment to change the way of funding is urgent.  We need it.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, has been extremely helpful and  co-operative.  We will do it as soon as we possibly can.</p></speech>

Representatives of Bus &Eacute;ireann came before the committee last week and we asked about the severance packages for recent retirees who were senior employees.  We were given the impression that they were subject to privacy agreements.  Why is this the case?  Given that public money is involved, surely this information should be in the public domain.</p></speech>

There is a <i>prima facie</i>argument that they should be in the public domain because public money is involved.  I understand that some of them will be released in next year's annual report.</p><p>There is a conflict which, I have to be honest, I have not even resolved myself .  It is a conflict relating to whether severance payments, which are sometimes - often rightly - seen to be absolutely excessive and unacceptable, should be hidden from the public.  If that happens, it is absolutely wrong.  On the other hand, some of them certainly are subject to confidentiality agreements.  Obviously a conflict arises and it is difficult to resolve.  A person signs a confidentiality agreement with a public company and public money is involved.  The person is entitled to individual privacy.  Aside from that the Chairman is, quite rightly, asking whether the public is entitled to know the details.  It is a difficult question to answer and I do not know the answer.</p></speech>

Is this something the Department could examine for future reference in order to ensure it will not happen again?  Can we provide for the public to be fully informed of what is being paid under severance packages to individuals?  Can it be done such that confidentiality clauses would not be allowable?</p></speech>

Let us consider how sensitive matters are at present.  Serious demands are being sought from employees throughout the company.  It is difficult for people to swallow an arrangement whereby some people are more special than others and confidentiality exists surrounding particular pay packages.  Is that something your Department can examine to ensure people cannot hide behind it in future?</p></speech>

That is something we could not countenance or tolerate for long.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform oversees the code of practice for State bodies.  I gather that a new provision is coming along to the effect that payments of this sort will not be the subject of confidential agreements.  I am of the view that they should not be subject to such agreements.  I am against the idea that a person can work for a State body and be paid off with vast amounts of money that would make a banker blush.  I am not saying it has happened recently but it has happened in the past.  The idea is completely indefensible.</p></speech>

It was raised again last week.  For the record, the committee will hear from representatives from the Department of Social Protection in some weeks to discuss matters pertaining to free travel.</p><p>I am pleased to hear the clarification today.  It is important to put people at ease and that they are reassured that there is no plan to curtail the free travel scheme.  The scheme is important to a large number of people.  It is their only lifeline, their only way of getting from A to B.  It is also important to acknowledge that for some people free travel is not beneficial.  These people are altogether outside the limits of public transport.  They do not travel outside their local communities and those communities are not served well.  This needs to be recognised.  I have long held the belief that these people should have the option of some form of monetary provision towards private transport.  Again, that is a matter for the Department of Social Protection because that Department administers the scheme &ndash; I appreciate that.</p><p>I am of the view that there is almost a <i>laissez-faire</i>approach on the part of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in respect of the free transport scheme in the sense that it is administered by the Department of Social Protection.  However, abuse of the scheme impacts directly on transport providers.  I have heard numerous anecdotes regarding abuses of the system, including stories relating to the companion pass system and the number of old passes still in circulation.  What is the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport doing to clamp down on abuse?  The Department of Social Protection administers the scheme.  Subsequently, however, when abuse takes place the losses are incurred by the transport providers.  There is serious concern in the public domain that this system is being abused, and that some people who really should not be benefiting from the scheme are doing so.  What is happening on that front?</p></speech>

It is an interesting suggestion.  I imagine the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, would be interested to hear about it as well.  We might put it on the table when we are talking to him about other things.  It is his baby, really, but it is an interesting suggestion.  You are referring to people who never use the scheme but who are entitled to it.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

There is a similar option with the household benefits packages.  People can tick certain boxes and so on.  Again, the cost of administration would have to be weighed up.  Anyway, I have long held the view that it could be an option for someone who might wish to choose it.</p> <p>  There is concern over abuse.  I have spoken to bus drivers and people working not only in Bus &Eacute;ireann but across the board in Irish Rail.  They are concerned about flagrant abuse of the system.  They cannot clamp down on it because they do not have the mechanisms.  I gather that only three Revenue inspectors are in place nationwide to work with Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Is that correct?  Three officials oversee and implement the free travel scheme.  There are 1.2 million cardholders.  That corresponds to 400,000 cardholders per inspector.</p></speech>

I have no wish to say anything to suggest that we are going to clamp down on or reduce free travel in any way.  There is absolutely no question of it.  We are not going to do that.  However, I understand the point the Chairman is making.  The new public service cards are helping.  In the main, it is a matter for the Department of Social Protection.  I imagine the Chairman will make representations, but I will certainly put it into the channel of communication.</p></speech>

I do not believe that is happening.  That is the point.  The Department of Social Protection is operating the scheme and I do not think it is a matter for that Department to do any more.  That Department is issuing the new electronic identification cards and so on.  However, not enough is being done by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to ensure abuse is prevented.  That is the point.  This needs to be examined.</p> <p>  The scheme is in place and it is valuable.  It is in place to provide and assist vulnerable people who do not have access to other modes of transport in most cases.  Unfortunately, when people abuse the system, it impacts on those who need it most.  They become the losers.</p> <p>  In recent years, oil prices have come down significantly.  Thankfully, this has been a help.  We have seen some small rises recently.  Last week, I asked about the implementation of the fuel-saving mechanisms on buses.  I was told that a 1% saving would amount to &euro;360,000.  This suggests &euro;36 million is what Bus &Eacute;ireann spends on fuel.  The figures are particularly high.  That is a vast amount for any State company to spend per annum.  What level of oversight does the Department over procurement to ensure the company is getting the best value for money?  Given such amounts, even small margins represent major potential losses or gains for the company, and, therefore, for the State and the public.  Given the scale of expenditure, is there forensic examination of the procurement process for fuel by the Department?</p></speech>

This is something that happens a good deal.</p><p>Responsibility rests with the board of management but I can discover for the Chairman what is the position.  We can ask about it and see what is happening.  I note what was said last week.  It was obviously a management responsibility that was being taken very seriously and dealt with quite constructively.  It would presumably be brought to the board.  I am not in any way trying to cop out of it because I can find out for the committee.  It is not something that a Minister would normally get involved in but we can certainly find out about it.</p><p> To answer the question on abuses or possible abuses, I will ask my Department to examine matters to see what is being done and what is the level of awareness.  The Chairman makes a fair point.</p></speech>

When the Department is such an important customer and is spending that amount on fuel every year, then maybe the ball is in the Department's court.  The Department has more muscle than other buyers.  I thank the Minister.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Keeffe has a final question.</p></speech>

The cost of insurance premiums has become phenomenal.  Is there anything the Minister's Department can do about it to help alleviate it?  Can the Department refer it to the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to look at it in the overall context of insurance premiums and costs?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-01a.675" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017020100002#V00400"><p>I am glad the Deputy asked that question.  Insurance premiums, from memory, leapt from &euro;1.9 million to &euro;6.5 million in one year.  Those are approximately the correct figures.  They are very worrying.  The Deputy has spotted something in the accounts that is obviously a concern.  It is a big figure that sticks out a mile when one examines the position in detail.  Part, not all, of the reason is because it is motor insurance - when buses have collisions and there are claims, they are very expensive.  There has been a change of actuaries because many of the provisions being made are coming under scrutiny.  Provisions being made for insurance need to come under scrutiny as a result of that.  One of the questions I asked as recently as this week is how this is happening.  I am going to get a report on that.  It is a very fair question.</p></speech>

I am conscious that the Minister has been here since just after 1.30 p.m. and that has to go to the D&aacute;il now.  The joys of being a Minister.  I again thank the Minister for his time and I thank members and everyone here for their assistance.</p></speech>
