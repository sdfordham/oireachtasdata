    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-08a.31" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012110800003#B01900"><p>Members will have received, as requested, detailed documentation on allowances.  Therefore, I intend to be brief in my opening remarks.  </p><p>  In 2011 the HSE Vote outturn was &euro;13.9 billion.  Of this, &euro;6.4 billion represented expenditure on direct pay costs, excluding superannuation.  At the end of 2011 health service employment stood at 104,392 staff in whole-time equivalents.  In addition to basic pay, the health service incurs pay costs in the areas of night duty, weekend payments, overtime and on-call payments, locum costs, PRSI and allowances.</p><p>  I take the opportunity to clarify that the schedule of allowances provided for the purposes of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform review of allowances and premium payments is a subset of allowances as reported in the HSE statutory financial statements, namely, the appropriation account and the annual financial statement.  There is a wider interpretation of allowances in the financial statements which use the classifications contained in the Department of Health's consolidated pay scales.  For example, the Department's consolidated pay scales classify sessional and on-call payments as allowances.  These types of payments are not allowances in the strict sense and have, therefore, been excluded, with the agreement of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, from our submission prepared for the purposes of that Department's review of allowances and premium payments.</p><p>  Further work is under way to refine the data provided for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The HSE operates multiple legacy payroll systems which do not facilitate the automated reporting of the information required by the Department and the exercise required significant manual analysis within a very challenging timeframe.  As a result, the information provided has been estimated and extrapolated, where necessary.  A full reconciliation with the statutory financial statements will be completed shortly and can be provided to the committee, if required.  In this context, for 2011 the total cost of allowances in the health sector amounted to &euro;166.5 million, or 2.61% of the total pay bill.  Of this, &euro;86.9 million was spent on allowances paid to nursing staff, with &euro;36.3 million being paid to care and support staff and &euro;29.3 million to medical and dental staff.  The remaining &euro;14 million was paid to management and administration staff who received &euro;9.2 million and health and social care professionals who received &euro;4.7million.  This is all detailed in a table provided for members.</p><p>  A total of 41 allowances were identified as payable in the HSE as part of the review of allowances.  Of these, 12 are particular to the nursing profession which accounts for 34% of all staff employed.  A significant number of the allowances involved stem from the resolution of a protracted period of industrial unrest in the nursing profession in the second half of the 1990s.  This process also involved a number of Labour Court recommendations on the allowance issue during this period.  The main thrust in the granting of these allowances was to recognise the nursing staff working in areas in which specialised skills were required or in areas in which the nature of the work was particularly arduous.  There was a severe shortage of nurses in Ireland at the time, with employers recruiting from countries such as the Philippines and South Africa.  Members will note from the detailed information provided that the basic salary of a new entrant staff nurse is a scale running from &euro;27,211 to &euro;39,420.</p><p>  It is worth noting that of the 41 allowances identified, 31 are legacy allowances, predating 2000, with the majority having their origins in the 1970s and 1980s through long-standing agreements and-or custom and practice which developed during the life of the former health board structure.  Of these, nine are historical red-circled allowances that have not been paid to new employees for a considerable period of time.</p><p>  In more recent times the necessity to remunerate staff for service developments has changed and in most cases allowances have been sanctioned only where legislative or regulatory changes have so dictated.  An example of an allowance approved in 2011 is the forensic psychiatry out-of-hours service allowance which was put in place on foot of the recommendation made in the Barr report following the Abbeylara siege.</p> <p>Due to the challenges posed by the legacy payroll systems predating the HSE, it has been difficult to quantify with precision the exact number of staff and costs associated to individual allowances.  However, the information available shows an estimated total of 36,887 staff in the HSE in receipt of an allowance.  Of this number, the greatest number of staff in receipt of allowances relate to two specific allowances paid to nursing staff, namely, the location allowance payable to 6,164 staff at an estimated cost of &euro;9.1 million and the specialist qualification allowance paid to 5,232 staff at an estimated cost of &euro;14.5 million.  These allowances have been approved as part of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, DPER, review, subject to further review, and my colleague, Mr. Barry O'Brien, national director of human resources, HR, will explain in more detail the background to these and the other allowances payable in the health sector.</p><p> It should be noted that the information provided to the committee today reflects national allowances paid across the health sector with the detail on costs and staff numbers provided for the HSE only.  An exercise to capture the detail of allowances paid in the voluntary sector is currently being finalised for submission to DPER.</p><p> An area of high expenditure which has been an ongoing concern to management and is subject to current negotiation with the staff representatives is the area of acting up allowances.  The estimated cost of acting up allowances for 2011 in the HSE is &euro;17.7 million<b>.  </b>As a 24 hour, seven day a week service it is essential to have the flexibility of staff to cover in a higher capacity, often at short notice, to ensure continued patient safety and minimal clinical risk.  The cost associated with providing this high quality standard of care while working within a decreasing employment control framework has necessitated the need to reassess the viability of the HSE to continue to pay such costs into the future.  In this regard, our current negotiations with the staff representatives is seeking to secure agreement that acting up will only be payable where the acting up period exceeds 84 days.  These negotiations are in keeping with the decision made by DPER on the outcome of the review in respect of acting up.  We anticipate that negotiations will be concluded shortly and the new arrangement implemented with immediate effect, thereby facilitating considerable savings to the Exchequer.</p><p> Finally, it is worth acknowledging that there are approximately 600 different grades of staff employed across the health sector, with the majority of staff not in receipt of an allowance.  Health services have evolved and developed over the past number of decades to meet the growing demands of our ageing population and the diversity of the health and social services now required, and this has been achieved through the dedication and commitment of all staff working in the health services.  The health reform agenda under the programme for Government continues to be progressed through active engagement with the representative organisations in line with the public service agreement with resulting development of efficiencies, increased productivity in the use of resources and the generation of savings.</p><p> That concludes my opening statement.</p></speech>

I thank them for attending what is probably the last day of our analysis of the various public sector allowances across the Departments and agencies.</p><p>  There were two striking items in Mr. O'Brien's opening statement.  He stated: "Due to the challenges posed by the legacy payroll systems predating the HSE, it has been difficult to quantify with precision the exact number of staff and costs associated to individual allowances."  That is the first time we have been told by an Accounting Officer that they are not in a position to quantify the number of individuals and the amount of specific allowances.  Perhaps he would expand on that point.  I appreciate there is the issue of legacy payroll systems that predate the HSE, but the HSE is not a new entity as it has been in existence for more than a decade.  Mr. O'Brien might update the committee on the current position with overhauling that payroll system.  He also spoke about being unable to quantify with precision the exact number of staff and costs associated with them.  To which allowances is he referring and how good is the estimate?</p></speech>

When I last appeared before the committee we spoke on a number of occasions about the absence of enterprise-wide information communications technology, ICT, solutions, which has been a feature of the life to date of the Health Service Executive.  We are examining, both for the purposes of the HSE for the remainder of its life and for the purposes of the health sector beyond the HSE, the appropriate solutions to enable good extraction of data.  With regard to the degree of confidence we have about the estimates, I will ask my colleague Mr. Barry O'Brien to comment on that.</p></speech>

We are clearly indicating that this comprises all staff employed directly by the HSE and all staff fully funded by the HSE.  If one breaks that down, therefore, we have approximately 65,000 staff directly employed and the remainder of the 102,000 are employed by voluntary hospitals and other voluntary agencies.  That is the total figure from our financial data for what is being spent on allowances.  That is the full scope.</p><p>  That said, as Mr. Tony O'Brien said in his opening statement, a separate exercise is currently being prepared for the staff numbers and costs which we gave to the committee per allowance.  In other words, if one looks at the data we gave the committee and I said there are X number of nurses on location and other allowances, they relate to HSE staff only.  An exercise to capture the details of allowance paid in the voluntary sector is currently being finalised and will be with DPER, but it will deliver the totality of the sum which we declared in our opening statement.</p></speech>

If the committee requires further information on the breakdown of the number of nurses in our sector and in the voluntary sector, I can supply that.</p></speech>

Mr. Tony O'Brien pointed out that the Department of Health consolidated pay scales classify seasonal payments and on-call payments as allowances but that the DPER review did not, or, with the agreement of the DPER, they were not included as allowances.  That is different from how we have dealt with every other Department.  Perhaps Ms Buckley can clarify this.  In the previous meetings I have attended we have included on-call allowances, although I cannot be sure of seasonal payments.  Why did DPER consider it suitable not to include on-call allowances?</p></speech>

Some Departments, for completeness, included things such as shift allowances, on-call allowances and so forth, but they were not mainly the focus of the allowances review, which was what we call the duty-based allowances.  In other words, allowances aimed at delivering a 24 hour, seven day per week working environment were not really the focus because, broadly speaking, they are closer to overtime and the like.  It was primarily the allowances that dealt with whether people were being paid an allowance for a particular type of task that predates modern working environments and so forth.</p> <p>To a degree, allowances are based on being on-call and working shifts.  They were submitted because of the confusion of language but they were not the primary focus of this.  These allowances need to be paid in environments where we must offer a 24/7 service.</p></speech>

At this committee, we have already discussed the many allowances submitted that most people acknowledge are core pay.  It would have been helpful to have submitted the full breadth of allowances, as other Departments have done, and I am unsure why they have been excluded.  It seems at odds with how other Departments have interpreted the review.  It is possibly inconsistent.</p></speech>

The reality of having theatre nurses and consultants on-call remained a reality in the day-to-day service delivery model.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform never envisaged a risk to service provision in reviewing allowances.  The figure we have provided includes a portion of that but we focus on allowances formally approved and recognised for specific individual professional grades, which we submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as part of the allowance review.</p></speech>

The B-factor is specifically for having a liability to be on call while the C-factor is paid when one is called out.  All other medical grades, from interns to senior house officers to senior specialist registrars, receive on-call payments because of the liability to provide on-call services in the 365 day service.</p></speech>

It would be particularly useful if we could have the figures broken down by grade in terms of how much is paid for nurses on-call and consultants.  Much of our discussion at the many committee meetings Ms Buckley has attended concern where allowances are going.  In many areas, the allowances go to relatively low paid employees.  One may have a concern about the payments being called allowances but no one begrudges someone at the lowest end of a pay scale receiving what is effectively core pay.  If a consultant is earning a very large salary and receiving additional allowances, it is of interest to the committee.</p><p>  Returning to the opening statement and the reference to 41 allowances, the HSE submitted 20 business cases.  For 21 of the 41 allowances, the HSE did not submit a business case.  Can Mr. O'Brien clarify where those 21 allowances rest?</p></speech>

The level of absenteeism, as of September 2012, runs at 4.69% while our target is 3.5%.  It is incremental and slow but the improvement is consistent with any European country delivering health services.  It is also consistent with Northern Ireland and the NHS.  I advise the committee that there are no circumstance where anyone in management and administration is replaced in instances of sick leave.  There are no overtime costs arising from absenteeism in the management and administration grade.  It arises predominantly in nursing, support staff and direct front line patient care staff.  The best performing group for absenteeism are the medical and dental group, where the absenteeism rate amounts to 1.1%.  There is occasion to replace a doctor in a crisis.</p> <p>The absenteeism rate for nurses is approximately 6.5%.  One can see, therefore, that in those instances we are challenged to replace directly one for one.  In the main, of the &euro;169,857 in overtime, it is in both the medical and nursing areas.  Obviously, it is not all due to absenteeism; it is to maintain rosters and rotas.  I was asked about absenteeism and it is important to note that it is almost only in front-line services and not in all instances that we replace.</p></speech>

One is paying a fee and VAT is involved as well, but obviously there is no pension cost associated with that so there is very little differential - it is slight - between the actual cost of an agency nurse and another nurse.</p></speech>

To be fair, there is a focused approach towards reducing absenteeism and making clear to everybody the shared responsibility for having good attendance management.  It is difficult to give the Deputy a direct answer and say whether absenteeism results in additional overtime costs.</p></speech>

When I speak to private sector companies, they can clearly tell me the cost of absenteeism to their organisations.  I accept that Mr. O'Brien is operating off a complex payroll system, but it would be interesting to have an idea of the cost to the taxpayer of absenteeism in the health service.

I wish to have a quick look at some of the allowances.  I understand that the living-out allowance for registrars, house officers and interns is paid to non-consultant doctors who are rotating between hospitals to help them secure temporary accommodation which is not available on the hospital site.  In Mr. O'Brien's business case, the HSE has acknowledged that there might be merit in reducing the weekly allowance.  I also know that the Labour Court has an opinion on the payment of the allowance and its continuance.  Does Mr. O'Brien have an estimate of how much the HSE could save?  I understand that if it is in the course of negotiation, he may not want to reveal that.  How did the HSE originally set the rate for this allowance?</p></speech>

It was revisited on a number of occasions during formal contract negotiations.  It was more recently determined in Labour Court recommendation No. LCR19702, which recommended the continuance of the allowance.  The allowance of &euro;61.20 per week was paid to a total of 5,251 staff in 2011 at a total cost to the HSE of &euro;8.1 million.</p></speech>

To set this in context, this allowance is to compensate mental health nurses for loss of earnings when moved from a hospital to a community setting.  Payment ranges from &euro;4,962 to &euro;5,722 per annum and the allowance cost about &euro;3.4 million in 2011.  I have a question arising from anecdotal experience.  Is it necessary to offer this inducement?  One of the main gripes that many nurses have - or one of the main challenges of their profession - is the long, anti-social hours.  The fact that a nurse is moving to a community setting as part of a primary care team enables people to have a more regular work-rest lifestyle.  Is it necessary to offer the inducement?  I imagine that this type of work might suit many people within the nursing profession very well.  How is the formula for loss of earnings, between the sums of  &euro;4,962 to &euro;5,722 per annum, actually calculated?</p></speech>

In 1984, the then Government's policy on the development of mental health services was entitled Planning for the Future.  It would have seen a major shift from institutional to community care.  The norm at that time was for the majority of mental health nurses to work in a hospital setting, usually on a long day shift and seven-day fortnights.  The first major move to the community took place in Castlerea.  There is a well-known formula, called the Castlerea formula, established by Labour Court recommendation No. LCR13358, which determined the compensatory factors.  What happened was that as we moved to the community, to compensate for the loss of access to premium earnings from weekend work and night duty, it was agreed that a community allowance would be introduced to entice staff to move from institutional care to community care.  That continued and was repeatedly re-stated in many subsequent Labour Court recommendations.  I can confirm, however, that this has no longer applied to any newly recruited mental health staff since 2010, as part of our changed programme under the public service agreement.  It is very much a legacy matter.</p></speech>

The idea of paying people because they do not have to work nights or at weekends was a bit bizarre.</p><p>  The GP training allowance is an interesting one and there may well be very good reasons for it.

Under the Department of Health and Children circular 99/2000 on Non Consultant Hospital Doctors agreement, the contract agreement included an annual pensionable allowance payable to GP registrars on an approved scheme.  This allowance is paid in lieu of 120 hours worked outside of normal working hours.  The allowance is currently &euro;11,430 per annum and was paid to 76 GP trainees in 2011 at a total cost of &euro;553,131.

There is craft worker's tool allowance, an allowance given to craft workers for the purchase of their tools.  I understand it is abolished for new beneficiaries.  I though this was peculiar.  We have this provision in other sectors, such as the local authorities.  I understand 352 staff received this allowance in 2011 and it amounted to &euro;280,497.  What regulations are in place for this allowance?  Is it vouched expenditure?  Is all the money being spent on buying tools?  Would it be more beneficial if the HSE were to provide the tools?  Is it proposed that the HSE will buy the tools, with the suggested abolition of the allowance?</p></speech>

The craft workers would have what is termed an "analogue agreement".  Part of the analogue agreement would have contained specific reference to this allowance.  Currently there are 352 staff receiving the allowance of &euro;843.60c.  The cost to the HSE is &euro;280.497.  It has been abolished for new beneficiaries.

That is a centrally negotiated allowance which is being examined by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We will be considering it in the context of priority industrial relations negotiations.

One of the key bodies of work we have been doing in the past number of meetings is to try to look at where the allowances are going and the salary scale of those receiving the allowances so that we have an informed opinion on whether these people are earning a substantial public sector salary or trucking along.  We need to have all the information.  It would be very useful to have a breakdown of on-call and seasonal allowances.  In terms of the reform of public expenditure, we need to establish the potential inconsistency in submissions received from agencies and that might be something we can look at in our own report</p></speech>

We can certainly provide information on the amount of money spent on the level of overtime and agency staff in regard to nursing, medical and in each category of work.  We can provide that information immediately to the committee tomorrow.</p></speech>

When I was here last we spoke at length on the absence of enterprise wide ICT solutions, which would enable us at the press of a button to extract information related to the totality of our direct employment.  The fact that we do not have a single system means there is a significant amount of manual intervention required in order to piece together the information from a multiplicity of systems.</p></speech>

The proposal we have put forward in our action plan is an internal shared services for HR in the health system.  As one can imagine, there is a significant number of stakeholders involved.  It would not be a short-term project .  It would take a couple of years for it to fully materialise that all public health providers would be the end-service users of a shared service model.  Currently in the HSE, all our recruitment is done on a shared service basis.  All pensions and personal administration is being managed through a shared service model.</p></speech>

It strikes me that there is no reason the HSE cannot keep it in-house.  Similarly, how does it sit with the Croke Park agreement which specifically provides that outsourcing should be a last resort when all other avenues have been exhausted?</p></speech>

A specific appendix to the Croke Park agreement deals with external service provision options.  There is a requirement on us all to achieve the maximum efficiencies for direct health service provision from the funding we receive.  It might be more effective, including more cost-effective, to avail of an external provider to meet significant infrastructural requirements in areas such as information technology.  That might prove to be a good solution from a staff perspective and in delivering the payroll function.  It is not as if the staff would not be employed.  Obviously, they would be redeployed within the wider health family, in line with the public service agreement.  The Deputy might ask questions if we were investing substantially in payroll infrastructure when an external provider could provide the service in an efficient and cost-effective manner.</p></speech>

We are committed to meeting specific requirements under the external service provision option.  We have to give a detailed proposal to the unions involved.  We are committed to operating within that framework and need to focus on where best to spend the limited resources we have available.  Perhaps we might get a highly cost-effective payroll system externally, while redeploying the existing staff to front-line services.  I will give an example.  The number of management-administration staff is now at its lowest level for some time.  It is close to December 2002 levels.  One of the scarcest resources in the health system is a grade 3 clerical officer.  It would be far better for them to be working on the front line - managing clinics and assisting consultants - than providing payroll services which are fundamental to any organisation.  It is an option for consideration as we face our challenges.</p></speech>

In that context, we have an obligation to consider which services must be provided by directly employed staff and which services might be better provided in other ways.  When I said we were not committed to this change, that is exactly what I meant.  We are committed to using the resources available to us as best we can to provide the very best health services we can.  That involves examining whether ancillary or back office activities might be better provided using a different mechanism, where it is more appropriate and where the national agreements provide for it to happen.</p></speech>

Clinical directors had to meet specific requirements under mental health legislation.  The title of "clinical director" was not in use outside the mental health service.  As part of our negotiations on the 2008 contract, we sought to bring clinical leadership to the fore in the planning and delivery of all health services, particularly in acute hospitals.  Some initiatives involving directorate and programmatic models, in which services are planned on a programmatic basis, had been pursued.  As part of the negotiations on the 2008 consultants' contract, it was agreed that clinical directors would be put in place with a view to providing direct clinical leadership for the body of consultants.  That was a significant change from the previous contract which identified each consultant as an independent contractor.  This brought the management, governance and accountability of consultants into line.  On that basis, a role was developed for clinical directors.  This was included in Appendix 4 to the 2008 consultants' contract and became part of the agreement.  We have introduced clinical directors across acute settings.  The first positions were filled within a short period.  They were introduced and the clinical directors appointed by way of nomination and agreement among the consultant body.  That term is now up.  We intend to open interviews to fill clinical director posts across our system.</p></speech>

It is fair to say the Government is planning a major reconfiguration by way of hospital groupings and subsequently moving to trusts.</p> <p>Obviously, the whole clinical director model will be fundamental in providing governance and accountability as well as managing objectives, outcomes and a cohort of consultants.  On that basis, no defined number has been agreed but we are looking for maximum efficiency.  We are talking about the major acute hospital sites where they exist and, in the main, they exist on a programmatic approach.</p></speech>

It is a large allowance, however, even as a percentage of the large salaries that consultants get.  What is the distinction between the three different contracts for consultants?</p></speech>

Contract type B is for all new consultants recruited on post-2008 contracts, which allows on-site private practice up to 80:20 for newly-appointed consultants.  A contract type B may exist for a consultant who held the previous contract but who was category 1.  They could have a variable up to a maximum of 70:30 private practice.  Then there is contract type B*.  This is for consultants who have access to off-site private practice once they have met their 37-hour commitment to public service.  Again, these are consultants who held a category 2 contract prior to the 2008 contract.  There is a contract type C but that has not been used so far.  This contract is to replace the existing type B* where in the public interest an exceptional case would be made in that a type C consultant could be appointed.</p></speech>

Second, there are those differentials in terms of rates of pay and, more specifically, to the public health system.  If one is paying an allowance like that for such a pivotal position as clinical director, from a policy point of view it would make sense that preference would be clearly given to those who carry out their work in the public system alone, for the very reason offered by Mr. O&rsquo;Brien that the clinical directors would be core in the delivery of service and reconfiguration of hospitals.  I would like to know category by category who is in receipt of what.</p></speech>

There would also be a significant number in the acute system on type B contracts and, obviously, some on B* contracts.  No restriction was placed on who had the potential to apply under consultant contract 2008.</p></speech>

For people holding a historic contract, one is looking for the brightest and the best to take on the role of managing their own peers and consultants.  In our recent discussions with the consultants under the Croke Park agreement and the Labour Relations Commission, we have further endorsed and enhanced the role of the clinical director as being the senior manager for all clinicians.</p></speech>

The argument has been consistently made that these very high salaries are paid to these individuals because they are all the brightest and the best.  Mr. O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s response to me does not tally with that argument or defence, however.  It would be good for the purposes of the committee&rsquo;s investigation if Mr. O&rsquo;Brien could break down the contractual arrangements with each of the 59 individuals in question.</p></speech>

The point Mr. O&rsquo;Brien made was not about their general ability as high-flying medics but their ability to provide leadership to their medical colleagues as well as for the changes necessary in models of care and so on.  Notwithstanding the valid points Deputy McDonald has made about the scale of the fee and so on, clinical directors are a critical component of achieving better value and efficiency in our hospital system.  They are also a critical part of the way hospitals are being reformed.</p></speech>

What is the wisdom behind abolishing the midwifery allowance, for example, when the focus now is on primary and care in the community and the maternity hospitals are under absolutely incredible strain?  In 2011, 924 persons were in receipt of this midwifery allowance at a cost of &euro;2.3 million, an allowance which was not pensionable.</p></speech>

Accordingly, why would one pay an allowance when there is no requirement to be a midwife to become a public health nurse?  There are many other areas of specialties in which nurses are graduating and they wish to enter the public health nurse arena.  Up to a short time ago, a nurse had to be a midwife to do so.  This has been removed and it is on that basis, solely, that this allowance will be abolished for new beneficiaries.</p></speech>

If one examines specialist qualification allowances, a significant number in excess of 20, we already pay a dedicated allowance for nurses who possess a higher diploma in midwifery.  If a nurse wants to practice midwifery, we will pay him or her a higher allowance.  We are not saying, however, that it is an essential prerequisite to be a public health nurse working in primary care.</p></speech>

Where it has been deployed, I understand it is a relatively efficient system, but it has never been rolled out nationally.  It is in different places in different phases of its release and, therefore, does not at this time represent a unified solution for payroll processing in the health system.

Mr. Tony O'Brien referred to the fact that he was also in the management service of a modern HSE.  I raised the question previously and I have put the representatives on notice that I would probably raise the issue.  Within the consultants area, &euro;74 million in private fee income remains unbilled to insurance companies.  I was told on 9 October that there were specific problems with some consultants in terms of completion of forms.  On the previous occasion the HSE appeared before the committee we were informed that &euro;8 million was outstanding for more than a year.  I am looking at this in the context of front-line cuts of the order of &euro;58 million before the end of the year.  It is ironic that &euro;8 million of that relates to home help hours and &euro;8 million of the &euro;74 million is the amount that is outstanding for more than 12 months.  For me the issue is simple.</p><p>  Does the clinical director's role involve examining whether the forms are signed and is that the only reason the claims have not been put in?  Is there a specific person in each hospital designated by the HSE to ensure forms are completed by consultants and claims submitted?  I commend the HSE on the fact it got &euro;125 million in accelerated payments from the insurance companies.  I see no reason the same cannot happen in respect of the &euro;74 million unclaimed private fee income.  It could be looked at in the form of an accelerated payment from the insurance companies.  This is about management.</p><p>  What is the clinical director's role in interacting with consultants?  Is there a specific person in place in the HSE at administration level to ensure the forms are signed?  I understand that in many cases patient files are not presented to consultants to sign-off on insurance claims.  Given that &euro;74 million has not been claimed in fee income, in the context of the HSE being required to make front-line cuts of &euro;58 million, &euro;8 million of which relates to home help hours, something is not right.</p><p>  I do not fully accept that it is tied in with the Labour Court.  This is an administrative issue.  Somebody should be put on the job full time to lug the files to the consultants to sign them because a submission cannot be made to the insurance companies unless the form is signed off by the consultant.  Is there a requirement for a change in legislation to the effect that it could be signed off by a senior house doctor rather than a consultant?  Is it all about management?  Will Mr. O'Brien give me an update on the role of the clinical director, the allowances paid and where that stands?  At this time the HSE is having to make adjustments in home help hours which are impacting on people.</p> <p>Clearly, the HSE is doing it because it is in very difficult circumstances but on behalf of the people we represent, we are looking for angles whereby the HSE can pull in money and not have to make adjustments such as these.  In that context, this &euro;74 million is sticking out like a sore thumb.  I have had time to reflect on this and I simply cannot understand why the claims have not been sent to the insurance companies.  It is totally unacceptable and I ask Mr. O'Brien to deal with that issue.</p></speech>

The HSE managers are seeking a commitment from all consultants to fully comply and sign private insurance forms within 14 days of receipt of all of the relevant documentation.  The purpose of this provision is to effect a significant reduction in outstanding income due to the public health system.  We have also advised consultants that persistent failure to comply will be addressed by the employer, under relevant procedures.  Furthermore, we have also highlighted the need for co-operation with the secondary consultants scheme, whereby a secondary consultant involved in a case can sign the claim form if the primary consultant has not done so within a reasonable timeframe.</p></speech>

There are roughly seven weeks left in the year.  Can these forms be signed off so that the insurance companies can be billed for the outstanding &euro;74 million, with some accelerated payment system put in place so that the HSE does not have to implement the cuts to front-line services that have been signalled?  The most obvious one that people want to see reversed is the cut to home help hours.   I ask the representatives to address that point.  I accept that they are playing hard ball on the issue but I need to know if they will get a result.  I am interested in the practicalities and I am pressing the matter because it is very important.  The amount of money in question is considerable and it is long overdue.  Of a total of &euro;74 million outstanding, one could probably expect approximately &euro;15 million to be outstanding at any given time.  Therefore, approximately &euro;60 million should be pulled in without further delay.</p></speech>

The forms should be signed in a timely and consistent fashion.  When we were before the committee previously we also spoke to Deputies about the phenomenon known as pended claims, that is, the interval between the submission of a fully signed form and the receipt of funds by the HSE from the insurers.</p></speech>

Clearly, though, if funds flow in and our projected end-of-year position improves, that will alter what we are doing.  As I have said consistently on all of the front-line service cuts, which we deeply regret, we are constantly examining ways of doing things differently and reducing the impact of those cuts.  If it appears likely that more cash will flow in, that will affect our expectations for our end-of-year Vote position.  Right now, frankly, even with the forms all signed today, given the experience of funds flowing from private insurers, I do not expect it to make a significant difference, particularly in the context of the accelerated cash that is now being finalised, up to &euro;125 million.</p></speech>

The critical difference between the &euro;125 million of accelerated cash and the &euro;74 million is that the latter has a direct impact in terms of both cash flow and cuts.  In the current environment, I suggest that the HSE cuts a deal with the insurance companies to get money up front because of the potential impact of the cuts to front line services with winter upon us.</p><p>  I commend the HSE on the &euro;125 million of accelerated cash, which is an innovative measure.  Circumstances are very difficult and there are enormous pressures on the HSE.  The first task is to get the consultants to sign the forms.  That is now under way, which I welcome.  The deadline is 14 days from 5 November, so 19 November is the critical date.  I call on the consultants to play their part in ensuring the forms are signed so that the impact on front line services can be minimised.  Once those forms are completed, I ask the HSE to engage directly with the insurance companies to secure some form of an accelerated payment which is sufficient to enable the HSE to reduce the impact of the cuts that are now taking place.  </p><p>  I am seeking a commitment from Mr. Tony O'Brien, as the CEO of the HSE.  I am putting my suggestion forward in a spirit of co-operation and in full awareness of the difficulties facing the health service.  As a public representative, however, it would be remiss of me not to raise these issues.  Can I take it from a management viewpoint that the HSE will proceed with first ensuring that the target date of 19 November is met?  In that context, I again call on the consultants to make sure that happens because &euro;74 million is at stake.</p> <p>Some &euro;74 million is at stake.  Once this takes place, will the HSE actively engage with the insurance companies to come up with some formula to ensure that sufficient funds are received in an accelerated fashion before the end of the year?  It would give the HSE leverage to reduce the burden of cuts on the ordinary people whom we represent and to whom the HSE provides a service.</p></speech>

I wish to address the big picture of the value of the allowances within the HSE and tease it out.  According to the figures the HSE has shared with the committee, allowances are worth 2.6% of the total pay bill.  We received equivalent figures from the Irish Prison Service relating to allowances as a percentage of the total wage bill and it provided a figure of 35%.  For the Garda, allowances as a percentage of its total wage bill were 16%.  Of any body that has come before the committee, the allowances in the HSE as a percentage of total pay are the lowest by some way.  Why is that?</p></speech>

Let us consider the nursing allowance.  It emerged from a tribunal with an outcome called the blue book agreement.  A Labour Court recommendation was made as a result of the commission on nursing, and there were three subsequent Labour Court recommendations.  At the time, management would have been dealing with significant pay claims and each recommendation would have been hard fought throughout the industrial relations machinery.  Each would have had a specific reference as well.  Since then, as we have changed and moved to modernise, we have had occasion to go back repeatedly to the Labour Court to argue.</p><p>  In essence, the vast majority of the people involved are on a basic core pay system.  The vast majority of the allowances amounting to 2.61% of the total wage bill are paid to front-line service provision people.  That is the nature of pay within the health system.  People refer to allowances, but the reality is different.  Let us consider the role of a public health nurse on one of our islands.  That person probably gets the ferry over to the island and spends five days there, living in accommodation on the island and making herself available 24 hours per day, seven days per week.  She might have a maternity qualification and perhaps more, and this is to the benefit of all of the islanders.  We pay basic pay and relevant allowances but we are getting a good return on that value in providing health care to that population.</p></speech>

I have provided some figures which I either brought with me or worked out during the session.  The figure for the HSE is 2.6%, while that for the Garda is approximately 16% and that for the Prison Service is 35%.  These are the figures for allowances as a percentage of the total wage bill.  From what we have to date, the HSE is substantially below the others.  The other figures relate to the number of allowances by agency.  We held a discussion about the Garda but the full list from the Garda shows 104 allowances.  The equivalent list from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government shows 63 allowances, while the list from the Department of Defence shows approximately 64 allowances.  Give or take an allowance in either direction, those figures are roughly correct.  However, the HSE has only 41 allowances.</p></speech>

We pay additional premiums for Saturday, Sunday and night duty, and for overtime.  To be honest, I am unsure of the scope of the replies of other Departments and whether they included figures for overtime.  Anyway, we received a specific request to answer questions on allowances and that is the number of allowances we have.</p></speech>

I am keen to illustrate the point.  Let us consider night duty.  The Irish Prison Service has an allowance for night duty, which took the place of the existing overtime payment.  The Garda has an allowance for overtime that evolved from its industrial relations heritage.  The Civil Service has an allowance for officials who are on call.  We went through all of these.  Is there a big question about the HSE definition?  We have experienced this before.  Is the definition of an allowance for the HSE different from the definition of an allowance for other agencies?</p> <p>The Garda includes overtime within the definition of allowances.  </p></speech>

The recommendations talk about the rate of pay for additional hours worked.  The word, "allowance" does not appear anywhere.  They refer, for example, to time and a half for the hours worked between X and Y, and double time after that.  The word "allowance" does not appear anywhere.</p></speech>

I am not doubting the information Mr. O'Brien has given me.

In many others that would be voluntary.  The vast majority of nurses, for example, do not do night duty.  I would be giving the committee wrong information if I spoke about the night duty allowance.  The rate of pay that is attracted, if one is deemed to go on the night duty roster, is time and a quarter.</p></speech>

Some of the categories mentioned by the Deputy have no access to the Labour Court.  They do not have access under statute.

When the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform came before the committee, the Secretary General of the Department said someone had to be available at weekends to make sure the IT systems worked.  He described the payment to such a person as an allowance.  In the HSE that would not be called an allowance.</p></speech>

We pay an on-call allowance for that.  It goes with the territory.  I do not wish to complicate this for the Deputy, but there is on-call, on-call with stand-by and on-call being present on-site.  All of these complications come into it.</p></speech>

However, the allowances percentage of total HSE wages is massively lower than equivalent figures elsewhere.  That got me into working through how the HSE defines an allowance and what are the components of a HSE allowance.  Following the hearings we have had so far, I observe that the HSE has a far narrower definition of what an allowance is than other bodies.  Mr. O'Brien's equivalent in the Prison Service told us that the service needs to have people working at night and they make that happen by paying an allowance.</p></speech>

Anyone who has adjudicated on rates in the health sector, namely the Labour Court, has dealt with the rate of pay and not the rate of an allowance.  That is all I am saying.</p><p>  All of us in the health sector are familiar with what an allowance means in the sector.  That is important, because when one structures a business and staffing levels one builds in the premium cost rate that one knows one is going to incur.</p></speech>

I know that everything Mr. O'Brien is saying is true and makes sense within the health service as he is describing it.  I am just teasing this out because he has a different definition of an allowance from the definition we heard in our other hearings.  If we were to use the same definition of allowances for the HSE as has been used elsewhere the figure would be much higher than 2.6%.</p></speech>

There is, however, agreement between ourselves and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, DPER, that we answered correctly and honestly the questions put to us as to the allowances we pay.  There is an acceptance that we have different methodologies for paying people who work in the health services.</p><p>  It is important to say that people who work night duty, Saturdays and Sundays do so as part of their core contracted hours of work.  There is a real risk of someone attaching the payment of an allowance to part of that.  They are not paid an allowance.  They work their core hours across the span of the working week but they attract a different rate, depending on whether they do night duty or Saturdays or Sundays.</p></speech>

It was only paid for the duration when the registered general nurse in the community was directly replacing a public health nurse.  This happened in 55 instances and it cost the HSE &euro;172,000 in 2011.  With the change in the way we deliver our community services and with new models of care, the registered general nurse will become much more common in the community.  On that basis we do not propose to pay the allowance to any new registered general nurse who is carrying out public health nursing duties in the community.</p></speech>

The first item is the historic rest days.  We previously advised the committee that we had an exposure for &euro;104 million for a group of 450 consultants from now until 2027.  We sought to reduce that by 50% and that the leave would be availed of by 2018.  The court has made a recommendation that it will be reduced by 25%, which will give us a saving of &euro;26 million and that it must be taken in full by 2020.  There will be a significant saving to the taxpayer on what was our liability prior to the Labour Court recommendation.</p><p>  On the other two matters, the first matter was to do with the current rest day arrangements, whereby consultants working on a rota system of one in one, one in two, one in three and one in four, had certain rest day entitlements as well as being in receipt of their B factor, which is for a liability to be on call and a C factor, which is payment for being called in.  The Labour Court recommended that the B and C factors should continue and that in future they will only get rest where they actually attend out of hours.  They will be given compensatory rest consistent with the Working Time Act.  In other words, if a consultant has cause to come in at 1 a.m. and work until 2 a.m., then the employer has a liability to give one hour's compensatory rest for that hour.  Up to now, those consultants in a one in three arrangement were given 26 days additional leave per year for that liability and those in a one in four arrangement were given 13 additional days.  Therefore, as and from last Tuesday, the HSE has advised all the hospitals that the rest for those in a one in three and a one in four no longer pertains.  The IMO is balloting currently on the entire range of packages and this will be completed by 21 November.  We have invited the IMO to engage immediately on giving effect to the two binding Labour Court recommendations.  I have invited the IHCA to engage immediately on the Labour Court recommendations.  The IHCA decided not to attend the Labour Court.  The IHCA views its participation in the public service agreement as being based on collaboration rather than on a collective agreement.  We view them as being fully encompassed by the Croke Park agreement and therefore it is our view that we have a collective agreement.  Our submissions to the Labour Court were based on the view that any outcome of the court would be applied to all consultants employed in the public health system.  That is the advice I will be giving to all the health sector managers, that the binding recommendations apply to all consultants equally.</p></speech>

The public service agreement is a two-way process.  There are challenges for managers to give effect to its operation as much as for employees.  Significant change has been delivered across the health system.  We have reduced staff by 10,000 since 2009.  There are more consultants employed in the public system than ever before, with currently 2,580 consultants.  We have never had such a high number of junior doctors employed.  The number of medical staff employed in the public health system has never been higher.  I fully expect all consultants to engage with and to accept the proposals and to work proactively with us.</p> <p>The real issue for the HSE will be to ensure that it reports appropriately to the Government if it meets resistance and if it is not receiving full co-operation from the consultant body in question.</p></speech>

The general picture emerging from these proceedings is that there are approximately 67,000 direct HSE staff, of whom 41,000 - in the region of two thirds - are in receipt of allowances.  Our guests indicated that there are of the order of 36,000 people operating in the voluntary sector.  One could assume, therefore, that approximately 24,000 of the latter are in receipt of some of allowance.  Are our guests aware of any new allowances in the voluntary sector that are separate from those which they have been examining?  Obviously, the voluntary sector is a different animal and different traditions have grown up within it.  Those in the sector must engage in a variety of different practices.  I accept that our guests have not reached a conclusion in respect of this matter.</p><p>  I understand from where Deputy Donohoe was coming in respect of the questions he posed.  We are trying to examine the position with regard to allowances across the public service and we have obtained some inconsistent definitions in this regard.  I appreciate that the definition provided by our guests relates to allowances of &euro;166 million, weekend payments of &euro;190 million, overtime payments of &euro;177 million, night payments of &euro;73 million and on-call payments of &euro;65 million.  This amounts to &euro;661 million in overall allowances which are directly relates to the HSE.  One would assume half that amount again is paid in allowances in the voluntary sector.  The overall figure for allowances in the health sector is, therefore, approximately &euro;1 billion.  If we were to use the definitions employed by the other organisations and Departments which came before us in respect of allowances and apply them to the health sector, then an amount substantially in excess of &euro;2 billion would be under examination.  The conclusion to which we are coming is that many allowances are essentially core pay elements.  In other words, they are payments in respect of hours worked.  We are of the view that some Departments, etc., are employing something of a misnomer in the context of allowances.  It is difficult to separate the definitions.  Our guests will understand, therefore, that the committee is obtaining different views from across public service.</p><p>  Are there many allowances payable in the voluntary sector which would not be considered normal if they came within the ambit of the HSE?

We operate our funding arrangement with the voluntary sector on a service level agreement basis.  Every HR circular I write is made available to all of the voluntary agencies, which are funded through our regional director of operations system.  These agencies are also fully encompassed by our employment control ceiling and are subject to the same restrictions in the context of the appointment of additional personnel, living within the control ceiling to which I refer and adhering to the payscales that apply.</p></speech>

Perhaps the terminology used by those who outlined the position on the latter allowances was different.</p></speech>

How many of these allowances are identified on individual employees' payslips?  Mr. Barry O'Brien referred to the eight HSE payroll systems.  I was going to mention the situation relating to PPARS, which was at the different stages of integration in different parts of the health sector.  That integration process was halted at a particular point when a controversy arose.  The system was fully rolled out in some areas while it was only partially rolled out in respect of some functions in other areas.  How many of the 67,000 direct staff of the HSE are on the PPARS system?  I take it the latter is the largest of the eight systems to which Mr. Barry O'Brien referred?  What is the breakdown with regard to the number of staff on each of these payroll systems.  Do each of the organisations in the voluntary sector have separate payroll systems?  Are myriad payroll systems in operation in that sector?  How is the information to which I refer captured?</p></speech>

It is stated in the documentation provided that there are 600 grades of staff across the HSE.  One of the controversies which originally arose in respect of PPARS is that in the areas of the country where it was introduced, there were of the order of 2,700 pay rate variations at local level.  People in one location were being paid while attending mass on holy days, while those in other locations were being paid for split shifts on certain days.  Payments were also issuing in respect of double shifts.  Mr. Barry O'Brien will know from where I am coming in this regard.</p></speech>

I am also saying to the committee that everyone in the health service is paid according to the Department of Health's consolidated salary scales.  The latter set clear salaries and they also set the rates.  Thus, an operator in the voluntary sector cannot pay a higher rate for overtime or in respect of Saturday or Sunday work.  The rates are absolutely set.</p></speech>

They believe the latter are paid rates of subsistence because they are working away from their base or whatever.  Even though they would not necessarily be the subject of tax, such rates of subsistence must be listed on their payslips.</p> <p>How many of the staff of the executive would have received a travel or subsistence allowance?  Of the 67,000 staff, would 6,000, 26,000 or 46,000 have received such an allowance?  Does Mr. Barry O'Brien have that information?  I would consider payments in respect of travel and subsistence an allowance and I do not see any mention of that in the documentation.  I suspect it is a considerable cost.  There is no argument about the payment of it to staff who travel for work purposes and are entitled to the allowance but I would want to get a read on this.  Where is that set out in the executive's system?  That information is not here.  Why was it not included in the documentation or did the definition to be covered given to the witnesses not include travel and subsistence allowances?</p></speech>

We can make available to the committee any information it would like on that matter.  We do not have the detail on that with us today but the vast majority of our staff are not in receipt of any sort of a travel or subsistence allowance.  However, a number of front-line service staff in certain very remote areas  would be in receipt of such an allowance.  For example, 60% or 65% of public health nurses, having regard to the area they cover in a working day, could be in receipt of a subsistence allowance for being more than five hours away from base.  The rules are clearly set by Government and that is what we apply.  In the past three years we have significantly reduced our overall spend on travel and substance.</p></speech>

In other words, if a paramedic is away from base for X number of hours or if a doctor has sessional hours in more than one hospital and is away from his or her base, would they both get the same rate?

In the case of the other allowance, there may be a slight variable and a cut-off point is arbitrarily set such that if one was earning more than one got for that subsistence and if one was earning below that, one got that amount.  The same qualifying criteria applied, namely, that if one is away from one's nominated base for more than five or ten hours or overnight, that is the reason one would qualify.</p></speech>

We talked about travel undertaken by staff and a travel allowance is a visible allowance members of the public can identify as being paid to a person for travel undertaken in the course of his or her work.  Home care assistants, community nurses, social workers and others are on the road every hour of the day and there is no argument about their being paid an allowance for that.  Do many staff in the HSE have company cars?  I am not talking about paramedics but about the use of official vehicles that may be required to bring home staff of certain grades.  Is there much of that?  I have a sense that some people have cars and they are free to take them home or may be required to have them in the event of emergency call-outs.  I am not talking about Mid-Doc or the out-of-hours doctor service .  Does that arise much?  What criteria are involved in respect of a person deemed to undertake a considerable amount of travel and thereby be allocated a car?  There must be some criteria in the system on that.</p></speech>

In certain grades ambulance managers have made themselves available, because of the integrated methodology of 999 calls, to respond, irrespective of the location they are in when off duty, to a 999 call.  From the point of view of transporting people to and from work, we do not provide any such transport.</p></speech>

Surely an ambulance manager would only come out in the event of major incident and not routine cases in terms of accidents, or do they come out to every accident?</p></speech>

There different types of vehicles.  If one was to bring in every ambulance manager with a base covering Kilkenny or Cork who the following morning was going visit the Dingle Peninsula or the west Cork, one would be scratching one's head thinking about the efficiency of this if first one had to get the person to come into Cork to collect his car and if he came from Clonakilty one might then have to then tell him to turn around and go to Castletownbere.  That system is effective not only in terms of the travel and subsistence allowance rate but it represents effective use of a fleet resource.</p></speech>

If I raise a matter that has already been covered they might let me know.  I apologise for not being able to be here earlier but I followed the proceedings as best I could from the monitor in my office.  A good deal has been dealt with but I want to return to a matter Deputy Donohoe raised relating to the process with which we are dealing and concluding today.  The information we have received from different Departments has been very interesting form the point of view of learning how differently each Department does its work.  In the case of the Department of Health and the HSE, we note the huge amount of work it took to compile this information, to get eyes on the situation in regard to the Government spend on allowances paid in this Department and sector, and that work is not yet finished or as complete as we would like it to be.  I would like to deal with the process that brought us here today and the information we have in front of us.  When did the work began to compile this information in the Department?</p></speech>

We had to give effect to that and respond to it.  The information the Deputy has was first submitted in February of this year to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and it is on that basis that we are before the committee today in regard to what we submitted at that time.</p></speech>

The information was submitted on 14 February.  Deputy Donohoe spoke about the fact that the situation appeared to be different with health in terms of the sessional or on-call allowances.

Why make that agreement?  Why would one decide to treat the allowances differently?  We all accept that the payment of such allowances would for the most part be considered core pay and would be treated differently anyway at the outcome of the review of allowances.  According to the statement, the Department of Health consolidated pay scales classify sessional payments and on-call payments as allowances.  Therefore, why make the decision with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform?</p></speech>

Everyone in the health family was clear on what was deemed an allowance by those of us who were engaged in the process of both negotiating the awarding of them and those in receipt of them.  I accept the ICTU was before the committee last week but if one were to ask someone from a health background what they deem to be an allowance they would have said there is a separate rate for overtime, Sundays and bank holidays.  All I am saying is that is the language of the health sector, which in 2007 had 110,000 employees.  Everybody in the sector would say there is a rate for it and we are probably exceptional in the sense that the reason my file is so big is that it is full of Labour Court recommendations.  In the history of industrial relations in the health sector management has contested the concession of any claims to anybody.  The vast majority of the allowances are on the back of Labour Court recommendations.  Ultimately, for us, the Labour Court is the court of last resort in the IR arena.  I do not even have the liberty to suggest to the committee that such a payment should be an allowance.  Immediately, the union side would say that I could not call it an allowance.  It is clearly written in the Labour Court recommendations that &ldquo;the rate to be attracted for this shall be&rdquo;.</p></speech>

Towards the end of last year when the Government initiated the work around the review of allowances a series of decisions was taken.  One was that a certain percentage of expenditure on allowances was to be achieved in the current year and parallel with that there was also a requirement to save an amount on overtime expenditure.  That was carried through, for example, in the HSE&rsquo;s national service plan.  The requirements were reflected in what was said there.  Even at that point a distinction was being made at Government level between what were allowances and what was overtime.  As the Deputy said, there may be a blurring of the issue and different definitions in play but that was our read from that point of view that overtime was something different.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-08a.392" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1034" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012110800017#Q01200"><p>It is interesting not so much from the viewpoint of the Department of Health but that other Departments did not take a similar approach when compiling information for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  They did not try to make such an arrangement themselves and say that they would treat some allowances separately.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-08a.393" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Brazel" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012110800017#Q01300"><p>Perhaps I could add to the point.  Reference was made to the complexity of the review within the health service.  When the review was undertaken there was quite a bit of consideration between the Departments as to how best to approach the review, to meet the deadlines and the priority to be identified in order to meet the requirements of the review being undertaken.  There was a fair exchange between us.  As my colleagues have pointed out, many of the rates were what we would call standard on-call rates.  We were trying to identify the allowances that were in play in the health service, but they were not well defined.  That is where the priority rested.  The HSE gave an undertaking to provide details on the amount of on-call payments, if possible by grade and staff.  That will add to the body of information available.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-08a.394" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1034" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012110800017#Q01400"><p>We got the information from other Departments when they came before the committee and it was helpful to see them and to compare how they stacked up in terms of core pay and the percentage paid in allowances.  When one can add allowances to core pay one gets a better understanding of what the allowance was in terms of what the person in receipt of it was getting elsewhere in terms of pay.  It puts the situation in context.</p></speech>

There was much concentration, in particular in the early stages with a narrow window of compliance, to concentrate on what was seen as priority areas in order to get the information assembled and collated.</p></speech>

We are providing information on the total moneys we set out in the &euro;166 million.  That is from the health Vote.  The figure is inclusive, but one needs to further break it down.  We gave the specifics on each allowances incurred in the HSE and the voluntary sector is currently engaged with that with our finance people.

There is one allowance that only two people in the entire health system have red circled to them.

There is a specific statutory instrument that affords to those working in the Gaeltacht the capacity to receive a percentage of base pay for working there.  While it is called the travel allowance for non-nursing personnel, it is a cross-sectoral allowance that applies in the local authorities and other bodies.  Obviously, a co-ordinated approach would be taken in that regard.  We have already clarified that the cardiac allowance, the weekly allowance, is superannuable and is subject to a Labour Court recommendation that states clearly it is part of core pay.  Therefore, we will be clarifying the matter.  The second-opinion provision is the one that was part of the Labour Court recommendation.  The consultants' continuing-medical-education allowance is being dealt with as part of the LRC discussions.  There is a view that it ought to become centralised and more effectively managed.  There is a statutory obligation on all consultants to maintain their competence for the Medical Council.  There is a proposal in this regard.  That is how that is being dealt with.</p></speech>

As I have already said, nine of those are long-standing and a number are statutory.  The scope is quite limited in the area of health.  I emphasise to the committee that the vast majority of allowances paid in the health sector have emanated from fairly protracted industrial relations procedures, in the vast majority of cases culminating in a definitive Labour Court recommendation.  Obviously, that in itself would present a new challenge if somebody were to say such an allowance is to be abolished.</p></speech>

As I said, the health sector has access to the Labour Relations Commission's rights commissioner service and the Labour Court.  A number of other Civil Service and public service facilities do not.  All I am saying is that, in the health family, there is a strong history of challenging every claim for any additional allowance or pay award.  In the example concerning nurses, there was a protracted dispute from 1993 until 1999, which was nearly eight years.  What occurred in that period was a clear indication of where many of these allowances have their origins.</p></speech>

Consider the circumstances that would obtain if we closed the facility, resulting in people no longer having access to premia.  If in their new work location the loss were continuous for a period of 12 months, they would then avail of a mechanism whereby they would get a payment in two instalments, one after six months and one after 12 months.  That is a standard compensatory element.  The process has not actually set any parameters so we will be guided by what emerges from the overall review of allowances and whether any compensatory issue will arise.</p></speech>

There could be a process of buying out the allowances at 1.5 times the cost.  One would make a saving in the longer term, of course, but there would be an initial upfront payment to abolish the allowances.  Is that the approach?</p></speech>

Our approach is not to pre-empt in any way what decision may be made resulting from the cross-sectoral governmental review of all allowances.  With regard to whether any compensatory element will arise, we are saying we will be guided by and take instruction from the relevant sources and respond appropriately.</p></speech>

Has the HSE costed the worst-case scenario of buying out allowances at a cost 1.5 times their value?  I am trying to figure out what the maximum cost might be and what it could be if there were no compensation.</p></speech>

For example, we carried out a major and fairly radical overhaul of our laboratory services, in respect of which the compensatory element amounts to slightly over &euro;12 million.  We radically changed the on-call service, the call-out service and extended the working day to 8 p.m.  As I stated, the long-term savings for the health service are quite significant.  The rules are as outlined.</p></speech>

There are no surprises.  A manager must be able to say a certain amount of money must accrue if he is to meet his liabilities.  They would have been making savings.

If in the first 18 months one's budget remained consistent, there would be no actual saving.  While the savings would be accumulating, one would have to set aside the compensatory element.  As the Deputy will be aware, hospital budgets continue to reduce.  Therefore, the real challenge involves the fact that one has to find the money somewhere.  That is what I meant by the public service agreement being a two-way process.  We get change but there are certain issues to which we must have regard.</p></speech>

Even if they are coming from different systems, one should not need to wait for so long before the type of reports for which the HSE has asked them became available.  It should be made clear to each and every such body that this would be the committee's expectation.  It also would assist the HSE, were such bodies to know the executive is expected to account for the expenditure in that area and hence its different relationship with them.  I note this issue is a cause of concern for some Members of the Oireachtas because today, the committee received a letter from Senator Fidelma Healy Eames on recent reports of the level of pay in the voluntary sector, particularly in one area, which members must revisit and on which they will be seeking information from the HSE.  Perhaps the witnesses might take note that they might provide the committee with their views in this regard.  I do not expect them to give them now but they might provide us with their views or details on the actions taken regarding the pay levels that have been reported, as well as the allowances, expenses or however one might wish to term them, that might be accompanying the aforementioned pay levels.</p></speech>

There is a general thrust that has some validity and I wish to propose a compromise that members might consider favourably.</p><p>  The operation of the Animal Health and Welfare Bill will provide a central role for the veterinary profession.  The Bill consolidates a wide variety of legislation.  Establishing different classes and hierarchies of authorised officers and inspectors with different powers and different responsibilities runs counter to the aim of reducing bureaucracy.  Authorised officers under the Animal Health and Welfare Bill have a wide range of functions and different classes of duties may be assigned to different officers by management.  This will be done as appropriate depending on the task in question and is best dealt with on an administrative basis rather than creating rigid legal structures.  Resources are finite and in some instances it may be more appropriate to use an officer other than a vet.</p><p>  Under section 23 the Bill does envisage a situation where an authorised officer may put down a badly injured animal where a vet is not available.  A number of points should be made in that regard.  It reflects the existing legal situation where an authorised officer can kill if he or she comes across an animal and it is appropriate to put it down.  The Veterinary Practices Act allows a non-vet to kill an animal.  The previous subsection will apply and specifies that anyone killing must be competent to do so, that is, someone from a knackery yard, for example.  A number of members insisted that to save farmers costs knackery personnel should be allowed to kill an animal.  Therefore it is inconsistent to deprive an authorised officer of the same power.  The provisions of section 23 reflect the current law where a fatally injured animal may be put down.  Similarly, the Veterinary Practices Act allows a non-vet to kill an animal in an emergency situation.  Furthermore, veterinary expertise is not required to kill an animal but competence is.  A variety of persons are permitted to kill animals, for example slaughterhouse operatives and knackery staff.  However, section 23(1) of the Animal Health and Welfare Bill will apply, requiring that anyone who kills an animal be competent to do so.</p><p>  In any event, the concerns expressed relate to an unusual case.  A significant number of authorised officers who are Department staff are qualified vets and those who are not will, in the normal course of events and where it can quickly be done, seek veterinary advice.  They are unlikely to use this power lightly because they must satisfy themselves, and potentially the courts, that the animal falls under one of the headings 23(2)<i>(a</i>) to <i>(d</i>).  However, it may need to be used urgently such that veterinary advice cannot be reached, for example in dealing with rabid animals.  The allowance to perform this act is currently and will remain available to persons without veterinary training.  Therefore, it would be an oversight not to allow an authorised officer to do so.</p><p>  Deputy McNamara outlined a specific concern which I will deal with in due course.  What Deputies are trying to do is to create a separate category for vets and for other authorised officers, including inspectors.  I understand the reason.  I presume they want to do that because there is a concern that the two people who can appoint authorised officers, namely, a county manager or a Minister, may appoint people who do not have the appropriate qualifications to carry out inspections on farms or in other places where there may be animals.  Given the concern that has been expressed by veterinary practitioners, farming organisations and members, I suggest that Deputies might consider that we would do two things to improve the Bill in terms of the appointment of authorised officers.  Currently, county managers can only appoint authorised officers from within their local authority.  A county manager cannot, for example, go to an animal welfare organisation with the intention of appointing an authorised officer from the organisation.  That is not allowed in the legislation, although a Minister could do that.  There are instances where we should consider doing that.  We will talk about them later.  If a county manager is to appoint a new authorised officer that is not a veterinary practitioner he or she must seek approval from the Minister to do so.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine must sanction the appointment of an authorised officer that is not a vet in order that we would try to get over the concern that county managers may, for whatever reason, appoint someone that is not suitable for reasons of their level of knowledge to carry out inspections.</p><p>  The second point we must address in the legislation in order to put an onus on the Minister to ensure that the right type of person is appointed as an authorised officer is to insert a provision on Report Stage, if members consider it a good idea, to the effect that a Minister must have regard to the expertise and qualification of the person before he or she is appointed as an authorised officer.  The notion that every authorised officer must be a vet does not make sense when one looks at the practicalities of the current situation.  For example, many of the agricultural inspectors in the Department are not qualified vets but they are people who have been trained in agricultural colleges and who carry out many other inspections on farms in terms of control and compliance.  They understand farming very well.  It makes sense for those people to also be authorised officers in respect of this legislation.  If they have a serious animal welfare concern they can call a vet to come and deal with the matter should a complication arise.  The notion that all inspections by authorised officers would have to be undertaken by vets would have a huge resource implication.  For example, if we had an outbreak of foot and mouth disease or any other disease that requires me to authorise a large number of authorised officers to respond to it in a comprehensive way, we would not be able to solely rely on vets for such a service.  In addition, there is a limited role outside of farming for a Minister to consider authorising someone who clearly has qualifications and experience and who may have been working with an animal welfare organisation to act as an authorised officer, for the keeping of domestic animals, for example.</p> <p>We should be using the pool of resources that is already there to try to add to the existing pool of authorised officers that I have at my disposal.  However, there is a distinction to be made when it comes to agriculture because a different level of knowledge is required, in terms of understanding farm practices and so forth.  As I said in the Seanad and on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il, it is my intention to ensure that there is no change in terms of the types of inspectors who are going on to farms at the moment.  However, we must insert that into the legislation.  Deputy McNamara raised this issue with me yesterday and there must be some recognition in the legislation and in the wording so that a Minister at any stage in the future will be obliged to have regard for experience and qualification when appointing authorised officers.  That may not go far enough for some Deputies in terms of the concerns they have tried to address with these amendments but I am trying to capture the spirit of them by inserting an extra level of checking on county managers if they propose that people other than vets are appointed as authorised officers.  Such a proposal would have to be given departmental or ministerial approval.  Furthermore, when a Minister or a county manager is appointing an authorised officer he or she must have regard to experience and qualifications.  I would like feedback from Deputies as to whether they regard this as helpful.</p></speech>

One of my concerns is that authorised officers could be allowed to carry out tasks currently carried out by veterinary officers or by personnel with veterinary qualifications.  In the current budgetary climate, that might seem attractive to the Department in terms of changing the roles and functions.  The proposal just outlined by the Minister could be an acceptable solution but it appears to me that section 37 already provides those powers to the Minister <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> authorised officers.  Amendment No. 1, which seeks to add veterinary practitioners to the definition of authorised officers, would not really have any negative impact on what the Minister has referred to but would give recognition to the fact that veterinary officers are people who can be considered authorised officers as well as veterinary officers.</p></speech>

What happens outside this House is of no relevance at committee.  A case is being put forward by the movers of the amendments and what the Minister thinks we think is of no relevance.  The way Committee Stage always worked when I was a Minister was that the movers of an amendment made a case for that amendment, explained why they proposed the amendment and then, when the Minister knew the reasoning behind the amendment, he or she replied to the case made by the Deputy.  Let us now deal with the actual amendments, as put forward.</p><p>  Amendment No 1 seeks to insert into the Bill a clear distinction between an inspector of the Minister and an authorised officer.  The purpose of that is to clarify that there are certain functions that can be carried out by an authorised officer who need not be a vet but that there are other, specified functions where veterinary expertise is needed.  I will draw the analogy of a hospital, where nurses are highly trained but where it is recognised that doctors have particular functions that only they can carry out.  In proposing this amendment, I believe that there are certain functions that should be reserved for veterinary officers or people acting on veterinary advice and that there are other functions that an authorised officer can carry out without veterinary advice or without a person with a qualification in veterinary medicine being involved in the function.  To allow that differentiation throughout the Act, amendment No. 4 must be accepted.  We must have a definition of an inspector as being a person with veterinary qualifications.  Otherwise it is not possible to follow through in the Act on the rest of its provisions.  </p><p>  We then move to amendments Nos. 40 to 45, inclusive, of which my amendment is No. 41.  The question that arises in amendment No 41, which deals with page 23, subsection (2) is very simple.  The Bill at present states:<blockquote>(2) If an authorised officer, a veterinary practitioner acting as such or a person specified in animal health and welfare regulations<br />is of the opinion that--(<i>a</i>) an animal is fatally injured,<br />(<i>b</i>) an animal is so severely injured or diseased or in such pain or distress that, for the alleviation of its suffering, it<br />should be killed,<br />(<i>c</i>) to prevent further suffering to an animal, it is necessary or expedient, or<br />(<i>d</i>) an animal is a danger to life or property,he or she may, without having to seek the consent of its owner or the person in control of it, kill the animal or cause the animal to be killed or destroyed in such manner as to inflict as little suffering as possible in the circumstances and may destroy or dispose of the carcass or cause the destruction or disposal of the carcass.</blockquote>  The issue here is not the killing of the animal, because there are many people who have the skills to carry out that function.  The issue is who is to decide that the animal is so fatally injured that it has to be killed.  The issue is not the killing itself but the decision on the killing.  I have no problem with a person from a knackery yard doing the actual killing.  The thrust of the proposed amendment is very simple, namely, that if an authorised officer is making such a decision and does not have veterinary skills, he or she should consult with a veterinary officer.  There are many ways, in the modern world, of consulting with a veterinary officer, lest the Minister respond that the officer might not have a vet to hand.  There are gadgets known as mobile phones and a lot of consultation, even from vet to vet, is done on mobile phones.  One veterinary practitioner, for example, rings another, describes symptoms and asks for the other's opinion.  Obviously, it is not an on-the-ground opinion as the vet has not seen the animal but he or she can give advice.  Advice can be given without the need to be physically present and the amendment would ensure that the decision to put down an animal was made with the involvement of someone with the requisite veterinary skills.  It has nothing to do with the act of putting the animal down.  The amendment is worthy of consideration.</p><p>  Amendments Nos. 69, 70, 72, 74 and 75, which are also in the group of amendments we are discussing, are more or less in the same vein.  What is being proposed in amendment No. 69 is reasonable.  The amendment reads as follows: </p><p>  In page 34, subsection (3), lines 29 to 32, to delete all words from and including &#8220;appoint&#8221; in line 29 down to     and including &#8220;agreement.&#8221; in line 32 and substitute the following:<br />&#8220;submit the names of persons he or she considers appropriately qualified to be authorised officers for the purpose of all or any of the functions that the person may exercise under the service agreement to the Minister who may appoint in writing any or all such person to be authorised officers&#8221;.</p> <p>That is a reasonable amendment.</p><p> Section 37(3) states: &quot;A person with whom the Minister enters into a service agreement under <i>section 74 </i>may for the purposes of enforcing this Act, appoint in writing, with the consent of the Minister, such persons as he or she considers appropriate to be authorised officers for the purpose of all or any of the functions that the person may exercise under the service agreement&quot;.  Amendment No. 69 seeks to insert the words &quot;submit the names of persons he or she considers appropriately qualified to be authorised officers for the purpose of all or any of the functions that the person may exercise under the service agreement to the Minister who may appoint in writing any or all such person to be authorised officers.&quot;  It is a minor amendment.</p><p> In amendment No. 70 we are saying the people appointed as authorised officers should have the experience, technical competence and other qualifications required to undertake the functions of an authorised officer.  One could say that goes without saying, but there is a significant concern that persons without these qualifications might be appointed as authorised officers.  Section 38(4) states:<blockquote>Where an authorised officer has reasonable grounds for believing that--(<i>a</i>) there is a risk of disease,<br />(<i>b</i>) a disease or disease agent is or may be present on any land or premises...</blockquote>That brings us back to the basic premise.  Will people without veterinary skills decide these two grounds?  We are not arguing about paragraphs (<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>) which refer to where an offence is being or has been committed under the Bill, but we are asking how someone who is non-qualified can decide there is a risk of disease.  The Bill states a disease or a disease agent may be present on any land or premises.  Surely one would need veterinary advice to decide if that was the case.  The proposal is that these subsections should be subject to the obtaining of expert advice.</p><p> Similarly, in subsection (1), on page 39, line 13, we are saying there is a need to obtain veterinary advice.  Section 42(1) states: <blockquote>Where an authorised officer is of the opinion that--(<i>a</i>) a contravention of this Act, an EU measure or animal 35 health and welfare regulations may have taken place or may be taking place,</blockquote>It appears there is a reasonable case to be made to try to ensure that, under paragraphs (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>), (<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>), the person concerned has technical knowledge or will obtain the advice of people with particular expertise.</p></speech>

That would be a huge waste of money.  The great majority of farmyard visits could be carried out by a non-veterinarian, but some training in animal husbandry or veterinary practice is required before a person can order the destruction of an animal.  Some of our colleagues will discuss the rights of animals, but aside from that, in some instances, they can be a very valuable and essential piece of property, for example, a pedigree cow or bull, on which a farmer's entire breeding system is based, or a racehorse.  If a person with no training was able to go onto a farm and order the destruction of a farmyard animal against the wishes of the farmer, I would be very concerned.  I declare a conflict of interest, as I am a farmer.  I have also received some legal training and would have grave reservations about the ability of somebody with no animal husbandry or veterinary training to come onto my farm and order me to destroy an animal.  I accept that he or she could honestly believe that that animal requires to be destroyed, but if a farmer believes otherwise, a degree of training or veterinary experience is required before a person could order the destruction of an animal.  I, therefore, urge the Minister to consider how these property rights could be protected.  I acknowledge such rights give way to the common good.  However, I am not arguing that a farmer's property rights in terms of his or her farmyard animals should trump everything else, but they should be considered.</p></speech>

In amendment No. 69 I give the wrong reference.  It is section 37(3) which states: "A person with whom the Minister enters into a service agreement under section 74 may for the purposes of enforcing this Act, appoint in writing, with the consent of the Minister, such persons as he or she considers appropriate to be authorised officers for the purpose of all or any of the functions that the person may exercise under the service agreement."  It is totally at the Minister's discretion whether the person has such competencies.  The amendment seeks to insert the words "submit the names of persons he or she considers appropriately qualified to be authorised officers for the purpose of all or any of the functions that the person may exercise under the service agreement to the Minister who may appoint in writing any or all such person to be authorised officers."  The Minister should do the appointing.</p></speech>

That was the approach in the Seanad, where I took on board amendments, and I intend to take on board amendments on Committee Stage where appropriate.  I have no problem with spending as long as it takes to go through the Bill, section by section, and listening to what Members have to say.  In an effort to be helpful I will say that I do not think I was, in my opening statement, proposing compromises without listening to what Deputies had to say.</p><p>  On the issue of a separate definition of what vets do versus what authorised officers do, clearly there is a different function for vets in a whole range of ways in terms of veterinary legislation and so on.  In regard to much of the work that needs to be done either by vets, as authorised officers, or other authorised officers who are not vets but who will have to call in vets to carry out detailed work because they are not qualified to do it, a clear distinction will be made.  We are trying to decide who will be given the limited powers of authorised officers in respect of inspections and the issuing of welfare notices, which is similar to handing a yellow card to a person.  It means that one is making a welfare mistake in terms of the animals for which one is responsible. One can accept a fine and a welfare notice to change that practice and avoid going to court or, if one is concerned that one is being treated unfairly, one can still go to court and not pay the appropriate fine.  The concern of some farming organisations is that non-veterinary personnel will go onto a farm and fine a farmer without the same level of evidence or proof that would be required in court.  The whole point is that we are trying to keep people out of court, where appropriate, for relatively minor welfare offences that can be corrected quickly.  This is a warning system that does not have the same burden of proof as a court.  That is a good thing for farmers and for other people who keep animals.  If a farm inspector takes a case, he or she must go to court in respect of imposing fines and so on.  I would like to keep people out of court as much as possible and have a practical discussion about welfare notices.  In the event of a complex case there will be a need for a fully qualified vet, because a person who is not a qualified vet would have to rely on the knowledge of a vet to make a complex welfare notice.  I am not suggesting that vets are not in a separate category to other authorised officers; clearly, they are, in respect of their qualifications.  If we want to outline in law the difference between the powers of authorised officers, be they vets or otherwise, we are getting into more complex requirements to respond to a case.  If a person reports a serious welfare case to the Department I would rather be able to send out an authorised officer, whether a vet or a non-vet, to investigate the matter.  If it is a complex case a vet would be called in to do that work.  We want to have the flexibility to use authorised officers in a way that is as efficient as possible.</p><p>  This is not a cost-saving measure.  Vets may be concerned that under the legislation a number of vets who are authorised officers will be replaced by cheaper substitutes.  That is not the intention.  My preference is that as many authorised officers as possible will be veterinary practitioners.  There are a large number of agricultural inspectors in the Department, who are inspecting in any event.  Large numbers of people will have to be found to respond to welfare calls, such as domestic pet cases.  I would like to see veterinary nurses involved.  If someone has to knock on a person's door, say there is a report that a dog has been screeching in pain for the past two or three nights and ask for an explanation of what is going on, the credibility of a veterinary nurse is sufficient.  If the case is complex, the veterinary nurse will call in a qualified vet to examine the issue.  The idea that we could not have authorised officers who are not fully qualified vets limits our options in respect of these choices.  </p><p>  There is a distinction in the Bill between farm animals and other animals because, in dealing with compensation cases, farm animals are part of a commercial operation.  </p><p>  I am seeking the flexibility for a Minister to appoint appropriate people as authorised officers.  What I said before Deputies had an opportunity to make the case for their individual amendments was that I am open to improving the wording to reassure people that in appointing a person as a veterinary officer we would have to have regard to the level of experience and qualifications.  That is not unreasonable.</p><p>  I want to deal with the issue of cost savings.  This legislation has been in preparation for a number of years.  To the credit of the previous Government, it happened under its watch initially.  We have tried to improve it.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked who decides when an animal should be put down or destroyed.  Essentially, there are two issues.  We need to ensure that anybody who is putting an animal down because it is in pain as a result of an accident knows what he or she is doing.  We do not want an amateur trying to put a large animal down and causing much more distress for the animal and for everybody present.  That is totally unacceptable.  There may be instances in which an animal is injured - it may have broken a leg in a slatted shed or fallen through a transportation box - and it is difficult to get a vet on site quickly, but there are experienced personnel present, perhaps the farmer or a person from a knackery yard or slaughterhouse.  There can be extreme animal welfare cases in which an animal needs to be put down quickly for its own good.  We need to ensure that a competent person can do that.  Obviously, we would like that person to be a vet, but it is not always possible to get a vet there quickly.  It does not have to be a farmer; it could be anybody else. When an animal is in significant pain and distress an authorised officer can make a judgment call as to whether the animal should be put down, and that can be done by a person who is competent to do so.</p> <p>In the vast majority of circumstances, this will involve input from a veterinary practitioner, either by telephone or on site.  I am trying to provide for authorised officers to make decisions in extreme situations, such as road traffic accidents, if it is not possible to get a vet on the other end of the telephone.  I am talking about circumstances in which there is a matter of minutes to make a decision, and an authorised officer will have the power to make that decision.  If we decide that such a decision can only be made with the input of a vet, there are instances - although they would be rare because, as the Deputy says, one can get a vet on the telephone most of the time - for which we need to ensure flexibility in legislation whereby somebody is not breaking the law if he or she decides that an animal should be put down quickly because of whatever set of circumstances arise, whether animals are being transported, are in the field or anywhere else.  If one cannot get a vet on Christmas Day, Easter Sunday or whenever, an authorised officer can make that decision.  We had this discussion in the Seanad as well.  My view is that an authorised officer should have the power to make that judgment call, although, under the guidelines for authorised officers and in their training, we should make it clear that they should seek the advice of a vet when appropriate.</p><p> On the legal point Deputy McNamara raised, we are looking into property rights.  If a farmer owns a bull worth a couple of hundred thousand euros and it has suffered a fracture, contracted a disease or whatever, there is a valid question over whether we want somebody to come in and make a decision to put that animal down, which would have significant commercial consequences for the farmer.  We must also ensure that animal welfare legislation is consistent.  I have agreed with my officials to take legal advice on the appropriate response from a property rights point of view and inform Deputy McNamara.</p><p> Ultimately, this brings us back to the amendments on which Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v spoke.  He spoke about whether there should be a requirement to get a veterinary opinion before that decision is taken.  In the vast majority of cases, the answer is yes, but in certain extreme cases I certainly would not like to see an animal suffering unnecessarily.  It is a matter of getting that balance right.  I will consider the suggestions.  On amendments Nos. 40 to 42, inclusive, on which Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v spoke, inserting a requirement to obtain veterinary input into that decision introduces a limitation that could result in animals suffering unnecessarily, and that is my concern.</p><p> I think I have answered most of the questions on the amendments.  If members want to reply on any of them, I will happily try to deal with them.</p></speech>

Let us go back over it again.</p><p>  I believe amendments Nos. 1 and 4 are needed because some of the other amendments that hinge on them are necessary.  In other words, we need to differentiate legally between an inspector and an authorised officer.  I still believe there are some functions that should only be carried out by persons with the competent veterinary qualification.</p><p>  I will wait for Report Stage in the case of the amendment on the qualifications of those who become authorised officers.  It is important, and I accept the Minister's good faith in this.  We will table the amendment again on Report Stage, when we look forward to getting an amendment to deal with the basic issue we have raised regarding the qualifications of authorised officers.  I will not press that amendment today and I look forward to the Minister's addressing that valid issue.</p><p>  I do not accept what the Minister stated about the decision as to whether an animal should be put down.  It is amazing, in the situation he cited, that an authorised officer could be found and got on site, yet one could not get a vet even on the telephone.  I can assure the Minister that vets are available on Christmas Day.  I cannot envisage a situation in which a vet could not be contacted by an authorised officer, who, presumably, would have mobile phone numbers for many veterinary surgeons.  I accept, for the purpose of clarity, that it should be made explicit that such consultation or advice could be given by electronic means without the veterinary surgeon being on site.  If the Minister undertakes to consider that issue - I will submit a slightly different amendment on Report Stage - and agrees to provide that there be consultation with a veterinary surgeon but that it may be done by electronic means, by the use of mobile telephones, by e-mail or whatever, and that there need not necessarily be an on-site inspection, I will accept that.</p><p>  Where the Bill, in section 38, refers to determining whether there is a disease, it states:<blockquote>  (4) Where an authorised officer has reasonable grounds for believing that--(<i>a</i>) there is a risk of disease,<br />(<i>b</i>) a disease or disease agent is or may be present on any land or premises[.]</blockquote>That is a reasonable position, allowing that there are no specific qualifications laid down for authorised officers and that this is a rather specialised job.</p><p>  On the amendments that I have proposed to section 42, the Minister has a point.  I will not press those amendments.</p></speech>

I also acknowledge that sometimes it simply will not be possible to get the advice of a vet.  However, in rural areas in these times it is easier to get a vet out than a doctor.  In the middle of the night or at weekends, when one calls a vet, in my experience, he or she attends.  When one calls a doctor, one is put onto an answering machine.  That is the horrible reality.</p></speech>

There will be instances in which it is not possible to get advice but, as the Minister pointed out, these are rare.  In the great majority of cases, one will be able to get the veterinary advice sought.  I am anxious not to be part of a committee that allows a law to go through under which authorised officers with few qualifications may come onto my farm or that of my neighbour - or, indeed, that of any of the many farmers who sit on this committee - and order the destruction of an animal without the owner's consent in a case in which it is unnecessary.  The Minister would want to preclude that possibility.  It is a small requirement that somebody seek veterinary advice.  If one seeks advice and it is not possible to get it, then a decision must be made on the spot.  Perhaps the Minister would take legal advice on that.</p></speech>

My fear is about what would happen if a cattle truck were involved in a crash and a decision to put down animals had to be made quickly because animals had lost limbs or whatever.  I have seen that happen when I was on a train that ran into a herd of cattle.  The animals must be put down quickly, but one needs also an authorised officer or somebody competent to carry out the job.</p></speech>

The provision does not intend to downgrade the advice of vets - quite the opposite.

They do not have to be an authorised officer.  There is a clear distinction between an authorised officer and a vet, not necessarily in this legislation but in the Veterinary Practice (Amendment) Act, which upgraded the legislation in this area in recent months.  There is a clear distinction between what vets and veterinary nurses can and cannot do in terms of treatments, operations and putting animals down. The legislation is very clear.  The role of vets is and can be distinguished from that of authorised officers.  The only matter that is being dealt with in this legislation is the role of authorised officers and what they can and cannot do.  Many authorised officers are also vets and they will have extra legal power to do all manner of other things.  That is why I do not believe there is a need to make a distinction in this legislation between the roles of an authorised officer who happens to be a vet and one who is not.  The legal determination of the decisions and operations that can be undertaken by a vet, a veterinary nurse or someone in a knackery yard is distinguished in legislation already.  The issue we are discussing is whether we should make a distinction in this legislation between authorised officers who are vets and those who are not and give different powers to them.  I think that would complicate the matter unnecessarily.</p><p>  In practically all the cases that I can envisage where an animal needs to be put down, the Deputies are right that a vet will reach the scene as quickly as someone from a knackery yard.  We must take into account an extreme situation where, for whatever reason, a vet may not be on site.  The compromise, which seems sensible, is that before an animal is put down, one would at least seek the advice of a vet.  If one cannot get it, one must go ahead and make a decision.  That is something to which I would be open.</p></speech>

Where the authorised officer who is inspecting sees something in a herd that suggests there may be a significant disease problem, the legislation enables that officer to act on that.  That is a practical and likely scenario.  If an authorised officer finds evidence of disease in a herd, that is likely to happen when they are looking for something else.  Undoubtedly, in terms of the assessment of that disease, one would need a veterinary practitioner to go to the farm to make an assessment as to what it is, how we should respond to it, how we should support the farmer to deal with it, how we should confine it and so on.  There is a requirement under the veterinary practitioners Acts to do that in terms of stopping the movements of animals and all the other things we have to do when we are trying to deal with a disease outbreak.</p> <p> I shall give another example, namely, an agricultural inspector that does not, lest we forget, have training on farming, farm practices and all of the basics of animal husbandry.  If he or she, during the course of a farm inspection, discusses with the farmer that there is a visible disease outbreak in the herd then he or she should be allowed to act on same as the authorised officer.  In terms of follow-up, there will need to be a proper veterinary assessment made to determine the appropriate response.  The provision is about the practicality of inspections and the interaction between inspectors and farmers which, for the most part, tries to support farmers in what they are doing and to give advice if needed.  I understand what the Deputy is getting at.  </p><p> With regard to the power of an authorised officer to undertake their power as an authorised officer, it states in section 38(4): <blockquote>Where an authorised officer has reasonable grounds for believing that-<br /><i>(a)</i>there is a risk of disease,<br /><i>(b)</i>a disease agent is or may be present on any land or premises. </blockquote>I want them to have the power to go along with that work and that is what we are examining. </p></speech>

All farmers know that if they see something in an animal the first thing they will do is contact their vet.  The idea that one would not put a call through to a veterinary officer, to state that there are significant symptoms and to ask what he or she should do, is farcical.  I am willing to resubmit my amendment on Report Stage and to make it explicit that a consultation does not have to be on site because, as the Minister has said, with mobile telephones and gadgetry it is easy to conduct a preliminary consultation by electronic means and then follow it with a more detailed consultation.  An authorised officer, according to the Act, can come from a wide range of people.  It is outrageous to say that people without veterinary skills can make a decision about a disease.  We live in the 21st century and if mobile telephone numbers have been made available then one can get a vet or veterinary practitioner on the line.

A large element of the legislation is about preventing the spread of disease, which is in everybody's interest, particularly the agricultural sector.  Section 38(4) states:<blockquote><br />Where an authorised officer has reasonable grounds for believing that-  <br />the officer may, in addition to the powers exercisable by him or her under <i>subsection (1)</i>:(i) search the land or premises;<br />(ii) search the vehicle, vessel, aircraft, railway wagon ...<br />(iii) require a person in charge to control the vehicle, vessel ....  <blockquote>(I) refrain from moving it, .<br />(II) give information regarding its place of departure.</blockquote></blockquote>That provision refers to when animals are being transported and if there is evidence.  To be clear, the authorised officers are garda&iacute;, customs officers and people who are appointed either by county managers or the Minister.  </p><p>  The legislation must take account of the customs officers and the animals that are being transported.  If animals are crossing the Border or coming into the country through a port and there is reason to believe that there is a disease risk associated with them, we must give authorised officers the power to stop the movement of the truck, bring in a vet and assess the situation.  The provision is not all about farm inspections.  An issue on a farm is likely to be discovered following another form of inspection.  In many cases the provision caters for animals that are being moved and there is evidence of disease such as scabs on sheep or symptoms that cattle or calves may have.  In such instances the authorised officer must have the power to address the situation and bring in the expertise that is needed because a customs officers is not a vet.</p><p>  I do not want to belittle the other powers that we are giving to authorised officers in section 38(4) which states: <blockquote>(iv) take, without making a payment, samples from an animal, animal product, animal feed, land, water, flora; <br />(v) seize and detain an animal, animal product or animal feed;<br />(vi) detain a vehicle, vessel, aircraft; <br />(vii) remove any equipment or machinery or books, documents or records and detain them for such reasonable period necessary for the purpose of his or her functions under this Act.  </blockquote>The provision tries to give an authorised officer powers.  It means that if they come across a situation that raises a reasonable concern - in terms of disease, a disease outbreak or the potential for a disease spread - they will be able to deal with that situation comprehensively and quickly.  Of course that will involve bringing in a veterinary practitioner to make a judgment in terms of what the disease is and so on.  Perhaps Deputies can suggest how we can improve on that.  Clearly, their amendment  is one suggestion.

"....may only be exercised by an inspector of the Minister" which the Deputies propose to be a vet.  I can understand why the Deputies have tabled the amendment but it would have a knock-on consequence for ports and inspectors who are on a farm when they come across a matter that needs to be addressed.  I do not suggest that a vet will not be involved in putting in place a medium or permanent solution.  Of course a vet will have to be involved to identify the disease and the veterinary Acts will deal with the powers of a vet in those circumstances.  I am trying to deal with the initial powers that an authorised officer will need in order to detain a vehicle or animals because he or she has reasonable grounds to believe that there is a significant disease risk.</p></speech>

The Deputies are proposing to amend the section of the Bill governing performances involving animals.  Clearly, the section in question is not technically the right place in which to provide for a ban on fur farming.  I would like to address the bigger question of whether a series of practices, including hare coursing, badger baiting and fur farming, should be outlawed, but the problem is that we do not have enough time for a substantial debate on the matter in the time remaining in this morning's session.

Unfortunately, we got off to the wrong start.  I said I would deal with the essence of what was sought in amendment No. 26, the outlawing of a series of practices that the Deputies consider unacceptable.  I was going to explain that I did not agree with such an approach and set out my reasons.  For example, I was going to speak about the circumstances in which the snaring of badgers was legal and the circumstances in which it was illegal, with reference to its role in the eradication of TB.  I was going to point out that I hoped to move to a badger vaccination programme, rather than a badger culling programme, in the not too distant future.  I wanted to indicate the reason the badger culling programme had been such a significant factor in the reduction of the incidence of TB in Ireland.</p><p>  In the case of fur farming, about which some people are concerned because they think it is cruel, I wanted to remind the committee that I had asked officials in my Department to compile a report on the issue.  I was going to read some of the recommendations made in the report in order that the Deputies would understand where I was coming from.</p><p>  In the case of hare coursing, I had planned to set out a series of reassurances.  I appreciate that no reassurances are acceptable to the Deputies who think it should be banned.  While they are entitled to their view, the committee is entitled to hear the details of the Government's approach to hare coursing and the other issues raised in the amendments, but we will not have a chance to do all of that now.</p><p>  I have some sympathy for one or two of the amendments on the list.</p> <p>For example, amendment No. 92, in the name of Deputy Pringle, concerns the requirement for the gathering and collection of data and making data available to the public.  He is seeking to add to that a number of categories that the Minister could consider in regard to the future data collection.  I am not saying I agree with everything he is seeking but I can understand the spirit of what he has said and perhaps we can try to accommodate that in an amendment on Report Stage.</p><p> It is important for me to be upfront.  Amendment No. 26 seeks to ban hare coursing and the use of animals in sporting events which may result in physical suffering.  I believe that is included in the performance section already in regard to ensuring animals are not on display or performing in a way that is cruel.  In the section on cruelty we have made a specific distinction in regard to hunting and so on.  The Deputy also seeks a ban on hunting, a ban on the shooting of wild birds, except for the purposes of disease control, a ban on the use of certain traps, a ban on the use of ferrets for the hunting of animals, a ban on badger culling, a ban on farming of mink or foxes for their fur and the use of wild animals in circus performances.  Some of his concerns are being addressed in other parts of the Bill around general animal welfare standards, what is prohibited in terms of animal cruelty and obligations in terms of looking after one's animals but an outright ban for all these sectors is not in place.  Badger culling and the use of wire snares to capture badgers is absolutely illegal.  The culling of badgers happens in as controlled a way as we can make it.  The types of snares used are specifically designed to ensure damage to the animal is minimised when it is being caught in order that it can be put down in as acceptable a way as possible.  </p><p> I would like to move on to a vaccination programme when I get advice that it makes sense to do it.  Ultimately, there are broader issues around TB that need to be dealt with.  Likewise, in regard to fox hunting, there are lines in the legislation around acceptable codes of conduct.  We will get to those when we move to the various sections.</p><p> I am not accepting amendment No. 26.  Many of the other amendments are linked to amendment No. 26, amendment No. 92 concerns a different issue and, perhaps, one or two of the others are different.  My initial reaction to amendment No. 26, which is the heart of this group of amendments, is that I cannot accept it but I want to read into the record what the Government is doing in trying to improve or support standards already in place or that have been put in place in the various areas.  I hope to get a chance to do that on the next day.</p></speech>

The use of animals in sporting events, in other words hunting, is legally permissible.  Will he explain whether the use of canines for the hunting of any animal, digging out of any wild mammal gone to ground and the use of terriers to attack and extract the wild mammal above or below ground, is legally permissible? The Bill provides that unnecessary cruelty is not permitted.  Is that issue covered in the Bill?  I do not agree with that particular procedure but I do not have a problem with normal hunting.  Nature can be quite cruel but that appears to be going too far.  If the Bill is passed, will the digging out of foxes be legally permissible, given the other terms about cruelty to animals?  I thought stag hunting was banned already.</p></speech>

That might be useful.  I can provide a briefing note to members of the committee on the various areas in order that we can have a discussion on the issue the next day.  I do not want to raise people's expectations that I will start banning a series of practices that I do not believe should be banned.  However people need to know the actual position in terms of what is legally permissible, the codes of conduct and whether they are being adhered to and the powers I have under this legislation to introduce new codes of conduct, if that is appropriate.  For example, people who use working terriers have asked that I introduce a mandatory code of conduct to ensure a distinction is made between the people who know what they are doing and behave in a reasonable way in that area and those who do not.  Those issues need to be examined.</p><p>  In regard to prohibition of animal cruelty, section 12(12) states:<blockquote>Nothing in this section applies in relation to anything which occurs in the ordinary course of-(<i>a</i> ) fishing,<br />(<i>b</i> ) lawfully hunting an animal, unless the animal is released in an injured, mutilated or exhausted condition, or<br />(<i>c</i> ) lawfully coursing a hare, unless the hare is hunted or coursed in a space from which it does not have a reasonable chance of escape.</blockquote>We have put some qualifications in place and I am sure we will have a long discussion on that section.  I do not have an opportunity to get into that debate now.   </p></speech>

I would like to know what is the practice and how humane is it compared to killing other animals, such as, a cow, a pig, or a sheep.

In talking about these issues, my main focus will be on the physical fabric of monuments and sites.  However, I will go a bit beyond that to talk about the connection between preservation and meaning and will try to connect that discussion with a wider international context.</p><p>  In international terms, the starting point in terms of principle can be traced back to the Venice charter, which is a document produced in 1964 by experts in the area of conservation.  The thinking behind that document at the time was that the business of preserving monuments would be facilitated by having international agreements, conventions and protocols that were shared between countries.  A number of European countries came together in France to discuss this and subsequently met in Venice where the charter was drawn up.</p><p>  In the documents I have supplied there is an interesting quotation from the first article of that charter, which is highlighted on the screen in my PowerPoint presentation.  It states that the concept of an historic monument embraces not only the single architectural work, but also the rural or urban setting in which is found evidence of a particular civilization, a significant development or an historic event.  It goes on to say that this applies to the more modest works of the past that have acquired cultural significance with the passage of time.  The deliberations of the group do not only talk, therefore, about the great monuments but also about modest works that because of the passage of history or events have acquired a significance within their culture.  Therefore, the group's prescriptions with regard to principles and procedures would apply equally in both cases.</p><p>  There is a history to how these principles have evolved.  If members will excuse me, I will go back a little to talk about that.  Although the discussion about preserving monuments goes back to the times of the Renaissance, it mainly took wings in the 19th century, at a time when there was massive reconstruction of medieval buildings and all sorts of inventions were being imposed upon them, with significant demolition taking place in order to arrive somehow at what the true building should be like.  However, it is really in the 20th century that we begin to see some progressive developments.</p><p>  I started off with the Venice charter from 1964, which involved mainly European countries coming together on this.  It is interesting that the main impetus for the development of conservation and preservation of monuments is clearly traceable to the aftermath of the two world wars.  At times when societies were particularly conscious of the fragility of civilisation and its products.  Therefore, we tended to get international congresses trying to arrive at definitions that would help the business of preservation.</p><p>  A number of significant shifts took place within the course of the 20th century and I will mention these as we go along.  From the end of the 1970s and in the early 1980s, we had a move to widen the discussion from the monument and historic area to historic towns and urban areas.  Then, there was an attempt to draw wider landscapes into the understanding and the existence of landscapes of cultural significance was recognised.  That particular discussion is particularly relevant to Ireland, where we have extensive landscapes that retain vestiges of the past and which, for one reason or another, have not been recognised over time, though they are beginning to be recognised now and people are paying attention to how we should deal with them.  For example, the landscapes of early Christian monasteries need to be regarded as a whole, rather than considered as individual examples existing in a particular place.  I will cover this again as we move along.</p><p>  Generally, when discussing the preservation or conservation of monuments and places of cultural significance, I always put three questions forward as "coat hooks" to help our thinking on the issue.  First, what is the significance of the monument or the place?  Second, how is that significance embodied in the material fabric we see in front of us?  Third, how is that significance maintained, revealed or protected in what we propose to do.  These three layers help us address the issue.</p><p>  With regard to the significance of the monument or place, this is an area where thinking has developed over the past few years.  This area brings into play multidisciplinary scholarship, because it is not within the competence of any particular academic or other kind of discipline to fully describe the significance of a particular monument.  One might look at it from an architectural, archeological, geographical, historical or other perspective.  There is a question of its place in folklore and in literature.  There are many different ways in which the significance of a place can be expressed.  As members are aware, there has been some discussion about the city of Dublin and its possible inscription on world heritage site lists.  One of the factors under consideration is that Dublin is and has been acknowledged as a city of literature.  A number of buildings on world heritage site lists are there because they are places where there has been outstanding achievement in the arts, rather than for the architectural quality of the place itself.</p><p>  Apart from this, there is the question of analysis of the fabric and detailed discussion of what exactly one is looking at and what remains on the ground in time.  The attitude taken in this regard is that the building itself is a document.  It is a document that was written at a point in time, but has since been progressively altered or written over by different generations under different circumstances.  Therefore, there is what one might call a polymces, which is one of those medieval manuscripts which when finished was erased and written over, but the older text could still be read through the newer one.  That is what buildings are - they are sedimentations of history.  One of the jobs of the analyst now is to go through those sedimentations and portray them.  His job is not necessarily to say this one is more important than that, but here they are, one after the other or one on top of the other.</p><p>  Let me refer to one of the international organisations that has had much to say on this area, UNESCO.  It has produced various categories of monument and criteria by which their value can be judged.  It has done this because it administers a system of world heritage sites and prescribes which are world heritage sites.  Therefore, it has had to produce definitions that allow it to make choices and judgments.  In terms of monuments, UNESCO has identified historical, artistic and scientific criteria to be applied.  In terms of sites, it has identified historical, aesthetic, ethnological or anthropological criteria and in natural sites, aesthetic and scientific criteria.  Of course, all of these overlap and interpenetrate one another.</p> <p>When it comes to the business of identifying the value of a monument, there are a number of international agreements that are relevant.  I have mentioned already that there is a progression involved and I will briefly explain what that progression has been.  The Venice Charter of 1964, which states that it does not apply just to modest works of the past, has the great monuments in mind.  The next document that is really significant from an Irish point of view was produced in Australia in 1979 and is called the Burra Charter.  It differs from other charters because in Australia one is not necessarily looking at huge monuments dating from the 12th or 14th centuries.  Very often one is dealing with landscapes of cultural significance, namely, landscapes that were highly significant to the indigenous peoples of Australia.  Therefore, one had to reformulate one's thinking about conservation to take account of cultural inheritances that are very different from the European model.  </p><p> The Burra Charter is particularly interesting for several reasons.  One is that because the Australians had to go to this effort, they did not take too much for granted in terms of definitions.  They had to spell out exactly what they meant, which means that the charter contains good definitions and explanatory memoranda.  If, for example, reference is made to a cultural site, a paragraph in the charter explains exactly what the reference means.  Therefore, the charter is very useful from the point of view of understanding the arguments.  From an Irish point of view, the charter represents the first time that the idea of a cultural landscape was articulated clearly and the first time that guidelines were given on how to approach it.  </p><p> The next document that is relevant is the Nara document on authenticity.  I will deal with authenticity in more detail later but it is the critical factor in this entire discussion.  The Nara document originated in Japan and was produced to address the nature of many Japanese monuments which were built of timber.  Some of them are over 1,000 years old but they still exist because they have been progressively repaired, with pieces replaced, over time.  If one looks at a Japanese temple that is 1,200 years old, some of the timber one is looking at may be only five years old, while some of it may be 500 years old.  The European perspective that demands that one must maintain the original material intact, in all circumstances, has to be modified by virtue of the fact that there are types of cultural inheritance where that idea does not apply.  There is a refinement of definition that comes from Nara, which begins to talk about the nature of authenticity.  It relates the nature of authenticity to the cultural context in which the monument is produced.  The Nara document also produces another valuable idea, namely, that there is not just tangible heritage that one can touch and that is physical, but also intangible heritage.  The authors are talking here about the craft and the knowledge that is inherent and implicit in the individuals who build and repair these things.  The Nara authors recognised that this is every bit as important as the artefact in itself.  </p><p> The last document I wish to draw attention to is the Declaration of San Antonio from 1996.  That arose, initially, as a challenge to the Nara document on authenticity.  It comes from the Americas and the authors took issue with the idea of a particular culture as being in some way related to nationalism.  They argued that the experience of the Americas is that within a particular nationalism there are many subcultures and quite often, as one can imagine in a colonial situation, a minority culture imposes its way on majority cultures within the society.  They required, therefore, a further definition of where the question of cultural identity might go.  Between the various aforementioned documents the issues of monuments and sites, cultural landscapes, tangible and intangible heritage and representation and embodiment are addressed.  By embodiment, I mean that a monument, apart from representing something actually embodies, in its fabric, a significance.  </p><p> The next question that arises is how significance is embodied in the fabric.  That is fundamentally a question of evidence and authenticity.  Basically, it is a requirement that somehow one establishes the evidence for whatever value one is ascribing to something.  In terms of the physical environment, that requires fairly intensive examination.  UNESCO, since 1978, has applied a test of authenticity and the idea behind it is that ultimately one is trying to find the truth and to determine the real situation.  One must be able to stand over the propositions one makes in terms of the significance of the monument one is trying to preserve.  The preservation of that evidence, that is, the evidence upon which one bases one's judgment, is the primary material goal of conservation and preservation.  It is not just a matter of preserving the building, as such, but also of preserving the evidence of that building over time.  This is a fundamental consideration.</p><p> The retention of material authenticity is a critical point.  The Venice Charter has a lot to say on this issue and contains what could be described as guidelines.  It states that evidence should not be removed or falsified.  When one is repairing a building one must recognise the evidence upon which one is basing one's judgment and ensure that whatever one does to repair the building does not change the reading of that, which it is very possible to do.  The charter goes on to state that material fabric should be retained and repaired and that where materials have decayed beyond repair they should be replaced with like materials.  One does not substitute materials unless it is absolutely unavoidable.  Of course, one of the very basic points in this regard is that old buildings have a habit of moving.  They do not shift location but they move, and introducing modern materials into buildings that are moving can be incredibly damaging.  We have seen many examples where, in order to stabilise a building where the walls are moving, large amounts of concrete are introduced.  However, concrete does not move so the rest of the building moves, the concrete stays where it is and a whole succession of seismological events can occur in slow motion, over time, as a result.   Basically, one does not do that sort of thing but one replaces like with like.  The charter states that new work should be compatible with the old and bear a contemporary stamp.  This is wide open to interpretation in terms of how one might propose to do that.  It is important to make sure that whatever one does now, it will be possible for somebody in 30 or 40 years to see clearly that the work was done in 2012.  There are many ways of doing that but one must make sure one does it correctly or else one is in danger of falsifying the evidence.  One cannot assume that the records we have now will be transmitted into the future.  </p><p> Another important point is that work should be reversible, if possible.  The idea behind that is very simple, namely, that nobody has all the answers.  In other words, one can make a decision today but one's knowledge is incomplete.  One might know better next year and might not have made the same decision or done the same thing.  Therefore, in theory, work should be reversible but that is not always possible with buildings.  If one inserts something to hold a building up, for example, it is not that easy to take it out again without consequences.  It is very difficult to reverse certain kinds of work.  The final notable point is that all periods and phases of building should be respected equally.  Again, that is a matter of judgment because obviously some phases in a building are more significant than others.  </p> <p>The starting point is that one should not try to produce a single coherent unambiguous work.  One is there to preserve evidence.</p><p> The Venice Charter refers to maintaining a setting that does not detract from the significance in terms of scale, form and function with regard to the preservation of a monument.  Primarily, this comes from people looking at medieval cathedrals, the Acropolis in Athens and the great monuments of the past.  It is not easy to translate that principle to the case of everyday architecture that has become significant with the passage of time.  We should consider how we understand this principle and how it should be explored and expressed.  I have provided some illustrations which are somewhat tongue in cheek.  I am unsure whether the committee members can see them on the screen but in one there is a nice shiny office block with what was the foyer of a theatre in front of it.  The idea was somehow to retain something from the past while developing the area behind it for new uses.  Unfortunately, the joke of this illustration is that the part in front is actually reconstructed; it is not the original retained structure.  It was rebuilt as a fake to show that those involved cared about the original structure.  The other illustration is completely ridiculous.  It involves a case where the developers were obliged to keep the building but they wished to maximise the use of the site and they simply built the new building on top of the old building.  Basic challenges arise, especially when one is working in dense urban areas.  There are difficulties with the business of trying to accommodate changing urban functions while at the same time trying to maintain the significance of a particular place or monument.</p><p> There is great significance to a place as well.  We are trying to establish the truth of a given place as it exists.  This means not only its history must be taken into account but also its contemporary reality.  We only have responsibility for conserving or preserving our heritage at a given point in time.  We exist for a limited period but the buildings were there before us and hopefully they will still be there after us.  We can only exercise our responsibility for the short span when we have the ability to do so.</p><p> The question of interpretation is always upfront.  There will be multiple narratives, especially for complex sites where there are complex and sometimes conflicting histories.  A transformation process occurs through the action of preservation or conservation.  The object is not the same after we finish acting on it as it was before.  Afterwards, it embodies one's action.  A transformation process is involved in preserving a building.</p><p> Some of the committee members might recognise the picture on the screen.  It is one of the iconic images that has emerged in the past 15 years.  It is a picture of the bridge in Mostar.  The committee members may remember the appalling civil war that occurred during the break-up of Yugoslavia.  Before it started, Mostar was a highly integrated city of Christians and Muslims.  As positions became polarised during the war both sides became entrenched.  I will not make any proposition about who did it most.  Anyway, there was a target, the cultural monuments of the other side.  Perhaps this was a way of denying the legitimacy of the other side or of sapping morale but either way certain sites were targeted.  The bridge was one of these targets and it was destroyed by shelling.</p><p> When the war was finished and NATO and its associated bodies came in as temporary administrators, the proposition was aired that the bridge should be reconstructed and it was decided to do that.  Now, it is a bridge between the two sides of Mostar.  One side is substantially a Croat city and the other side is substantially a Bosnian city.  The Bosnians are delighted to have the bridge in place but the Croats ignore it.  Now, the act of reconstruction has created something which cuts across people's understanding or their desire of where they want to be.  It has become a political statement produced by a body from outside that came into a highly fraught situation.  The bridge now has a symbolism completely different from what it was before it was destroyed.  It may have physical similarity and one could argue that it makes part of the city intact again but its meaning is now completely different and it is completely different on both sides of the river.  This comes about because people are bringing their own cultural, political and social agenda to bear in their appreciation of it.  There are overlays of meaning in the act of preservation and conservation.  In the business of preservation we need to represent the understandings of the present because they evoke different things and memories.  We need to understand the significance of the intervention.</p><p> The survival of a place is always strengthened by having a use compatible with its physical form and structure and its significance.  This is another article of the Venice Charter and it has been repeated in other charters since.  One might think that the proposition should be a basic tenet but it is not as simple as it seems.  Modern usages put different demands on historic fabrics.  Therefore, it becomes very important to be able to understand that by allowing new services to be put through a building there can be a loss of historic fabric and this may involve a loss of authenticity and it may potentially damage the evidence that the monument represents.</p><p> Any use of a building should be sustainable.  This is where the focus moves to the question of future management.  When we preserve a monument the question is what do we have in mind?  Do we want it to be another museum?   What do we want it to be?  This is where some thought and creativity must be applied.  Basically, when one is trying to preserve a monument, one is trying to preserve its significance in future but that is not a static thing; it evolves in time.  We make our judgments about what we consider to be significant now but we must take into account the fact that life will change.  Therefore, the monuments we preserve somehow need to accommodate our ability to keep telling the story of what is happening and how what happened at a given event in time has been commemorated and the meaning that has for contemporary society.  After all, this is what monuments are supposed to do for us today.  They are supposed to tell us something about what we are now and what sorts of things we consider valuable for the future.  That is our job when it comes to preserving monuments and passing them on.</p><p> I have put up a picture.  Some of the committee members might be familiar with it.  I realise it is a little out of left field but it comes from the city of Sarajevo.  I am unsure whether the committee members remember the beginnings of the war there.  There was a bombardment of the city which targeted a market where 22 people were killed as they queued to shop.  As part of that bombardment the national library was also destroyed.  One day a cellist came down the street with his cello, sat down in front of the ruins and played an adagio in G minor.  He played it for 22 days one after the other in the middle of the snipper fire, shelling and everything else.</p> <p>His creative action had extraordinary influence in making people realise the fragility of the culture and what was happening.  The image went viral worldwide and had its own influence, making people say: &quot;Hold on.  This goes too far.  Apart from the human cost there is also a cultural cost to what we are doing, and can we stand by this sort of thing?&quot;</p><p> We need to be creative about the use of monuments.  We need to remember that places like cities are more than containers for human activity.  They are also the locus for memory and the imagination.  They help us to understand our own past by virtue of what they are now, but they are also places that allow us to imagine the future.  James Joyce boasted that one could reconstruct Dublin from <i>Ulysses</i>.  He might have been right, at least for parts of it.</p><p> I will conclude by posing the three questions again.  What is the significance of the monument for the place?  How is that significance embodied in the fabric?  How is that significance maintained, revealed and preserved in the action or intervention that is proposed?</p></speech>

In the discussion we will be having today, would that part of the charter relate to a situation where a number of buildings of a historical nature exist and are designated a national monument, and would the area immediately adjacent to those buildings fall within that meaning?</p><p>  The second quotation from the Venice Charter is: "Preservation of a monument implies maintaining a setting that does not detract from the significance in terms of scale, form and function."  Can Professor Kealy relate that quotation to my first question?  Again, I am thinking specifically of a discussion we will be having subsequently about the buildings in Moore Street, but Professor Kealy need not respond in that context.</p></speech>

I must say that.</p><p>  All these charters are merely statements of principle.  In the same way, the concept of authenticity, for example, is only understood in the actual real context.  If we are talking about a setting of a monument, we must talk about that particular place, its own history and what it actually means.  One must bear in mind that the charters are not one-size-fits-all documents.  They are statements of principle which must then be interpreted and on which judgments have to be made.  There is no way out of that because all actions require judgment and the judgment takes place at a point in time.</p></speech>

It is helpful for us to understand the general context of conservation, preservation and so on.  I have some experience because I come from a historic cultural town.</p><p>  What does the professor think of the term "management of change"?  Finding a sustainable use is the key to preserving any building or context as far as is practical.  If a building is protected too much it will not find the modern use that will protect it and it will suffer and decline.  Does he agree that management of change and finding a sustainable use for a building is the key?</p></speech>

The curtilage of sites is protected.  The curtilage of this site is within the bounds of the buildings in Moore Street rather than the battlefield site.  The context, however, is wider than the curtilage that is protected.  There is no doubt about the authenticity of the site.  Professor Kealy said work should be capable of being reversed.  Does that include the context as well as the actual buildings?</p></speech>

What is the professor's position on retaining a building that, in itself, has no architectural merit whatsoever but because of something that occurred in it?  Is it as important to retain such a building as the Acropolis, for example?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-08a.700" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Loughlin Kealy" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2012110800007#F01800"><p>Management of change is a perfectly good definition of conservation.  I did not spend much time talking about the Washington Charter, which deals with historic areas and towns.  One of the presuppositions of that document is that urban areas change, as they have done in the past and will continue to do.  The management of change, therefore, comes into play as whatever means are necessary to ensure that the significance of a monument is not lost in the process of change.  All of that belongs within planning and urban design, as well as in conservation.  It is a wider question than simply the preservation of an actual structure.</p><p>  The second question is similar to one I dodged earlier.  I am also going to dodge Deputy Murphy's question.  If I am to observe my brief here, I will not trespass on the area the committee will be discussing and making decisions about later.  I apologise, but I am not going to go there.</p><p>  This brings me to the third question.</p> <p>One of the slides I used showed that the primary purpose of preservation or conservation is the preservation of evidence.  If a particular society or group decides that a structure is significant for a number of reasons, the evidence of that significance is to be maintained.  How this is done, compared with how the Acropolis is conserved or preserved, is a case of chalk and cheese.  The general intention is the same but the <i>modus operandi</i>is vastly different and different kinds of skills are required.  The conservation and preservation of the Acropolis has a number of different phases.  Most of the past few years have been spent trying to undo some of the work done in the past.  From a technical point of view, that work has proved to be incorrect and sometimes damaging.</p><p> I said that people are conscious of the differences of culture.  In our culture alone, we have places where buildings are built of what I call fugitive materials - materials that decayed quite quickly.  The preservation or conservation of a thatched cottage involves the continual replacement of the thatch.  There is no way out of that.  However, this does not mean that the significance of the building has changed.  It just means that, in this case, the original material is not as core to its significance as it would be in the case of the Parthenon or the Acropolis.  It is a different ball game.</p></speech>

If a witness is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and the witness continues to so do, the witness is entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of his or her evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and witnesses are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I advise witnesses that the opening statement and any other documents submitted to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.  In the interests of fairness we will hear the witnesses in strict alphabetical order according to surnames.  The exception will be the Dublin City Council submission which will be taken last.  The members of the committee are here to listen.  I ask witnesses to note that the committee has no opinion on this issue other than this is an important site in the history of Ireland and must be maintained.  The committee does not have an opinion at this stage nor has it expressed an opinion on the best means to do this.  The purpose of today's meeting is to inform the committee of the issues involved.  The committee will deliberate in private session at a later date on what it has heard.</p><p>  I wish to make a further statement.  Chartered Land was also invited to this meeting but, unfortunately, has declined the invitation to attend.  It gave a number of reasons for its non-attendance.  As Chairman of the committee I made every reasonable attempt to persuade Chartered Land to attend and to facilitate its attendance.  Acknowledging its central role as owners of the site, I acceded to its request for more speaking time than other witnesses.  I guaranteed that it would not be subjected to questioning or interruption by any other witnesses and if this happened, the meeting would be suspended.  I changed the venue of the meeting to ensure that correct parliamentary procedure would be followed to achieve that objective.  This could best be done at a committee meeting in Leinster House and this is the reason we are meeting here today.  The meeting was originally scheduled to take place in the offices of Dublin City Council on Wood Quay.  I thank Dublin City Council for facilitating that request.  We changed the venue specifically to facilitate the attendance of Chartered Land.  However, Chartered Land, among other conditions, wished to give its evidence in private session only.  This was not acceptable to the committee.  This committee hears evidence in public session in so far as possible.  Chartered Land has declined our invitation.  It has missed the opportunity to put its case in an open forum before the Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas and before the people.  It is unfortunate but that is its choice.</p><p>  I invite Ms Nora Comiskey to address the committee.</p></speech>

We are the 1916-1921 Club.  Our sole aim is to celebrate 1916 and 1921 and to stand up for everything initiated by 1916.</p><p>  We have supported the Government's plans for the celebrations.  We have a strong and dedicated following.  In 2006 the president of the club, Paraic Byrne, wrote a letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> stating the club's support for the Government's plans for the commemoration and to show that we support the legal government of the country.</p> <p>People will know that we support the legal Government of the country and we supported it on all its celebrations.  </p><p> The 1916-1921 Club exists to commemorate the 1916 Rising and the subsequent struggle for independence during the following five years that culminated in the first democratic Government in 1919.  It was certainly the first organisation to represent ordinary people, including women.  The club sees 1916 as being worthy of commemoration as the seminal event in the nation's history.  We should not forget that for some two decades in our recent history the State chose not to commemorate or celebrate the event that led to its foundation.  The 1916-1921 Club is in the process of compiling a programme of events as we approach the centenary.  We strongly believe, as do our members, that the Moore Street and general retreat area should form a central part of these celebrations.  We believe that the extreme sacrifices of the leaders of the 1916 Rising are responsible for the peaceful, democratic Government we all enjoy today.  We plead with our public representatives and media to refrain from referring to the Rising as a violent encounter while ignoring the violence that engulfed the world at the time and also ignoring the fact that two years previously the Ulster Unionist Council-UVF armed itself to the teeth to oppose Home Rule.  It is said that forgetting the past leads to a repeat of the mistakes of the past, and therefore it is of the utmost importance that all physical links to the event in our history that led to Independence are treated with the utmost care, attention and respect.  </p><p> We are a mere four years away from the centenary of the 1916 Rising, the pivotal event of our history.  The generation who participated in that event are no longer with us, but the buildings, streets and laneways they held in the name of the Republic remain with us as they were then.  These are our lasting physical link to that momentous event - the birth of this nation.  In light of that, the 1916-1921 Club supports the development of a historic, cultural and educational quarter in the GPO-Moore Street-Moore Lane area, the location of the last headquarters of the 1916 Provisional Government, where five of the signatories to the Proclamation spent their last hours of freedom before being executed.  The Proclamation is still one of the most enlightened documents in the world today, and we should continue to bring it to the attention of the international community.</p><p> If members would like I will read out part of the letter from 2006 to show that we supported the Government.</p></speech>

The subject of our presentation is the same as that of previous speakers, the saving of No. 16 Moore Street.  We had the pleasure of meeting the Chairman of the all-party Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch, and the secretary of the committee, Mr. Eugene &Oacute; Cruadhlaoich, last May for the purpose of further briefing the committee on the two alternatives that are currently before the Minister with regard to securing the above objective.  In the course of the briefing we outlined to the officers of the Oireachtas committee that the first of the two alternatives the Minister is evaluating dates from the time our Save No. 16 Moore Street Committee was formed, which was around 2003, while the other group's option dates from around 2008 or 2009.</p><p>  The first option had its genesis in a call by us to the members of Dublin City Council and Oireachtas &Eacute;ireann to desist from permitting the demolition of No. 16 Moore Street and its environs to make way for a regeneration project for the north O'Connell Street-mid-Moore Street-Ilac Centre area in the form of a mixed-use development of commercial and residential accommodation.  Full planning permission had been granted in 1998-99 for the demolition of No. 16 Moore Street and its contextual buildings.  Our proposal to the authorities for the implementation of an alternative vision, which would fulfil both the need to regenerate and the need to commemorate, was that a specialist conservation consultancy be identified and appointed for the specific purpose of carrying out a detailed examination of the area and bringing to the council a report and recommendations on how a balance could be correctly and properly struck between the requirement of the council to regenerate the semi-derelict and decaying northern end of the capital city's main street and the need for correct, proper and appropriate commemoration of the events that were seminal to the genesis of our State, including the Provisional Government's decision to surrender, an important part of which took place at No. 16 Moore Street.</p><p>  A firm of expert conservation consultants was selected and appointed.  It duly carried out its work and reported back to Dublin City Council in the form of a detailed bound report which recommended not only that No. 16 Moore Street should be returned to its 1916 specification and to pristine condition and used in perpetuity as a commemorative place for the events that unfolded on, in and around Moore Street in the latter days of Easter week 1916, but also that No. 16's three contextual buildings, Nos. 14,15 and 17, should receive the same preservation treatment, although without specifying that these three buildings should form an integral operational part of the commemorative project.  The report and recommendations by the expert conservation consultancy received a rapturous welcome and endorsement not only from all 52 members of Dublin City Council but also unanimously from our own committee's members.</p><p>  The proposal that was specified by the expert consultants as striking an appropriate balance between regeneration and commemoration was subsequently dealt with by the various authorities and players with jurisdiction acting in co-operation with Dublin City Council planning department, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, Chartered Land Limited, the Save No. 16 Moore Street Committee, the members of Dublin City Council and the concerned public.  The planning permission that now exists reflects the comprehensive input of all of these groups.  The proposal is fully funded, both in terms of capital provision and in terms of the operation of the commemorative element of the scheme in perpetuity, and the precise detail of its implementation is clearly defined with built-in contingency provisions.  Only ministerial approval of the section 14 application is required to move forward towards the delivery of the commemorative element of the Dublin central scheme by September 2015.</p><p>  The Chairman of the Oireachtas committee requested at the conclusion of our meeting that we obtain reinforced assurances from NAMA and Chartered Land Limited that the commemorative element of the Dublin central scheme could be successfully decoupled, if necessary, from the commercial element of the scheme and that, even in the event that the main scheme was held back by prevailing economic circumstances, both the capital and the operational overhead cost of the commemorative part of the scheme would be available.  We gave our assurance to the officers that we would attend to this aspect and report back.  We have since done so and reported back in positive terms.</p><p>  To summarise, the proposal to completely restore the buildings at Nos. 14-17 Moore Street and designate them as a commemorative centre for the 1916 Rising, which was made by the owner of the site, Chartered Land Limited, and which was accepted with modifications by the planning authority and, on appeal, by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, was deemed satisfactory by the majority of the Save No. 16 Moore Street Committee in terms of achieving the committee's founding aims and objectives.  In arriving at this decision the committee took cognisance of the likely effect of the proposed surrounding development on the national monument, the financing provisions which were then in place and the approaching deadline for completion of the works by 2016.  The committee is of the view that the proposal is well worked out and achievable within the limited financial context and timeframe.</p> <p>The relationship between the national monument buildings and the proposed adjacent commercial development has been carefully considered by the architects with open space being created to the rear of Nos. 14 and 17, which will feature some outdoor commemorative material.  The proposal provides for the historic buildings themselves to be restored and renovated according to the best conservation practice and thereafter used in perpetuity as a commemorative place to the memory of the events which unfolded in and around Moore Street during the course of the latter days of 1916.</p><p> The committee will continue to carefully monitor the works to make sure they are carried out in accordance with the proposal, through its architect member, The O&rsquo;Rahilly&rsquo;s grandson, Mark Price, who has liaised closely with Shaffrey conservation architects and will continue to do so until completion of the project to reinstate No. 16 Moore Street and its three contextual buildings, Nos. 14, 15 and 17, to the 1916 specification and pristine condition.</p></speech>

Before I begin my statement I wish to state for clarity and for the record that in regard to the communication, I am bound, a Chathaoirligh, to refer to a communication to your office that questions the standing of honourable members of the Save 16 Moore Street Committee, including members of the National Graves Association - the campaign founders - who have for over a decade remained steadfast in their opposition to the planned demolition of No. 16 Moore Street and its surrounding area.  The cheap attempt on the part of supporters of the Chartered Land planning application, some of whom are present today, to smear their reputation is a disgrace and cannot be allowed stand unchallenged.</p></speech>

We are trying to maintain a reasonable, balanced committee meeting.  I sincerely ask him to respect that and not to engage in inflammatory language.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-08a.718" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Connolly Heron" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2012110800010#J00500"><p>That is fine, Chairman.  The claim that our members are somehow falsely claiming to represent the views of the campaign committee is a scandalous falsehood and should be withdrawn and removed from the record with immediate effect.  I trust that the joint Oireachtas committee is in possession of the letter of rebuttal that I felt obliged to send in defence of their, and my, reputation as a voluntary, unpaid and unrewarded participant in an honourable, responsible campaign to date.</p><p>  As an elected officer of the Save 16 Moore Street Committee I am charged with the responsibility of recording its deliberations.  The record shows that the agreed founding aim of the committee was to protect the standing and integrity of No. 16 Moore Street in its entirety as the focal point of a 1916 historical cultural quarter.  The record shows that this has always been the case and that this remains the central aim of the committee to this day.</p><p>  The holder of the highest office in the land, an t-Uachtar&aacute;in, Michael D. Higgins, on walking the 1916 battlefield with relatives of the 1916 leaders during the presidential campaign said, &ldquo;This area belongs to no individual group or political party.  It belongs to the people.&rdquo;  The recent announcement by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, that control of planning cannot be left in the hands of elected representatives in light of the disclosure of corruption in the planning decision process makes sense until one examines the decisions taken concerning the proposed development of the Carlton site.  The recent TG4 documentary by D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Maolfabhail on the, to put it mildly, chequered history of the site demands a response from some quarter in defence of a city under siege apparently from our own publicly funded city planners.  Any modest residents&rsquo; association records minutes of meetings.  The startling disclosure by a city official that our city authority does not hold a written record of all meetings on the future development of the heart of our capital city is beyond belief.  Other Carlton site pre-planning meetings also took place with officials in the very Department charged with the protection of our heritage.  Can we assume that they kept the minutes of those meetings?  They should make interesting reading.  Is there contained within a record any official in the Department expressing the slightest concern at a developer&rsquo;s proposal to arbitrarily redraw the boundary of a national monument in his own commercial interest?  If not, why not?  After all, this is the very Department charged with the guardianship of our heritage.</p><p>  The apparent secrecy surrounding this proposed development of our city centre must now end.  It continues today with the astonishing absence of Chartered Land.  That elected city councillors were unaware of a contract drawn up in their name should be a matter of the gravest concern.  Was any other official in a Department aware of the contract drawn up in secrecy behind closed doors during the course of preplanning discussions?  There has been surprisingly little response to what has been rightly described in the D&aacute;il by Deputy Mary Lou McDonald as a scandal.  This is not a planning application for a new kitchen extension in a suburban home; this is an application to invade and build on, over and under the protected area of a national monument designated in honour of the men and women of 1916.  This is the highest form of protection the State can bestow on a building or structure.  Put simply, we expect the State to honour that designation.  A national monument by its designation belongs to the people.</p><p>  There has been a shocking lack of vision on the part of those charged with the protection of the city culture, history and heritage over a long period, and a lack of consultation with those most affected, namely, its citizens.  There has been an abject failure on the part of State agencies, public officials and those charged with protecting our most recent history and heritage to protect the very heart of this city, the GPO-Henry Street-Moore Street area.  The area includes the 1916 battlefield site.  The Easter Rising was the only land engagement of any size fought in Britain and Ireland in the 20th century.  All buildings that bear witness to and form part of a battle are historic.  The difference between a battle that is written about and taught to our children and one that is largely forgotten can be summed up in one word &ndash; preservation.</p></speech>

The question for us today is how will we be judged on this issue.  As Oireachtas Members, under preservation order No. 1 of 2007, committee members undertake the preservation of the national monument.  It is their duty to protect the national monument in the interests of the people.  In their letter of notification to interested parties the committee sought to bring interested parties together to achieve consensus on the best approach to preserve this historic site.  Consensus is not a prerequisite for preservation; action is.  It is time to act.  As the actor Sam Waterson put it on the threat to the preservation of battlefields in the United States.  "Those places that we cherish had better be defended; because development is so swift, so efficient and rather final."</p><p>  I trust that the committee will facilitate and allow all interested parties to present their case to it in the interests of openness, transparency, proper planning, the protection of our heritage and history and, more importantly, in the national interest.  Anything less insults the very memory of those the Moore Street, Moore Lane, 1916 national monument purports to honour.</p></speech>

I endorse what was said by Mr. John Connolly.  We have carefully considered the matter over the seven to eight years that the Save 16 Moore Street Committee has been running.  We are convinced that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.  While it would be brilliant if we had the &euro;100 million or &euro;200 million it would take to implement the big plan, that money does not exist.  There is a strong possibility of funding the saving of No. 16 Moore Street and its three contextual buildings.  The Dublin City Council planners, An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the other relevant authorities got their decision near enough right.  The planning permission that exists at present is the best that we could make of it.  We support the proposal.</p></speech>

I believe it was a Professor Kealy who went a long way towards explaining that there is a psychological element to our natural, living, built, buried and cultural environment which is necessary for a social democratic country to understand.  For example, to deal with built heritage, when one walks down a street the architecture in that street and the manner in which it is presented to the public who utilise that street has a psychological impact on the people.  If the place is monolithic in its presentation, psychologically the people will feel oppressed and therefore when planning departments plan streets and so on they should be cognisant of those issues; it should be an educational requirement for those sitting in such seats of responsibility.</p><p>  Regarding No. 16 Moore Street and its environs, I am here as an environmental activist and a member of the Save No. 16 Moore Street.  In early 2003 I was asked by some people to have a look at Moore Street and specifically No. 16 Moore Street.  I was informed that about two years prior to that time a Save No. 16 Moore Street group had come into being which had lobbied Dublin City Council long and hard and eventually achieved its objective, through a unanimous vote in the chambers, to have No. 16 Moore Street put on the list of protected structures.  However, as is the case with ordinary people who have such interests but who are not activists they do not understand that when they achieve their aims through consensus, as voiced by someone earlier, they must ensure that what was achieved is brought to reality.  That is what happened.  They went home and two years later the site still has not been put on the list of protected structures, even though we had a unanimous vote on the issue in the city council chambers.</p><p>  I was asked if I could put my energies into it and in doing so I called a meeting of interested individuals in Tailors' Hall off High Street, Dublin.  At that meeting it was decided by everybody present that a committee should be formed to ensure No. 16 Moore Street is listed as a protected structure.  I had not intended going any further on that action that day as I had other interests in mind but I asked the people present if there were interested parties who would chair the committee.  There was a request from the floor that I take the chair but I said I was too busy.  That request was made three times and eventually I succumbed and carried it forward from that point.  I chaired a loosely run committee with little or no regulations; it was just free speech at the table to determine where we could go from that point.  Many members joined and left the committee for different reasons but about 18 months later, through strong lobbying of Dublin City Council, we again achieved a unanimous vote in chambers to have the building put on the list of protected structures.  We continued with the challenge and turned our face to central Government to seek national monument protection because listed protection does not afford great protection.  We got national monument protection.</p><p>  My argument at the committee was that we should argue to keep the houses on both sides of No. 16 Moore Street to keep some context to the single building.  The single building would be lost in the development but at least Nos. 15 and 17 would give it some context and we would have some room for a commemorative centre as opposed to a small museum.  I was first lambasted for that idea but we ran with it.  We mentioned it a few times but we continued to argue only for No. 16.  We succeeded in getting four houses put on the list of protected structures, the footfall of six houses designated as a national monument, four on Moore Street and two on back lanes.</p></speech>

Another is that I am a Dubliner, a mother and a grandmother and for future generations it is imperative that this area is properly treated but it is in danger of not being so.  The national monument as it is currently designated is the buildings on Moore Street, Nos. 14 to 17, back as far as Moore Lane.  The planning permission proposed intends to intrude on 60% of that.  Professor Kealy mentioned the importance of not interfering with buildings.  The planning permission proposes putting staff toilets, kitchens and car parks under this national monument, which could well endanger the structures.</p><p>  When the campaign began Nos. 14 to 17 were seen to be very important.  We must keep in mind that Nos. 10 to 25, and the yards behind that, were all occupied.  There were approximately 300 volunteers and they occupied all of the yards and all of the buildings.  The proposal we are putting forward is that we return many of the buildings to their previous use, much as Professor Kealy suggested, namely, living accommodation, relevant shop accommodation not simply a commemorative centre.  Nos. 10 to 25 and the lanes are very important as well.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-08a.739" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colm Mac Geehin" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2012110800011#K01300"><p>I am the legal adviser to the relatives of the seven signatories.  The members have heard two of those relatives speak already.  They come from all walks of life.  They hold very different views but the one issue that has brought them together and for which they have got the support of other groups is their alarm and dismay at the way our history is being treated and in the way the area of Moore Street is utterly run down.  As Mr. James Connolly Heron referred to already, this is one of two battlefield sites in the whole of Ireland and Britain in the 20th century.  The Easter Rising was the first anti-colonial war which inspired other nations.  It was the one international event that happened on our soil, and that is what they wish to state.</p> <p>They have made presentations to the committee already on what they want preserved.  Their point could not be restated often enough.  They want to save not merely the monument at 14-17 Moore Street but the entire terrace, in addition to the historic laneways the Taoiseach called the laneways of history.</p><p> I wish to bring the attention of members to some of the obfuscation that has occurred.  It has been stated repeatedly by the supporters of Chartered Land that the monument comprises the buildings at 14-17 Moore Street.  It does not because these comprise but 40% of the national monument, which extends back to Moore Lane.  It has also been stated the company has full planning permission but it does not.  It has planning permission subject to the consent of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p><p> Why is the company seeking consent?  Its representatives are not present today because, in the company's culture, this matter should be addressed in secret or behind closed doors, as was always the case.  Although the representatives are not here, they sent a very revealing letter to the committee last July.  I will not read it in full but will summarise it.  A startling point made in the last paragraph is that while the company does not have any money itself, it is confident that, for the present, NAMA will give it sufficient funds with which to develop the buildings to the front, as it puts it.   I do not know how it intends to renovate them.  It refers to only four buildings in the centre of the terrace in the national monument.  The letter proceeds to deny that the development would encroach on the monument.  As the authors put it, "this is not quite true".  This is quite revealing.  It is intended to build a three-level car park covering the 60% of the national monument that lies to the rear, in addition to toilets beneath.</p><p> The company's main acknowledgement is that it has no money with which to carry out the development and that it does not envisage the monument being developed before 2016.  This begs the question as to why it is so insistent on obtaining consent.  To use its own parlance, it is because it wants to "flip" the site.  Flipping means that, with the benefit of the planning permission, the monument can be sold, which would suit the company and, I presume, NAMA.  It would then be in the hands of what we normally call vulture capitalists, who could build a massive shopping centre on the site.</p><p> Extraordinarily, the letter states the company does not wish to do away with the laneways.  The planning permission documentation states a square is to be put in the middle.  This would encroach on the national monument itself.  The company wants to crash through the buildings to the front and build new roadways down the middle.  It wants to pave over everything in existence and obliterate it from the site entirely.  This is the plan that has conditionally been sanctioned.  This is what the company wants to flog with the consent of NAMA and, I presume, the Minister.  If this is allowed to happen, it will be a national disgrace.  There is no place for this development whatsoever.  It is entirely without meaning.  The only intention is to sell it on to some others with large funds to do what they can with it.</p></speech>

I am a grand-niece of Mr. Joseph Plunkett, who was on the Moore Street site along with his two brothers, George and Jack.  I am a member of the group of relatives of the seven signatories.  The more I go to Moore Street, the more I find it extraordinary, emotional and deeply moving.  This has been the experience every time we brought somebody there.</p><p>  Every member of this committee should see the TG4 documentary <font color="#2F2F2F">&quot;Ini&uacute;chadh Oidhreacht na C&aacute;sca</font>&quot;, which must be one of the best documentaries ever to have been made in the country.  It is beautifully researched and the only documentary that tells the entire story.  It will shorten much of the committee's work if the members all watch it together.</p><p>  My second recommendation is one that the members probably feel they do not need.  I would like to take them on a journey from the door of the GPO, which was on fire, requiring 300 men to dash across Henry Street, under fire from snipers on the roof of the station, to where they got bottlenecked in Henry Place. <b></b>Henry Place was packed when filled with an army of 300 men and their five leaders .  They got stuck because of the sniper fire from the direction of the Rotunda.  They had to wait and go across in batches as Joseph Plunkett signalled by dropping his sabre.  Seventeen of them were wounded.  They were exhausted and very thirsty because there was no water in the GPO while it was on fire.  The buildings around it were heating it inordinately.  The soldiers got to Mrs. Cogan's house, broke down the door and entered.  She was cooking a ham and when she finished cooking it she gave it to them.  The Pearse brothers, who were closer to each other than others were to either of them throughout their lives, slept on the table upstairs.  They got up in the morning and everyone started burrowing through the houses in the way they had been trained to do; they were trained for urban warfare.  Eventually, the whole terrace was filled with men, as were the yards behind.  The leaders took their place in the middle as a place of safety.  Joseph Plunkett sat at the end of James Connolly's bed.  Connolly was in terrible pain owing to a gangrenous foot, which would have killed him had he not been shot first.  Plunkett was also dying, in his case with tuberculosis.</p><p>  Pearse looked out the window and saw, to his horror, the three members of the Dillon family, who were wrapped in sheets and carrying white flags, being shot down and killed by the artillery at the top of the street.  He said no more civilians should be killed.  He and the others got together, therefore, and agreed on a surrender.  Ms Elizabeth O'Farrell walked up the street on her own into the mouth of the guns with the surrender note for the British.  She walked down, and up and down again, and then back up with Pearse.  Both were arrested.</p><p>  Joseph Plunkett came out and stood in the middle of the street, on which there was nothing but bodies, and waited with his back to the guns for the men to line up.  They all combed their hair, washed their faces and brushed down their uniforms.  The Englishmen, the Liverpool men, and the Glasgowmen argued and were in tears in the belief that they would be shot immediately.  They wanted to continue fighting.  All lined up with their guns unloaded and marched in fours with their arms at the slope behind Willie Pearse and Joseph Plunkett, with Tom Clarke and Se&aacute;n Mac Diarmada behind.  They marched back down Moore Street the way they had come, back through Moore Lane, Henry Place and Henry Street.  The marched up O'Connell Street where they laid down their arms outside the Gresham and then marched to the Rotunda where they were made lie on the ground overnight in the wet.  The next battalion that arrived, Edward Daly's men, was made to lie on top of them.  That was the beginning of the end of the British empire.</p><p>  The site is a huge battlefield, extending all the way from Prince's Street to Parnell Square and beyond.  If we can enhance it, we can do what makes people feel they are real and belong to the human race, and what makes them feel they have generations behind them.  It would make them feel connected to the whole world, including Australia, America and Africa, whose inhabitants also had to get rid of the empire.  The area to which I refer is very important and nothing should be done lightly.  If the monument is not ready for 2016, it does not matter; doing it right is what counts.  We owe this to ourselves, our forebears and future generations.</p></speech>

My mother Barbara's father was Thomas McDonagh and her mother was Muriel Gifford.  Muriel's sister, Grace Gifford, married Joseph Plunkett in Kilmainham Gaol chapel an hour before he was shot.  P&aacute;draig H. Pearse was my mother's godfather.  My grandmother's sister Nellie was in the Royal College of Surgeons working with Madame Markievicz.</p> <p>She also worked with Connolly.  During 1916, my grandfather's brothers, Joe and Jack, fought in Jacob's factory.  Joe was later the Deputy Minister for Labour to Madame Markievicz and he died on hunger strike on Christmas Day 1922.  Earlier, Professor Kealy asked whether we wanted these buildings to be another museum and we must think about what we wish to commemorate and how we wish to do so.  The liberal and open ideas of the people of 1916 are possibly not in tune with the Ireland of 2016, the central value of which may be seen as being profit and profitability.  The question is whether we wish to forget these people, who ended a 700-year occupation and whose ideal of Ireland was liberal, European, egalitarian and co-operative.  My grandfather was one of those people.  He was a feminist and intellectual, whose Irish theatre presented works by new playwrights from across Europe.  The Ireland he envisaged and of which he dreamed was European, intelligent, honest and liberal.</p><p> In response to Deputy Coffey, these buildings on Moore Street - this palimpsest as Professor Kealy said - these Georgian townhouses of small businesses really constitute the last terrace of such working-class Georgian houses in Dublin and perhaps in Ireland and they are the Alamo of Ireland's history.  This terrace of houses and yards and the lanes down which the people of 1916 retreated, these houses in which the dying James Connolly and Michael O'Rahilly spent hours on the threshold of death and where Tom Clarke, Joe Plunkett, Sean McDermott and P&aacute;draig Pearse prepared to lay down their lives, are the essence of Ireland's republic, that is, the republic they sought.  We can choose to preserve these buildings as a symbol of that open, European and liberal Ireland for which these men died or one can follow the profit and salute the Celtic tiger and all it stood for by destroying this heritage.  It is up to members.</p><p> If we wish to be the Ireland those men and women envisaged in 1916, then we should commemorate those people and ideals and should save these laneways of history and these houses and their curtilages but otherwise, no, go for the profit.  My sister, Ms Muriel McAuley, has reminded me that the cobblestones across which they retreated are still in place on the streets.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-08a.744" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Tierney" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2012110800013#M00200"><p>We are here today at the joint committee's invitation to clarify where, from the perspective of Dublin City Council, the issue of the national monument stands.  The matter of works to the national monument site is still within process and obviously, any comments we make must take cognisance of that fact.  Professor Kealy's presentation was very interesting because one point it highlighted to everyone is the multiplicity of factors that must be taken into account in situations like this, which is far from being a black-and-white matter.  That was one reason the council commissioned the Shaffrey report in 2005, which we have circulated to members today, together with our presentation, and which is well worth reading by everyone if possible.</p><p>  Mention was made of the TG4 programme, of which the council has a very different view.  Moreover, some issues were raised today which are beyond the bounds of what I understood we were here to talk about.  However, I am happy to respond to this effect, namely, when I became city manager in late 2006, one of my very first meetings - that is the reason I remember it so clearly - debated this issue fully.  The situation was openly debated and the issues, some of which were referred to today, were dealt with at the time.  Indeed, some of the decisions prior to my becoming manager, either were lost in terms of the compulsory purchase order or withdrawn in terms of the agreement to which reference was made.  The city council is debating these issues again and a report was put before its members last Monday night dealing with those issues.  A further debate on the issues will be held on 19 November.</p><p>  Before I hand over to Mr. Jim Keogan to cover our written presentation in more detail, I will conclude by referring to the planning permission that was granted in 2008.  In effect, our decision was appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and following a lengthy oral hearing, An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted the permission in March 2010.  In making the decision, the board considered that the proposed development, as amended, and subject to compliance with the conditions it had set out, would constitute an appropriate mix and intensity of land use, would be compatible with the established pattern of development in the vicinity and would be acceptable in terms of impact on cultural heritage of the area, including the national monument at Nos. 14-17 Moore Street, protected structures within the site and environs, and the historic street network.  The plan approved provided for the preservation of Nos. 14-17 Moore Street as a national monument.</p><p>  The fifth condition of the grant permission states that no work shall commence within the preservation order boundary of the national monument at Nos.14-17 Moore Street, unless prior ministerial consent to such works has been obtained in accordance with the statutory requirements of section 14 of the National Monuments Acts 1930 to 2004.  In compliance with this condition, Chartered Land has made an application to the Minister to carry out works in accordance with the approved plans and the decision is awaited.  I now ask Mr. Jim Keogan to take it from there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-08a.745" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Keogan" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2012110800013#M00300"><p>I wish to put in context the role of Dublin City Council in the redevelopment of the area.  The site of the national monument at Nos. 14-17 Moore Street is in close proximity to the GPO and both are situated in an area of the city that has suffered from urban blight and dereliction since the 1970s.  The physical appearance of this area has been a cause of concern to the city council, having regard to its historical, social and architectural significance for the nation.  A number of interventions have been made by the city council and the Government over the years to address these issues and problems.  The first was the preparation by Dublin City Council and subsequent approval by the Government in 1999, of an integrated area plan for O'Connell Street.  That plan was one of five approved for the city, which provided for a package of tax incentives to assist in the redevelopment and rejuvenation of targeted sites within the plan areas.  The Carlton sites form "Site Cluster 1" in the O'Connell Street integrated area plan, which was identified as having great potential and capacity to act as a catalyst for the redevelopment of that part of Upper O'Connell Street, which had been and is suffering from widespread dereliction.  The site of the national monument at Moore Street formed part of these designated lands.</p><p>  Subsequently, designation of O'Connell Street as an architectural conservation area took place in 2001.  This was the first architectural conservation area prepared for Dublin pursuant to the newly-introduced planning and development legislation in 2000.  The purpose of the designation was to give recognition and protection to the historical and architectural character of this area.  The GPO, together with the Carlton facade and other buildings, form part of this designated area.  Subsequent to the aforementioned designation, the area was also made an area of special planning control in 2003.  Again, the city council so designated the area and it was the first of its type on foot of the new planning and development legislation.  The purpose of the exercise was to regulate undesirable uses within the area and to give greater protection to the historical character of this primary main street of the capital.  Again, this designation was the first of its type for the city.</p><p>  I refer to Nos. 14-17 Moore Street and the site's inclusion on the record of protected structures.</p> <p>Up until 2006, Nos. 14-17 Moore Street had no conservation designation under the provisions of the planning Acts.  In 2005, Dublin City Council commissioned Shaffrey Associates, architects, and John Montague, urban historian, to carry out an architectural assessment of Nos. 14-17 Moore Street.  Following consideration of the report, public submissions and the positive recommendation of the city manager, the members of the city council approved the inclusion of Nos. 14-17 Moore Street in the city council's record of protected structures.</p><p> A retail core strategy was prepared by Dublin City Council to address the continued decline in the retail offer in the city centre.  The continued migration of retail activity to the suburbs required specific interventions by way of policy initiatives.  The strategy was introduced by way of a variation to the then Dublin city development plan and identified sites within the north and south side retail areas suitable for redevelopment which could enhance and consolidate the city centre as the primary retail area for the region.  It should be noted that the lands at Upper O'Connell Street, inclusive of the Carlton site, were identified as one of these sites.  The strategy took cognisance of the protected status of the buildings, both in O'Connell Street and Moore Street, and would also provide the opportunity to integrate them into a renewed and vibrant city area, thereby further enhancing their status.</p><p> Nos. 14-17 Moore Street were subsequently designated as a national monument by the then Minister in 2007.  Between 2002 and 2006, Dublin City Council invested over &euro;20 million in the refurbishment of the O'Connell Street area.  This public investment in the area was to both stimulate and complement private investment which was also taking place.  It should be noted that 11 cluster sites were identified within the O&rsquo;Connell Street integrated area plan for tax designation.  Of these 11 sites, only two remain undeveloped, including the Carlton lands.  In 2008, a planning application was lodged with the city council for the comprehensive redevelopment of a 2.1 ha site situated between Upper O'Connell Street and Moore Street.  The site area included the national monument at Nos. 14-17 Moore Street.  The applicants, Chartered Land, had assembled the site over several years and had engaged in a consultation process with stakeholders, including the city council members, prior to lodging their planning application.</p><p> The application was assessed having regard to the city development plan and the policy objectives of the various strategies and designations outlined above.  It should be noted that major modifications were made to the proposed scheme during this assessment process and a decision was made to grant permission in 2008.  The planning authority was satisfied in making this decision that the national monument was both respected but also would now be enhanced by forming an integral part of a larger, vibrant urban block.</p><p> The decision was appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and following a lengthy appeal period that included an oral hearing, An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted permission for a development in 2010.  The city council has been consistent over the past several decades in seeking the redevelopment of these lands at Upper O'Connell Street and Moore Street.  The city council has sought to achieve this redevelopment in a balanced fashion that respects the historical and architectural significance of the area but, at the same time, recognises the need for investment so as to address the serious urban blight and dereliction from which the area has long suffered.</p><p> Since the application by the developer for consent to carry out works on the national monument site was made, we understand further positive steps are being taken with the Minister's office to see if there is a way to reinforce and extend the commitment to appropriately commemorate the 1916 event.  We are not privy to these discussions at this point but when the environmental impact statement, required under new legislation passed in July, emanates from this process it will go on public display, submissions will be taken and the council will also be formally consulted.  It may well be that a proposal that addresses various concerns still being expressed can be achieved through this process.</p></speech>

How does the council believe the local authority in Amsterdam would feel if there was a request to build a shopping mall that would completely dominate Anne Frank&rsquo;s house?  This is the similarity in the proposals for the Moore Street site.  Does the council accept the emotive and concrete evidence that the whole area from the GPO right down to the Rotunda hospital is part of our history and culture, not just the few houses mentioned?</p><p>  I am on the centenary commemorations committee and when Chartered Land presented to it, I asked why it wanted to put a car park at the Moore Street site.  Will the council explain this to me too as the area is well-served with car parks and by public transport?</p><p>  There is significant potential in this area for a historical and cultural site which will return vibrancy to the city.  There is potential for employment and tourism but I cannot understand how this has not been seen.  How could the council put into a developer&rsquo;s hands the preservation of a site that is so much part of our history?  Why would we trust a developer to do that?</p></speech>

The fact remains it was an independent adjudication and I have read some of the most relevant parts of it to the committee.  Mr. Keogan has explained the context.  We commissioned several reports, including the balanced Shaffrey report which deals with the business and retail needs of the city on the one hand and the preservation aspect on the other.  That decision was taken, subject to the request to carry out works under the National Monuments Act for which we await a final outcome.</p></speech>

Has Mr. Connolly Heron worked on a sustainable programme which could be put in place by 2016 which would retain the national monument in its historic setting?  If so, how has this been received to date?  Has Mr. Mac Geehin been in contact with NAMA about the site?  With regard to a recent TG4 documentary, &ldquo;Iniuchadh Oidhreacht na C&aacute;sca&rdquo;, does Dublin City Council believe it has questions to answer?  Do the delegations share the concern that the original buildings might collapse during construction works?  This is about our national heritage.  It is a key battle site and has important potential to draw tourism.  It is important some facility is in place by 2016.</p></speech>

For three years, we have been notifying planning enforcement of the breaches of the planning regulations in the area such as the blocking up of windows, exits and entrances but to no avail.  That is why our call is for State intervention at every level.</p> <p> If we are worried about 2016, the starting point is planning enforcement.  One should examine the area, list all the planning breaches and compel the owner to carry out immediate restorative work on the entire terrace.  It is not really a difficulty - in fact, one could say in a sense it is easier - that this national monument is under the control of a developer who is under the financial control of NAMA.  In a way, the State is involved, but what must happen and which has not happened to date is that there must be action.  There must be a political decision taken that this is not merely an ordinary planning application but that this is a proposal to destroy the historic centre of Dublin that links directly to the event in our history that led to our independence.  It requires political will.  It requires the committee, as elected representatives and Members of the Oireachtas, to remain steadfast that there will be no invasion of the area of the national monument, no building on it and no building under it.  It must be protected fully.  Outside of that, there is a battlefield site to be taken care of.  Stage one in this entire process is there must be no invasion of the protected area of a monument of this importance.</p></speech>

We tried to persuade NAMA of the folly of this development.  We understood, as the Deputy understands, that the agency holds the purse strings.  Since then, the agency was totally non-committal in its replies to us.  If one gives credence to what Chartered Land states in this letter that was circulated to all the members of the committee, NAMA is willing to give Chartered Land money to do some sort of a dickying up, as it were, of the four buildings to the front of Moore Street in the hope that such a move, somehow or other, will bring about a reconciliation, after which it can apply to the Minister for his consent and the whole place can be flipped, so to speak.  That seems to be the scenario that is being played out.</p><p>  What ought to be happening is that some of those involved, including those present in this room, among whom are included Dublin City Council, should admit now that they got it completely wrong and that they got carried away with the codology of building a suburban-style shopping centre.  Why do they not now admit that they were wrong, ask the Minister to refuse his consent and let the whole house of cards collapse, after which we can start again?</p></speech>

Given as this seems to be a clash between commerce and culture, and perhaps commerce and who we are as a people historically, is it possible that if this debate had taken place some years ago, there would be a greater awareness of the significance of the site?  Does the manager at this stage see any way we can step back and revisit that situation?</p><p>  I want to put a question to Mr. James Connolly Heron as well.  Seeing as this is an emotional experience - it certainly has been for me - and it must be a wounding experience for all of those on both committees who are relatives of the 1916 patriot leaders, and given the time constraints at this stage, what would be the view of his committee if there were a decision to revisit this in its totality and to bring forward an agreed plan and a date for its launch, perhaps culminating in some aspect of its acknowledgement as a site in 2016?  I put that question in the context that we must find the solutions.  That is why we are facilitators here today.</p><p>  I also have a question for Mr. Mac Geehin.  He was exceptionally clear on the parameters of the planning permission which has been given and it is quite clear there is a ministerial role in so far as the designated site is concerned.  I am aware that at least one Minister, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, has walked the site, and perhaps other Ministers have as well.  Will Mr. Mac Geehin be seeking an urgent meeting again with the Minister specifically to discuss that aspect of the ministerial role?  If there was a positive response on the other issue, could that be brought to the Minister?</p><p>  I also have a question for Mr. John Connolly.  With his presentation, I feel I am in the presence of history.  If there was an agreement through Government to have a plan designed and agreed for the whole battle site, would his response be positive or negative?</p></speech>

It would not be fair to say that debate did not take place at the time.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; did not suggest that.</p></speech>

There was a considerable amount of consultation on the various designations and the different permissions.  The council, as I said, had commissioned as far back as 2005 a report specifically on the area.  One can see the changing nature of the debate in that, as far back as 1998, the permission was for full demolition.  The position changed fairly dramatically during the period up to the application in 2008.</p><p>  We are in a process.  I repeat what Mr. Keogan stated, that our understanding is that, since the application by the developer for consent to carry out the works was made, further steps are being taken with the Department to see if there is a way to reinforce and extend the commitment to commemorate the 1916 event appropriately.  We are not privy to those discussions.  If something comes out of that, it will have to be declared as part of the environmental impact statement which, in turn, will go on public display for further consultation.  We will see whether it addresses any of the issues that have been expressed.</p></speech>

If one reads the Shaffrey report, it is clear that the entire terrace should be preserved.  Ms Shaffrey singles out No. 10 Moore Street at one end of the terrace that we call "The 1916 Terrace" as being worthy of preservation.  She talks about Nos. 20 and 21, what was Hanlon's and is now Polonez Store, and the corner where The O'Rahilly died as worthy of preservation.  We would fully support the Shaffrey report in that regard.</p><p>  In answer to Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;'s question, there are two simple solutions.  The first is that Dublin City Council should refuse to hand over Nos. 24 and 25 Moore Street, currently under its ownership and control, to any developer who proposes to demolish a terrace that Dublin City Council's policy is to preserve.  That is what the city council should do immediately.  The second is an even simpler solution: the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, should state that he will not consent to any proposal to invade or build on or under the designated protected area of a national monument.  If he says, "No", the present planning application falls and we go back to the drawing board.  Effectively, the city council can send this plan back to the drawing board, if it has the will.  Certainly, the Minister can, if he has the will.  There is a simple way to get back to the drawing board.</p><p>  It is not as if this plan has not been changed.  The current proposal has been changed three times from the infamous park in the sky proposal to where we are today.  It is beyond belief that the State has not said to this developer, who is in NAMA and is on a salary of &euro;200,000 paid out of the taxpayers' purse, to change the plan.</p> <p>We do not understand it.</p></speech>

We were clear that planning permission is conditional on his consent.  If he refuses his consent the entire process collapses.  It is surreal in its present state because the developers say they cannot and will not build anything because they do not have the money to develop a new Dundrum on top of the battlefield site.  Encroaching on the site is integral to their plans.  They say it is not entirely true that they are building on it but it is largely true.  There will be a three-tier carpark with toilets underneath.</p><p>  We have met everybody and members must be well rehearsed in the issues at this stage.  When we met the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il, Deputy Martin, he indicated that a committee chaired by the Taoiseach could resolve the problem.  He cited the IFSC, a development which I do not greatly admire, and pointed out that it required a Taoiseach to drive the project with the assistance of a small committee.  The Minister can be the starting point for reversing this ridiculous and unnecessary suburban shopping centre.  We do not need it and it will not be built with this money.  I do not know what the vulture capitalists will do when they get their hands on it but everybody in a position of authority should exhort the Minister to say "No".  It would be a popular decision and, God knows, this Government needs to make some popular decisions.</p></speech>

What can this committee do?  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; made the point about never the twain shall meet.  However, we should come together to discuss our different views.  The Minister has stated unequivocally that the buildings at Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street are robustly and comprehensively protected as a national monument and no change can be made to the buildings, whether externally or internally, without his consent.  I have seen the plans that the group originally presented but with NAMA now in the picture and the developer removed from it, at least in monetary terms, what is the next step?  The group cannot say the buildings should be allowed to deteriorate.  I have seen fine buildings deteriorate through a lack of action.  We cannot allow that to happen.</p></speech>

The provisions under the existing Planning and Development Acts are adequate to protect the buildings in question, as well as other buildings in the area directly associated with the Easter Rising.  The Senator mentioned one of the iconic figures of Irish history, Michael Collins, who spent time in the terrace in question.  He was in the GPO garrison.  It is extraordinary that every political party in this State can be linked to the evacuation of the terrace.  The Labour Party is directly linked through its founder, James Connolly.  Fianna F&aacute;il has too many links to mention but the most obvious is the former Taoiseach, Se&aacute;n Lemass.  Fine Gael has the Michael Collins connection and while Sinn F&eacute;in was not an active participant in the rising, it gained from it in terms of popularity and appeal.  All these parties can trace their lineage to what we describe as the birthplace of the Republic.</p><p>  Nothing will happen until we have a political decision.  We are rapidly approaching the centenary of 1916.  The decision could be taken politically.  If the Minister says "No", we will go back to the drawing board to produce a new plan.  At that stage all interested parties -----</p></speech>

I am not a member of this committee but I am a member of the all-party centenary committee, which has had several discussions on this issue.  Ms &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in gave one of the most important contributions because she explained how one can capture the events of 1916 in one's imagination by walking these streets based on a little bit of history.  If it is redeveloped in an inappropriate manner - I will not comment on the specific proposals - and those streets are no longer there, we will potentially obliterate any way of capturing these memories.  I visited the site and the buildings at the invitation of Chartered Land but I also toured with relatives.  I have seen the potential for the site from within and without and I have also visited many historical sites around the world.</p><p>  I have a number of questions for the witnesses.</p> <p>One of the questions is to Dublin City Council.  Does Mr. Tierney believe that in the public mind there is a view of the city council that there has been an ignorance about the social, cultural and aesthetic value of historical buildings in Dublin?  That is based on what happened with Wood Quay, Frascati House and Georgian Dublin.  This also applies to the national authorities in the context of Kilmainham.  Does he believe that a different approach should have been taken to historical monuments in the city?  The idea behind DCC's rejuvenation plan with the HARP project was to preserve as much of the historical city centre as possible to attract tourists and generate revenue there.  Where lies that project?</p><p> Mr. Conway mentioned having one in the hand and two in the bush.  Does he believe that the State has two birds in the hand because it controls everything, which is in the gift of the Minister?</p><p> Is it the view of the various witnesses that there should be an early decision from the Minister in order that once for and all, we can ensure this area is properly preserved in dedication to those who fought, died or survived during that heady week in 1916?</p></speech>

With regard to the site, the historical aspect is the most important.  There is in hand great design, architectural and historical research relating to the four relevant buildings, Nos. 14, 15, 16 and 17 with Nos. 14,15 and 17 to be developed as a commemorative centre and No. 16 as a national monument, which is all good.  The first thing that has to happen by law in any development is that a screening must be implemented.  The screening will identify where an environmental impact assessment needs to be carried out.  All interested parties must be allowed an input into such an assessment.  That should be done properly according to the letter of the law.  We are in this situation in the first place because this was not carried out.  We are back at a stage where we are looking at what needs to be done, which is to identify the full extent of the national monument.  Once that is identified, we can say this all needs to be properly protected and other aspects of the site can be commercially developed while, at the same time, putting money aside to protect and enhance the national monument.</p></speech>

They conducted their business in a fair and efficient manner, which is appreciated.  I thank the committee members and non-members who attended.  The history of what we are discussing and the significance the witnesses associate with 1916 is not lost on us.  It is wonderful to acknowledge that.  I do not want to single anyone out but Ms &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in's contribution was wonderful.  She evoked the spirit of 1916 and reminded us of the type of republic envisioned by the men and women of 1916.  That was hugely historic.  James Connolly is one of my political idols and it is enthralling to be in the presence of his relations.</p><p>  We have a facilitatory role and I assure the delegation that the committee will return to this.  We will do our level best to ensure a balance is struck.  I do not want to see a skyscraper over Moore Street.  There is room for manoeuvre and I assure them the committee will not be found wanting in this regard.</p><p>  My final comments are for Chartered Land.  This committee comprises Deputies and Senators from all parties and none which, as mentioned by Mr. James Connolly Heron, were born out of the issue we are discussing.  We made every reasonable attempt to bring in the company's representatives.  We gave them assurances that they would not be interrupted and they would be allowed to address the committee through the Chair.  We had allocated them extended time, more so than any other witness, and they attempted to dictate to a joint committee of the Houses of Oireachtas.  That is repugnant to the idea of democracy.  I want to put on record my disgust about that because this committee made every effort to facilitate their request.</p></speech>

I will begin by providing an overview of the European and international dimensions to the work of the ECOFIN Council.  As this will be the penultimate Council under the Cyprus Presidency, I take the opportunity to brief the committee on some of its key dossiers.  I will also speak about the agenda for Tuesday's meeting, after which I will be happy to take questions and observations from members.</p><p>  The work of the ECOFIN Council is heavily influenced by the work of the European Commission, the priorities of the rotating Presidency, the work of Heads of State and Government who meet regularly at European Council summits in Brussels, the ongoing volatile situation in the financial markets relating to the crisis in the eurozone and the work of the G20 and the IMF.  Specifically in regard to ongoing international developments, the G20 met in Mexico earlier this week to consider a number of issues which we will discuss later in the week at the ECOFIN Council.</p> <p>The G20 summit closed on Monday and the Mexican Presidency issued the usual communiqu&eacute; setting out decisions taken.</p><p> With regard to the EU Presidency, the Cypriot Presidency still has one third of its term left to run and it is committed to making progress on a number of key dossiers, including the single supervisory mechanism under the banking union heading, and additional measures to strengthen economic governance, referred to as the two-pack.  On the single supervisory mechanism, the Cypriot Presidency has stated it will do all in its power to secure agreement during its tenure.  On the two-pack, it is also hopeful it will be able to respect the European Council invitation of 18 and 19 October 2012 and reach agreement with the European Parliament with a view to adoption by the end of 2012 at the latest.</p><p> The Cypriot Presidency has also successfully co-ordinated a review of the European semester and it will shortly submit a synthesis report to Council bringing together the deliberations over recent months of various Council formations.  This will help inform the roadmap on the organisation of work for the 2013 European semester, which will be prepared by the incoming Irish Presidency.</p><p> Turning to next Tuesday's ECOFIN meeting, the Department has already supplied the committee with the latest draft agenda for the meeting, and I will highlight some of the key issues that will be discussed.  At next week's Council meeting, Ministers will be updated on the progress in the trilogue discussions that are under way to achieve agreement on the two-pack.  I expect the Council will be asked to give a mandate to the Presidency to continue negotiations with the European Parliament on the basis of a new set of compromise suggestions which will be put forward by the Presidency.  It should be noted that the scrutiny sub-committee of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform will meet on 14 November.  The sub-committee has invited officials from the Department to the meeting to discuss the two-pack, as well as the financial transaction tax and the common consolidated corporation tax base.</p><p> Returning to the upcoming Council meeting, the Commission will present an update on the status of the revised capital requirements rules.  The proposal is at trilogue stage of negotiations, and it is likely the Commission will urge that these negotiations come to a conclusion.  The need for stronger capital and liquidity standards for EU financial institutions is evident from the financial crisis and Ireland recognises this is a vital piece of legislation.</p><p> There will be a state of play report on the single supervisory mechanism, including an exchange of views.  The latter will be on the basis of the Presidency report that will be prepared following an <i>ad hoc</i>working group on 5 and 6 November.  Under the proposal, the ECB will take on the prudential supervision of credit institutions.  A regulation amending voting procedures in the European Banking Authority is also proposed as part of these reforms.  The objective is to ensure equitable treatment of euro area and non-euro-area member states within the single supervisory mechanism.</p><p> A state of play discussion on the financial transaction tax is scheduled for the meeting.  At the June 2012 ECOFIN meeting, it became clear that agreement on the Commission's draft directive to introduce a financial transactions tax would not be reached at EU 27 level.  Those countries that favour the tax are now trying to introduce it by way of enhanced co-operation, under which at least nine countries must participate.  I understand that 11 countries - namely, Germany, France, Austria, Belgium, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Italy, Slovakia, Estonia and Greece - have written to this effect to the European Commission.  On 23 October 2012 the Commission submitted its proposal for a Council decision to authorise enhanced co-operation in the area of a financial transaction tax.  The Council will have to decide after consent by the European Parliament.  A subsequent Commission proposal for a directive implementing enhanced co-operation in the area of a financial transaction tax should follow in due course.</p><p> The mandate for negotiation of amendments to the savings taxation agreements with third countries will be discussed at ECOFIN.  There will be a proposal that the Council adopt relevant decisions authorising the opening of such negotiations, and we hope the proposal will be agreed.  We will discuss in restricted session issues related to the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact.  In particular, the items discussed will pertain to Greece and may include recommendations for specific measures to be taken by Greece to address its excessive deficit.</p><p> The Presidency will inform the Council on the follow-up of the ECOFIN-related decisions taken by the European Council on 18 and 19 October.  The October Council was dominated by discussion of economic issues, particularly the interim report on the future of the economic and monetary union, which identifies the single supervisory mechanism and the broader<br />banking union as essential building blocks to delivering genuine economic and monetary union.  The Council will have an exchange of views on the outcomes of the annual meeting of the IMF and World Bank Group in Tokyo and the G20 finance Ministers' and central bank governors' meeting in Mexico, as well as a possible follow-up.  The Council conclusions on climate finance - fast start finance - will be agreed in advance of the 18th conference of parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, in Qatar from 26 November to 7 December 2012.  The Environment Council adopted conclusions on the other aspects of the preparation for Doha on 25 October.</p><p> Draft Council conclusions on the annual EU statistics package will feature on the agenda.  This may only be an &quot;A&quot; item on the Council agenda, which would allow for its approval without any major discussion.  Ministers will have an exchange of views on state aid modernisation from which the Presidency will draw its own written conclusions.  The Competitiveness Council will also deal with this issue on 10 December 2012 but is not considering adopting Council conclusions.  It is expected that ECOFIN will subsequently adopt Council conclusions, taking into account the Presidency conclusions from the November ECOFIN discussion and the discussion at the December Competitiveness Council.</p><p> I would like to say a word on our own economic and budgetary situation.  The Department's latest projections were set out in the 2012 stability programme update, which was published on 27 April.  GDP growth returned last year and further modest growth is anticipated for this year, again coming from the external side.  It is expected that somewhat more broadly balanced growth will develop next year and beyond.  However, so far the exporting sectors are leading the recovery.  This underscores the importance of restoring sustainable growth in the euro area, which is a key trading partner for Ireland.  In this context, resolving the difficulties in the euro area will be vital.  Furthermore, taking account of the Exchequer returns for the first ten months of this year, our budget is on track, and I am confident that fiscal targets will be achieved again this year.  The Department will produce revised forecasts for 2012 and later years shortly.  These will take account of domestic developments over recent months and the current outlook for the international economy.  However, given the worsening of the external environment - particularly in key trading partners - it is clear that short-term growth prospects will be weaker than previously anticipated in the April stability programme update.</p><p> A considerable amount of progress has been achieved on the reform programme and enhanced governance measures in the EU as a whole and in the euro area.  Europe 2020, the EU's growth strategy for the coming decade, is now well-embedded throughout the EU.  This is also true of the EU semester, which has now become an important part of the annual work stream of the Commission and Council.  The successful implementation of the 2013 semester will be a priority for Ireland's Presidency.  The euro plus pact, which is now in place as part of the EU semester, has concrete goals aimed at fostering competitiveness and employment.  The six-pack, which came into effect last December, will reform the Stability and Growth Pact by, among other things, ensuring better budgetary surveillance and focusing on prevention and correction of macro-economic imbalances.  The two-pack will therefore be the key final piece of the reform strategy for the euro area.</p><p> The four presidents' paper on the economic and monetary union was released in June.  The paper's four essential building blocks are proposals for an integrated financial framework, a budgetary framework, an economic policy framework and greater democratic legitimacy and accountability.  An interim report by President Van Rompuy was presented to the October European Council.</p> <p>A specific road map for the achievement of a genuine economic and monetary union will be presented at the European Council meeting on 13 and 14 December. </p><p> Moving forward, it is Ireland's view that the focus must be on delivering in all respects the commitments already agreed by the Heads of State and Government, including those of 29 June.  Those commitments were vital in giving certainty to the markets and for Europe's credibility.  During its Presidency next year Ireland will mark 40 years as a committed member of the European Union.  We will take up the Presidency of the European Union on 1 January 2013 and will work in collaboration with the other members of our trio, Lithuania and Greece.  Membership of the EU during the past 40 years has been good for Ireland in terms of attracting a considerable amount of foreign direct investment and in gaining access to a much bigger market for our exports.  Equally, Ireland has been perceived by our European partners and successive members of European institutions as a diligent, pragmatic and constructive member of the Union.  We have demonstrated this continuously during the past six occasions on which we held the Presidency of the European Union and have gained a reputation for holding efficient, business-like and pragmatic Presidencies.  In 2004, Ireland presided over the enlargement of the European Union to 25 member states.</p><p> The Government believes that Ireland's future is intimately linked with continued membership of a strong and vibrant European Union and as a member of the euro area.  It is the intention of the Government to continue to proactively engage with senior officials in the EU institutions and with our EU partners in the implementation of policies aimed at strengthening growth and stabilising turbulent financial markets.  This is reflected in the main themes of our Presidency, which include promoting growth and restoring the EU's competitiveness.</p><p> I thank members for their attention.  I am happy to respond to any questions from members.</p></speech>

I propose that ten minutes be allowed for the opening round of questions and five minutes for any second and subsequent rounds.</p><p>  Before I invite Deputy Dooley to put his questions, I have a question for the Minister on the financial transaction tax.  The Minister's report to the joint committee today indicates that that has not yet been fully decided and that there are processes in place for a commencement date.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

The Chairman will be aware that the Commission published a paper some time ago.  It became clear during the early discussions on that paper that it would not be possible to get agreement across the 27 eurozone members.  The treaty provides that a smaller number of member states can proceed by way of enhanced co-operation.  To do this, nine states must write to the Commission indicating that they want to move in that direction.  Eleven member states have done so.  It is a long and intricate process under the treaties.  While there will be some discussion on the matter on Tuesday, it is unlikely that significant progress will be made in the short term.</p></speech>

Those countries are in similar financial programmes to Ireland.  What is Ireland's determined position in this regard?  Is it an observational one or has a more determined decision been taken on the matter?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-08a.804" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2012110800004#C00500"><p>Ireland's position is that at a level of principle we would support a financial transaction tax, provided it was applied universally and particularly to the main world financial sectors.  That would be our ideal position.  If it applied in Singapore, Hong Kong, New York and Tokyo as well as in London and the European centres, we would go along with it.  Our next position, in order of descent, would be that if a financial transaction tax was agreed across the 27 members, we could also agree to that.  Our fear is agreement to any lesser group having a financial transaction tax in which the United Kingdom would not participate.  Some 33,000 people here work in financial services and we believe that if a financial transaction tax were introduced here and not in the United Kingdom, activity would migrate from Dublin to London, resulting in a loss of part of the industry and some jobs.  On the other hand, we can see the merits and principles of a financial transaction tax.  In the event of a group of nine, ten or 11 member states agreeing a financial transaction tax, we will not seek to put barriers in the way of its being introduced elsewhere.  </p><p>  What is currently being discussed is a form of stamp duty on share transactions and other financial transactions.  A low level of 0.1% is the tentative suggestion, although that is not a hard proposal.  In Ireland, we already have a stamp duty on transactions in shares, which stands at 1%.  What is being debated is not particularly out of line with what we are doing, although what we are doing is at a higher level than what is being contemplated.  Listening to the contributions of colleague Ministers around the table, I found there was no common view across the 11 member states that have signed the enhanced co-operation request.  Each has its own attitude.  As such, it might be quite difficult to get agreement when it comes down to the particularities of a tax, even among the 11 concerned.</p></speech>

In the eventuality that an FTT is up and running in a minimum of nine countries, will the Department engage in monitoring the tax that we are foregoing in this regard?  If so, I would ask that the Department report on that matter to this committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-08a.806" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2012110800004#C00700"><p>We will closely monitor any development because it is an issue of great relevance to Ireland.  I do not believe there is a question of Ireland foregoing any tax.  That is conceived so far on the basis of what has progressed.  Our tax take for the 1% stamp duty will be in excess of any possible take that will accrue from a financial transaction tax.  A number of other issues are running parallel to this.  There is agreement among the 11 member states concerned that a financial transaction tax is in principle a good idea.  However, what to do with that financial transaction tax is a matter of debate.  Some people believe that as per the Tobin tax, with which Members will be familiar, it be used to fund non-governmental organisations, NGOs, in under-developed countries.  Another cohort of people think it should be used in the area of climate change, to reduce carbon emissions and so on.  The stronger view now is that it would form a separate stream of direct funding for the European Union.  Currently, this funding is provided by way of contributions from member states.  The thinking now is in terms of a separate stream funded by a financial transaction tax and, possibly, other means in the future.  We are in the early stages of debate on the issue, with 16 of the 27 member countries having already removed themselves from the enhanced co-operation.  There are a range of issues on which there is not unanimity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-08a.807" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2012110800004#C00800"><p>I welcome the Minister and his officials and wish the Minister well in his negotiations and discussions at ECOFIN.  The Minister said in his concluding remarks that Ireland would focus on delivering in all respects on the commitments already agreed to by the Heads of State and Government, including those of 29 June.  I assume we can take that as relating to our bank debt in particular.  It is well recognised that there are two aspects to our bank debt, namely, the &euro;30 billion associated with the promissory note and the &euro;29 billion associated with our pillar bank investment.  On the promissory note, there has been an expectation for some time that a technical paper would be produced setting out a mechanism by which some form of resolution would come about.  In this regard, discussions since June have focused on trying to resolve the cost to the taxpayer of the investment that had to be made in our pillar banks.</p> <p>May we take it that there is a continued effort to follow both streams of resolution, the promissory note and dealing with the pillar bank investment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-08a.809" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="09:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2012110800005#D00200"><p>The decisions of the Council on 29 June were much wider than any commitments made to Spain or Ireland.  The primary decision at that Council was for banking union, and that consists of the three pillars of supervision across Europe, a mechanism whereby insolvent banks across the eurozone and the Union would be resolved centrally by a European mechanism, and a guarantee scheme through insurance for depositors across the Union.  The best way to understand it is to consider how banks work in the United States.  If a bank fails in Texas, the Texan authorities would not have the responsibility for the resolution of the institution.  There would be no big fuss and it is part of the system.</p><p>  In that context the commitment was made to separate banking debt from sovereign debt.  In this light, a commitment was also made to the possibility of a direct recapitalisation of Spanish banks through use of the European Stability Mechanism, and then there would be examination of the sustainability of the Irish debt position, with all sovereigns treated equally.</p><p>  It is true to say we are pursuing, as the Deputy noted, both sets of negotiations.  We are engaging on the promissory note, as we have been for some time.  The deadline in that regard is effectively the next payment date, which is 31 March next year.  We are not waiting until then but pushing for an earlier resolution on that.  There is also a position on the trading pillar banks and how we might be recompensed for the fact that the Irish taxpayer ultimately carried the responsibility for recapitalising both Bank of Ireland and AIB.</p><p>  The Deputy knows from the statement of 29 June on banking union that before any direct recapitalisation of the banking system in Europe can occur, the supervisory aspect of the banking union must be put in place and seen to be working.  That is on a longer timeframe than the promissory note to which I referred.</p></speech>

It indicated that the ratio would continue to rise and one of the modelling exercises related to a return to the State of &euro;24 billion.  Unless we get something in that order, the model predicts we would find it difficult to have a sustainable debt position.</p><p>  What is the Minister's expectation in that regard?  I have seen some modelling done by a number of economists and the IMF indicating that the impact would be relatively minor on our overall debt position because of an elongation of the repayment associated with the promissory note.  The significant positive impact on our debt position would be a return to the State of something in the order of &euro;24 billion to &euro;25 billion, which was invested in the pillar banks.  The Government seems to take some solace from the fact that has been identified, particularly by Chancellor Merkel, as us being a special case as a result.</p><p>  Does the Minister expect to have a further discussion on this?  I accept the Minister discussed the matter during the week with Mr. Sch&auml;uble, who reiterated this special case position.  Does the Minister expect to have discussions as part of ECOFIN about our special case?  What is the Minister's expectation?  Does he expect a position of investment in the order of &euro;24 billion or is it more likely to be the ESM purchasing shares in the pillar banks at market value?</p></speech>

It is used colloquially, such as when people say it will be very hard for Ireland to deal with servicing this bank debt with sustainability.  When people use it in debate, they do not mean we will default but rather that life is being made difficult for everybody and taxpayers in particular.  It is also used in a very narrow sense, effectively meaning that if a country's debt position is not sustainable, the country will default.  In the first sense I agree with the Deputy and the IMF analysis but in the second sense I do not.  There is no question of us defaulting.  The position is that if our debt peaks at 120% or 121%, we can still service it and it remains sustainable in that sense.  Nevertheless, it would put a very severe burden on the taxpayer, and the amount of resources dedicated to servicing a debt of that level would inhibit growth rates.  The Secretary General of the Department, in speaking to the committee yesterday, used the metaphor of driving a car with the handbrake on.  When speaking about sustainability, particularly with regard to the IMF, it is not an inability to pay that is discussed but rather the difficulty in paying, the burden placed on the taxpayer and the inhibition of growth rates.</p><p>  There have been various interchanges since 29 June, particularly involving the Taoiseach and Chancellor Merkel, and both on the telephone and in face-to-face meetings.  The German finance Minister came to Farmleigh the week before to meet with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, and I had a lengthy meeting with him.  He reaffirmed the position of Chancellor Merkel so there is nothing new to add to the position already stated.  It has been recited, parsed and analysed on a number of occasions in the joint statements made by the Taoiseach and Chancellor Merkel and after the Minister, Deputy Howlin, and I met Mr. Sch&auml;uble.  There was a press conference after our meeting and the German Finance Minister quoted Chancellor Merkel in expressing the exact policy position of the federal government.</p></speech>

One projection I have seen for the interest payments on that debt next year will be &euro;9 billion.  How on earth can anybody describe that as sustainable?  Of course, the interest payments can continue but that would be at the cost of impoverishing the Irish people and diverting resources that should be going into desperately needed public investment, for example, into paying the national debt.  How on earth does anybody believe that the sharks in the financial markets will entertain this State for major lending in a year or two when all the economic indicators are downwards?</p> <p>How does the Minister square these circles?  </p></speech>

Every household is affected by it and the Government is not making light of that.  It is a huge burden.  The Deputy stated that it is 121% of GDP.  Of that amount 40% is the transfer of bank debt onto the sovereign.  If we did not have to carry the burden of bank debt on the sovereign then the debt GDP ratio would be somewhere over 80% and would be one of the lowest in the European Union.  The average debt of the euro group is about 94% and we would be well under if we did not have to carry the burden.  The purpose behind the two pieces of negotiations is that we envisage a reduction in the burden on the Irish taxpayer thus making it more sustainable.  In blunt language, to reduce the imposition of the servicing of the debt on the taxpayer is the purpose behind the two pieces of negotiations but I cannot predict the outcome.  The Taoiseach has explained the policy position in great detail and the lines that we are pursuing to secure a better deal for Ireland.  We are trying to untangle a previous complex arrangement that was entered into.  We would all agree that the original agreement on bank debt, in particular, imposed a very heavy burden on the taxpayer.</p></speech>

It was criminal lunacy but his Government continues the policy of bleeding the Irish people of their resources in order to honour that criminal arrangement.  In light of how indefensible this is, that the Irish people are held to ransom to bail out the European financial system, how does he explain that his colleagues, particularly in German, have made such heavy weather of recognising and acting on an unjust and unsustainable proposal?  Why is there talk of not having an arrangement for debt reduction until after elections take place in Germany near the end of next year?</p></speech>

It would not be in the interests of the country to do so because resiling from those arrangements would put us in a default position.  Default is not part of our policy and in the absence of a default we are negotiating a better position for Ireland.</p><p>  The Deputy mentioned the German authority.  It is quite clear from the statement on 29 June and the joint communiqu&eacute; from the Taoiseach and the Chancellor, that Germany is now fully cognisant of the special position of Ireland and that it is positioning policy to do something about that.  It is also a condition, and always was since 29 June, that before there is a move on these matters the direct supervision of the European banking system must be put in place which will be done during the course of 2013. </p></speech>

The three institutions of the troika, the European Central Bank, the European Union and the IMF, were equally complicit in putting a gun to the head of the disastrous previous Government.  That means that it put a gun to the head of the Irish people.  Why should we adopt a position of justifying ourselves when the previous Government clearly placed a demand on the Irish people to pick up tens of billions of euro of private debt?  It put the debt on their shoulders.</p></speech>

The Minister's Government, following on from the disastrous policies of the last Government, is bending the knee to these institutions at every point rather than standing up to them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-08a.820" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2012110800006#E00800"><p>That is not true.  On a number of occasions the Deputy has stated his position on these matters.  We both agree that the original deal was a bad one.  The Government is trying to unwind it by negotiation.  As Deputy Dooley pointed out, there are two parts to the negotiations and we are proceeding with them.  We are making some progress and we shall see where it works out.</p><p>  It is also true that Ireland has a deficit problem and a debt problem.  Both problems are not entirely separate because the services cost of the debt kicks across into magnifying the deficit problem.  Even if there was never a legacy banking issue in Ireland we are still not collecting anything like the amount of revenue that is necessary to run the services on which spending is conducted in Ireland.  There is an impression that if we could sort out the legacy banking issue then everything would be resolved but that is not the case.  There is an equally difficult position with the deficit and we must close the gap between revenue and expenditure and that is what the budgets are about.  I agree with the Deputy that there is a crossover.  Obviously, servicing that debt appears in the current account.  </p></speech>

I shall commence by asking him about the single supervisory mechanism and what he referred to as an exchange of views.  He mentioned a proposal that referred to a prudential supervision.  Today, as he will know, we will have all read the newspaper reports on pay levels for executives in the IBRC.  We all welcome the call made by Mr. David Duffy that resulted in a pay reduction for Mr. Eugene Sheehy.</p><p>  I wonder, within the prudential supervision and the exchange of views, if we could have some discussion on the banks that have been nationalised or left in the control of the State?  Does he see a situation where officials can thumb their nose at pay reductions?  On 5 April the Minister asked Mr. Alan Dukes to require the IBRC executives to take a 15% pay reduction.  I think Mr. Dukes has still not got back to him on that.  Is there scope within the single supervisory mechanism to address the issue?  I know that it involves a difficult legal position given the botched bank bailout by the last Government but, nonetheless, CEO pay is capped.  Perhaps there is a potential to introduce a cap on pay for lower grades. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-08a.823" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2012110800006#E01100"><p>There is general agreement that the light touch supervision that prevailed in Ireland and elsewhere before the banking crisis was one of its causes.  Everywhere, including Europe, has moved away from light touch regulation.  From a policy point of view - driven by the AAA countries in Europe - anything like a common banking system could be put in place.  In other words, before other people would take responsibility centrally for the debts of banking systems and other sovereigns, an effective supervisory system is the first step that must be put in place.  Instead of the Irish Central Bank and the Irish regulator being the sole regulator of the Irish banking system, its regulation would move to Frankfurt.</p> <p>The regulatory system would be organised and driven by Frankfurt.  In practical terms, there are approximately 6,000 banks in Europe and there is a debate about the extent, but the Commission proposal is that all 6,000 banking institutions in Europe should be under the supervisory control of the European Central Bank in Frankfurt.  How it would work in practice is that it would be the legal entity which would be empowered to regulate.  It would work to a common rule book for all the banking institutions in Europe but in the actual application of the regulation there would be nothing to prevent Frankfurt from delegating its legal supervisory authority to local regulators.  However, it would also have an override provision, where it could intervene where it thought it was necessary to impose its regulatory regime directly.</p><p> These are the things that are being worked out.  I am outlining the shape of it to the committee.  Whatever its shape, it must be refined, agreed and be in place early next year, and a legal framework must be in place by 1 January.  That is what is meant by the supervisory position.</p><p> On the question about the IBRC, it is true that I wrote to Alan Dukes and asked him to talk to the board of IBRC to ask it to apply a pay cut across the pay levels.  It was done in the public service and I cannot see why it would not be done elsewhere.  At the time, it was discussed by the board of IBRC but the members of the board did not think it was wise or prudent to take the pay cut.  The members said the IBRC was losing staff and that it would be very difficult for it to hire.  However, my position is that while they have the legal authority to set the pay scales arising from the articles of agreement they entered into at the time the status of Anglo Irish Bank was changed by the previous Government, there is a public interest as well and I will continue to push it.  We will see where it goes.  The Deputy is correct that I wrote to the bank, but the board said it did not think it would be prudent to apply a reduction in salaries.  However, we are working on it.  At the same time, the board of IBRC took a 20% reduction in its director fees and took another 15% reduction subsequently.  The chief executive has a salary this year that is approximately &euro;200,000 less than what it was last year.</p></speech>

It is important to pursue it and, perhaps, contact Mr. Dukes again.  I have a question about growth.  Mr. John Moran appeared before the committee yesterday.  Much of the commentary appears to forget that Ireland has growth at present, uniquely among similar countries in Europe.  However, there appears to be a downward projection for what our growth figures will be.  Will that help in the negotiations with respect to the promissory note?  At what point does the Minister think the revised growth figures can be made public and how, if at all, will they impact on the budget he is drafting?</p></speech>

We released growth figures in April and they are operable at present.  The next set of growth figures will be released by us in the next couple of weeks.  A large of amount of very strong data are coming through for this quarter, especially for the services sector.  The Deputy will have seen the export figures and the purchasing managers index.  While we have not got a final cut on what the Department of Finance forecasts will be, the trend is that it will be marking up the growth rate for 2012 from 0.7%, which is what we based the figure on, and it will pull back the estimated growth rate for 2013.  It is not all bad news.  There will be an adjustment upward for 2012 and an adjustment downward for 2013.  However, it is not yet finalised so I cannot give the precise figures in advance, but that is the tendency or trend.</p></speech>

I wish to deal with two issues.  The first is the cost of funds to our banking system at present.  I also wish to hear about the Minister's strategy for the ultimate sale of the banks and how the cost of funds will play into that.  The ECB is reducing the amount of funding it is providing to our pillar banks.  There are many strategies one can use to sell a bank and many different forms of funding can be used.  One can have direct funding from the European Central Bank, personal deposits, corporate deposits or wholesale markets.  In any business model one tries to buy low and sell at a higher price, but we are doing the reverse of that at present.  AIB lost &euro;1 billion last year.  Has the Minister had discussions with President Van Rompuy about trying to provide us with more funding directly from the European Central Bank as we move forward?  We talk about trying to capitalise the bank through the ESM.  That can be done in a less onerous way than going to the markets.  AIB representatives appeared before this committee last week and said they have commenced negotiations with potential investors.  However, if we go to the private markets to sell our shareholding in Bank of Ireland and AIB, we will require multi-strand forms of funding going forward.  I have a preference for going to the ESM.  The reason is that I believe there is a strong argument to be made for our banks to be predominantly funded through the European Central Bank.  It would be a great deal cheaper and less onerous.  Also, it would be a way of dealing ultimately with personal debt.  What are the Minister's thoughts on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-08a.828" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2012110800007#F00500"><p>First, how are the banks funded?  They take in deposits, and the deposit flow into the banks has increased.  If one looks at the project as a repair of the banking system, the fact they are getting an increased flow of deposits is a good indicator that people with savings believe the banks are being repaired.  They are now at the stage where I think interest rates on deposits will probably come down because they have a strong flow of deposits.  Much of their funding also comes from the emergency liquidity assistance, ELA, funding from the European Central Bank.  However, it is not that the ECB is cutting back on the amount of funding available but that with the increased intake of deposits and the deleveraging of the banking system, the Irish banks require less than they did previously.  It is a demand-driven scheme rather than a supply-driven scheme.</p><p>  On the sale of the banks, one would look first at values.  We own 15% of Bank of Ireland.  We also have preference shares there which will be taken out at some point.  We own 99% of AIB, effectively the whole shareholding.  The National Pensions Reserve Fund calculates values and it puts a value of between &euro;8 billion and &euro;10 billion on this.  This year's figure was revised earlier this year; it was &euro;8.1 billion.  Last year's figure was &euro;8 billion.  This is inexact, however, because one is assuming there is a willing buyer.</p></speech>

The precedent would be applicable to Ireland.  That was the thinking.  If that model was followed through, the ESM would take a bank share.  It would buy the entire shareholding in the case of AIB or take a share in Bank of Ireland.</p></speech>

Representatives of the pillar banks appeared before the committee last week and they said they cannot envisage interest rates, particularly those applicable to mortgages, going down in the short, medium or long term.  To the contrary, they envisage them increasing.  That will impose a greater burden.</p> <p>We have talked about debt, which can be sustainable, but in this case it is crippling sustainability.  We are asking a racehorse to do a mule's job.  It does not apply to a modern society trying to develop itself.  Ultimately, we must revise strategy and talk to the European Central Bank to get further funding directly from it.  That can only apply if we are on fixed line strategy with the ESM to take shareholding, as opposed to the investment from private stakeholders who will ultimately benefit on the back of the negligent lending of the past.  </p></speech>

There are two national interests, which are not always in line.  One is the individual difficulties of mortgage holders and other creditors of banks.  It is in their interest to have low interest rates.  On the other hand, as we are effectively the sole owner of AIB, the other national interest, which is the taxpayers' interest, is to ensure the banks become profitable so there is value in the shareholding held by the taxpayer.  When we look at the level of charges and interest rates applied by the banks, the consideration on behalf of mortgage holders contradicts the consideration of making banks profitable.  It is a difficult matter.</p></speech>

The cashflow model that sells the bank ultimately needs to reflect the fact that people in the most debt will not be burdened with the largest margins.</p></speech>

On the ESM, the statement of 29 June envisaged that when banking supervision was put in place, something along the lines suggested by Deputy Spring will happen.  The Irish banks are fully recapitalised under stress conditions.  Within the current property values, the banks are adequately capitalised.  When Basel III regulations on bank recapitalisation come into effect, that may change.  It will not change because of new difficulties in the Irish banking system.  Basel III is further down the line.</p><p>  Do the committee members think a fund in Europe, designed as a rescue fund, is the best entity to run an Irish bank?  It has no experience of running a bank.  Its function is to raise money on the markets and give it out to countries in difficulty.  We must consider that point and the arrangements-----</p></speech>

For the Minister to start engaging in the kind of things I might say would drive up borrowing costs for Ireland.

The Minister laid out why he is doing it and, although I do not agree with all of what he is doing, I understand why he is doing it.  Some 40% of the debt is not ours.  The markets do not believe there is no chance of default and have factored in a greater than 40% chance of default, reflected in the sovereign risk premium.  The Minister cannot say there is any chance of default but I can and I will.  It may be necessary and we should always bear in mind that 40% of it is not ours.  We would never default on debt that was ours.</p><p>  Regarding the question of Deputy Dara Murphy on the letter to Anglo Irish Bank and wages, did the Minister send a similar letter to AIB?  What is the level of debt surrender engaged in by Bank of Ireland?  If the Minister does not know now, he can come back to us.  We had an extraordinary presentation by Richie Boucher last week, where he refused to answer legitimate questions.  In some cases there was no commercial sensitivity or non-disclosure reason why he could not answer.  He thumbed his nose at the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and it was an extraordinary performance.  I would appreciate it if the Minister for Finance can find out.  In respect of domestic mortgages, has Bank of Ireland engaged in debt surrender to date?</p><p>  I would love to hear the thoughts of the Minister for Finance on the fiscal union in five years' time.  The two-pack is pretty serious.  The first part refers to regulations on "common provisions for monitoring and assessing draft budgetary plans and ensuring the correction of excessive deficit of the Member States".  This is serious in terms of national sovereignty.  The single supervisory mechanism, the single banking regulator, the common capital requirements and the Stability and Growth Pact are serious matters and we are signing up to them.  Can the Minister for Finance give his view on what it will feel like for the Oireachtas to make a budget in five years' time?  Will European officials see the budget ahead of time?  Will they be able to veto budgetary options the Government of the day would like to engage in?</p></speech>

I have given the committee preliminary documentation on the agenda.  It is unreasonable to ask me to be held accountable for everything across my departmental brief when I have been invited to discuss the ECOFIN agenda.  It is not that I am reluctant to do so but I am hesitant in case I give inaccurate information to committee members speaking from memory when I have not briefed myself on the issues raised and without accompanying documentation.  I am quite prepared to answers the questions but I would prefer if members proceeded by way of parliamentary question and tabled written questions.  Then, I will supply answers but I hesitate to do so now because I have only the brief on ECOFIN.  I briefed myself on that topic last night.</p></speech>

The documents in response to the committee's request include the two-pack, which is being negotiated at a trilogue with the European Parliament, the Presidency and the Commission.  The documents provided refer to the governance part of the two-pack and some regulations on the common provisions for monitoring and assessing draft budgetary plans and ensuring the correction of excessive deficits of member states in the euro area.  There is also regulation on the strengthening of economic and budgetary surveillance of member states experiencing, or threatened with, serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability in the euro area.  There is progress towards agreement with the Parliament but there remain areas of divergence.  The Presidency has filed amendments to bridge the gap.  Members of the committee are familiar with the six-pack and the provisions of the stability treaty, which was passed in Ireland by referendum in May.  It has now been passed by the euro group countries.  It feeds into the additional regulatory regime.</p><p>  The only additional item coming forward is suggested by the German finance Minister, which is that the Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs be given the same kind of powers as the Commissioner for Competition.</p> <p>Members will recall that the EU Competition Commissioner can take action, without reference back to the college of commissioners, if states are acting against the rules of competition.  It is now being suggested that Commissioner Olli Rehn and his successors should have that kind of interventionist role.  That would give additional supervision.  It remains to be seen whether that comes to anything.  As far as I have seen, no formal papers have been filed in this regard to date.</p></speech>

As the Deputy will be aware, the ESRI and the Central Bank developed a paper on the financial transactions tax at my request when it became clear that certain European countries were going to push the matter fairly hard.  I wanted the advice I was getting within the Department of Finance to be supplemented by an examination of the possible impact on Ireland of the financial transactions tax, as then envisaged in the Commission paper.  We got the paper from the ESRI and the Central Bank and it was published on our website last June.</p></speech>

I would like to know how the workings of the Clearing House Group contributed to the Minister's consideration of his policy position.  The ESRI report weighed heavily on the 1984 Swedish movement to bring in a financial transactions tax.  Does the Minister accept that the research done by the ESRI and PricewaterhouseCoopers was very flawed?  The financial transactions tax that is now envisaged is very different from the Swedish model and the model examined by PricewaterhouseCoopers and the ESRI.  Members of the Clearing House Group who regularly meet representatives of the Department of Finance are advising their senior clients that a patchwork tax would be the worst kind of financial transactions tax and that it would be much better for the EU to have a unified financial transactions tax.  Is the Minister prepared to review his policy position on the matter in co-operation with this committee?</p></speech>

The first time I heard it debated in the Houses of the Oireachtas was on the back of the Tobin report, which was very fashionable 12 or 15 years ago.</p></speech>

The proposal at the time involved the imposition of a financial transactions tax at a very small level to fund overseas development aid, in effect.  The plan was that it would lead to a big international budget for this purpose.  Sweden was the only country to put in place a financial transactions tax along the lines suggested.  It was a disaster from Sweden's point of view because it closed down the Swedish financial sector, in effect.</p></speech>

We are talking about a different type of tax.  As it is a residency tax, it could actually lose revenue.  Transactions could take place here but the tax could be paid in other countries.  I do not think we are having that serious debate.  I know the Chairman is about to cut me off, so I will ask my other question.  This committee has asked for the position papers and minutes of the Clearing House Group that meets the Department of Finance on a regular basis to be made available to it.  I hope the Minister will respond by indicating his support for the request and for the committee's position.</p></speech>

It is a fact that when Sweden introduced a financial transactions tax, it wrecked that country's financial services industry.  The Swedish authorities say that quite openly at meetings.  They are very antagonistic to financial transactions taxes as a result of what happened previously.  I know the situation has moved on.  I set out the Irish policy position on a financial transactions tax in considerable detail in reply to the Chairman's first question here today.  The Clearing House Group is run by the Department of the Taoiseach and is chaired by the Taoiseach.</p></speech>

The Minister mentioned what was done in Sweden in 1984.  That was done on the basis of stamp duty rather than on ownership or tax residency basis.  That is why it failed.

Three things struck me when I looked through the paper.  The two main reinforced steel joists of the meeting are the capitalisation of the banks and the role of a central European banking supervisor.  The rest of the issues are packed in around those two issues.  There is a darkening shadow of debt over Europe.  Politicians across the eurozone are beginning to understand that there has been a criminal capture by the financial system of the budgets of eurozone countries.  The financial transactions tax might have had an earlier origin with other ideas for funding different efforts across European Union countries, but it is now essentially converting itself into an insurance fund for banks.  They get the uneasy feeling that the balance sheets of the 6,000 banks across the eurozone are not as healthy as they have tried to fool everybody about.  We had our own banks in last week.  The sort of good news from Anglo Irish Bank was that the final estimate of its loan losses might be &euro;25 billion, rather than between &euro;29 billion and &euro;36 billion.  That is patently disproved by the facts.  It had a &euro;74 billion loan book at the start of the collapse.  Half of that is &euro;37 billion.  There is going to be a loss of &euro;37 billion, regardless of the mirrored corridors of accounting.  When they said their final estimate is &euro;25 billion, that was after taking credit for approximately &euro;17 billion of interest on promissory notes over the term of those notes.</p></speech>

One of the points the Minister is raising at the ECOFIN meeting is the revised capital requirement rules.  I ask him to outline his view on that matter and what impact he expects the revisions to have on the capitalisation of our banking system.</p><p>  The Minister referred to the fact that 40% of our national debt relates to the banking system.  In that context, I ask him to indicate how that debt has a knock-on effect on our budgetary position.  The total interest charge for servicing our debt will be &euro;4.1 billion in 2012, &euro;5.6 billion in 2013, &euro;5.5 billion in 2014 and &euro;5.6 billion in 2015.  What is the value amount of those totals that relates to banking?</p></speech>

In that context, Ireland welcomes the efforts to reach a compromise on the outstanding issues and we favour keeping the proposed text as close to the Council's compromise text as possible.  The prudential capital assessment review assesses the capital requirements arising from expected base and potential stressed loan losses and other financial developments over the medium term and was published in March 2011.  The covered institutions are well capitalised at levels of around 15% to 16%.  These capital levels for tier one capital ratios are clearly well above the minimum of 10.5% required by the Central Bank.  The recent European Banking Authority capital raising exercise did not require further injections into the Irish banks.  CRD IV and CRR, therefore, hold our banks to a higher requirement than has been the case before now, and this will help secure the long-term future.</p><p>  The servicing costs of all the debt from the Irish banking system do not arise in terms of the ECOFIN agenda, but I can provide that information to the Deputy.  I do not want to speak from memory because I do not want to put out inexact figures.</p></speech>

The Minister spoke of the knock-on effect of that on the budgetary system.  I was just inquiring about the negative impact the bank debt is having on our budgetary position.  We have a dead weight of banking debt which has become sovereign debt.  I was seeking a flavour of-----</p></speech>

I will send them on to the Deputy.  In terms of helping the Deputy, if he thinks of the promissory note repayments on 31 March every year in respect of Anglo Irish Bank alone, the sum is &euro;3.1 billion.  That will go on for about 12 years, and then there is a long tail to it after that of decreasing amounts.</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, the previous Government negotiated an interest rate holiday so it did not hit our budgets, effectively, until the change of Government.  Within the sum of &euro;3.1 billion there is a lot of capital repayment built in.  The amount is not standard as one goes through the years so, again, in the interest of being exact, I would need to give the Deputy that information later, and I will do so in writing.</p></speech>

Are we approaching a situation where Europe can start dealing with specific problems, like Ireland's debt problem and the deal we are seeking to resolve it?  At a meeting of this committee yesterday, one of my colleagues pointed out that if growth is weaker than expected in the next few years that could have a knock-on effect in terms of us being able to reduce our unemployment levels.  In that context, getting a deal and more support from Europe could have a major impact on our ability to get out of the crisis we are in.</p></speech>

Some European countries are in recession at the moment and, indeed, we are one of the stronger countries in terms of growth rates.  We had a growth rate of 1.4% last year, better than the budget provision of 0.7% for this year and somewhere around the middle of the forecast for next year.  We will see in a fortnight's time what the figures will be.  Obviously, if we have stronger growth rates our tax take will increase, our deficit will decrease and more people will go back to work.  Our model is export-led growth and because of that we need growth in the European Union because Europe is such a big customer of ours.  We need growth in Europe to get maximum effect from the model of recovery we are using.  Approximately 20% of our exports go to the United States of America, a further 20% go to the United Kingdom but 40% go to the European Union, with the remainder going to the rest of the world.  One can see from those figures the importance of growing European economies in terms of demand for Irish exports of both goods and services.  We would like to see a European solution that addresses growth and jobs, and the Taoiseach has said on a number of occasions that the main theme of the Irish Presidency will be the growth and jobs agenda.</p><p>  The Deputy asked how Europe is going at the moment.  It is more settled than it was six months ago but many problems remain to be addressed.  The Greek problem continues but we hope that progress will be made on that in the coming weeks.  Spain still has its difficulties, as Deputies will know from reading the newspapers.  Italy, too, has its own difficulties.  Places like Cyprus and Slovenia have very big banking problems.  Individual countries within the EU all have their own programmes for strengthening their own economies.  The difficulties in Europe are not behind us but significant progress has been made.  The next big European project is banking union.  That should be very helpful to the integrity of the eurozone and the wider ECOFIN zone.  We will see how that develops and how rapidly it can be put in place.</p></speech>

We represent an industry under considerable pressure.  Pub sales in the past five years are down 34%.  We believe we have a strong case for an excise reduction but we recognise the reality of the public finances.  Accordingly, we are calling for the <i>status quo</i> in terms of excise, that is, that excise levels be maintained at current levels.  We are keen to make one important point clear and understood to the committee.  Excise has a disproportionate impact on the on-trade.  If an excise increase went through, it would result in job losses in the on-trade and a loss of revenue to the Government by virtue of the fact of the VAT intensity of the on-trade.  More VAT is generated from the on-trade than the off-trade.  We are keen for the committee to recognise the differential impact between the on-trade and off-trade when it is considering its view.</p></speech>

It would result in a switch in product and channel from the on-trade to the off-trade and it would result in a loss of jobs and tax revenue.  The level of these losses would depend on the level of the tax increase.</p></speech>

People look closely at the price of drink and if the price of drink came down, it would be a positive thing.  It is important to recognise that the Government has been supportive of the industry through the 9% VAT rate on food in the hospitality sector, which is positive, and in terms of The Gathering initiative in 2013, which is designed to promote Ireland.  It would be conflicting to have a hike in excise in the year of The Gathering.</p></speech>

Our association represents independent, specialist off-licences.  We have 350 members who run pure or specialist off-licences.  These are family owned and operated in the community.  Unfortunately for us, alcohol in the off-sales sector is in the crossfire of a war for market share within the grocery industry.  The upshot of the deep discounting of alcohol has been the loss of 2,800 jobs in our sector.  There have been 75 closures in the past four years and seven closures since July 2012.  Based on these figures, we reckon we face a further 25 or 30 business closures in 2013.  Our members are trained, highly skilled owner-operators located in the heart of the community.  They employ expertise in retailing alcohol but their livelihood is being undermined and threatened by the use of alcohol as a driver for footfall to sell other, dearer grocery products.  An excise increase is a luxury we cannot afford.  Currently we are having difficulty competing with the large multiples because they can absorb increases and sell below cost and reclaim the VAT on any loss against other grocery products.</p></speech>

It seems the role of the multiples in the sale of alcohol in the off-trade has completely distorted the market.  I am keen to establish whether there is a way of marrying the health objectives we all share while recognising the financial and budgetary constraints within which the Government must work.</p><p>  I know many members of Ms Jones's association are struggling despite a shift from the on-trade to the off-trade.  Frankly, many in the on-trade are on their knees.  Is there some way to address this, perhaps through the licensing system, by revising the level of licence fee paid or by attaching a levy to the multiples?  The way in which they are selling alcohol makes it ridiculously cheap.  This is having many negative consequences and it should be reviewed.  Is there some way of marrying these two issues, perhaps through the licensing system?  Am I right in saying that a large multiple only pays the same amount for its licence to sell beer, wine or spirits as a small independent off-licence or a Centra selling wine?  I understand they pay &euro;500.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Therefore, the total renewal fee is &euro;1,500.  That is not linked to turnover.  It is a standard fee across the board whether one is a large multinational or a small shop like mine.</p></speech>

It is a possible mechanism by which the market can be regularised and by which the role of the multiples can be put under the microscope.</p> <p>I know it can be difficult to prove whether or not alcohol is being sold below cost and the point has, correctly, been made that multiples have such a wide range of products they can afford to have loss leaders to get customers in the door and increase their footfall.  Is there clear evidence that alcohol is being sold below cost?</p></speech>

In its latest offering, dated 5 November, Tesco offers two litres of spirits for &euro;40.  In other words, one can buy two litre bottles of vodka, rum, gin and so on, for &euro;40, or &euro;20 for a litre.  The duty on that is &euro;12.45 and the VAT is &euro;2.87.  That leaves &euro;3.80 for the guy in Sweden to pick the winter wheat for the Absolut vodka, bring it in, distil it, box it, ship it through customs, send it to Ireland, give it to a wholesaler, sell it to a multiple and for the multiple to take it out of the box and put it on the shelf.  To argue that below cost selling is not taking place is a farce.</p></speech>

I have always opposed these tax increases, particularly on tobacco.  The health issue is an excuse and hypocrisy by Governments.  Health issues are serious but they should be dealt with in a different way, rather than by piling on taxes.  That is also my position with regard to the forthcoming budget.  At the same time, I am in favour of a complete ban on the advertising of legal drugs which can have very damaging effects, even though most of us take them to some degree or other.</p><p>  If there was no increase in tax on alcohol, or even if there was a decrease, which is unlikely, what is the chance of Mr. O'Keeffe's industry giving a break to the customer?  There is a huge rip-off in the pub industry on the sale of wine per glass, for example.  In an off-licence premises of one of Ms Jones's members one can buy a bottle of wine for &euro;8, but one would be charged &euro;5.50 for a glass of the same wine in many pubs.  If, conservatively, one can get five glasses from a bottle of wine, that amounts to &euro;27.50.  That is a huge rip-off of someone who is having a social drink.  If the Exchequer does not take money from the public, some element of the drinks industry will.  </p></speech>

Second, when there was an excise duty decrease three years ago, the Central Statistics Office, the independent Government statistical service, showed the reduction was passed on in full across the industry.  Third, there is a fundamental difference between buying a product to take home and buying the same product to consume in an on-trade environment.  We have to make a margin to sustain ourselves financially.  A price range is in operation in the market.  One can buy a glass of wine in a Dublin pub for between &euro;4.50 and &euro;10.  A consumer will be able to find a pub that offers a really strong price value proposition and where he or she will be happy to pay the price.</p><p>  Alcohol in the on-trade is a discretionary item.  People come to pubs because they want to.  They come because we offer a product and service that is attractive.  Not every pub is attractive to every customer, but the individual can find a pub that suits his or her needs so that we are both happy to do business.   </p></speech>

An off-licence is also a regulated environment, in that professional people are serving there.  The difference is that the product is consumed in the regulated environment of a pub, with appropriate and trained staff.  It is, clearly, different if the customer takes the product home.  That is true.</p></speech>

It is controlled from two angles.  There is control by the management and staff, and publicans take their responsibilities very seriously in this regard.  No publican wants his pub full of people drunk out of their minds.  It is not an attractive atmosphere and does not attract good regular business.  It is in the publican's own professional and business interest to control that environment.  Second, there is the social control from other customers.  Consumed socially, alcohol is very enjoyable.  A customer can meet people and have a drink and a chat.  It is a very positive thing to do.  From my perspective, representing publicans, it is the best environment in which to consume alcohol.</p></speech>

Does he accept that it is indisputable that the availability of very cheap alcohol in off-licences is directly linked to over-consumption, particularly by young people but also by people generally?</p></speech>

The prevalence of excessive drinking has emerged as a result of price promotions and the merchandising of alcohol to drive footfall into multiple mixed trading environments.  Specialist off-licences retail in a responsible manner.  They must; otherwise, they will lose their licences.  They must make margin and pay their rent, rates and staff.  They cannot afford to retail alcohol below cost or at cost.  If they do, they will go out of business.</p><p>  The manner in which alcohol has been permitted to be price promoted by mixed trading environments in the media has permitted this.  </p> <p>It is incumbent upon the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Health to bring forward their action plans.  The Commission on Taxation has stated that the impact on health and public order, among other things, must be considered.  The Department of Finance has taken action in that among EU countries, Ireland has the fourth highest excise duty on beer and spirits, the highest excise duty on sparkling wines, the third highest excise duty on wine and the second highest excise duty on cider.  Many member states have no excise duty on alcohol.  It is difficult to park a health and justice argument into a finance and taxation argument and I do not think it is right.</p></speech>

I represent a fairly rural area in Sligo and north Leitrim.  Sligo is a fairly big town but much of the area is rural.  I am very conscious that a number of pubs and off-licences have closed over recent years.  We spoke briefly about the social implications of pubs serving drink.  I also see a social benefit in having a bar in a rural area and it is a great loss when a local bar is closed.  Many rural folk may go down to the pub once a week to have a few pints, meet their neighbours and have a chat.  If that pub closes, often those people will not go out.</p><p>  It might be an over-simplification to hope that a reduction of 1% or 2% in excise duty rates, if it were envisaged, would change the situation dramatically.  Surveys have shown that people do not have enough disposable income at the end of the week and they have to make tough choices.  Increasingly, people are choosing not to go to the pub or to the off-licence.  It is quite understandable that if a person wants to buy a bottle of gin or wine, they will go to wherever they can buy it cheapest.  In my view that is rational and logical.  How does the number of licences <i>per capita</i> in Ireland compare with international figures?</p></speech>

We have done comparisons with the United Kingdom.  In simple terms, we are not as densely pubbed, so to speak, as the UK.  The UK has a deregulated system and, on a <i>per capita</i> basis, there are three times as many pubs in the UK as there are in Ireland.  In our view, Ireland is densely pubbed in that there is no shortage of pubs.  That is not a matter for debate.  Compared with the UK, however, Ireland is less densely pubbed.</p></speech>

I understand the desire of the drinks industry not to be the subject of further tax increases.  However, I am confused to hear that the consumption of alcohol is down by 20% in less than ten years.  I refer to a recent report which said the very opposite by stating that in the period 1970 to 1990, there was a doubling of alcohol consumption and that 50% of the population abstained from alcohol.  Now, only 15%, if even that, abstain from alcohol.</p></speech>

It depends on the length of the time period.  From the 1970s there was a large growth in consumption per head.  Females, who generally did not consume as much alcohol - the lady would have the glass of sherry - became almost what one might call normal drinkers.  That raised the average level per head.  It maximised at the turn of the century, in 2001, and since that year it has dropped from about 14 litres per head to just below 12 litres per head.</p></speech>

I want to deal with the nub of the issue which is the marketing, advertising and merchandising of alcohol.  The <i>quid pro quo</i> is that if the industry wants a stay on any further taxation on alcohol, it should be the promoter rather than the Government or Members of the Oireachtas who seeks containment of merchandising and advertising.  In my view, the glamorising of alcohol is where the problem lies, even more so than the price of alcohol.</p></speech>

There are three different types of outlets for the sale of alcohol.  The off-site outlet issue is far more complex, and Ms Jones made this clear in her contribution.  The big multiple retailer and the independent or family-owned chain of off-licences operate a different model, albeit with under the same rules.</p></speech>

What we are doing is facilitating the various organisations, associations and groups which made pre-budget submissions in the context of outlining their positions.  We ask that our guests do not go into detail in respect of their submissions because these have been circulated to members for their perusal.  Instead, our guests can summarise what they see as the main points of their proposals and members may then pose questions.  I invite Ms Kathleen O'Meara and Mr. Ronan Lyons to make their opening comments.</p></speech>

As the Chairman indicated, our submission has been circulated.  We have come to this budget process with a new and radical idea.  Members will be aware the Irish Heart Foundation and the Irish Cancer Society are committed to the battle against tobacco in Ireland, especially in view of the high death rate relating to smoking.  The idea we have come up with in the context of the forthcoming budget is that tobacco profits should be controlled.  The tobacco industry in Ireland is earning extraordinary profits.  These are much higher than needs to be the case and, as a result, we have an opportunity to do two things.  The first of these would be for the Government to take &euro;150 million extra from the industry, which would send a very strong signal.  We would urge that at least some of this money be spent on combating the marketing practices of the tobacco industry, on assisting those who want to quit smoking and on providing help to those who have been harmed by smoking.  Our proposal is specific in nature and it is designed to take some of the huge profits earned by the tobacco industry in Ireland.  To put it in simple terms, the Government takes 79% of the industry's profits.  The figure for the UK is 90%.</p></speech>

We are proposing a very simple solution, namely, the creation of a regulator to regulate the Irish tobacco market.  There are particular reasons we are proposing this and these are based on how the tobacco market operates in this country.  We are of the view that a regulator is necessary both in the context of taking the profits to which I refer and to regulate the market in a certain way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-08a.962" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ronan Lyons" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2012110800014#N00500"><p>My name is Ronan Lyons and I am speaking today on behalf of the Smart Taxes Network.  I will be brief because I would like to maximise the time available for questions and discussion.  Given that a property tax is on the way, we would argue strongly in favour of a tax that is based on site value rather than on a full tax.  The reason for this is that it would be better from both from the point of view of progressiveness and from the perspective of offering an economic incentive.  In addition, it will be easier to introduce.  I will not say any more than that now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-08a.963" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/990" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Lynch" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2012110800014#N00600"><p>The committee receives submissions from different groups and there would be a conflict in respect of them.  As part of its presentation and in the context of the interests of its retail members, I am sure IBEC will state that the smuggling of tobacco is increasingly becoming a problem.  If one sets aside the health issues and concentrates on the product, it is evident that there is smuggling and criminality on a massive scale and that, as a result, the Exchequer is losing huge amounts of revenue.  Further increases in the price of tobacco are merely going to compound the problem.  As Deputy Dara Murphy stated earlier in the context of price elasticity, increasing the price can often lead to unintended consequences.  Perhaps our guests might comment on that aspect.</p><p>  On the introduction of a site valuation property tax, a particular issue arises.  This relates to the position of those who own high value houses which are situated on low value land versus people who own low value houses which are situated on high value land.  How fair is Smart Taxes Network's proposal in respect of this matter?  It could be criticised because it suggests that more money be taken - in the form of a wealth tax - from those who fall into the latter of the two categories to which I refer.</p></speech>

In addition to the revenue that is being lost, cheap tobacco is being made available to young people.  In our opinion, this is keeping smoking rates among children very high.  However, there is a great deal of misinformation in respect of this matter.  We are strongly of the view that tax increases are not necessarily the driver of the problem in question.  Not many people are aware that the price of cigarettes in the UK is actually higher than it is in this country.  The cost of the premium brand of cigarette in Ireland is &euro;9.20, whereas in the UK it is &euro;9.30.  The UK authorities have been increasing the price for the past ten years on a price escalator above inflation of between 2% and 5%.  In the same period, they have cut the rate of smuggling from 21% to 9% because they are dealing with the problem.  In this country we are reducing the number of customs officers by hundreds.</p></speech>

It is also an issue relating to the activities of entrenched criminal networks as opposed to one of tax.  This is proved by the UK case.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-08a.969" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ronan Lyons" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2012110800014#N01200"><p>In the context of high value houses on low value land, this is very much a footnote to the differential effect of a full value tax compared with a site value tax.  The latter encourages people to use land well.  If we were to introduce a full value tax, we would actually punish construction activity at the very time when we need to be fostering it by encouraging retrofits and extensions.  We must encourage people to use their land well, particularly because many of them will, as a result of negative equity, be stuck on the same plot of land for the foreseeable future.  The primary effect of a site tax would assist in encouraging individuals to use their land well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-08a.970" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/990" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Lynch" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2012110800014#N01300"><p>Would it not be possible to deal with that difficulty?  One of the positive aspects of Smart Taxes Network's proposal is that it would not penalise developments or home improvements.  Other jurisdictions have vacant site registers in respect of which compound penalties apply and these ensure properties are not left vacant.  Putting in place such a register here would strengthen the Derelict Sites Act.  We could also consider imposing a property tax that would be calculated not on a per &euro;1,000 basis in respect of the value of a house but which would be calculated on the basis of &euro;25,000 or &euro;50,000 bands instead.  If one's house is worth &euro;200,000 and if one spends &euro;100,000 carrying out work on it, we know for a fact that it will not increase in value by &euro;100,000.  The value increases proportionately rather than on the basis of the amount of money spent on improvements.</p> <p>Would there not be the same outcome if there was a band based upon value?</p></speech>

The UK is stuck using 1991 values more than 20 years later.  We should put in place the simplest system that achieves the same effect.  If one wants to punish vacant lands and sites, which is already done via site-valued taxes and, as such, an extra system is unnecessary, I recommend that it be done via a per person tax credit, which would further shift the burden of taxation away from people and onto land.</p></speech>

I might take Ms O'Meara up on the idea of extracting further profits from the tobacco companies operating in Ireland.  Does such a model work elsewhere and could we emulate it?  Extracting profits is an attractive idea about which I would like to know more.  What level of profits is being earned by tobacco companies in Ireland?</p><p>  What does Mr. Lyons believe the impact will be on householders of adopting a site value tax as opposed to the Government's apparent plan, namely, a market value tax?  If the burden is being spread via a site value tax to other forms of property owners, will individual households have smaller bills?  What categories of people are captured by a site value tax that are not captured by a market value tax?</p></speech>

It is difficult to quantify the tobacco companies' profits in Ireland.  In the UK, Philip Morris and Imperial Tobacco earn 50% and 65% of turnover, respectively.</p><p>  We have done a great deal of work in devising a model specifically for Ireland.  From figures supplied through the Revenue Commissioners, we have been able to identify that the tobacco industry takes 21% of the retail price.  In the UK, that figure is much lower.  This is the gap that we are considering.  I did not have an opportunity earlier to explain how the companies have done this in an interesting way.  Generally, there is a price increase in every budget.  In recent years, that increase has been in cent.  Despite the fact that the tobacco industry approaches people such as the Deputy, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners and argues against price increases, it increases its own prices while the Government increases taxes on tobacco in the budget.  Therefore, it widens its profit take and keeps its profits high.  This fact has not been identified prior to our work.  We are looking in that direction for profit.  Normally, we would ask for a tax increase and we are not ruling it out.  Indeed, we ask that members consider a tax on hand-rolled tobacco, which is currently much lower than the tax on rolled tobacco.</p></speech>

The principal reason is that vacant development land and developed land are treated equally.  If one takes the route of a full value tax instead, it is effectively equivalent to a second bailout.  The vacant landbanks on the edges of towns would not be hit in a tax liability sense.  Their value would be increased relative to everywhere else and their owners would be given free money by the rest of society.</p><p>  An element of the impact should be stressed.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has discussed his desire for the regeneration of town centres.  A full value system would push people onto the fringes of towns and remove activity from the centre.  A site value tax would encourage people to use valuable land in the centre of towns.  This is as much a commercial as a residential point, but it holds true to the system.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, that increase hits the poorest people in society.  As the submission states, smoking is the greatest contributor to health inequalities and accounts for up to half the difference in life expectancy between the richest and the poorest groups in our society.  Is this because there is a higher level of addiction among people with lower incomes?  If so, piling additional costs on an addiction that is difficult to break places additional hardships on people who are already stretched financially.  I always vote against the Government's increases under spurious health arguments when the reality is that it wants another grab at working class people's profits.</p><p>  The executive summary of the Irish Cancer Society's provisions does not seem to refer to the advertising of tobacco, which remains prevalent in various ways.  Is this not a key area to hit?  Would it not be better to commit resources to helping people overcome this addiction without breaking their pockets?  I fully agree with hitting companies' profits up to the limit.  I am in favour of taking the companies into public ownership and, on a different basis, recognising smoking as a serious health and societal hazard.</p><p>  Be it a site value tax or a property tax, the reality is that it is another grab.  It will be a tax on the shoulders of people who are bailing out speculators and bankers all over Europe.  In many cases, people have been impoverished as a result.  The domestic economy is trashed.  Whatever form the tax takes, Mr. Lyons is in favour of placing another burden on those people.  Some of us fundamentally oppose that idea.</p></speech>

However, 58% of 18 to 29 year old women in the lowest socioeconomic groups smoke.  This figure is more than double the figure for the general population.  One in four women in those communities will die from tobacco.  It is the greatest driver of health inequality in the country and tobacco tax is every state's greatest weapon to tackle tobacco addiction.  Not only should the taxes increase, but that money should be spent on helping people to get off cigarettes.  If people can do so, they will be better off in the long run.  We view it in terms of the health savings, which are more important for the communities in question than the economic savings of continuing to smoke.</p> <p>The bigger the financial burden a tax increase places on people, the more likely they are to give up.  That has been proven by statistics.  I would not push that argument too hard but it is still a fact that this can help people to stop smoking and help them and their communities to be healthier.  It can reduce overall costs to people.</p></speech>

There is a gap between Government spending and receipts.  I would like to close that gap as fairly as possible and going after wealth is part of the solution.  Two thirds of wealth in Ireland is in real estate, with the bulk of it in land.  A site value tax would be much more progressive than another increase in income tax, as the increase in income tax would eat away at tax credits.  One cannot hide a house in Switzerland and if a person owns a large house in Ireland, it will fall under a site value tax.  The most valuable sites in Ireland are still worth up to &euro;10 million per acre, so we should get some of that publicly created value back into public hands.</p></speech>

Is it idealistic?  There are two ways for the State to extract profit from tobacco companies, which operate legal businesses in this country.  Some 79% of the total profit goes to excise or VAT.  Has there been any legal opinion as to whether it is possible for any government to engage in a profit tax that is different from income or corporation tax?  The witnesses do not have the figures but what if the State got approximately &euro;250 million from the  &euro;1.36 billion, with the retailers getting a chunk, along with people working for the companies and costs for buildings, etc.?  The tobacco companies would have a profit so has it been ascertained if it would be legal to propose to treat the profit differently than that of any other industry legally carried out in the State?</p></speech>

Political will would be required to do this, and we have seen examples of political will in this area in Ireland before.  We are not saying this is a simple request and it is not.  We have been told that it is potentially difficult in the context of the tobacco tax directive but our advice is that it can be done.  In particular, it can be done because this issue is health-related as opposed to a normal market element.  There is no question that it would be an intervention in the market but there are other examples of market intervention.  We are asking for this market intervention because tobacco harm is so considerable and there are public health issues involved that are being dealt with internationally.</p><p>  For example, the only public health international treaty concerns tobacco, namely, the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.  That is a World Health Organization treaty and Ireland is a signatory to it.  It is an unprecedented treaty in many ways and it is designed to intervene in and control relationships in particular around tobacco.  It is recognised internationally and by the Irish Government that the tobacco industry is not a normal industry and the level of harm being caused by it means that governments must take a particular view about it.  Therefore, we ask for political will to become evident.  A previous Minister responsible for health, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, took action that at the time was unprecedented in the world.</p></speech>

We conducted research on this which was published in the UK in 2010, The Case for OFSMOKE: How Tobacco Price Regulation is Needed to Promote the Health of Markets, Government Revenue and the Public.  I will leave the reference with the committee.  It states:<blockquote><br />Most governments have extensive experience in undertaking these sorts of activities and the fact that price cap regulation is used in other sectors provides sufficient evidence of its feasibility and legality under both World Trade Organization and European Union rules.</blockquote>It would be compliant with Article 3 of the Global Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

Apparently, a person can buy cigarettes on the black market at a quarter or a fifth of the price in a shop.  A shop may charge &euro;10 for a packet of cigarettes that is sold for &euro;2 or &euro;3 on the black market.  That is a major incentive for crime, as the Chairman mentioned.  The penalties for bringing in cigarettes illegally are absurdly low.  These products arrive in 40-foot containers and not handbags or suitcases.  If the shippers could be fined &euro;100,000 or &euro;250,000, they would be more careful about the cargo taken on board and prevent illegal products from using their ships.  It is not for me to ask some questions and if I am lucky, some journalist might pick up on the issue.  As part of the presentation, the witnesses should articulate the answers and help us make them a reality.</p><p>  With regard to Mr. Lyons's comments, I agree that a site value tax is the way to get optimum use from land and resources in an economy.  If it is introduced at a low level, it could be done fairly.  I have not seen practical worked examples of how people would have to complete a form or valuation on a self-assessed basis.  We have been told that a decision has been taken and the Government wants to collect this through the Revenue Commissioners.  That is a given unless there are strong reasons for this not to be the case.  Perhaps it should.  How can we get a simple form together so people can provide their own self-assessment?</p></speech>

A site value tax relates to the income generation capacity of any site, either in the form of rental for a house, office block or factory.  There should be a sensible economic connection with the piece of physical land, and it would be a fair basis for starting the collection of a tax.  If there is income from land, there is an ability to pay tax from the income.</p></speech>

The fundamental point Retail Excellence Ireland, REI, would like to make is that the Minister for Finance let many retailers down in the most recent budget when he announced that the Government would not act on the matter of upward-only rents, a subject the Chairman worked tirelessly on, having pledged that it would.  The one good thing that came out of the Budget Statement was the application of guidelines to insist that the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, would engage with vulnerable tenants and potentially reduce rents.  We meet NAMA officials every six weeks and they are doing that.  They have reduced rents in the majority of cases for vulnerable tenants.  We would like those guidelines to be applied to other State landlords in the upcoming budget such as the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, which is currently increasing rents for tenants in Cork, and local authorities, which are forcing through rent increases on top of untenable rents.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-08a.1013" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Patricia Callan" time="11:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2012110800017#Q00500"><p>Essentially we have two key principles in our budget submission this year.  The first is that the budget ensures businesses can retain and create jobs.  The way to do that is not to increase the cost of doing business.  Second, we need measures to support the restoration of consumer confidence in the domestic market.  With regard to the cost of employment, the budget is all about the threats rather than necessarily what we want in it.  The kites that have been flown so far have destroyed investment and expansion in the interim because people are so worried about measures such as employer's PRSI increasing, mandatory pension provision and the transfer of four weeks of sick pay onto employers.  Anything that adds to the cost of hiring somebody will militate against employers creating jobs in exactly the same fashion as the slashing of the redundancy rebate last year killed off the transfer of businesses.  One cannot buy a business now because the risks are too high.  We want the Government to job-proof all policies and to make an assessment of the impact on jobs of the implementation of various measures.  That is the key and critical message.  We have many tax proposals in the submission that might help small businesses, in particular in the area of finance and improving cashflow, and I can take questions about those, but the key message is not to increase costs.</p></speech>

Similar measures are needed for IBRC and other State-owned properties.  In the submission, REI is seeking the establishment of a stimulus group that would encourage citizens to apply for seasonal and temporary positions within the retail sector.  Could he elaborate on that?</p></speech>

Basically the retail industry used to employ more than 300,000 people and when the recession came, this reduced to a skeleton full-time staff of 255,000.  That means when the seasonal peak arrives at Christmas, there is a necessity to hire many more temporary employees than we used to.  It is our contention that between 30,000 and 35,000 will be employed this Christmas.  The problem our members have is it is challenging to make these appointments because people on social welfare find it a challenge to get back on welfare when the work finishes.  It takes six to eight weeks for them to resume their welfare payments and they are bereft of cash to live off during that period.  Thus, they will not take advantage of the opportunity to work temporarily and that is a concern.  We need to build a flexible social welfare system that fits today's environment, not yesterday's where we all had jobs for life.</p></speech>

I did a piece of work on this that I will send to the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation separately about direct member experience.  It is not just in this area.  It relates to the general principle of how the welfare system works.  We need to move to an hour-based system.  The reality is our system derives from the concept of the five-day week.  Most businesses operate a seven-day week and, for example, nursing homes need people for a few hours in the morning and a few in the afternoon.  The system, therefore, needs to be redesigned in the sense that it should not hamper anyone to take up employment.  Signing on or off should be fluid.  If the welfare system can be integrated more directly with the Revenue, given employers are supplying Revenue with the relevant information when they set up employees on the tax system, it should be a simple process to offset one against the other to ensure people do not lose out.  However, seasonal sectors such as the fishing industry present huge problems in terms of practical details.  Even where up to three months' work is available, there is no incentive for people to take it up.</p></speech>

Mr. Fitzsimons said that progress is being made on the guidelines as they apply to NAMA properties and that is welcome given the ban on upward-only rent reviews will not be extended to existing leases.  How widespread is the problem of State-owned institutions such as the banks being difficult in renegotiating rent for tenants?  I am aware of the IBRC case in Cork.  Are there cases where the intransigence of these State bodies has cost jobs or has the potential to cost many jobs?</p><p>  The timing of the budget has been the subject of comment recently.  The Christmas period is a critical time for REI members because so many of their sales are achieved during that period.  Is there is an optimum time for the Budget Statement?  Should it be brought forward by a number of weeks to give people a clearer run into Christmas or should it be put back to the new year?</p><p>  The key issue for Ms Callan and the SFA is no increase in the cost of employment.</p> <p>I attended one of the briefings in the audio-visual room in Leinster House that addressed the sick pay scheme and employer PRSI.  It is unfortunate that both schemes fall within the Department of Social Protection, given the enormous adjustment that Department must put through in the forthcoming budget.  Can the witnesses crystallise the impact of the measures?  People in business are very scared that either or both measures will fly in some shape or form.  What would be the impact on existing businesses and their potential to take on new staff?</p></speech>

People plan their gifts for loved ones and, more importantly, people decide to buy cars in November and December and then collect them in January.  The most preferable date is the lowest ebb in the economic cycle in the retail context, which is February and early March.  If we are ploughing ahead with austerity, as we must, it would make sense to do so at the quietest period in the cycle rather than at its peak.  Speculation, kite flying and discussion about austerity measures leads to people being frozen with fear.</p><p>  The State as a landlord is not a major issue because most landlords are private entities.  The Minister for Finance mandated NAMA to engage with tenants and it is now the largest landlord of any type in the country.  We urge committee members, the Department of Finance and the Minister to apply the guidelines if they make good sense.  Vulnerable tenants need the guidelines.  Why not apply them to other State landlords?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-08a.1021" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Patricia Callan" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2012110800018#R00300"><p>Specifically on the topic of job creation, a survey of our members showed 46% thought the biggest barrier to job creation was not enough business and 33% said it was cost.  These are the top issues for people thinking about whether to create jobs.  In the context of the budget, we need to move it out of peak business cycles and have uncertainty squashed fairly fast.  One of our five key messages is not only to have an annual budget but to know what will hit us over the coming three years.  Uncertainty kills decision making.  If it is bad news and people know about it, they can decide to invest and plan accordingly.  It is critical to the restoration of confidence.</p><p>  With regard to cost, people are struggling to pay wages at the end of the week so anything that increases costs will militate against their decisions to hire people.  One particular example concerns the redundancy rebate reducing from 60% to 15%.  If someone with 20 years service was eligible for the maximum of &euro;600 per week, the overall redundancy payment amounts to &euro;24,600 and, under current rules, the company must come up with an additional &euro;11,070.  For every person the company was going to make redundant, it must now get rid of two people because the bank will not supply money to fund redundancies.  There is no incentive for people on the margin to continue to trade or to sell a business.  It makes people go into the insolvency fund.  It is nonsense and was not thought through.  The approach of the Department of Social Protection concerns its own budget.  We need a whole of Government perspective.  There is no point in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation writing an action plan for jobs with 200 good ideas when, in one fell swoop, negative decisions wipe out that good.  That is why we need consensus.</p><p>  I have never taken so many calls and e-mails from our members about any single issue as about the sick pay issue.  They cannot understand it.  In the case of our nearest neighbours, Northern Ireland, people are paid at half the rate here.  Employers there pay the sum in the first instance but reclaim the amount through the income tax system.  It will also put us at a competitive disadvantage.  Across Europe, there is no consistency in systems in terms of clarity, despite the Minister's comments.  The briefing arranged by the Minister had experts flown in from the UK who spent two years analysing this, including consultation, examining medical issues, the problem of certification, and systems and cost problems, and they decided not to change the system because of the recession and the dramatic negative impact it would have on businesses and growth.  Ireland has done no analysis, despite the Minister's promise of a cost-benefit analysis.  The Minister promised she would exempt small companies up to 100 employees, which was promptly revoked by her officials.  In this malaise of uncertainty, people are making decisions and have stopped creating jobs because they are worried about what will happen.</p></speech>

I had a number of retail units and I come from a small business background.  I am sympathetic to the witnesses.  Having said that, it is important to note the Government has reduced PRSI in its brief term in office.  In international terms Ireland is going up the charts as a place to do business.  In comparison with many of our competitors, Ireland is now a cheaper place to conduct business.  Commercial rates have not increased over recent years, with the exception of a couple of local authorities.  Although the witnesses refer to destroying investment, despite the extremely difficult economic climate, the economy is experiencing modest growth.  We should all be more careful in our language and when using terms like "destroying".  I accept there are difficulties for people in the retail sector and we are hopeful improvements in foreign direct investment will trickle down to small business, which is the natural order of things.</p><p>  Last week, representatives from the banks appeared before the committee in an extraordinary session and there was significant questioning about how banks are dealing with small businesses and lending.</p></speech>

There have been PRSI exemption schemes to support companies hiring long-term unemployed people and those coming off JobBridge.  The problem with the schemes is that they have been underused relative to their value.  Small companies are not tax experts and the scheme does not really resonate.  One of the proposals, which is under discussion, is that it should be simplified.  The proposal should be to give businesses &euro;1,000 or &euro;2,000 to take people on.  This is plain language and is why measures such as the special savings incentive account scheme worked all those years ago.  That would be better than the tax system.  In real terms, we have experienced nothing but increased taxation on labour.  The marginal tax rate for self-employed people is 55% and 52% for employees, which is one of the highest in Europe.  It is a deterrent and we should be incentivising people to work.  A tax on labour is a disincentive to work.</p><p>  We welcome the reduction of business costs but it is mainly in the private sector.  Government-imposed charges and fees have increased.  It is business to business negotiation that has seen the benefit.  It is no great feat that commercial rates have been frozen when rents have dropped by 20% or 30% in real terms.  Rates have not dropped to the same extent even though we have years of deflation.  There was no deflation in rates.  The whole system is unfair.  Why is the business community paying for the public good?  It is not receiving a service in return.  The whole system must be completely revisited and we are disappointed that, in the programme for Government, even if the &euro;500 million of efficiencies in local authorities is achieved, it will do nothing to help businesses.  Instead, it will offset the central Government contribution.  The proposal is not to split it equally with ratepayers so rates will remain the same.</p><p>  Members may be aware of the revaluation process at present, which will take ten to 15 years to get around the country.  The process will impose extra challenges and people and result in bills increasing by 20% or 30% depending on location.</p><p>  In terms of access to finance, we have proposed seven measures-----</p></speech>

To do that, we need to reduce business costs.  We need to realign our domestic economy costs to equate to current market demand, which is dissipated.</p><p>  Rates have been mentioned.  I am aware that it would be a challenge to reduce rates.  They are currently increasing because of revaluation.  Anyone in a primary location, such as a high street or shopping centre where all the retailers are, is facing increases in the revaluation process.  It is fundamental that ratepayers receive a service.  We have been arguing this for a long time and we launched the Town &amp;amp; City Management Framework, a way of managing towns.  Many retailers are happy to pay the same rates but they want the same service one gets in a shopping centre.  They want a secure and safe environment, fair and equitable car parking and a good vibrant retail mix that engages with customers.  </p><p>  In Dublin city, the ratepayers want to pay more.  They are willing to participate in a bid to pay more rates if they are assured of the delivery of services that will, in turn, increase consumer demand because customers will want to come into a safe and engaging space.</p></speech>

Small enterprises and self-employed people, along with workers, are its foremost victims.  It puzzles me why her organisation continually pushes a policy that will further eviscerate the domestic economy.  In her submission, for example, she shows herself to be in favour of the impoverishment of young people who cannot find jobs.  For people under 25, she proposes a weekly dole of &euro;55.  She complains that social welfare benefits are too high.  What does she want?  Does she want a slave population that will work for nothing for her members, or for employers generally?  Is that the policy of her organisation?</p><p>  She has called, again and again, for a property tax and a water tax on ordinary householders.  Here, she is at one with the Government which speaks in terms of broadening the tax base, as a cover-up for a grab for hundreds of euro more that many people simply cannot afford, as if there was a pot of gold hidden under every house that can be reached into to pay this tax.  </p><p>  She recommends a tax of &euro;400 which can go from that up to &euro;1,000.  With regard to water, the ESRI and other agencies want a combined tax of &euro;1,300 per annum, which will mean new taxes on top of ordinary people.  This will cut down people's ability to buy the services of Ms Callan's people.  There is a fundamental contradiction in her position.</p></speech>

We are where we are.  No one wants to be here but we are borrowing &euro;1 billion a month to fund our public services.  Given that position, we must make choices.  In our analysis, as Mr. Ronan Lyons has said, property tax is the least damaging to economic development and growth.  The only way we are going to exit this crisis is by growth and by allowing businesses to get on with their jobs and try to create more jobs.  I hope we will all agree on that.  Our position is not incongruous.  It is about hard choices.  In making those choices, we accept that it will take money out of people's pockets and we do not want that to happen.  It has to happen somewhere, however, and it is better that we tax assets, and a property tax is a wealth tax.  </p><p>  With regard to our analysis of the social welfare bill, it is a reality that we got carried away during the Celtic tiger years.  The Department of Social Protection's statistical information on social services for 2010 states that the rates of short-term payments had increased by 80.5% in 2010 on a baseline of 2001.  During that time the consumer price index, CPI, went up by 21.7%.  Our social welfare rates went up at four times the cost of living.  They are completely out of line with international trends.  We certainly do not have a slave population.  We have the second highest minimum wage in Europe, which is something our members are having to deal with.</p><p>  Our analysis of youth unemployment is based on a UK model of trying to incentivise people who have never had a job to go and find work.  Schemes such as JobBridge have been successful, but JobBridge could be much more successful.  Some 2,000 of the internships that were advertised attracted no applicants.  We have an issue with making work attractive and encouraging people.  While I accept that there are not enough jobs for everyone, there is a mismatch that we need to get to the bottom of.  This has to do with delivering on Pathways to Work and the Department of Social Protection engaging better with employers.  We all have a common aim, which is to exit the crisis and to have a better life for all our people.  The way to do that is to give someone a job, rather than leave them floundering on welfare.</p></speech>

I am not saying there should not be any cuts, but I question whether there might be taxes.  In order to pay a contribution for a service one has to have income.  Income is the flow out of which taxes can be paid.  When everything is in balance, as Mr. Ronan Lyons said in the previous submission, one can have a tax from the notional income that comes from owning sites or land, depending on whether the land is residential, commercial, retail or whatever.  When in balance, an economy can put a demand on the owners of land for a contribution towards the general purse.  When, however, the revenues of the State have suffered a sudden drop off a precipice and when expenditure is way above revenue, one has to look to revenue, temporarily, as bridging financing for the readjustment programme in order to maintain fairness as well as take a reality check, to use Ms Callan's own words.</p><p>  There is income.  We know this from having asked the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners.  A high incomes levy on incomes of &euro;120,000 and over would produce &euro;520 million.  A corporation tax uplift of 2.5% on the headline rate-----  </p></speech>

Can I draw your attention to their presentations?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-08a.1035" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1027" speakername="Peter Mathews" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2012110800019#S00900"><p>I am asking why they both make the same point.  Here is a reason for suggesting their presumption is misplaced.  They say it in two lines in both submissions.  The submissions contain some good points about supporting investment and jobs through the tax system.  Points Nos. 1, 2 and 3 under that heading are imaginative, creative and realistic.</p><p>  I come back, however, to the fundamental point that one should not presume that taxes cannot provide the short-term three year bridging financing to carry &euro;1.25 billion of the readjustment programme without hurting the economy, as Deputy Joe Higgins has said.  The indigenous economy, GNP, is worth &euro;130 billion while GDP is &euro;150 billion or more.  The one that everyone in Europe talks about is GDP but this country is, realistically, on GNP.  For our 250,000 employees, it is GNP that counts.  We must get this message across to people listening in from abroad.  It is not happening.  They do not understand the household and business debt burdens on our society.</p> <p>That is why the proposal about the cash receipts basis being increased is very clever, because the small businesses cannot get the liquidity to pay their VAT bills due to the volatility of their incomes.  Well done, but I urge the witnesses to think about it and not to be afraid.  I have asked the chief executives of the multinational corporations about corporation tax.  They would not blink if the rate went from 12.5% to 15%, and that would yield &euro;670 million.</p></speech>

It is correct that when we frame these conversations we must be cognisant of the catastrophe that has happened in the sector.  It would not be fair to do otherwise.</p><p>  With regard to the budgetary process, we met the troika and it was quite shocked at how long the process is in Ireland.  It really starts in July when the discussions begin in public.  Many of the sector's issues focus on cost base.  That is logical because it is an item that could be under the control of the State.  Obviously, demand has collapsed so I would like to hear more from the witnesses about how to stimulate demand in the economy.  On jobs retention, Germany has a system under which viable companies can put in a proposal whereby over a small period of time, perhaps a year or 18 months, they get some level of support from the state to help them keep their employees employed.  That stops after the specified period.</p><p>  There is a view that the issue of upward-only rent reviews is dead and buried, but there are possibilities.  We could legislate for a reduction in the length of rental contracts.  I understand that rental contracts in this State are far longer than the European average.  A reduction of those rental contracts would allow for the frozen high rents to come to an end sooner, which would be in everybody's interest.</p><p>  Have the witnesses considered the idea of a progressive rates base, whereby the rates take is not changed but the balance of who pays the rates changes?  In other words, a small firm that is not making a profit would pay slightly lower rates than a large multinational that is making a larger profit.  Therefore, typically a rate would be based upon the type and size of the business as well as taking into consideration the profitability of the business.</p><p>  What are the witnesses' views on those issues?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-08a.1038" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Fitzsimons" time="12:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2012110800020#T00300"><p>To take the latter point first, I disagree with rates based on profit.  There would be an inherent motivation to not be the best.  It would be rewarding the unprofitable.  In retail, the most progressive, forward thinking retailers are commonly the most profitable.  Indeed, last Saturday evening, we, along with the President of Ireland, interviewed the winner of the store of the year, who has hired many people over recent years despite the recession.  He is a good retailer.  I do not wish that guy to be incentivised with lower rates if he becomes unprofitable.  The fundamental issue with rates, regardless of how they are structured, is that we get service.  One pays a service charge in shopping centres.  There are weekly and monthly service charge meetings, accounts are put up on the board, everybody has their say and they decide what the shopping centre will do.  They spend the money and do it transparently.  Currently, we have these beautiful big glass boxes called local authority buildings sitting in county towns, but there is very little transparency.  There is a parade to announce the fact that the path was slightly improved or a bit of damage was rectified, but they are not dealing with vacancy, dereliction, street lighting or crime.  Next week, the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, our organisation, Chambers Ireland and the County and City Managers' Association are coming together to devise a way forward for our town centres.  Hopefully, through that type of national representation we will motivate stakeholders locally to engage with their local authority and put some plans together to re-engage with customers.  Regardless of who pays the rates, if the rates are wasted we are fooling ourselves and wasting time.</p></speech>

That is fundamental.  From the business community's perspective in terms of stimulating our investment and looking at expansion, notwithstanding the absence of customers there are the problems of credit and credit flow that were mentioned earlier.  To refer back to the tax measures that could help, we believe it is important to introduce a roll-over type of relief in the budget whereby we can incentivise entrepreneurs who sell a business to reinvest in another business.  That will help in terms of investment finance for new start-ups, which will be critical for creating an enterprise culture as we move forward.  We propose moving to a VAT cash receipts basis.  We understand that moving from &euro;1 million to &euro;2 million is no problem with the EU and can be done straight away.  It would massively impact and help companies with their cashflow, which would allow them to invest more which, hopefully, will build confidence.</p><p>  We also believe there should be specific examination of releasing personal pensions.  It is ironic that when owner managers put money into a pension pot when they could afford it, they were allowed to invest in property and equity but not in business.  It is an absurd system.  Either changing the system or allowing the early release of those non-essential funds is critically important.  From the business community's perspective in terms of confidence, it is very much about its ability to invest and expand.  For customers, it is about messaging, clarity and knowing where we are going, which is somewhat unclear.</p></speech>

I will send it to the committee so the members will have the details.</p><p>  On the CEBs, it is fundamentally flawed logic.  It will cause serious damage and our major concern is that there has been no attempt to ask the end user, the business person or the person who is thinking about setting up a business, what they want from the service.  It is all about internal wrangling and moving things out of one Department and into another, with no end user in sight.  It needs to be seriously examined.</p></speech>

It is largest private sector employer with 255,000 people employed, yet we do not have any transparent leadership in the Government for that industry.  If we wish to talk about rent, we must go to the Department of Justice and Equality, in the case of rates it is the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, for labour issues it is the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation or the Department of Social Protection and for e-commerce it is the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</p></speech>

I welcome Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy from Social Justice Ireland and Mr. Tom McDonnell from TASC and thank them for appearing before the committee. Rather than go into the budgetary submissions and give full presentations on them, it is an opportunity for the delegates to identify one or two points the would wish to raise with committee members and also it is an opportunity for members to tease out some of the concepts in the proposal in greater detail.  I welcome you to the committee.  I will begin by asking Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy about his proposal on property tax, where he stated that he is in favour of the site valuation model as opposed to the valuation model.  There are arguments for and against this, one of which is that the site valuation model does not provide the type of gatekeeping that a true valuation model would have.  For example, in the early 1990s if a person was earning &euro;35,000 his or her house would, perhaps, have been worth &euro;50,000.  People saw their house values increase to &euro;200,000 to &euro;300,000 but their salary did not increase with it.  There would have been an immediate question as to the level of taxation on people's property not meeting that of their income.  I would like to hear more on that issue.</p><p>  The universal pension system was also mentioned.

The most important thing I would like to say to the committee is that at the core of any issue around budget is the question of consistency in government policy, what might be called coherence in government policy.  What I am saying is that the Government should not have a series of policies that are working in different directions.  For example, the most important issue that needs to be addressed within the overall budget context is to face up to the fact that the current set of proposals on the budgetary adjustment aimed at producing a borrowing reduction of &euro;3.5 billion in 2013 is not a consistent or coherent position.  The reason being that the way it is set up, there is a ratio of almost 2:1, that is &euro;2 in cuts for every &euro;1 in tax increases.  If the Government persists with that policy it will not be able to meet other objectives, such as protecting vulnerable people or core public services, whether those services are delivered by the State, the private sector or the community and voluntary sector or combinations of one, two or three of those.  That is not doable if the Government continues to move in that direction.</p><p>  Another point about the same issue is that the overall low tax take in Ireland is not sustainable given the commitments the Government is already engaged in on a range of fronts.  One the one side, the Government is trying to reduce borrowing which is desirable and has to be done.  On the other side it is trying to ensure public services are maintained and delivered at a frequency and capacity that people require.  People are trying to provide those services and maintain what is available with far less of a tax take than any other country in a similar position.  One might say the Government is trying to deliver European Union levels of service with American levels of taxation and I do not believe that is possible.  In that context what is needed is more coherence and consistency in policy. What we would be looking at therefore is the service levels that people want and how they are to be delivered, the level of social protection and so on.  We also need to consider what is possible in terms of a fair taxation system and if there is a shortfall of a certain amount how then can those services be delivered.  Does the tax take have to be increased or do we have to find other ways of doing it?  The point is that there should not be an attempt to do the impossible.</p><p>  I wish to make one other reservation and then respond to the two questions.  Social Justice Ireland is strongly of the view that Ireland cannot get itself out of its present predicament without getting a serious break on the debt issue and that does not mean extending it, unless for 20 years, such as getting a bond and paying it in 20 years time.  That is not the way to go unless one goes with the Karl Whelan proposal that we pay it all back in 3.1 billion years at the rate of &euro;1 per year, with the interest to be paid at the end.  Clearly it is a rather facetious proposal but it is trying to make a simple point that it is not possible with Ireland's current levels of debt, which are rising, to get ourselves out of this spiral.</p> <p>We also need jobs.  Without investment there will be no jobs at any scale.  Without sufficient jobs there will not be recovery.  Without recovery, we will be stuck in this austerity for the foreseeable future.  Those issues are on the broader budgetary table which maybe we are not dealing with because we are just dealing with the taxation issue here, but the taxation issue feeds into that.  We would be proposing, for example-----</p></speech>

All of the proposals are in the document.</p><p>  The Chairman asked me about the universal pension proposal.  What we are doing is straightforward enough.  We are proposing that the Government does two things in the budget.  On the one side it should offer tax relief at the standard rate for pension contributions so that it is no longer available at 41%.  At the moment some 80% of pension contribution tax breaks go to top 20% of earners.  Therefore the richest 20% in the country get 80% benefit from the tax break.  For the sake of consistency in policy, coherence and trying to benefit everybody, it would be much more sensible to stop that, make it available at the 20% rate for everybody and use the money not to write off debt but to create a universal pension.  At the moment there is a need for that type of initiative.  Some 46,000 women in Ireland do not have a right to a pension of any kind and never will.  This is an issue that has been ignored by successive governments for three decades.  It is an historical issue about how pensions developed in Ireland.  People never got into the system or were taken out of the system going back to the times of the marriage bar and such like.  The 46,000 women would be covered in this because it would be universal.  Everybody at 66 years of age would get-----</p></speech>

We would scrap the non-contributory old-age pension and everybody over the age of 66 would get the level of the contributory old-age pension.  In no case would anybody get only part of the contributory pension, which is happening to many people because they have not made sufficient contributions over their working life, have not been in the system for long enough or for whatever the reason bars them from getting full payment.  That is a fairer system and is a redistribution from the top 20% throughout the system, picking up the holes and closing them off.  That is what we would do with the universal pension.</p><p>  On property tax, we favour a site value tax.  The easiest way to calculate it is by paying a tax on the basis of the services that have been put into the site by the taxpayer in the first place.  For example, if a particular area has many services, then the site value has been increased dramatically by the taxpayer putting money into that area.  Another geographical area might have little or no taxpayers support put in.  In such cases we believe the site value has not been enhanced by the public purse.  For example, somewhere near the Custom House-----</p></speech>

All the other public services including sewerage and water services are supplied.  Therefore a considerable amount of tax money went into the development of that property.  What does someone living close to Mullaghanish near Ballyvourney have?  The State does not supply water there.  Although there might be electricity, there is no public transport - there might be a bus once a day but people need to get themselves down to the village.  With all the supports and taxpayer investment that has gone into it, that part of Dublin 1 is obviously quite different from a rural place that has had very little investment.

For consistency with the Government's position we have decided rather than necessarily implicit support for stating that a budge adjustment of &euro;3.5 billion is the appropriate amount, we have to the greatest extent possible attempted to adhere to the Government's triple lock although not fully.  In proposing our composite set of proposals to an adjustment of &euro;3.5 billion we have considered the wide body of empirical literature and radical literature as to which types of tax have which types of effects.  These include long-term effects, short-term effects, sustainability, efficiency, social justice, equity and so on.  We have considered all of these issues and it is in that context that we make our proposals.</p><p>  I echo Dr. Healy's points on debt sustainability and the need for a deal on the banking debt, but we can come back to that.  The Chairman asked me specifically about the property tax.  The evidence is very clear.  Recurrent, as opposed to transaction, tax on immovable property is the most efficient and sustainable tax over the long-term.  If properly designed, it can be equitable.  For example a recurrent tax, which is a flat tax, such as the one that is in place at the moment is of course not equitable.  It is a question of how the system is designed and to what extent waivers are given and so on.  We advocate having no waivers and rather having an ability-to-pay-based deferral system.  This ensures the integrity of the funding or revenue source over the long term because it will eventually accrue to the Exchequer in the form of capital acquisitions tax being supplemented by a<i> lien</i> on the house or as part of the subsequent transactions.  Therefore it is sustainable over the longer term and because it is a known resource coming in over the longer term, the bond markets and everybody else can regard that revenue as being stable, which is not true in the case of, for example, stamp duty.</p><p>  We picked a tax which is market-based in the short term but have given great consideration to the concept of a land or a site valuation tax over the long-term.  Ultimately the current market value of the asset is the amount a buyer will pay for it rather than some notional value which will be subjective pending rezonings and so forth.  Dr. Healy spoke about the services provided and of course the market value will reflect the services in the area, whether it be a Luas line, motorways, shops and so forth.  Therefore a property in Ballyvourney which is identical in every way to a property in Ballsbridge except for location will be valued at a much lower price because of the amenities available in Ballsbridge.  As property prices increase and decrease, it will obviously impact on the revenue to the State, but because the value of tax increases as the price of the property increases, it acts as a dampening effect, both up and down, on the fluctuations in property prices over the medium and long-term thereby helping to prevent future crises.  Nevertheless the advantages of the site valuation system are also very enticing.  We have proposed that it should be a 0.35% levy which should apply to all residential properties except for those for social housing, for housing homeless people and so on.</p> <p>It should be universal and there should be horizontal equity.  While everyone should pay, people in defined situations such as mortgage arrears or whose combined household and child care costs exceed a particular proportion of their household income resulting in it going below a certain level would qualify for a deferral.  The 0.35% rate was decided on in the larger context of identifying particular forms of taxation to provide a sustainable tax base over the long term.  It is our position, based upon the evidence, that these types of taxes are the least damaging to employment, growth and sustainability over the medium and long term and should, therefore, be substantial.  For example, a tax of 0.35% on a house worth &euro;200,000 would be &euro;700.  This would be deferred in respect of a person experiencing mortgage arrears, based on his or her inability to pay.</p></speech>

I would like to focus for a minute on the property tax.  I do not agree with the notion of a site valuation tax.  Support for or against it is, I suppose, based on one's general experience.  There is usually a nice social mix of housing in rural villages.  Often there could be one large house, built by a professional who had the means to do so, next door to a more modest house which meets the needs of its occupants and is on a site of the same value as the large house.  For this reason, I would be concerned about concentrating our focus on a site valuation tax.  I am interested in hearing Dr. Sean Healy's view, given his understanding of social mix and the dispersal of population, on how a site valuation tax might work negatively in this regard.  While it may not necessarily lead to ghettoisation, it could impact negatively on the way in which rural parts of Ireland nicely knit together.  I believe the tax would be better reflected on the property rather than the site.</p></speech>

In my view, people would benefit from whatever services were available and would have to provide the other services that are not available.  Where there are different types of houses because some people had more money than others that is another issue.  There are other ways of dealing with that, namely, an income or wealth tax or a combination of both on people with higher income who have built the larger homes which are worth more.</p><p>  What we attempted to do was to link the tax with what has already been done with taxpayers' money.  The services provided in a village or town will be of a particular level, with variations from place to place.  The smaller the town or village, the more likely it is there will be fewer public services available because less money will have been invested in service provision there.  In that context, it would appear to us that a site value tax would be fair.  I do not believe it would have any real ghettoisation effect.</p></speech>

However, I believe basing it on market value is probably less susceptible over the long term to the creation of the type of effect that a site valuation tax would have.  That is not to suggest I believe that would happen.  Nevertheless, it is a greater risk.  Ultimately, basing the tax on the value of the wealth asset - the property, be it principle or private - should be the basic system employed.  It is possible to have a maximum cap in terms of the proportion of income a person would pay.  Again, we would advocate that that would be a parity, ability to pay and deferral system.  While over the longer term the risks <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> ghettoisation or gentrification do appear, unfortunately every tax and public service created has a behavioural effect on the economy.  There is no doubt about that.  There are winners, losers and unintended consequences, as evidenced from some of the property based tax reliefs over the past decade, which relate to other factors.</p><p>  We are calling for the tax to be introduced in this year's budget and to apply from next year.  It needs to be done quickly and at a reasonably high level and should probably be increased in future years.  Ultimately, from an economic efficiency perspective and from an equity point of view, we believe the evidence favours the type of model we are proposing. </p></speech>

I would like to make one brief observation.  The essence of our non-contributory pension is its universality.  In comparative terms across the European Union, in particular the eurozone area, it is quite generous.</p><p>  Like Deputy Dooley, I am not convinced by the site valuation tax model.  Perhaps Mr. McDonnell will respond to following matter, which goes to the core of social justice.  It has been suggested that people in social housing would be exempt from whatever type of property tax is introduced.  I am aware, as I am sure are other members, of areas where there is a mix of private and social housing.  In many cases the people in social housing who have far more disposable income than those in private housing who are faced with paying mortgages and so on.  Perhaps Mr. McDonnell will say how he arrived at the rationale for an exemption for such a large block of housing in the State, namely, the social housing block.</p></speech>

What we specifically called for is an exemption for social housing and group residential facilities used exclusively for certain specific purposes such as the provision of housing facilities for the homeless.  Perhaps I did not make that clear in my earlier remarks.  We are not calling for an exemption in respect of all social housing.  We are speaking specifically about residential facilities which are used for designated purposes.  We are conscious of equity issues.  TASC is a think-tank, whose<i> raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> is economic equality in the context of efficiency and so on.  Therefore, we believe it should be the market value of the wealth asset that is taxed.  We should, because these are immovable assets as opposed to certain other types of assets which because of capital controls are easy to move off-shore, focus on these assets, at least for now.  I agree with Deputy Murphy about the universality principle.  There should be no waivers rather deferrals only should be permitted, which eventually come due.</p></speech>

Where a person's housing and child care costs exceed a particular amount, in terms of the housing costs being associated with mortgage borrowings, this would have to be taken into account in the context of the deferral system.  This is set out in our submission to the interdepartmental group.  Broadly speaking, this is the only sustainable system that can be maintained.  On the issue of people losing properties and so on, that arguably requires a different set of policies, which are not fiscal policies.</p> <p>It has more to do with personal insolvency and other areas.</p></speech>

We are speaking about a non-means tested old age pension which would be paid to everybody at the same level and which would be at the level of the contributory old age pension.  There is an illusion that everybody in Ireland is entitled to a pension at least equivalent to the non-contributory old age pension.  This is not true.  Many people receive a partial payment in their contributory old age pension and they are not in a position to claim on a means tested basis to get the balance through the non-contributory system.  A total of 46,000 women receive nothing because they have no entitlement to a pension under any heading.  They can make a claim for the non-contributory pension if they do not have enough income to live - whatever the basic parameters are for this at any time - but they do not have a right to it as such.  It is means tested and if they have means or notional means, they do not receive it.  We are in favour of a universal payment.</p><p>  The question was asked that if people in social housing have more money available than people in other housing, why should they not have to pay a property tax.  My approach is that they should pay tax in another way.  If they have more disposable money available than other people, it is not because of their welfare payments, because these payments are already below the poverty line.  In most cases a welfare payment does not provide enough to live life with dignity.  It is not sufficient to provide the level of income required for a minimally adequate standard of living.  Research carried out by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice shows this to be the case.  If the people have money from other sources, this money should be open to taxation in other ways.</p></speech>

I presume he is also in favour of a water tax, which will increase this amount to &euro;1,000 or &euro;1,300.  From where is this sacred text about property tax and broadening the tax base coming?  It is as if every household has a hidden pot of gold it can pull from under the floorboards and pay as property tax.  In fact, it will come from the same place as income tax and VAT, which is the take-home pay of working people.  I find extraordinary Mr. McDonnell's proposals for a deferral if people are on low incomes or unemployed.  Take the generation on 35 or 40 year mortgages as a result of the extortion and racketeering which went on in the property market and of which they were victims when they needed to buy a home to start a family.  For the past ten years they have paid extortionate rates.  Perhaps they must move on to an interest only arrangement with the bank for the next ten years, after which they may barely be able to afford the payments again.  At the end of all this, thousands or perhaps tens of thousands of a tax will have mounted up.  I must put it to Mr. McDonnell that this is extraordinary.</p><p>  I agree with much of what Dr. Healy's organisation, Social Justice Ireland, has said, but he is opting for a site tax which would also be on the family home.  The home does not earn an income.  It costs money to keep.</p></speech>

One of the advantages of this system is that the tax burden is lower during a time of high unemployment and low incomes throughout the economy and rises at stronger periods.  Property is wealth, and this would be a wealth tax.  I regard a wealth tax as very much a progressive measure.  For too long we have had a dysfunctional tax system.  The amount of revenue brought in by the State is far beneath the levels sufficient to generate western European standards of public services, which I assume Deputy Higgins supports.  Therefore the question is how this is paid for and who pays for it.  Wealth as opposed to income only must be a component of this.  It is the least damaging to employment and efficiency.  The question then is how this is done.  One begins by taxing immovable property in a universal system which acknowledges that those on low incomes and suffering from mortgage arrears difficulties are exempted for a period.  If they remain in difficulty for the coming 20 years, they will continue to qualify for a deferral until such time as the house is transferred.  If the amount is &euro;700 a year for 20 years the total would be &euro;14,000 which would be paid when the house is sold.  It would be much less damaging to the individual at that time than it would be to have to pay &euro;700 per year now.  We feel this is by far the best system to help reduce the &euro;10 billion structural deficit we have in an equitable and efficient way consistent with not damaging employment.</p><p>  For what it is worth, the majority of the remainder of our proposals are taxes on inter-generational wealth transfer and inheritance.  We also speak about reducing pension tax expenditures because the current system is a disgrace.  I do not know any economist on the right or left internationally who would support our system.  I agree with Dr. Healy that the basic pension should be increased because this is how one helps people.  I strongly advocate that no cuts whatsoever should be made to primary or secondary benefits for vulnerable groups and taxes should not be increased for low income groups.  Through carefully working out all of these measures one can design a system, even for this year at &euro;3.5 billion, which protects the most vulnerable in society and places the burden precisely where it should be, which is on the wealthiest and highest income groups.  We do not buy into the austerity narrative.  We have argued for years about how it is counter-productive.  We have called for the &euro;4.5 billion from the National Pensions Reserve Fund to be targeted.</p></speech>

For much longer than a decade, since before the recession hit us in 2008, we have been arguing about the tax base, and Deputy Higgins is well familiar with our arguments.  We were very conscious of the fact that the tax base was being narrowed which made the tax take very vulnerable if anything happened.</p> <p>Since 2001 we have clearly indicated, in print and in meetings with politicians up to and including the Taoiseach of the day, that the amount of houses being built was in excess of what was required.  We used the phrase, "You did not need to be Einstein to know that there would come a day when we would have to stop building too many houses" because there was more than enough to keep us going.  Consequently, the Government's tax take was extremely vulnerable because there was too much emphasis placed on transaction taxes.  Then Social Inclusion Ireland reached the sensible conclusion that it was best to substantially increase the tax take from fixed assets or wealth in one way or another and thus property became part of that.  We opted for a site value tax because we thought it was more likely to work, more effective and more equitable.</p><p> I shall deal with the equity side.  A high value was placed on land in urban areas but much of that was tied to the social and economic investment that was paid for by taxpayers.  That being the case then there should be a payment given back to all taxpayers, and not just the taxpayers living in the area, from what had been provided in the area at taxpayer's expense.  We then concluded that site values was a better way to go.  It can be argued that a substantial portion of the benefit of the land value should be enjoyed by all of the members of the community, not just the owner of a particular property.  An increase in site values is linked to the investment in infrastructure in the area and much of that was paid for by taxpayers.  Therefore, it can be argued that a substantial portion of the benefit gained by an increasing site value should go to the whole community through the tax system.  That is why we opted for this approach rather than house values.</p></speech>

Fr. Healy gave the Custom House and Dublin 1 as an example and talked about all of the infrastructure. First, we must bear in mind that most of the high concentrations of poverty are also found in inner city areas and that is precisely why taxpayer investment and infrastructure was made.  Second, I shall reiterate the point made by Deputy Higgins.  We are not dealing with perfect equilibrium because people are up to their tonsils in debt and they were fleeced.  They are now in negative equity and can only afford to pay interest only mortgages at present.  That problem will not go away anytime soon.</p><p>  I was surprised by how the group dealt with a wealth tax.  Why was it not more expansive in how it defined wealth?  There are more assets than the family home.  Can I ask each of the delegations to identify what it thinks is the most important matter for the forthcoming budget when it comes to dealing with two categories of citizens, the children and the working poor.</p></speech>

In order to help the working poor we simply propose that tax credits be refunded.  There are 130,000 people in jobs but they are so low paid that their household is in poverty.  Therefore, we must do something to target those people and to keep them in their jobs.  We have talked about how to incentivise people to take up jobs.  These people have jobs but they are paid so little that they are below the poverty line or are struggling financially.  A simple measure that would help would be to refund the two main tax credits to which they are entitled.  In other words, change the system so that they can benefit from the full value of their tax credit.  For the most part, they do not benefit from the full value of the tax credit, so they could receive a payment from the State to make up the balance.  That means that the poorest people in employment, the working poor, would benefit from the full value of any changes in the tax credit system.  I know that we are not likely to see that in the budget this year or next year.  There was a time when they were increasing and I hope that it will happen again.  It is perverse that a tax change of that nature can help everybody except the poorest in employment.  We came up with a costing of &euro;140 million that was based on numbers from three years ago.  At the time the Revenue Commissioners claimed that it would cost over &euro;3 billion.  We held discussions in this committee room that eventually sweated down their figure of &euro;700 million and, in subsequent discussions with our technical people, the figure was further reduced to &euro;350 million. The Revenue Commissioners have not been able to move our cost of &euro;140 million by one cent because it was rock solid.  The proposal would probably cost less now because there are fewer people in employment than three years ago.  The provision can be made for that sum.</p><p>  It is most important that there is no reduction in child benefit and no second tier payment introduced as a <i>quid pro quo</i> for a cut in child benefit.  I am sure that the members will question what I am saying and whether I support the wealthy.  The Department of Finance and the troika asked me the same questions but I gave them the same answer that I shall give here.  Let us take two households that each have a total income of &euro;100,000, two people live in each, the households are identical and pay the same tax.  If one household has two children then it receives over &euro;3,000 from the State in child benefit.  It is a contribution for the two children but it is far below the cost involved.  Along comes a recession and Ireland is in trouble and needs to make savings in order to reduce its borrowing.  What does the Government mean when it proposes a cut in child benefit?  Which household will it take money from?  Obviously, the household that contains four persons.  To me that is not obvious.  It is not the right thing to do and I would leave them alone.  The State already does far too little for children by way of a contribution or supports.</p><p>  Instead, if the Government needs to take money from the two households in order to make a contribution to Ireland reducing its borrowing then it should come from both houses through the income tax system or some other process rather than cut the child benefit.  The child benefit is the only payment of substance and my group deems it to be not nearly adequate.  It is the child's payment and should remain as it is.  If one examines the range of services for children the one thing that they all have in common is that they are underfunded.  There is insufficient funding across the system.  The last thing that we should do is to reduce the little funding that exists through that one payment.  There are much fairer ways to increase the tax take and reduce the borrowing than targeting children who are in no position to speak for themselves.</p></speech>

My organisation proposes a system that is based on market value rather than site value.  The measure would address the basic issue but also our ability to pay the deferral system and income is a component of that.  For example, if a person is unemployed then it is certain that he or she would defer a payment and, therefore, would not pay the tax.</p><p>  With regard to whether one should expand the wealth tax from the property tax, there are a number things that can be done and that Ireland should be doing.  Although this is not strictly a wealth tax, we should support financial transaction taxes which ensure the movement of finance.</p> <p>Taxing financial assets in Ireland is quite difficult because of the open nature of the economy.  We will look at this in greater detail in the future.  One of the reason we do not have specific proposals on such taxes is that we do not have cost proposals on it.  We do not have the numbers.  </p><p> In terms of perfect equilibrium, it is not a perfect equilibrium and that is the reason it must be sustainable over the long term.  When one has high levels of unemployment and incomes go down, the income component of a deferral system kicks in.  In addition, house prices are falling.  This tax will be less of a burden during times such as now.  When good times return, if they ever do, then the level will increase.  On the issue of the sustainability of the debt and whether we should be repaying it, the position taken by TASC, as we articulated last year, is that we should suspend the payment of the promissory note, pending a full renegotiation.  We have made that clear.  We believe Ireland should come up with its own technical paper in which all the options available to Ireland are examined.</p><p> I have been asked what can be done for children and for the working poor.  One begins by issuing a guarantee that there will be no cuts to services for children, no increase in taxation <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>the low paid, credit spans and so on.  A broader commitment is also made, including a commitment to a quality audit so that as part of the budget process one looks at how the proposal will affect children over the entire year.  We need to know that by looking at the evidence and having the debates in January and February and not in the middle of November when we all criticise the decisions that are not based on evidence and are made on the night before the budget.  We need to take a multi-annual approach.  One of the areas that Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy raises is the idea of refundable tax credits, which we fully support.  It is a very good way of supplementing the incomes of the working poor.  </p><p> The money in the National Pensions Reserve Fund, which is approximately &euro;4.5 billion, is uncommitted and could be committed to the domestic economy, not necessarily as a stimulus only but in targeted ways.  Let me give examples.  A significant cohort of the people who were formerly in the construction sector will never be able to get jobs in construction again.  We had a boom.  When the economy returns to normal, the levels of construction will be below the boom levels, therefore we must consider now what skills will be necessary for the economy of the future so that we do not create structural unemployment over the next decade and onwards.  We need to focus specifically on the long-term unemployed and ensure they will get the education, retraining and upskilling necessary.  We need to pour money into developing people.  It is about human capital to a large extent.</p></speech>

It is important to see if there are cases of men in these circumstances.</p><p>  Deputy Higgins raised the issue of property taxation and where payment of the amount calculated on the basis of taxation could be deferred.  He pointed out that the deferral would compete with negative equity.  Some people whose houses are in deep negative equity might never be in a position to pay off the deferred tax and it might never be retrieved.  One must think about that.</p><p>  One may draw a comparison between the size of a loan and contamination of a site, when it comes to site value.  If one has contamination on a site, then the site value will be zero minus the cost of removal of the contamination.  If one looks at a mortgage that was too big in the first instance on that site, one has a financial contamination of the site and the site has no value.  How can one raise a tax on what would otherwise have been a mortgage free site?  We have the working poor and the new poor, the people who have too much debt and have temporarily lost their income.  There are people who were income rich for a number of years - architects would be a case in point - and they have no income now.  Engineers are in the same position.  We cannot jump to a conclusion on a reflex type of movement. </p><p>  It was Mr. McDonnell who said that property is wealth.  It is not.

There should be no waivers in respect of negative equity but there should be deferrals based entirely upon people's ability to pay.  If a person's ability to pay status changes, the deferral should be removed and if his or her ability to pay declines, then a deferral can kick in and there can be different levels of deferrals.  It should be a universal system across the board for everyone - there should be horizontal equity.  No groups, because of negative equity, should be able to exempt themselves from a property tax.  I reiterate that all taxes have negative impacts on employment, growth, incomes and also on equity but property taxes or taxes on a moveable property specifically are the least damaging across the board in the case of all of these issues.</p></speech>

On the pensions issue, the witnesses have hit on something important.  They are right that 80% of the benefit going to 20% of the people is problematic and we need to deal with that but why would they not go a little further?  Some &euro;2.5 billion is given in tax reliefs and most of that goes to the top 20%.  Why would they not go considerably further and argue - I think Vincent Browne argued this point a while ago - for eliminating almost all of that relief and have universal provision of the non-contributory pension at double its current level?  We could afford that if most of those reliefs were eliminated and the private pension system was phased out.  Why would the witnesses not take that more radical route?</p><p>  On the property tax issue, the witnesses should rethink what they have proposed because they are the good guys but I believe they have got it totally wrong on this issue.  The rate they propose of 0.35% would amount to a property tax of &euro;700 a year on a house valued at &euro;200,000.  People who are not rich live in many areas Dublin where properties have high values and under that scenario they would have to pay &euro;1,000 in property tax alone.  It is of no consolation that the payment of that tax would be deferred until further down the road and people would be accumulating debts.  That is an awful scenario.  The witnesses should rethink this proposal.  Some 70% or 80% of people own their own homes.  There is nothing wrong with that and the family home should not be considered as a form of wealth in the same sense as commodities and financial investments<b>.</b>  The witnesses' position reminds me of the joke about anarchists: Why do anarchists drink green tea?  They drink it because proper tea is theft.</p></speech>

On the Deputy's suggestion to double the level of the universal pension, phase out the private pension industry and pay for it by eliminating reliefs, if we could double the level of the pension and pay for it by eliminating reliefs and so on, the Deputy would find no bigger supporter of that proposal than us because we would be positive in support of phasing out any kind of support for the private pension industry.  There has been a great degree of rip-off in the private pension industry over decades and the major beneficiaries have been those in the pensions industry, not the people who drew pensions or were depending on them.  We made a proposal previously that the State might invest a serious amount in pensions and make the universal payment of pensions as strong as possible and, on the other side, provide capacity for people if they want to invest in their pensions, but the State would do it and all the charges that go to fund the private pensions industry would be eliminated.  The State would run this through the vehicle already in place for handling State money and so on.  There might be  a possibility of doing something in that context and that would need to be examined.  I would have no problem with it and would be more concerned about how much we could do, what would be the value of the remainder of the tax breaks and so on.  I would need to examine those to ascertain what would be possible.  I would have no problem with increasing it, funding it in the way the Deputy suggests and eliminating support for the private pensions industry because it has a negative impact.</p></speech>

Broadly the role of the State is to ensure that all people within the State have an income sufficient to their needs.  We should not be providing any tax breaks.  That would be our longer-term position.   However, a budget is a year-by-year process and one would do that on a phased basis over time and in 2013 we would do it by reducing tax relief to the standard rate, which principally would affect people on higher incomes.</p><p>  On the property tax issue, 70% or 80% of people own their own homes but the one cohort of people who do not, by and large, are those at the bottom of the scale.  That is the one group we could be sure would be exempt.  It would have positive redistributive effects from that point of view.  </p></speech>

I reiterate that if an individual is on a low income or experiencing difficulty in making repayments, a deferral would kick in until transfer of the property.  Essentially, that would deal with short-term issues about creating additional difficulties for people because it is only people who do not find themselves in large difficulties who would be liable to this tax in the short term.  Given the massive size of the deficit, somebody has to pay and it is our position that this is the best and fairest way to do it.  It would be done in a way that effectively protects the most vulnerable in society and those who do not have the ability to pay.  It would also be efficient and sustainable over the long term and, economically, that makes sense as well.</p></speech>

As I have told other witnesses that have appeared before the committee today, the purpose of this meeting is not to go into a detailed presentation of pre-budget submissions or for members to make statements.  It is an opportunity to drill down to specific proposals contained in a submission, or to get a better insight into the thinking or rationale underpinning it.  In some cases, we will try to ascertain if modelling has been done by individual organisations to see from where the information has been extrapolated.</p><p>  I thank the various witnesses for attending the joint committee.  They are Mr. Fergal O'Brien, chief economist, IBEC; Mr. Paul Sweeney, ICTU; Mr. Tom Geraghty, PSEU; and Mr. Roland O'Connell, president, Society of Chartered Surveyors.</p><p> I will get the ball rolling by putting a number of questions to IBEC and ICTU.  IBEC's pre-budget submission suggests a grant or tax credit package to incentivise home improvement works during a three-year window of opportunity.  Similar work has been done in Sweden and certain works are under consideration in Germany also.  Does IBEC feel this would be effective if a property tax was simultaneously introduced, as home values would be factored in with this?  IBEC's submission specifically states that it supports the private property tax.  Can Mr. O'Brien clarify if that is a valuation-based property tax or is it a site valuation approach?</p><p>  ICTU's proposal suggests a &euro;3 billion three-year stimulus package.  What industries does Mr. Sweeney think would be specifically targeted by this stimulus and what new jobs would be created if such a programme were put in place?</p><p>  Section 5.7 of the ICTU proposal notes the support of congress for automatic enrolment in pensions.  This ties into what Dr. Healy was saying earlier.  Would this be a universal pension or something that citizens could opt in or out of?  I would welcome greater detail on that proposal.</p><p>  The ICTU submission also refers to a property tax.  I would be grateful if Mr. Sweeney could expand further on this position.  Is he proposing a banding of property taxes from &euro;100,000 to &euro;150,000 and from &euro;150,000 to &euro;200,000?  Is that the type of model he is proposing?</p><p>  I invite the IBEC representative, Mr. Fergal O'Brien to begin.</p></speech>

As regards our home improvements tax credit-grant proposal, we have examined a couple of models internationally.  We have found this type of approach to be effective in stimulating activity in the domestic economy.  This is what we regard as being probably the most significant challenge we face currently, which is to see some sort of normalisation of activity in the domestic economy.  We have focused on the home improvement sector for a couple of reasons.  One is because it is so labour intensive.  It has a relatively low import content.  We also believe we still have significant savings and wealth in this economy so there is a capacity for households to unlock the activity, given sufficient and adequate incentive.</p><p>  Another issue of which we are particularly conscious - not just in home improvements but also across many sectors of the economy - is the growth in the black economy.</p></speech>

The business community is concerned about the growth in the black economy that we have seen in recent times.  We are quite conscious that, as a result of so many people losing their jobs in the construction sector, it has added to home improvement activity in the black economy.  Our proposal is for the Government to fund an element of home improvement costs.  We suggest up to a maximum of &euro;3,000 in a &euro;20,000 spend.  We are suggesting also that this would be Revenue positive because, first, it would incentivise additional activity and, second, it would move activity from the informal economy into the formal one.  The tax compliance requirements would mean that one would only have fully registered contractors.  In addition, one would have the personal public service numbers of employees working on the contract.  We would have, therefore, fully tax compliant activity.  By making all the activity tax compliant, it would fund the cost of any grant or credit.</p><p>  One of the benefits of waiting this long into our crisis to start looking at such proposals is that we can see what has happened elsewhere, particularly in the crisis response measures in Canada.</p></speech>

The essence of the proposal is that there is an incentive for the home owner to carry out these works within the window of opportunity and get some sort of subvention from the State.  It pays for itself by creating new activity and bringing activity from the informal economy into the formal one.  As I said, the merit of looking at something like that now is that we can see how these schemes have worked in the recession internationally.  The cost benefits are there and do stack up.  This would really stack up, particularly at the moment in the Irish economy given the increase we have seen in activity in the informal economy.</p><p>  I do not think there are any implications for property tax.  We think it would be a significant, positive net contribution back to the Exchequer and would create in the region of 6,000 to 10,000 jobs over a three-year period.</p><p>  On property tax, our submission has focused particularly on where we would be players rather than just commentators.  We have particular concerns on how employers would be affected.  To answer the Chairman's specific query as to whether we have opted for a site valuation or the market value approach, we favour the latter purely for its simplicity, deliverability and administrative reasons.  In an ideal world, the economist in me would go for a site valuation approach, but we do not think that is practical in the short term.  It is something to which we would not be opposed in the long term.  For pure ease of administration in the short term, however, we favour a market-based valuation approach.</p></speech>

I note the Minister for Finance appeared before the joint committee this morning and more or less stated there is very little growth.  While he is hoping for some uptake on exports, no economy is going to survive on exports.  It is a zero-sum game throughout Europe with little growth.  Essentially, the key point I wish to make about our submission is we would reverse what the Government is doing, which is very little by way of tax rises.  Moreover, it is hammering the poor as 78% of all the tax rises thus far have been on lower-paid working people.  Put simply, it ain't working and while they can blame Europe, people in their hearts and souls must know it really is not working and people are going round with their fingers crossed.  We have proposed that the taxes should be increased substantially, particularly on high-paid people who are not spending their money.</p><p> The second thing is the stimulus programme of &euro;3 billion per year, about which the Chairman has asked a question.  We published a document in July, which we have costed and for which we ran a model.  We have a body attached to congress called the Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI, which now has an economic model that is as good as those of the ESRI or the Central Bank and it is doing work in this regard.  The Chairman also asked where we would invest and we would invest in five broad areas.  The first is broadband, which is a serious area.  Another is retrofitting and energy efficiency, about which we are at one to a degree with IBEC because our housing stock is poorly insulated and one would get a major gain from this.  I do not know whether grants should be given but that definitely is worth thinking about.  Another area is public transport, as our public transport system is pretty poor.  We have made suggestions on finishing some of the major roads that are nearly ready to be finished, as well as on light rail, buses and so on.  We advocated completion of the Luas BDX line, which has got the go-ahead and I believe that is great news for Dublin's citizens.  Only Irish people - certain politicians - could design two tramlines that do not meet.  The fourth and fifth areas are water and waste treatment and health and education and we advocated certain projects with regard to the latter, such as the children's hospital and the Grangegorman campus.  The Grangegorman project is very labour intensive.  It is in the inner city and is a very good project in which to invest and we are delighted the Government is going ahead with it.  These are the essential points.</p><p> The Chairman asked about automatic enrolment in pensions.  It would be mandatory and consequently, there would be no opt-out.  Young people really never think of their pensions and it is only when one hits 50 that one starts thinking about them.  An interesting point in this regard concerns people like me, who worked in England for some years.  I worked there for six or seven years before going to college, but my brother, who was there, tells me I am going to get a pension from Britain for those years, which is good news.  It might only be a fiver a week but it is something one never thinks of when one is young.  We can revert to pensions but on the property tax, we are fairly broad in that regard.  To be straight with the joint committee it is because congress represents 39 unions in the Republic and getting them together on this was a difficult task.  We know what is going to happen-----</p></speech>

I understand a banded system.  The United Kingdom, operates such a system, which I consider to be highly flawed because the band begins at &pound;800 and ends at &pound;1,200.  Consequently, it means that if one is Del Boy Trotter living out in Nelson Mandela House, one is paying &pound;800 while if one is Queen Elizabeth, living in Buckingham Palace, one pays &pound;1,200.  The bands are too limited, too narrow and all the rest of it.  A banded system that began at &euro;100,000 and which went up indefinitely could be something to be looked at.  ICTU's submission talks about a banded proposal and I would like to hear more about that.  Does it envisage an indefinite band or is it a band that is very confined?</p></speech>

However, if such a property tax is to be put in place, it should meet certain requirements.  Obviously, they include fairness, equity and so on.  That is the full extent to which we had anything to say.</p></speech>

I will start with Mr. Fergal O'Brien, who I gather from his submission is extremely enthusiastic about a property tax.  Perhaps he will talk to members a little about that.  I also wish to ask him about the issue of lending to business.</p> <p>There is, obviously, still a huge difficulty in accessing credit.  I was interested to read in the document of IBEC's  endorsement of a State-backed enterprise or investment bank.  I note the distance we have all travelled since the crisis hit, but this does not strike me as standard IBEC fare.  </p></speech>

Mr. O'Brien says a little about it in his submission but I would like to know a little more.  What does he think the scope of that initiative might be?</p><p>  I welcome the thrust of the ICTU submission.  It is not even a mile away from the thinking of Sinn F&eacute;in.  It is unfair to talk about spending &euro;9 billion in total in investment in jobs and strategy.  It is investment and not spending, and is to be welcomed.  It also is notable there seems to be almost complete consensus on the good sense of retrofitting and the necessity of doing it, both for job generation and as an environmental policy.  There is something in that.</p><p>  Can Mr. Sweeney and Mr. Geraghty talk about two things that interest me?  The first is the proposal to levy a wealth tax at 1% on wealth above &euro;2 million.  I am also interested in the ICTU position on universal payments, such as child benefit, state pensions and ancillary payments to older citizens, such as free travel.  Could members have a view on that?</p><p>  Could Mr. O'Connell give a view on the balance that needs to be struck between tax raising measures and cutbacks? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-08a.1191" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Roland O'Connell" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2012110800030#FF00400"><p>Perhaps I could first comment on the residential property tax.  In the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, we think the residential property tax is a good idea, not because we welcome new taxes but because we feel it is better than the current stamp duty system.  When the property market is booming the economy, in general, is booming and there is considerable revenue from stamp duty.  When the economy is not booming the property market is not booming either and stamp duty income drops off.  The residential property tax should be used to fund local authorities.  Having an annual residential property tax, as opposed to a one-off transaction tax, means local authorities can plan ahead and estimate what their income is going to be.</p><p>  We have recommended that the property tax be banded.  We have not, however, recommended that the bands be limited when the value of a property gets up to a certain level.  I have just come from a presentation by a member of the UK valuation office, who said the UK top limit is &pound;3,000.  There was also a speaker from the Northern Ireland office, where they have what probably is a better organised and more advanced system.  Their band also cuts off at a certain level.  The Northern Ireland bands run from A to I, alphabetically, and the UK bands from A to H.  That is a policy decision, however, and not something the society would have a view on.</p><p>  We would echo comments here that the property tax should be straightforward and unambiguous.  It should be transparent and clear.  The collection should be low-cost and done at a convenient time of the year, that is, not when several other costs are being charged.  Most important, it should be easily understood by the public and there should be a level of transparency about how the money is being spent.  We believe it should be used to fund local authorities but there should be an onus on the local authorities to explain to taxpayers where their money has gone and how it is being spent.</p><p>  As for the method and whether the tax should be based on valuation, location, rent or size, that again is a policy decision because all these methods have pros and cons.  We have done considerable investigation on this, internationally, and have come to the sad conclusion that there is no perfect way of levying this tax.  Within our own society, there is considerable disagreement about which is the best way of doing it and consequently, we have not expressed an opinion as to which is the best way.  Much of it comes down to what the policymakers are trying to achieve.  For instance, the easiest method for the homeowner to self-assess, which also is the easiest method to be verified by the local councils or whatever the body will be, is purely a size-based one because anyone can measure the size of his or her own house.  Any local authority will have records in its planning office as to what is the size of the house.</p></speech>

While that system would be the easiest to self-assess, it has all sorts of other drawbacks.  The site value reference has many advantages on some points but one major disadvantage is that for instance, in the case of an apartment block, the site value for an individual apartment would be negative at present.  It is very hard to assess a tax on a negative value.  The society understands there are pros and cons in respect of all the methods.  It is a matter for the policymakers to decide what is their priority and then to choose a correct method to reflect that priority.  If the newspapers are to be believed, it appears as though we are heading towards a valuation based tax and if that be the case, so be it.</p></speech>

In the society's discussions, did it consider issues such as mortgage distress or negative equity?  I hear the points being made by Mr. O'Connell and the society clearly has thought out the various models in a thorough manner.

The society is entitled to do so, please do not get me wrong, but I am uncertain whether I accept the society may take a policy view on one element but shy away from the other.  If the society is on board for this, I would anticipate that, as a professional group, it would have thought through the issue in its totality.</p></speech>

We did think it through and if I am straying into the grounds of policy, I apologise for it but our view is there will have to be exceptions for a whole series of groups.  Clearly, those who simply cannot afford to pay it must be an exception or some alternative route must be found for them.  How such an alternative route is arrived at is a matter for those who are assessing the tax, rather then for us as property and construction professionals.  Consequently, we believe there should be exceptions.  It extends to instances such as those to which Deputy Boyd Barrett referred whereby people who have very low incomes may be living in relatively expensive houses and cannot afford to pay such taxes.</p> <p>All of those things will have to be taken into account when levying the tax.  We have not been cheeky enough to say this is how one should do it in the same way we have not presumed to say this is the right method to assess it because it depends on what the policymakers are trying to achieve.  The one big issue we could distinguish within that is that it is a better system for funding local authorities to have an annual tax, even though it is not an ideal time to introduce it and there are huge difficulties with it at the moment.  However, an annual tax of that nature is a better and fairer solution than transactional tax.  That is as far as we went on that subject.</p></speech>

The allied professionals - architects were mentioned - have taken an absolute pasting because construction went off a cliff and because of the contraction in the domestic economy.  I asked that question not to try to get Mr. O'Connell to stray into broader policy but I am curious to know, in light of discussions among a professional group such as his own, the prevailing view among his peers in terms of getting it right, fixing the deficit and getting ourselves back on some kind of sustainable footing.  Is it his view that the Government is getting it right?  I do not want to put words in Mr. O'Connell's mouth but does he see what-----</p></speech>

We have covered a lot of that in our submission.  In broad terms, the two big issues that face us in the construction business and in the property business are confidence and finance.  Those are the two big issues which stop activity in the marketplace.  In our submission, we dealt with those under a number of different headings.  For instance, on the residential mortgage side of things, we feel there is some confidence coming back into the market but it is very fragile and it is very localised.  That is very important from a governmental point of view, in particular in the case of new apartments and houses which were built but never sold.  There is a large amount of VAT tied up there and if any of those are sold, the VAT revenue comes back into the central Exchequer, so it is very important to see some activity there.</p><p>  From speaking to people involved in residential sales, the big issue we found was that approximately 40% of all transactions in the greater Dublin area this year were cash buyers, including people who sold abroad and are moving back and so on.  That is an indictment of the fact that despite the banks being recapitalised by the State, they are not lending.  Do not get me wrong.  We acknowledged, and did not like, the fact mortgages were too easy to get but it is now the other extreme.  There are very viable mortgagees who should be getting loans but who cannot get them at the moment and, therefore, cannot buy a house and generate revenue for Exchequer.  </p><p>  We feel very strongly that despite what the banks are saying, they are not lending at the rate they should be.  Having approved people for mortgages, they are then creating hurdles and difficulties when people go to draw down the finance.  We have asked that it is looked at by the Department of Finance.</p></speech>

We have suggested a 1% on wealth over &euro;2 million, including one's personal home when it is worth over &euro;1 million.  If it is worth &euro;1.1 million, one only pays on &euro;100,000.

One cannot subsidise some of the mad borrowers by not taxing them.  As I said before, there is no point in the likes of us doing the detail on this because the policymakers, or the implementers, will do what they are going to do.</p><p>  We have a section on universal payments.  There is an intellectual argument against them because of the cost, in particular in tough times.  However, the big thing in favour of universal payment is that they bind society together and get the middle class committed to the social welfare system.  That works very well in Europe, so we have set out a number of universal payments we think should be retained, including the travel pass and dental and optical benefits, although one pays for dental and optical benefits in one's PRSI.  </p></speech>

On the property tax issue, from an IBEC perspective, we have 7,500 member companies, the vast majority of which are in the domestic economy.  No matter what we do on the taxation side, it will impact on their businesses in the domestic economy.  The priority for us in the taxation proposals in our budget is to limit that damage on growth and jobs.  It is nothing the Deputy will not have heard already today.</p><p>  From an employer's perspective, we have a particular insight into the Government's proposal as to how the property tax will be collected.  We have now heard from the Minister for Finance that the property tax will be collected through Revenue and through adjustments to personal income tax credits.  In some cases, although not in all, it will be deducted by employers in monthly payroll systems.  That is something about which we have quite a concern in terms of employers administering those payroll systems.</p><p>  Our concern is that if we go down this route of administering the property tax through the income tax credit and the personal tax credit system, it will have two consequences for employers and business.  It will put wage pressure back into the workplace.  We know that from recent experience where we have had income tax increases.  When people have less money in their pay packet, there is a kick back to the employer.  We are going through a phase when we are trying to reduce costs and be more competitive and I think that will be unhelpful.  </p><p>  As Mr. Paul Sweeney said, practically every economist thinks that property tax is a good idea by nature of it being a tax on property and less damaging to growth.  If we administer this through the income tax credit system, it could <i>de facto</i> become a tax on work and a tax which only workers will be pay, or, at the very least, it could be perceived that way.  That would be damaging.  It could act as another reason not to take up a job.  If one looks into the behavioural economics of this issue, how one frames it-----</p></speech>

If we are going to have a property tax, it must be a real one and not a <i>de facto </i>tax on work.  It must not become perceived as a tax on work and a disincentive to take up a job.  That is much of the feedback we have got from our members in recent times.  </p><p>  However, I think there are ways around that and again it all depends on how one frames this.  The default option should not be for this to be delivered straightaway through the income tax credit system.</p> <p>That should almost be the collection of last resort.  We know there has been an issue around payment and compliance with the property charges that have already been introduced.  Therefore, I can understand the Government's rationale for opting and wanting to collect the tax in this way but it should not be the first port of call, it should be the last resort in terms of a collection mechanism for the tax.  People should be provided with the other options first and failure to pay in some cases could resort to adjustments to their personal tax credits system. </p><p> On the issue of access to credit for SMEs, there is no question but that this is still the single biggest issue for SME members.  A number of things could be done in the budget to address the difficulty.  On the specific issue of the State-backed investment bank, this works well internationally in cases where banking systems are not in turmoil or in a crisis such as in Germany and Canada.  The crucial thing is that it is part of a range of options in terms of SME finance.  One of the lessons that has to be learned from the crisis is that Ireland was the most reliant economy on bank lending for SMEs than anywhere else in Europe.  That will change over time and was a consequence of the easy access to credit.  The State has a role to play, be it perhaps through funds at our disposal through the National Pensions Reserve Fund and in time through a State-backed investment bank.  Some of the other suggestions in our submission would be around our employment investment and incentive scheme, a follow-on from the business expansion scheme, which is an excellent opportunity to get funding into SMEs.  That scheme is not working for various reasons.  It is obviously a tough investment climate but the set-up of that scheme is not working.  Traditionally the business expansion scheme worked because it was able to draw on a relatively small pool of high net worth individuals who were happy to invest in businesses.  For various reasons, wealth destruction and changes to the tax system-----</p></speech>

There are many people who would want to invest in real Irish businesses if the tax system facilitated it.  We are missing an opportunity by not doing that.</p><p>  I will make one final comment if the Chair will allow me.  On the important issue of access to credit for SMEs, in Ireland there is no incentive for anyone selling a business at the moment to reinvest the proceeds of that sale into another Irish start up or growth business, unlike in the UK where there is roll-over relief whereby if a person selling a business reinvests the proceeds he or she receives an offset against capital gains tax.  There are many people selling good businesses but there is no incentive for them in the tax system to reinvest the proceeds in this country.  There should be such a system.</p></speech>

That is a disgraceful tax and should be abolished in the budget.

As he said, on the face it, it may appear attractive to cut the universal benefits in the circumstances but there is another issue related to the much broader problem.  We have a serious difficulty with the income tax system, in that a disproportionate amount is paid by those in the PAYE sector, therefore, cutting universal benefits and means testing them will disproportionately affect those in the PAYE sector because they cannot hide their income, whereas the self-employed are in a position to do so.  I do not have the exact figure off the top of my head but I think in excess of 80% of all income tax is paid for by those in the PAYE sector.  Nobody would seriously suggest that anything like that proportion of total income in the country is earned by those in that sector.  Clearly, they are overpaying and everybody else is underpaying.</p></speech>

I said in the previous section that the mortgage element that attaches by way of charge to the properties that are going to be valued is like a financial rather than a physical contamination.  Mr. Roland O'Connell would be aware that a physical contamination on a site or a property immediately hits the value.  It is just a starting point in theory and in fairness one would say that where there is a mortgage on a property it is actually a charge on the property and, therefore, it reduces its value for the purpose of taxation.  That is a matter of physical and financial fact and has been missed in the discussion.</p><p>  Another issue I wish to raise because all the delegates represent various bodies is the corporation tax rate - the sacred cow - which stands at 12.5%.  From my discussions which have been pointed and searching with people at the top levels of companies from abroad who have invested and are thinking of coming to Ireland, a 2.5% uplift from 12.5% to 15% in the headline rate, because the PWCs and KPMGs of this world do all sorts of planning-----</p></speech>

Congress said it wanted to keep the rate at 20% but it went to 12.5%.  Has it served Ireland well?  It certainly has.  Is it too low?  There are a couple of points on it.  Some 62% of companies do not pay corporation tax because they are proprietary directors and they ensure they do not and those that do, pay an effective rate of between 4% and 5%.  What we have proposed for this budget, which is a little different from what we said previously, when we were talking about the headlight rate referred to by Deputy Mathews, and if everyone in the main parties is so obsessed with the rate, is that essentially the exemptions be curbed and if we raise 2% more in the effective rate, one could raise &euro;2 billion.  The rate is very unpopular.  I was in Berlin last week and got hammered over it.  We are looking for a handout in grants and will not even join the financial transaction tax while at the same time we are bleeding them dry with Dutch and Irish sandwiches or whatever they are called.</p></speech>

Many policy makers have been blind to this issue.  I can understand the reason the Government takes a firm line because investors like certainty, which is understandable.  We know that as we head towards fiscal union there will be change.  It is better to organise not to have absolute harmonisation of rates but for co-ordination within bands.  We talk about the consolidated rate.  I agree with those who say that by using the consolidated basis, the figures will be based on the amount one sells in each country, then as a small country, we will lose out.  We need to negotiate on the issue rather than let it be imposed on us.  That is my worry in the long run.</p></speech>

We have a transparent competitive corporation tax rate which means that relatively, we get more of our tax revenue from the corporate sector than most other economies in Europe with much higher rates.  If we increase the price, that is the rate, I do not agree that we will get more revenue.  We will probably get less revenue or the same revenue, applying the higher rate.  The main reason would be due to the lack of certainty for business as a result of that change.  It would result in behavioural impacts.  If one looks at the outcome for Ireland and compares it with that of other countries in Europe, we get a very high share of our total tax revenue from the corporate sector by having a simple, transparent, consistent and certain rate.  It would be flawed economic policy to change that.</p></speech>

Will IBEC respond to me on the reasons the economy has collapsed?  What is the problem?  What has happened to our economy that there is no investment?</p></speech>

The single biggest reason the domestic economy, because the export economy is performing well, is so weak at present is not because of the impact of austerity but because of the impact of credit flows in the economy.  If one looks at the data from the Central Bank and compares the net lending-borrowing of households in 2012 to the situation in 2007, we have had a swing in the region of &euro;12 billion to &euro;16 billion.  I think that is a multiple of the impact of austerity.  It is the distorted relationship in credit between our households and the banks that is the biggest single reason for the collapse in economic activity.  Much of it is related to what happened to the construction sector.  Some one in two people who are out of work previously worked in the construction sector.  Of course the fiscal adjustment and the austerity is impacting on growth.  If we had normal credit conditions, both in terms of demand and supply, there are supply issues in the banks but there are also demand issues in households.  At present our households have a particularly high savings ratio.  If that savings ratio, as we heard from the IMF was to come down by 4 percentage points it would add 1% to our GDP numbers.  That is the single biggest reason that the domestic economy is so weak rather than the fiscal adjustment.</p></speech>

Business investment is increasing and has been for the past year and a half.  It is not as much as we would like and the main reason it is investing is that the export economy is performing strongly.  We will have a record level of exports this year.  We have very little spare capacity in the export sector.  We are seeing our export companies investing more than have been in previous years.  The domestic economy remains particularly weak.  The vast majority of our 7,5000 members are operating in the domestic economy.  Our suggestions here are around the pensions issue, where we are advocating for an early release of the additional voluntary contribution, AVC, component of our pensions.  The suggestions around the home renovations sector is to some degree trying to normalise a credit flow in an economy that is suffering because of the changes in the past couple of years.</p></speech>

I will pass over because we have no time for a discussion on it but I fundamentally disagree with the points made by Mr. O'Brien.</p><p>  I will address the question on the property tax to each of the witnesses.  Is there not a recognition on the part of all of the delegates that they accept this proposal?  I find it surprising that the unions would accept it rather than actively campaigning against it.  Significant numbers of union members will not be able to pay it.  I do not understand the reason.</p><p>  The wealth tax has been mentioned, with which I agree.  There is a bit of a slippage between property and wealth tax.  Surely we on the left should be advocating for a wealth tax, which would include property over a certain value, but not the family home, and opt for a higher wealth tax and higher income taxes on people at the top level?  Why is the union making a concession on a tax that will be imposed on union members and will impose a very significant extra financial burden on them and is without question going to have a further dampening effect on the domestic economy, which IBEC should be concerned about?  If the figures for the property tax we are talking about are implemented - ranging from &euro;400, &euro;500, &euro;600 and &euro;700 a year on ordinary low and middle income households - it will have a crushing effect on demand in the economy</p></speech>

It is not dissimilar to what I have already said, which is that there are divided opinions among trade unions about the issue of a property tax.  There are those who would argue - I am sure this is the view that Deputy Boyd Barrett would have sympathy with given the income tax system is so disproportionately skewed against people in the PAYE sector - that imposing a property tax in addition to that has a disproportionate impact on workers.  Equally, others in the trade unions will argue the opposing point.</p> <p> It is difficult to see how one could have an equitable tax system with a broad base of taxes without having a property tax.  Rather than beating ourselves up about whether we are for or against the notion of a property tax, we accept it as a given because the Government has decided that there will be a property tax.  We confined our submission to focusing on the protections we would like to see included if a property tax is to be introduced.</p></speech>

The crisis in Ireland was caused by the banks behaving like drunken sailors and lending money willy-nilly to anyone and everyone.  There was failure on the part of the public sector in the sense that the regulator, imbued with the ideology that markets work without intervention, went along with it and that is the reason this economy collapsed.   The banks have moved from crazy lending to the other extreme, and on this I agree with Mr. Fergal O'Brien, of becoming totally risk averse.  Austerity has caused a problem on the domestic side.  One cannot simply take &euro;25 billion out of an economy, which is the amount that will have been taken out of this economy by the end of next month, which is approximately 16% of GNP.  It is a staggering retrenchment and while it has been necessary to a degree we disagree on the amount of it.</p></speech>

I have a few questions from my brief reading of the submissions.  Reference was made to labour activation measures but how would congress, IBEC and the SCSI envisage they would work in practice?  The biggest single issue we face is unemployment.  We did not discuss that at length but I am sure everyone would agree it is the biggest single issue.  If people come off unemployment benefits that benefits them and the State.  The witnesses might deal with that issue.</p><p>  I wish to take up Mr. O'Brien's point, which was interesting.  Access to credit is a major issue for the SME sector.  Representatives of Allied Irish Bank and the Bank of Ireland appeared before the committee and we seemed to get different signals from them on this issue.  Bank of Ireland said that the amount of &euro;3.5 billion will all be for new lending and AIB said only &euro;600 million of the &euro;3.5 billion will be for new lending.  There is a reluctance on the part of the banks to engage in calculated risk-based entrepreneurial lending.  Mr. O'Brien might give us a flavour of the different business models in place elsewhere.  I was interested in his point regarding the business expansion scheme.  How does he envisage that could work in practice?  I am centring both questions around employment.  Rather than a headline mention of these measures, I would like to hear how the witnesses would in practical terms link labour activation measures to the provision of credit for SMEs and to comment on the types of funding models that could be used and on access to credit.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-08a.1272" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fergal O'Brien" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2012110800034#KK00800"><p>I thank the Deputy O'Donnell for his questions.  On the labour market activation measures, there are a few points to be noted on the unemployment issue and I will return to aspects of demand and the domestic economy, which is our single biggest challenge.  Specifically on the activation measures, we did some recent research with our members to ascertain what is working and what is not working.  The JobBridge programme is working well  and business is very supportive of it.  We are seeing a good deal of transition from those internships into sustainable employment and that should continue to be supported.  We have found there is a very weak level of awareness among employers of a range of other schemes such as the employer PRSI exemption scheme and the Revenue assist initiative.  Our recommendation would be to streamline those programmes and research suggests that better promoted, better branded cash equivalent payment schemes rather than a tax foregone model would work better.  </p><p>  Regarding other issues around labour market activation, we still have incredible skill shortages in the economy.  Our technology sector has 7,000 to 8,000 unfilled vacancies.  We have some good programmes that are working, in particular the Springboard programme, which again is a good exemplar of something that is very close to the workplace, it is reacting to real demand for real jobs and it is giving people who used to work in the construction sector good jobs in the medical devices and technology sectors.  In general, as a principle, those types of programmes that are close to the workplace and that will be able to respond to real opportunities and vacancies in sectors are the way to proceed because we have an incredible churn currently in the workplace.  We are losing jobs but a good many jobs are being created, and there are many unfilled jobs.</p><p>  On the issue of credit for SMEs, there is no question it is still a major issue for our members but it depends on the sector of the economy in which one finds oneself.  Certain sectors of the economy have become very attractive.  If someone is involved in the food and drink sector they probably do not have much difficulty in getting access to credit and there are many institutions willing to do business with them.  If someone is in a less attractive sector they are in a much more difficult position.  Are there problems in terms of credit supply?</p></speech>

We have examined the State aid rules because when one goes into these types of schemes they are very much tied up with the EU State aid rules.  We have look at experiences in the Netherlands and Austria, in particular, where government has guaranteed some of the risk for the individual investors and we seem to have got a good behavioural response from that.  We think that could make quite an impact.  As I said previously, the business expansion scheme worked because a small group of investors saw the advertisement in <i>The Sunday Business Post </i>and went to their advisers and put money into it.  It worked and sustained many good businesses  We need to cast the net much wider, we also need proper promotion and branding of the scheme and some technical changes need to be made to it, but I would hate to see us give up on it because it could make a real different in terms of funding for SMEs.</p></speech>

There were more jobs than there were graduates and one of the reasons for that is employment fell sharply and people went into different business, emigrated or whatever, but now things have stabilised.  We are getting this message across to career guidance teachers and parents to encourage them to get their children to consider the property sector as a job for the future because they tend to spend three or four years in college.  While the construction industry has not stabilised yet, it is getting to that point.  We have had a huge loss of skills but we need to start getting people back into that sector in order that we will have people with skills in the future.  We are quite optimistic about the future of the country as a whole.</p><p>  The Deputy asked about measures to create employment.  We believe that currently there is outstanding value in the construction sector but we do not believe the State is necessarily approaching this from the right direction.  One of the reasons is that the public tendering process seems to concentrate solely on the lowest tender and in recent years people have been awarded contracts for which they tendered below cost and when their businesses have then collapsed that has created a mess.  We need to examine the public procurement process, how we can do that more efficiently and we need to speed up the process.  What would help in that respect is if the Government across all State sectors had a chief construction adviser who co-ordinated all of those elements.  Mr. John Moran, the Secretary General of the Department of Finance suggested we examine creating a centre of excellence in Dublin for both property and design skills - construction skills  - because we have built up a huge level of talent that we can export.  Many of these people are going abroad to work and we need to support that export of skills where they can be based in Ireland and do work abroad.  There are sectors in which the Government can help with that and we have covered that in our submission.</p> <p>In recent months, we have seen the benefit of investment in strategic construction projects.  By that I mean things like the National Convention Centre where a couple of weeks ago the International Bar Conference was held.  They brought 5,000 lawyers from around the world who used hotels, restaurants and taxis, all of which generated money for the local economy.  The American football match in the Lansdowne Road stadium had the same effect.  When there is such good value in the construction sector we should take advantage of that, be it investing in broadband, transport or other long-term infrastructural skills.  How do we do that because we have no money?  We could get private pension funds to invest in this sector as well as getting money from the National Pensions Reserve Fund and the European Investment Bank.  One of the issues in getting money from those entities is that private pension funds are worried about the construction risk of investing in something at the nascent stage before it is built.  That is a hurdle we have to overcome.  How do we bridge that risk gap for them?  If we can do that we can then see construction which will create jobs and have a long-term beneficial effect for the State.</p></speech>

A section in our report this year was inserted towards the end.  A group of unions in construction are perturbed with some of the practices that basically amount to moneys going out of the country.  Outsiders are coming in bidding very low and then ignoring all labour standards and not paying tax.  Frankly, they are fly-by-night cowboys.  We really need people who are giving tenders in Ireland to think more creatively about it because it is a serious problem.</p><p>  On labour market activation, I agree with Mr. O'Brien that the key problem is lack of demand.  Looking at the supply side on activation, a lot more could be done. </p><p>  We were nervous about JobBridge but it seems to be working well and we are reasonably happy with that.  It is one of those things that has been very well implemented.  We hope that we get the real jobs for people at the end of it.</p><p>  One of the points in our submission is that activation requires an intense level of quality service from State agencies.  The OECD has been rightly critical of the way we have dealt with labour market activation in the past.  We need to do a lot more. </p><p>  We also say in the submission that there should be many more apprenticeship systems.  They seem to be dying out but a modern apprenticeship system is a great way of linking people who are not in employment or education and binding them to the workplace.  We have suggested that there should be apprenticeships in catering, hospitality, commerce and logistics as well as the traditional areas.  They can be flexible systems.  Hopefully, with the new State agencies, including SOLAS, it is an area in which there can be progress.</p></speech>

There were a number of items of private business to attend to.<br />  I welcome everybody to the meeting which is focused on the pre-budget submissions of nine groups and which is divided into two parts.  I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery that mobile phones should be switched off in order that there is no interference in the work of the broadcast unit.<br />  Today's meeting is an opportunity for us to listen to and discuss the pre-budget submissions from various community and voluntary groups working in the health and children sector.  We took a decision as a committee that as we are always heading to meetings on pre-budget submissions and budget 2013 is of great importance, we would listen to what the groups have to say in the context of putting the country's public finances back on a sustainable footing.  It is in all our interests that the public finances are stabilised and the economy returns to growth.  It is also an opportunity for us as parliamentarians to meet the groups, commend them on their work and thank them for the tremendous service they provide.  In education and advocacy, the groups play a significant role in society, and that is to be acknowledged.  The process of this pre-budget engagement will elevate their status outside the House when they can be here in the parliamentary committee making a formal presentation.<br />  I am conscious there are nine groups.  Members are used to a time limit of five minutes and I ask the groups to confine themselves to five minutes.  We have received their pre-budget submissions.  I ask them to make their remarks in five minutes to allow for discussion and interaction.<br />  I draw attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in respect of a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such as way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br />  I welcome Mr. Chris Macey, head of advocacy at the Irish Heart Foundation, and Mr. John McCormack of the Irish Cancer Society.  Mr. Macey has five minutes.</p></speech>

Traditionally, we focused on taxing smokers and today we are also asking for the committee to support our recommendation for excessive tobacco industry profits, some of which are being used to manipulate national health policy, to be transferred to the Exchequer.  Part of this revenue should be used to help smokers quit smoking.</p><p>  In Ireland, the Government has been taking approximately 79% of the price of a packet of cigarettes in tax.  The rest goes to the tobacco industry.  In the UK, the rate has been 90%, leaving the industry there with a much smaller profit margin.  In monetary terms, the tobacco industry has been earning approximately &euro;1 per pack more in Ireland than in the UK.  We estimate that by increasing the rate to 90%, the State could secure &euro;150 million a year more, not from smokers' pockets but from industry profits, making them pay more for the damage done by smoking.</p><p>  Every year, the tobacco industry increases the price of cigarettes, regardless of whether the tax increases.  This means its profit margin gets bigger and it is virtually unnoticed by the smokers, who think all of the increases are caused by tax hikes.  Between 2000 and 2010, for example, tobacco companies increased their prices by 83% compared with tax increases of 78%.</p><p>  The industry uses a sizeable proportion of its extra profit to pay lobbyists and public relations firms which come to places like Leinster House to claim that higher tax increases smuggling.  The industry follows this up by increasing its prices.  If the tobacco industry genuinely thought or cared that tax increases fuelled smuggling, why would it have increased the price of cigarettes every year for the past ten years?  The truth is this is a duplicitous industry that cares only about profit and then uses these profits to undermine State tobacco control policy and regulations.</p><p>  In our pre-budget submission, we recommend that Government appoints a regulator who would determine a profit level for the tobacco industry that is more in line with other consumer products and with the levels of other countries.  This simple initiative, which has worked effectively for other industries, would mean the tobacco manufacturers would have less money to invest in marketing, PR and lobbying aimed at disrupting the State's efforts to reduce the smoking rate.</p><p>  Smoking is one of the greatest public health challenges of our time.  We must do what we can in order that the tobacco industry does not profit from tobacco sales while the State and the individual are left to pick up the bill in financial and human terms.  Last year the State took in &euro;1.36 billion in tobacco tax, but the Department of Health states that at current smoking rates, tobacco related illness will cost the State &euro;23 billion in the next ten years.  This means the taxpayer is subsidising the tobacco industry, which does not create any jobs or make any meaningful contribution to society, to the tune of &euro;1 billion a year.</p><p>  Traditional methods of tackling the power of the tobacco industry are not working and we need a new approach.  We know that tobacco companies do not care about their products that kill and maim people.  By reducing their profits, we can hit them where it will hurt them most and also increase Government revenue at this time of greatest need.</p><p>  Mr. McCormack from the Irish Cancer Society will finish our submission.</p></speech>

We also need to focus on the basics.  For example, we do not have a national tobacco strategy, that is, a strategy that incorporates high regular taxation, reduced tobacco industry profits, tough anti-smuggling measures and concerted smoking cessation measures which will greatly reduce the human and economic impact of smoking.</p><p>  Other countries have shown that one can impose big tax increases on cigarettes and reduce smuggling at the same time where the will and leadership exists.</p> <p>In the UK, for example, through regular tax increases above the rate of inflation over the last ten years, major brand cigarettes are now more expensive than in Ireland.  Packs cost more than &euro;9.30 in the UK at current exchange rates, compared to &euro;9.20 here.  During the same period the smuggling rate in the UK has fallen from 21% to 9%, which is less than half the rate in Ireland.  The next time that tobacco industry supported groups like retailers against smuggling tell members that increases in taxes hit their funders in the pocket, please remember whose interests they are protecting.  We urge the Government to commit to an annual price escalator for tobacco taxes on all tobacco products, including hand-rolled tobacco, of at least 5% above the rate of inflation.  This has been proven globally to be the most effective way of reducing smoking rates, especially among teenagers, but it will only be effective if we tackle the illicit market which provides easy access to cheap tobacco and thereby negates the effect of higher prices.</p><p> Our template for action is provided by the UK, which had roughly the same smoking and smuggling rates a decade ago as we have now.  By combining high regular tax increases, tough anti-smuggling measures and effective stop-smoking strategies, the number of smokers has decreased by 2 million, including a 50% reduction among children, while the illicit market has shrunk from 21% to 9%.  For an annual outlay of &pound;300 million, tax revenues have risen by &pound;1.2 billion, while health service savings total &pound;1.7 billion.  A crude estimate of what this could achieve in Ireland based on the UK experience suggests that an outlay of &euro;8 million a year would return additional revenue of &euro;130 million to the Exchequer each year.</p><p> High smuggling rates must be tackled to cut off the supply of cheap tobacco which is increasing the number of young smokers.  We must give Revenue, which has lost hundreds of staff in recent years, and the similarly hard pressed Garda, the manpower and equipment they require, along with tough justice in the courts to deal with smuggling.  We must also give greater support to smokers to free them from the grip of addiction.  If such co-ordinated action is taken we can effectively tackle the health catastrophe that costs this country one of its citizens roughly every 90 minutes and massively increase tax revenues and cost savings for Ireland&rsquo;s cash starved health service.  We need new thinking about tobacco in Ireland and with this in mind, we ask members to endorse our pre-budget submission.</p></speech>

Older and Bolder is a national alliance of organisations that champions the rights of older people in Ireland.  Our member organisations are Active Retirement Ireland, Age and Opportunity, the Alzheimer Society, the Carers Association, the Irish Hospice Foundation, the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament and Senior Help Line.  Each of the alliance members has its own unique goals and work programme and Older and Bolder's role is to enable our members to speak with a collective and united voice on issues of policy and practice which are critical to the well being of older people.<br />  The issue on which Older and Bolder is currently focused, together with people of all ages and from all parts of the country, is the right to age well at home and we have called our campaign &quot;Make home work&quot;.  The campaign highlights the obstacles faced by older people, people with chronic illnesses or disabilities and children with life limiting illnesses who want to live well at home but need support to do so.  Our campaign also highlights the broader social determinants of health, such as income, transport and social participation, and shows how, together with access to home and community care services, these determinants support people in aging well at home.  The focus of our pre-budget presentation this year was guided by our campaign and I intend to avail of this opportunity to make reference to the elements of our pre-budget submission that are relevant to this committee, particularly in respect of home care services.<br />  A few months ago our campaign to make home care work became a campaign to rescue home care after the announcement by the HSE of &euro;22.5 million in cuts to home care services.  Some 18% of the cuts announced on 30 August were targeted at home care services and represented a direct attack on old, young and disabled people in their own homes.  Not only are the cuts a regressive step in terms of safe and healthy aging, they make no sense from an administrative or care management perspective.  We are already failing people who need home and community care services.  In the Republic of Ireland in 2006, 14% of older people with limiting disabilities living in the community received no care, compared with 2% in Northern Ireland.  That percentage has not changed much since then.<br />  We are being asked to accept assurances that the HSE's priority to is minimise the impact on patients of spending cuts but where is the evidence to support these assurances?  There is a complete lack of transparent information about how these cuts are actually being applied.  In the case of the home help budget the HSE has predetermined that &euro;8 million will be cut from home help services before the end of the year.  To say that the assessment process is based on a review of individual needs is misleading at best.  How is the HSE going to engage efficiently and humanely in the individualised assessment of 11 million home help hours resulting in a reduction of a million hours?  The examples we hear from around the country of people's hours and services been cut are staggering.  In one case a family received a letter from a local HSE office dated 3 September referring to the budget cuts and announcing a cut to the family's home care package.  This letter issued just two working days after the cuts were announced.  There could not have been time for a clinical assessment of needs.<br />  The whole process has raised many unanswered questions.  In the absence of home help hours and home care packages, what will happen to individuals who are medically fit for discharge from acute hospitals but need social care support to return home safely?  In the wake of cuts to home care services, will the budget for the nursing home support scheme be increased to cater for increased and earlier admissions to nursing homes?  If, as mooted, people currently in receipt of home care services are assured that a service will be maintained, what will happen to individuals and families currently awaiting assessment for access to home help and home care packages?  How will an already stretched public health nurse network meet the needs of people in the community who have identified unmet needs and who are at risk?<br />  The key underlying issue is the lack of a legislative framework for home and community care to govern individual entitlement, single assessment, quality of services, etc.  This issue once again highlights the vulnerability of community care budgets to cuts in both bad times and good in the absence of legislative protection.  Citizens in Ireland have no legal right to care in the home or community.   People do not realise this or understand the implications of it until they are in a transitional or crisis situation.  It is only when they are looking for care and support for themselves or a family member that they discover there is no right of access to care.  The need to clarify the legal situation with regard to home care has been highlighted by various bodies over many years, including the Ombudsman.  The HSE service plan for 2012 states that the HSE will continue to work with the Department of Health on legislative proposals for community services.  Exactly the same commitment was set out in the 2011 service plan and I suspect we might find it in previous plans.  The entire process is characterised by inertia and a failure to plan and act decisively.<br />  Access to home and community care is currently <i>ad hoc</i>, discretionary and dependent on one's illness, where one lives and to whom one speaks.  Older and Bolder believes it is time to put in place a commission on long-term care in Ireland so that the statistics, facts, projections for costs, population, dependency needs, etc., can be placed in the public domain and debated publicly.  The issues I have outlined reinforce the need for a planned approach to aging, which is why Older and Bolder has campaigned vigorously over the last four years for a national positive aging strategy.  The deadline of October 2012 has come and gone and we are now looking at year end before a draft reaches the Cabinet.  There can be no further delays.<br />  Cuts to home care services will devastate the prospect of safe aging at home.  Cuts to these services have again highlighted the urgency to underpin the delivery of community care services in Ireland with legislative protection and we ask the committee to take the lead in advancing this matter.  It is imperative that budget 2013 reflects the vital role home care services play in the delivery of health care in this country.  The committee's letter of 9 October 2012 calling on the Minister for Health to reverse the cuts was welcomed by those of us who champion such a move and we ask members to continue to hold to account those who would cut these services.</p></speech>

As he pointed out, the Carers Association is part of that consortium.  I will focus on two additional issues in my remarks.</p><p>  To the extent that cuts are required, there has been insufficient creativity in considering how compensatory adjustments can be made to existing budgetary frameworks and commitments.  We have made a number of proposals in our submission.  Resources are being systematically shifted from home help to home care, which appears to fit the strategy of providing resources where need is greatest.  There must be scope to backfill some of the services lost on the home help side by using labour market activation measures.</p> <p>By and large we do a certain amount of this already, and people who have gone through training in home care have very high progression rates into employment because it is a growing area, not only in terms of State services but also commercial services.</p><p> We are giving a guarded signal that we support the extension of the fair deal model into community care, which is an alternative to cuts.  However, there are problems with the current fair deal model which must be got right, and once the model is extended to community care it must be significantly tweaked because fundamental differences exist between the two.  The Government has already signalled it wants to extend free GP care to everybody, and in delivering the next step we suggest extending it to full-time carers.  There is a clear strategy to get people out of hospitals faster.  Is it possible for this strategy to incorporate as part of the discharge process a transfer of carer protocol which would include helping carers and training them so when they take ill people home they are able to look after them?</p><p> We believe absolutely that community-based services should be on a statutory basis.  With all the focus on cuts we are very concerned not enough attention is being paid to how the money that is being spent is being poorly spent.  I would nearly go so far as to say that in some cases it is being misspent.  It is not only about arguing about the margins.  The absence of a statutory basis for community care means it is now routine that somebody looking for between &euro;50 and &euro;100 a week to support a carer for a person in the home cannot get it because the money is not there but they can obtain &euro;750 a week to put someone into care because there is a statutory basis for this.  Every time this happens the State loses &euro;600 a week.  The officials, doctors and patients do not want this.  The only reason it is happening is because of the legislative framework.  It is not a budgetary issue, it is a legislative issue.</p><p> Under the Croke Park agreement it is becoming quite routine to redeploy unqualified untrained staff into roles they simply cannot carry out.  In the early stages, this had to do to some extent with work practices.  As an example, somebody can be put to bed at 3 p.m. because that person needs help to go to bed but the home help deployed to do the work will not come any later.  Leaving this aside there is an issue with regard to whether those being sent into homes to provide care are trained in moving and handling patients and are able to handle tasks such as dialysis or taking blood sugar tests, which they are not and they do not even pretend they are.  Patients need these services and they cannot get them.  This happens below the radar.  People think it is okay because there are 5,000 extra home care packages but if these packages are inadequately delivered by unqualified staff it is a waste of money and not something from which to take satisfaction.</p><p> The lack of flexibility in responding to the needs on the margins means the State system takes the easy option, particularly under the Croke Park agreement.  Where care is needed the voluntary sector is being asked to provide it at night and weekends because the State system will not do it.  People in the State system get paid higher salaries to do the easy work while the voluntary sector is kicked off to do the hard work.</p><p> These are some thoughts for the committee to reflect on.  In the current budgetary climate there is a danger of looking at cutbacks all the time.  A vast amount of money is still being spent and it is not being spent as well as it could.  This is a very important budgetary issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-08a.1297" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Dolan" time="09:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2012110800005#G00200"><p>I thank the Chair and the committee.  The Disability Federation of Ireland and its member organisations throughout the country are very appreciative of this opportunity.  I want to explain how health policy is pivotal in determining what the future will be like for disabled people and those with mental health needs and people in general in Ireland.  In the main, people with disabilities are living in communities when they become disabled and they try to stay living there.  They are not immune from the attrition of the recession in families and communities.  Committee members will know from their clinics that people with disabilities have been subject to particular cuts with regard to income and services.  An issue arises of a double hit to already vulnerable people.  In September this year and last year, the Disability Federation of Ireland and eight national organisations, including Mental Health Reform and the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies, came together to state we have gone past the point of sustainability of services as things stand.  Since last year cuts have been eating into the level of services people require.  We also have information on demographics and greater need.</p><p>  These cuts and restrictions also undermine the social infrastructure which enables people with disabilities to live independently and stay out of hospitals and long-stay institutions.  The events of late August and early September with regard to cuts to personal assistants and home help, and the issue raised in recent weeks with regard to the mobility allowance, have torn the confidence of people with disabilities and their families with regard to the stated intent of the Government to protect the vulnerable.  People do not feel this is happening and they do not have confidence it is being brought through.</p><p>  Cuts to personal assistants and home help puts more pressure on hospitals and long-care institutions.  It needs to be understood that the best way to take pressure off hospitals is to have fewer people requiring them for shorter periods of time and to put the focus where it is needed.  Voluntary disability organisations, families and carers are at breaking point.  To put it very starkly, the patient will be dead before the austerity medicine works.  This is our stark assessment of the situation.  The cuts are coming too hard and too fast for people and organisations, whether the HSE or voluntary organisations, to be able to react.</p><p>  For the past two years this country has had a plan with the troika with regard to income and expenditure.  We have a jobs plan.  Over a similar period of time, since the Government came to power, it has had a commitment to have a plan to protect the national disability strategy.  This plan is not yet in place.  The earliest it will be put in place is January or February next year.  A budget will be announced in four weeks' time which will make it more difficult to have coherence around this issue.  There is an imbalance in Government policy thinking.  Much work is being done on the economic side, which is right, but there does not seem to be any similar coherence or multi-annual planning to have what I broadly call a social infrastructure for people, whether they are disabled, children or elderly.</p><p>  Disability and mental health issues and chronic conditions of all types are a risk contingency faced by every person in the country.  Not everybody is directly affected but those we know and love and those around us will at some stage be affected.  Only the Government can underwrite this and try to put a floor under it.</p><p>  A value for money report was published a number of months ago on disability services.  It did not deal with a plethora of supports and services which are very much involved in the community and supporting people and their families.  Disability policy and health are central to Irish success and well-being in the long term.</p> <p>Members of the Oireachtas make the decisions.  They must either weigh up the risks of making decisions that further reduce services to people with disabilities, mental health needs and so on while at the same time degrading the sustainability of Ireland's social infrastructure, or instead recognise that, through practice rather than rhetoric, action must be taken by Government.  Further service reductions will be devastating to people and, equally, to Ireland's resilience and future performance.</p><p> The Chairman is from Cork.  He knows that sustained rain followed by a high tide results in flooding.</p></speech>

The same happens everywhere when two things happen at the wrong time.  Some 80% to 90% of costs, be it for the State or a voluntary organisation, cannot reduce in the short to medium term under the Croke Park Agreement.  This, coupled with the &euro;2 in savings achieved as a result of service reductions, &euro;1 of which will go into the Exchequer pot, leads to a loss of services for people.  This is the quandary.  The community and disability sector wants to work with Government and everybody else to keep services in place.  We need leadership and signposting from Government to do so effectively.</p></speech>

However, the evidence is that this is untrue.  Perhaps Mr. Dolan would set out his evidence in this regard.  Who is carrying out the medical assessments?  Are they being undertaken by a person at a desk or by a caller to the person's home?  What is the cost of the assessment?  Is it counter-productive?  For example, is the cost of carrying out these assessments greater than the amount which will be saved?  Also, does this place a further administrative burden on the provision of home help?  I have always said that I believe it is counter-productive to leave people with no choice but to go into long-term nursing home care because this places a greater financial burden on the Exchequer and the person concerned, who would probably prefer to remain in his or her home.</p><p>  On the presentation by the Carers' Association, no reference was made in its opening statement to the length of time carers are waiting for their applications to be processed by the Department of Social Protection.  This issue has been raised with me on a number of occasions.  Carers are people who are working for their social welfare payment.  Many of these people are waiting in excess of nine months to have their applications processed.  In many instances, initial applications are being refused, leaving them to engage in a lengthy appeals process.  Perhaps Mr. Dunne would indicate the experience of his organisation in this regard and would say if he has any statistics which would back up the claims I make.</p><p>  Mr. Dunne set out areas where he believes money could be better spent, which is welcome.  Perhaps he would enlighten us further in this regard.</p></speech>

I am of similar mind to the views expressed by Mr. Chris Macey of the Irish Heart Foundation and Mr. John McCormack of the Irish Cancer Society, whose respective contributions I welcome.  In the limited time available to me, it will not be possible for me to direct questions to all five lead speakers.</p><p>  I would like to highlight a couple of issues and to direct my first questions to Mr. John Dunne of the Carers Association and Mr. Sean Dillon of Older and Bolder.  I received a reply yesterday to parliamentary questions on home help hours and home care packages.  The figures with which I was provided in this regard are very worrying.  The figure in respect of the number of people in receipt of home help hours and home care packages indicates a very worrying trend.  A large number of those in receipt of these reports are receiving reduced supports, namely, shorter and-or fewer attendances by their home help hour providers.  This indicates that from 31 December 2010 to the end of July 2012, there were 3,701 fewer people in receipt of home help hours.  During the corresponding period, there was an increase of 1,159 in the number of home care packages.  However, the net reduction in terms of recipients of home supports was in excess of 2,500.  This does not reflect the real impact of cuts.  We are deeply alarmed that in some instances home help time has been reduced to 15 minutes.  It is important these facts and figures are spelled out.  Everyone knows what is happening.</p><p>  I am happy to report to Older and Bolder and the Carers Association that this committee unanimously adopted a proposal from me and wrote to the Minister asking that the proposed cuts not proceed.  However, we now know that they have been applied since the last bank holiday weekend.  This is an opportunity for all of us, Government and Opposition, to support the case that not only should there not be further cuts in terms of budget 2013 but that there should be a reversal of the cuts implemented, which are impacting furiously.</p><p>  My final question is to Mr. John Dolan of the Disability Federation of Ireland.  Mr. Dolan referred in his submission to an implementation plan in relation to the national disability strategy.  There is no such plan yet in place, which is outrageous.  This committee has a role to play in this area and should write to the Minister about this issue following today's meeting.</p></speech>

I am awaiting a reply to a parliamentary question to the Minister on this issue.  I had hoped to have that response with me today.  However, perhaps Mr. Dolan will say, authoritatively or from an informed and speculative basis, what would have been the impact, had it proceeded, of the &euro;10 million cut to the provision of personal assistance to people with disabilities, which had been signalled as part of the package of &euro;130 million in cuts?  We need to know what would have been the impact of that &euro;10 million in cuts and how this related proportionately to the overall provision on an annual basis of those supports for personal assistance for those who have that right and need.</p></speech>

I thank the organisations for their submissions.  I endorse the submissions of the Irish Heart Foundation and Irish Cancer Society.</p> <p>I agree with the idea of an annual price escalator.  To some extent, the banning of smoking in public places a number of years ago led to us sitting on our laurels and we must focus on the presentations as a result.</p><p> I have a question for the other three organisations.  I agree with the comments of previous speakers but the key question raised by all the organisations relates to quality of life for the people they represent.  That quality of life relates to home and community-based services and the fact there is no statutory basis for the services.  Will the representatives of the organisations deal with that?  I agree that this committee can spearhead the provision of a statutory basis for these services but will the witnesses comment on that aspect?  It is key to an acceptable quality of life for people.</p></speech>

I am concerned about the way the adjustments were made to home care packages in the past few months.  One of the problems arising is that because people doing home help or care are not permanent and pensionable, it is an easy element to cut.  I raise the idea of getting the Department to ring-fence the home help budget for 2013 so that in August 2013, if there is a budgetary problem with the HSE, we will not be going first to the element that is not permanent and pensionable or the home care packages.  That should be done.</p><p>  I met somebody the other day who was getting half a carer's allowance, which is &euro;100 per week.  The person's mother has Alzheimer's disease and it is a full-time job taking care of her.  That person is saving &euro;900 per week for the State because it would cost &euro;1,000 per week for a place in a nursing home.  We must be very proactive in ensuring we do not have a repetition of what has happened this year in 2013.  The only way of doing this is by ring-fencing the budget within the HSE right across the country.</p><p>  I support fully the comments of the witnesses and we must support people.  We must grow the number of people we can keep at home for longer than in the past.  We must ensure this can be done through future budget planning as well.  I am not sure of the view of the witnesses on ring-fencing the budget.</p></speech>

They all do wonderful work.  I am not ignoring the gentlemen from the Irish Heart Foundation but I have three or four questions for the other witnesses.  It is almost like "speed questioning" so I will not waste time.  I have particular respect for the work done by Mr. Dillon's organisation.  I believe we could have found the &euro;8 million savings inflicted in September and, along with my committee colleagues, we are very disheartened by it.  Moreover, we continue to investigate it.  The cuts across the country are starting to become clear and people are beginning to complain in all our constituency offices.  Some counties seem far more affected than others.  Is there any feedback on what is happening around the country?</p><p>  I have met with local people concerned with carer's allowance in the past number of weeks and there is a particular fear that the half carer's allowance will be cut in this budget.  Will Mr. Dillon give an indication of why his organisation sees that coming?  He argued earlier that we are misspending our current budget despite the fact it is shrinking.  Will he outline how this is happening?  Will he tell us who is the gentleman being put to bed at 3.30 p.m., as that is outrageous?</p><p>  I met Mr. Dillon earlier this year and we spoke about the older persons strategy.  The carer strategy was finally launched this year.  We are waiting on the disability strategy.  Is the same person in the HSE producing all these strategies?  Is that why we are waiting on them in chronological order?  I am joking and I hope it is not the same person doing them.  If the same person is doing them, could the committee address the issue and seek other resources, seeing as there are thousands of people in the HSE who could examine the strategies?</p><p>  The HSE is apparently to remove disability services aimed directly at servicing children's special schools.  Is that true or is the matter being investigated?</p></speech>

I will answer in the order the questions were asked and if that is not sufficient, members should feel free to come back in.  We have no confidence that implementation of the cuts is being done in a medically or clinically driven manner and the numbers do not allow that to happen.  If 1 million hours are to be taken from 11 million hours in order to meet an &euro;8 million budget reduction in home help over a couple of months, how else can this be done?</p></speech>

Is it a unilateral process?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-08a.1313" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sean Dillon" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2012110800007#J00700"><p>It is very hard to get precise information on how the HSE is implementing the process, although we have asked to know how it is happening.  The evidence percolating from the ground is that the HSE is picking an arbitrary figure of a number of hours based on percentage needs, and a directive will go out that there must be a reduction of 2,000 hours in an area, for example.  If the supply exceeds demand, there is no problem but we know demand for these services far exceeds any supply.  As this is a budgetary matter, there must be a reduction.  We have heard cases where an hour is reduced to 30 minutes or 30 minutes is reduced to 15 minutes.  The 15-minute unit seems to be entering some equations.</p><p>  There are approximately 10,000 people in receipt of a home care package and according to some parliamentary questions, approximately 40,000 or 50,000 people get home help service.  The argument is that we will be able to review that in time to deliver these cuts; in reviewing the process we will be able to reduce the service sufficiently to save &euro;8 million.  The public health nurses are at the end of their wits because, quite unfairly, they must play God.  They get a direction from a local HSE office that 100 hours must be cut, for example, and some person therefore has to lose the service.  One of the easiest ways to accomplish this is by taking 15 minutes from everybody.  The letter I mentioned is from a local HSE office within 50 miles of here and is dated 3 September.  In most cases it is a desk-based cut.</p><p>  With regard to the statutory basis for quality of life, we fully endorse the need to introduce legislation to protect community services.  The fair deal nursing home scheme affects approximately 5% of older people, with approximately 530,000 people over 65 in the country.  Approximately 30,000 of those people are in long-term residential homes.  We have legislated for that through the fair deal scheme.  I am not saying the remaining 95% need a carer service but in most cases the service needed would be a community or home-based service.  If we believe in the continuum of care, ranging from a little home help to end-of-life care - our colleagues in the Irish Hospice Foundation can give more detail on that - there are different care needs along that continuum.  We must ring-fence and protect the budget used in that respect.</p><p>  There was a question as to why this is happening differently in certain areas, and this is down to discretion.  Where there is discretion, the cut opted for is usually the easiest and quickest.</p> <p>Therefore, the allocation of the service is discretionary and the cut is discretionary.  That is why we need to ring-fence the funding.</p></speech>

As Mr. John Dunne pointed out, the HSE has an obligation in terms of funding for the fair deal scheme.  If one enters that system and qualifies then one will receive it.  However, if one qualifies for a home care service one does not necessarily get it.  The difference is that a person does not have to receive it.</p><p>  It is the Department of Health that dictates the strategy and not the HSE.  There is an office for older persons.  I know that one person provided the carer's strategy which had a knock-on effect on the positive ageing strategy.  It is my belief that there is a resources issue.  The development of national policies should not depend on each other.  There should be enough of a distribution and allocation of resources to implement them concurrently because both strategies feed into each other.   </p></speech>

I have no problem going on the record to say that delays are unacceptable.  Unfortunately, the Minister has no problem going on the record either but delays continue.  I shall not dwell on the matter because it does not come under the committee's remit.</p><p>  The Deputy was polite.  I have said that money is being wasted and have gone beyond saying that it could be better spent.  I am concerned about the matter.  If it needs colourful language to make people think about the matter then I shall repeat that money is being wasted.  </p></speech>

It is not so much the Department because operationally it is a matter for the HSE which acknowledges the problems.  I have said to the HSE that I believe that it is a systemic issue and it has asked for examples.  It wants to know the name of the guy being put to bed.  The point is that we can all sort out the problem for the guy who must be put to bed.  The problem is the 19 other cases that we do not know about.  I have quite a colourful spectrum of stories from across the country.  Individual carers are terrified and, to be fair to the HSE, their approach is not necessarily a rational one.  Those carers are terrified that if they complain they will lose their jobs, particularly in the current climate of cutbacks.  They think that if they complain they might lose their jobs and, therefore, they will not complain.</p></speech>

It is not a diktat from an official and I do not suggest that there is badness anywhere.  It is my assessment that there is a culture, in certain parts of the public service, where people do their job on their terms.  Under the Croke Park agreement they continue to do their job on their terms but have now been moved to a new job.  I do not know the individual that I am talking about but I presume that his or her previous job involved doing home help.  That means that he or she stayed in the company of a person and did a bit of housekeeping, shopping or whatever.  The work was not time critical and the carer was wanted in the middle of the day.  The person has now been redeployed to a different sort of job which involves giving a certain degree of personal care and helping somebody into bed.  There has been a vocal campaign on their behalf - and I am being general here - that these people deserve work and must be given work.  In order to do that they are being redeployed.  I have no issue, in principle, with that as long as he or she is properly trained and accepts that if he or she has a different job that it is done appropriately.  The problem is that there been a culture of mismanagement within the system and there does not seem to be an ability to drive change.  I do not suggest that there is badness anywhere.  There are gaps in the system and there is a cultural and systemic problem.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in raised the issue of cuts.  Obviously there have been cutbacks.  Deputy Regina Doherty also raised the matter in terms of a geographical spread.  Two shifts have taken place and both are strategically sensible.  First, there has been a shift from home care to home help.  Where resources are scarce it makes sense to concentrate available resources on the people who have the greatest level of dependency but one must not write off others.  That is why we asked for that piece to be backfilled.  </p><p>  Second, for some strange reason there has always been a better level of home help and home care support in the south and west than in Dublin and along the east coast.  The HSE is trying to strategically re-align its spending in that area to match the demographic.  It is hard to argue with that aspiration.   </p><p>  The net reduction of 2,500 in terms of recipients of home supports was mentioned.  At this stage people are experiencing substantial cuts but they tend to be marginal rather than a total abolition of services.  We must bear in mind that there is a constant turnover in home care and home help, particularly in home help, when people die or go into residential institutions.  That results in significant savings in the short-term because the budget paid for home care is not reallocated but then there is a longer queue created because people must wait for new services.  </p><p>  Senator Burke asked for home care funding to be ring-fenced.  I shall return to the management culture and state that I am more than slightly nervous at the concept of ring-fencing.  We need change but ring-fencing would create an obstacle.  I shall return to the statutory obligation and ask for equal priority to be given to the two pots of money.  It would ensure that it is not a matter of having no home care or giving six times as much funding to put a person's granny where she does not want to be.  That is literally where we are at and is purely down to legislation.  The provision is not even politically controversial because the previous Government prioritised it and the current Government has it somewhere on its shopping list.  The Government is wasting money every week that we are without that legislation.   </p><p>  I shall make a final point on the institutional side of the debate.  Mr. Dillon is right that it is the Department of Health rather than the HSE that writes the strategies.  It is the same group of officials who will write the legislation and that is where extra staff resources could be provided.  Enacting the legislation is the single most important thing the committee could do for the sector.  </p></speech>

Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked two questions on the implementation plan and the national disability strategy, NDS.  I shall add the question by Deputy Regina Doherty to them.</p><p>  The national disability strategy has been in existence for the past six or seven years.  There has always been an issue about adding an implementation element to it.  The strategy is a Government plan and is not just for the Department of Health.  It is potentially quite powerful because it can examine the determinants of health and the interconnection between health, social welfare, education, employment and factors like that.  The problem is that we will not have it until January or February because it has been delayed three times this year and that is since the Government took over.  The strategy will come after the next budget which may contain the same level cuts as last year, perhaps more.  That is a big issue.  The Croke Park agreement is also still in place.  There has been talk about adjusting the Croke Park agreement and formulating a Croke Park II but that would be two budgets away.  The strategy is also connected with public service reform but nobody has copped on to that.  There is a broad disability strategy and there are strategies for carers and children.  It is helpful if one can see that all of the strategies are interwoven.</p><p>  During the last debate before the general election, the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste were asked by Miriam O'Callaghan to identify one social justice priority.  In a flash the T&aacute;naiste said that it would be the disabled and the Taoiseach spoke eloquently about people with mental health needs.  Unfortunately, they have not put their words into action.  </p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked about the decisions that have been taken, particularly the &euro;10 million cut to the personal assistance service announced on 30 August.  How could &euro;10 million be saved from the &euro;40 million budget for personal assistants with four months remaining in this year without closing down the service lock, stock and barrel?  Like my colleague, Mr. John Dunne, I do not think anyone was trying to do that.  At a senior level in the Department of Health and the HSE people had just carried out a value for money report on the disability programme.  The big issue for people with a governance concern about health is why was such a consequence not spotted earlier.  We very much welcome that the proposal has been withdrawn and that the cuts will be made somewhere else. </p><p>  Deputy Healy raised a quality of life issue but I shall not spend time discussing it.  Everyone has said, in different ways, that quality of life is about keeping people where they want to be, with their families, and providing support to people, often at a modest level, at an appropriate time and in an appropriate manner.  </p> <p>There was a question from Deputy Doherty about children in special schools.  I do not have any evidence on that.  We can talk to the Deputy later, or perhaps our colleagues who will speak later might have some idea.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-08a.1325" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1068" speakername="Peter Fitzpatrick" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2012110800009#L00200"><p>I welcome the witnesses.  The presentations were excellent.  I am a Government backbencher and none of us wishes to impose any cuts on anybody.  If there are cuts, it is important they are minimised.  I have been talking to the Minister, and I am trying to do my best for all the groups.</p><p>  Mr. Chris Macey gave me a shock, and it is not because I am a non-smoker.  A total of 79% of the price of a packet of cigarettes goes to the Government, while in the UK 90% of the price goes to the government.  That is not acceptable.  He said the tobacco industry makes &euro;1.36 billion in profits per year and that it is subsidised by Irish taxpayers to the sum of &euro;1 billion.  It has reached the stage that we will have to examine the damage tobacco is doing to people.  Cancer is an awful disease and I have experience with it because my father died from lung cancer.  It was due mainly to smoking, which put me off cigarettes.  My father got up every day at 7 a.m.  In our house the living room and kitchen were one big room and for 15 or 20 minutes every morning it was unbelievable to listen to him coughing.  It was only a matter of time but we could not get him off cigarettes.  The Government will have to put some type of levy on smoking tobacco and the money should go back to the medical people, the HSE, cancer research or the Irish Heart Foundation.  At this stage the industry is making far too much profit.  It is sickening.  The Minister is talking about introducing a smoking ban in cars carrying children.  That is very important.  I am delighted with the smoking ban because I like a night out in a restaurant for a meal.</p><p>  I have met Mr. Sean Dillon on a few occasions and he is doing a fantastic job.  In fact, I met him in Drogheda.</p></speech>

Cuts of 14% from 2008 to 2011 is a lot.  Mr. Dillon has a fantastic organisation and we will all try to help him.  People think the Government is imposing these cuts purposely, but that is not the case.  The bottom line is that the country is bankrupt and we are trying to do our best.  Health is a very important issue at present and the commitment we will give is that any cuts will be minimised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-08a.1328" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1147" speakername="John Crown" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2012110800009#L00500"><p>I welcome our guests.  Obviously, I join in the support for a gradual ratcheting up of the pressure on the tobacco industry.  I favour punitive levels of tax on its profits.  There is nothing about the tobacco industry we should be trying to protect.  There is no economic argument in the macroeconomics of the country to support keeping the tobacco industry running either nationally or internationally.  A great deal of nonsense is talked about the critical importance of the tobacco industry to farmers, manufacturers and so forth.  There is a colossal opportunity cost associated with the money which is spent on tobacco products, in addition to the obvious health and, indeed, moral benefits which would accrue from everybody stopping smoking.  There would be vast economic benefits.  For that reason we must understand that the tobacco industry, although it is legal, is unethical and evil.  We should be trying to stamp it out.  That should be our goal.  These are people whose business plan can be summed up in four words: addict children to carcinogens.  If the tobacco company does not do that, it fails.</p><p>  For that reason I support the increase in tax, but I would go further.  During the six months when Ireland holds the Presidency of the EU, I propose a very far-reaching policy which I believe our Government should espouse and which every Member of the Houses should support.  We should get the EU to commit itself to the idea that by the year 2030 it will be illegal to do any commerce in tobacco, that is, grow it for profit, sell it, import it and manufacture products.  If we invented tobacco tomorrow, it would not be legal.  There is no doubt about that.  Substances which are far less carcinogenic than tobacco products are routinely banned.  They cannot be used in the manufacturing, environmental and many other sectors.  We would never allow it.  It is here because it has been grandfathered in, so we should commit ourselves to that policy.  As a step along that route, we should also consider a very concise, EU directive that bans any contact between a tobacco company and a public relations company until such time as we implement a complete commercial ban.  We have no business allowing the industry to use propaganda to get more addicts.</p></speech>

There is great merit in what the organisation is doing, but perhaps the witness would discuss the logistics of it.</p><p>  With regard to the other presentations, I have a question about home help.  Is there not a problem with the consistency of home help delivery throughout the country?  In some parts of the country there are one hour allocations while in others there are 15 minute allocations.  There is also an inconsistency in what home help provides.  It is personal care in my part of the country and in many others, but in other areas it also includes home support, for example, assisting a person who lives in an isolated area.  That lack of consistency is causing significant anomalies and people are losing out.</p><p>  In the three presentations from Mr. John Dunne, Mr. John McCormack and Mr. Sean Dillon there is a consistent theme that there is a lack of joined-up thinking between the acute sector, the hospitals, and the community sector and that significant savings could be made if there were joined-up thinking in that context.  I have a question for Mr. John Dunne on that issue.  There is a statutory right to nursing home subvention, or the fair deal scheme.  He is arguing that this statutory right should be extended to community services.  In the current economic climate that statutory right will not be extended.  What is being considered at present is that a similar means assessment would be introduced for community services as is currently in place for the fair deal scheme.  Is there an argument to be made to move that a step further whereby if an applicant is approved for the fair deal scheme, they can have the option of going into long-term residential care or having a community fair deal package put in place?  It is a type of middle ground but it ensures that elderly people are not left in a position where they must either go into the home or be left without any services.</p></speech>

It is a pity Deputy Kelleher and Deputy Troy are not here.  They left in good time because I had intended to slate them.  The reason we are here is the reckless spending of previous Governments over the past 15 years.</p><p>  I started to read the organisations' budgets and presentations at 10 p.m. yesterday when I returned from canvassing for the referendum.  I went to bed at 11.15 p.m. and got up at 5 a.m. today to continue reading them.  I was astonished the Chairman would have nine groups before the committee today and wondered how we would deal with them.

As I said in the Chamber a few weeks ago, I am not the straw man or the tin man in "The Wizard of Oz".  I have a heart.  Parents on both sides of my family have needed carers, home help and every service to help people remain in their home.  What I say next will probably contradict what I have just said, but I cannot disagree with anything the representatives of the Irish Heart Foundation and the Irish Cancer Society said.  I also support Senator Crown on this.  I pass the Coombe Hospital every day on my way home and it is bewildering to see people standing with a drip in one arm and a smoke in the other hand.  I had reason to visit a person who was ill in St. James's Hospital two weeks ago and was surprised to see people were still standing outside smoking.  I met a lady three weeks ago when I was canvassing for the referendum and she stood at the door and complained that she was waiting for 12 weeks for a pair of socks from the HSE, yet she could tell me that she smokes 25 cigarettes a day.  People in this country need to wake up.</p> <p>Its costs amount to &euro;29 billion and we must examine the management of people being addicted to things.  Senator Crown is not far off my opinion on this.</p><p> I have two further comments.  I apologise for taking so long but I thought it was important to tell those two stories.  I am in favour of the review of home help services.  With relatives, friends and parents, I have experience of home helps coming into the house for one hour and spending half of the time having a slice of toast and a cup of tea.  This is not about companionship, it is about helping a woman with one leg to be able to make a cup of tea, about sitting her down and taking care of her needs.  There is a need to review the home help service.  This the beginning of a new era.  In communities, people are beginning to cop on that Mary will not come in to sit down with the person for an hour.  People have family, friends and neighbours and we need to look into services in the community.  There are plenty of organisations and there are many unemployed people who are willing to do something different in the community with their lives while they are unemployed.  That must be part of it.  I have not yet finished.</p></speech>

I read the submission last night and I think the political pun contained in it is unwelcome.  I will leave the House whenever people decide not to elect me.  I hope not to receive a pension until I am 68 years of age.  I am not interested in what happened in the past in political life in this building, I am interested in the future.  As public representatives, we must respect the fact that we will not receive a pension when we leave the premises.  I agree with the idea and it was not necessary to have it otherwise.  I agree with the suggestion regarding carers having more than six weeks after the person they have been caring for has departed.  I do not agree with a period of a year but I support the idea of six months.</p><p>  Why does someone who is a full-time carer want a free GP card?  Perhaps I read the suggestion wrong but that is what I picked up.  The submission refers to record numbers of people with physical disabilities.  What disabilities do these people have if they are carers?  What records exist?  Perhaps the witnesses are telling me that someone who was a carer ends up with a physical disability from being a carer.  What are these physical disabilities?  I do not know anyone who has been a carer who has a disability after the loved one dies.  Perhaps I am living on a different planet.  I want to say much more but the Chairman will not allow it.</p></speech>

I endorse everything he said, which would represent a better future than the present world.  Regarding Senator Crown's comments on the tobacco industry and its PR machine, the big red herring is that tax is fuelling smuggling.  Evidence from the UK this week contradicts that point.  The UK has had a tax escalator over the past ten years of 2-5% and cigarettes in the UK are more expensive than they are here.  The price equates to approximately &euro;9.30, when converted, in the UK and &euro;9.20 here.  At the same time, the UK has reduced the smuggling rate from 21% to 9%.  It has done so by enforcement.  While Ireland has laid off hundreds of customs officers, the UK has introduced better enforcement and spent money on cessation activities in a way Ireland does not.  It has reduced the number of smokers by 2 million and child smokers by 50%.  It has reduced its smuggling rate while increasing taxes.  The UK takes in an extra &pound;2.9 million for an outlay of &pound;300 million in that area.</p><p>  In response to Deputy Naughten's question, there is an EU issue in terms of a regulator.  We have had discussions with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance and both sides are checking out the legal aspects of it.  They are interested in the proposal but there is legal work to be done.  As a concept, it's time is coming.</p><p>  Deputy Catherine Byrne's comments on people smoking outside hospitals with drips shows the addictive nature of it.</p></speech>

Is there anything we can do in legislation, beyond introducing the smoking ban, in respect of the confines of a hospital and its perimeter?  Mr. Macey is correct that it is appalling to see patients or staff members, particularly in a hospital, smoking at the gate or in a bus shelter.  It is unacceptable.  I am not against the rights of people to choose to smoke.</p></speech>

Studies show the duplicity of the tobacco industry.  The nicotine content of cigarettes is on the increase all the time so it is becoming more difficult to give up smoking.  We have a proposal from the Department of Finance to set up a group and bring in Departments and the tobacco industry to talk about these issues.  It is against the WHO framework convention on tobacco control, to which Ireland is a signatory, but we must also question what the tobacco industry can do to help us sort out the issues of tobacco control.  The industry is not interested in that.</p></speech>

One of the countries with the greatest smuggling problem is Estonia, even though it has the cheapest cigarettes.  The link between the high price of cigarettes and smuggling is a fallacy created by the tobacco industry.  We have heard much about the resources needed.  The budget submission from the Irish Heart Foundation and the Irish Cancer Society amounts to &euro;150 million on the table.  Some &euro;150 million is on the table by taking more money from big tobacco because of the havoc it is causing to the health of Irish people.</p><p>  Deputy Catherine Byrne referred to the Coombe hospital.  The tobacco industry is expert at marketing to women.  It has pink, soft cigarettes with soft packaging that is particularly aimed at women.  The rate of lung cancer is increasing and more women in Ireland die from lung cancer than from breast cancer.  Smoking rates are rising among women and falling among men.  Much of this is due to the fact that the tobacco industry is expert at recruiting young women to smoke.  It is crucial the tobacco industry is taxed out of existence so that it can commit less money to PR and marketing to young women.</p></speech>

The first was from Deputy Denis Naughten on the consistency of service delivery.

There is a difference between home help and home care packages.  The home care service is called enhanced home care because it is a far higher dependency type service.  Personal care enters the equation.</p> <p>That service was tendered and at least it introduced an element of regulation and standards to the home help service.</p><p> The difference between home help and home care packages is causing some of the problems.  Ultimately all these things should be based on need and the assessment of need.  A standardised needs assessment would allow for a determination of the nature of the care plan required.  The HSE has a pilot project for single assessment.  This is behind schedule.  However, it will mean that whether a person is in Donegal or west Clare, south Cork or Dublin, the same assessment of the individual's care needs will apply.  This should at least begin the process of standardisation of the delivery of care.  </p><p> Deputy Catherine Byrne asked about a review of the home help service.  Our concern is for the person who receives the service and we will wholeheartedly support anything that improves it.  However, instead of the review to determine the problems, we note that the service is cut in advance of any review.  The demand far exceeds the supply.  I suggest we should see how the service can be improved rather than cutting the supply in the face of increased demand.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-08a.1354" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Dunne" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2012110800011#N00200"><p>Deputy Naughten raised the matter of consistency.  We carried out a listening exercise early in the year.  I travelled around the country and I met groups.  We asked them whether they noted a difference between the two services.  It seems to boil down to whoever is delivering the service.  If one had a good person it did not matter what hat he or she was wearing when they went into a house and the reverse applied with a person who was not so good.  As Mr. Dillon said, there is a lack of consistent management and as a consequence some of the money is being wasted and better results could be achieved.  Mr. Dillon also referred to the issue of standards.  The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, has stated it will be unable to regulate home care until 2016.  In fairness to the authority, it has been very clear in stating what it wishes to do in the meantime.  We would be of the view that we are more important but at least it is a considered position.  In the meantime, the HSE has begun to put in place its own framework using this competitive tender and applying standards.  The difficulty now is that the HSE is cutting across that.  The people who won the right to deliver services based on that tender are now being displaced by home helps who are neither qualified nor trained and to whom these standards are not being applied.  The system demands certain qualifications but the staff delivering the care are not qualified.  This is a fundamental issue but when I raised it with the HSE the response was that it was hoped to sort the problem in the next year or two.  If I said to anyone that I would sort something out in the next year or two, I know what the public sector's response would be if that were to be my defence.</p><p>  On the question of a statutory right, there is a statutory right to residential care but in the current financial climate there is no prospect of a statutory right for community care.  For God's sake, legislators have created a statutory right for the most expensive option.  If a statutory right for the cheaper option is not created, the State will be condemned to spending money on the most expensive option.  </p><p>  I thank Deputy Byrne for taking the time to read the submission.  I was not making a cheap political shot.  I made a very deliberate decision that we would put nothing in our pre-budget submission that we could not say how it would be paid for.  I refer to the question of the transition period.  A carer who has spent a lifetime caring for a person is formally unemployed six weeks after the person dies and the system then forgets about them.  It was a question of how to pay this cost.  At the time there was the issue of those who had been county councillors who had to forego the dual mandate and were compensated.  To be clear, we did not say that those payments should be abolished.  We simply argued that a very small allocation from the pot would pay for this transition.  I do not apologise but it was not a cheap shot.</p><p>  On the question of why full-time carers want a free GP card, the carer's strategy highlights the very obvious connection, which is acknowledged by the Government, that carers are doing a job for the State.  I do not like the notion that they are working for their social welfare payment.  They are saving the State a lot of money.  They need their health in order to do the job.  Employees, even when unpaid, are entitled to holidays and to a certain level of health and safety consideration.  This leads on to the point about physical disability.  I can describe a case of a big man who is bedridden and his wife, who is of small build, is the carer.  The assessment decided it would take two people to move that person from the bed and the HSE decided it could not spare two people.  It left the wife to do it.  Patient moving or handling cause physical injury to carers.  A body is heavy to move and our system does not even provide training to people on how to do it, never mind to provide help.  That is how carers suffer physical ill-health but they also suffer distress and stress.</p><p>  Carers also suffer in another third way.  I can describe a case.  A daughter who cares for her mother needed to go into hospital.  She was advised to bring her mother to the accident and emergency department and to leave her there.  We intervened and the matter was dealt with in a different way.  In such situations it is often the case that carers will not go into hospital.  They will put their own care on hold and in the long term, the health of both people collapses.  </p></speech>

The country is bankrupt in the sense that we do not have income to meet expenditure.  The trick for any social democratic State is to ensure we are not also socially and morally bankrupt.  We have to find or try to find a way to match the growing needs with the available resources.  Many people in this country are unemployed, unfortunately.  That is the crux.  It cannot be a case of telling people that we are broke, that they should go away and return when we are flush.  I know the Deputy does not mean it that way.</p><p>  Deputy Naughten spoke about the lack of joined-up thinking between acute and community care and the possibility of savings.  I am loath to talk about the savings.  The issue is that we have a big demographic profile in this area.  Ironically, the success in the health area over the past 15 years in bringing down the mortality rate has increased the morbidity rate.  We did not take this on board.  People who survive strokes do not go out to play football the next day; they have conditions and suffer losses as a result.  It is the case that, thank God, more people with disabilities are being born who would not have survived to birth ten or 20 years ago.  According to the Health Research Board, the number of people waiting for personal assistant services, home help services and care attendant services equals the number of people who have these services.  Therefore, the demographic factor must be considered in the equation.</p><p>  Deputy Byrne referred to the work of home helps.  I spoke about trying to get some kind of national cohesion, some kind of social plan from the Government.  Many community groups and organisations could be supported as part of an overall Government approach.  She is correct that it should involve neighbours and local groups befriending people and this is what voluntary groups do.  Then the very particular skill-sets and services that are required can be marshalled and people can be paid to provide them.</p><p>  I thank all the members for their interest.  </p></speech>

I am conscious that I could speak at length so I have decided to keep it short and deal with the issue of child income supports and squeeze in the issue of the new child and family support agency.</p><p>  I am Maria Corbett and I am with the Children's Rights Alliance.  The alliance is a coalition of 100 organisations which are working to promote children's rights and to make the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child a reality in Ireland.  We are very interested in the budget which has a major impact on children.</p><p>  The Government in its programme for Government made a commitment to the establishment of a new child and family support agency early next year.  In last year's budget the Government created a new Vote for the new agency.  The new agency comprises the Family Support Agency, which has a clear budget and also the child and family services of the HSE.  It is unclear what budget the HSE allocated specifically for its child and family service as this information was not in the public domain up to now.  It is unclear what the HSE will allocate to the new agency.  It is absolutely critical that we ensure that sufficient resources are granted to the new agency. </p><p>  The new child and family support agency to be formally established next year will be a statutory body tasked with promoting the welfare and protection of children.  It will also be tasked with supporting families in Ireland.  It is absolutely critical that it gets an adequate budget and that it starts on the right foot.</p><p>  I urge the committee in its work on children and the budget to watch the funding of this new agency closely.  I understand the legislation establishing this new agency will come to the committee.  I am flagging it for members and perhaps we can engage with them when they are reviewing the legislation.</p><p>  I am almost loth to mention the children's referendum on Saturday, 10 November.  If that referendum is passed, and we are strongly advocating a "Yes" vote, issues will need to be considered by this committee.  Perhaps we can consider how best to address the questions of legislation and resources to make the outcome of the referendum a reality.</p><p>  My main focus is on child income supports.  People will know that throughout the years of the Celtic tiger, Ireland did not address the serious issue of child poverty.  It is a national scandal that in a wealthy modern western European country we still have such a high rate of child poverty.  The figures are astonishing.  Almost one fifth of children in Ireland are living below the poverty line.  Of those approximately 8% of children are living in deep poverty.  That is just not acceptable in this day and age.  We need to grasp this problem.  We need to set out at a political level an ambitious child poverty target so that we begin to address this issue and take ownership of it.  I am aware that we are in straitened economic times and that we need to figure out what to do with the annual budget.  I am also aware that we spend a significant proportion, 2.2%, of GDP on child income support.  I am conscious that money is invested in this area.</p><p>  The issue I wish to raise is whether that money is being spent in the best possible way.  It is absolutely critical that we ensure that cash and other supports go to vulnerable families.  There are many families who are really struggling.  The child benefit payment is an integral part of the support.  While I acknowledge the child benefit payment needs to be reformed, I am also flagging that it would be very destabilising to make a dramatic change to the child benefit for the families who depend on it.  The reality is that families with children are three times more likely to be in debt from ordinary household expenses.  We need to be very conscious that Ireland has a very vulnerable population with children.</p><p>  Our official position is that we do not wish child benefit payment to be cut, to be means tested or to be taxed but we are in favour of reform.  The Department of Social Protection has produced a set of proposals around it.  I wish to give members a sense of the direction in which we are leading on this issue.</p></speech>

I believe the committee has received our pre-budget submission in advance.</p><p>  I am the policy officer with Mental Health Reform, which is the national coalition advocating for improved mental health services and implementation of the governmental mental health policy.  We want to bring to the notice of members the voices of some of the people who receive mental health services.  I will share some comments from individuals who have shared their views with us in the past month or so.  One person said that if one does not have good mental health one has nothing.</p> <p>Another person said that if funding is cut, mental health services will not evolve and will instead return to the old times that were experienced 15 years ago, with more readmissions and less care.  We also heard from someone who said that they do not want mental health services to go backwards and that it is all very well for the Government to try to cut the mental health budget, but it does not realise the impact these cuts have on people on the ground.<br /> The reality is that more people are experiencing poor mental health in Ireland.  A survey that was recently published by the national stigma reduction campaign, See Change, found that 15% of the population claims to have experienced a mental health problem in 2012.  That is more than double the number of people who said they had a mental health problem in 2010.  Irish mental health services are under significant strain.  The current staffing level is 23% below the level recommended in A Vision for Change.  Irish mental health services are short 2,645 whole-time equivalents at present.  As a result, staff are stretched.  This kind of pressure leads to people not getting the follow-up care they need after being discharged from hospital.  There are no early follow-up appointments.  It leads to nurses not being able to provide timely follow-up in day hospitals when people are going through a difficult time at home.  If a person who has experienced hospitalisation in the past, but is now successfully living at home, begins to feel they are becoming unwell and goes to their local day hospital for an appointment, they may be told they cannot get a follow-up appointment as early as they need because of the lack of adequate staff.  There is Irish evidence that comprehensive community-based mental health services cost less than a hospital-oriented service.  A study conducted in Kildare and published this year found that a community-based service is 21% cheaper <i>per capita</i>than a traditional hospital-based service.  The main differences between the two services is that the provision of day hospital and home treatment in the comprehensive service is absent in the hospital-oriented service.<br /> Mental Health Reform has made a number of specific recommendations for budget 2013 to keep reform on track.  First, the Government must keep its programme commitment to allocate &euro;35 million next year for the continued development of community-based mental health services.  Mental Health Reform welcomed the Government's commitment in budget 2012 to allocate &euro;35 million for the development of community-based mental health services, suicide prevention and access to counselling through primary care.  We have not yet sees this commitment realised, but we remain hopeful that the promised staff will be in place before the end of the year. Given the significant gap in staffing, we are asking the Government to keep its commitment to an additional &euro;35 million for next year along with an exemption from the moratorium for the relevant posts.  It is important to note that the &euro;35 million allocated this year was not really additional funding, given that the mental health budget included a 5.6% cut in regular spending.  Even with the planned provision of &euro;35 million this year, there was an overall 1% cut in the budget for mental health services.  One can imagine what the situation is now that the &euro;35 million has not been realised.<br /> Mental Health Reform also welcomed the commitment in budget 2012 to provide &euro;5 million specifically for the development of counselling services through primary care.  We consider this to be a positive mental health promoting initiative.  Given the links between poverty and poor mental health, it is particularly important for the Government to consider in budget 2013 how those on low incomes as well as those on medical cards can access counselling services.  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, has made a commitment to appointing a director for mental health as part of the restructuring of the HSE.  We are concerned that without the necessary staffing resources, a director will have little impact to assist in managing the change programme.  If the directorate is to fulfil the intentions of A Vision for Change, it must have multidisciplinary input.  It also requires budgeting expertise and administrative support if it is to be effective.  It is difficult to plan mental health services because we have no information on community mental health services in Ireland.  If one was running a business, one would want to know how many customers one has, how often they shop and how satisfied they are with one's service.  We have no idea how many people are using community mental health services.  We had more information about community mental health services in 1984 than we do now.<br /> Mental Health Reform believes that partnership between public mental health services and the voluntary sector is vital to implementing A Vision for Change.  Mental health voluntary organisations provide vital support services such as peer and family support, telephone helplines and information in the community.  HSE-funded mental health voluntary organisations cannot afford to incur additional cuts without affecting front-line service delivery.  It is vital that the Government continues to support the reform of Ireland's mental health services.  We ask the members of the committee to champion the issue of mental health in the run-up to budget day in December.  In particular, we urge members to write to the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, to impress upon him the economic good sense of investing in community mental health services.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-08a.1364" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian O'Donnell" time="11:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2012110800013#P00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend this morning's meeting.  Much of what I have to say is a reinforcement of what my colleague, Mr. John Dolan, said earlier.  I will place a particular focus on people with intellectual disability and their families.  The Chairman will be aware that Ireland is almost unique internationally in so far as the voluntary sector provides the substantial majority of services to people with intellectual disability.  Up to 85% of such services are provided directly by voluntary organisations on the basis of service level agreements with the HSE, which has statutory responsibility for this area.  Voluntary organisations have a long and rich tradition of providing services to people with intellectual disability in Ireland.  In some cases, such as Stewart's Hospital and the Daughters of Charity, this form of provision dates back to a time before the foundation of the State.  Voluntary organisations are typically an amalgam of members of local communities, parents, friends, people with an intellectual disability and staff who come together with the common objective of responding to local need by providing the best possible support to people with intellectual disability in their communities.</p><p>  Over the decades, services have developed to the extent that they are now internationally recognised for the range and quality of supports provided.  Voluntary organisations are to the fore in promoting quality within services.  Following work done by our federation&rsquo;s quality sub-committee in the 1990s, voluntary organisations took the initiative in developing quality systems.  A recent survey of our member organisations confirmed that the majority have achieved international accreditation as high-quality providers of services to people with intellectual disability.  A unique characteristic of service provision in Ireland is the high number of organisations which were founded by parents and friends of people with intellectual disability.  These organisations, which were established on a voluntary basis, were born out of local communities and therefore have strong ties and affiliations with the communities in which they are embedded.  Parents have a strong role in their governance, as evidenced by the number who are members of the respective boards of directors.  The parental voice is an essential and valued perspective and the federation is committed to ensuring this voice is heard.  To this end, last month we organised comprehensive briefings for parents on the implications of funding cuts and on what we are doing as a sector to manage the cuts and to seek protection from further cuts in the forthcoming budget.</p><p>  Being closely identified with local communities gives voluntary organisations access to significant voluntary input, which has evolved from fund-raising activities to include befriending programmes, policy development and supporting people with intellectual disability to enjoy meaningful lives.  The value of this input, which is obviously provided at no cost to the State, has been conservatively estimated to be approximately &euro;50 million per annum.  It has always been the case, within a context of finite resources, that the demand for the services of voluntary organisations has exceeded supply.  Therefore, there has always been a focus on the efficient and effective use of the resources available.  There has been a constant drive to innovate and to develop newer and better solutions to meet the diverse needs of the people we support.  This focus is particularly sharp in the current economic climate.   For example, the needs of over 650 school leavers were met this year through the development of a series of innovative solutions in the absence of additional resources.  That was the first time that any of us can remember when no resource at all was available to meet the needs of school leavers.  That was managed this year.  We have fully engaged with the value for money and policy report that was published recently.  We carried out a national survey of our membership which confirmed that significant progress has been made, and continues to be made, in implementing the recommendations contained in the report.</p><p>  I would like to set out the challenges that are facing the voluntary sector at present.  Like everybody else in this country, those involved in this sector have faced significant cuts over the past four years.  In our case, there has been an aggregate cut of approximately 15% at a time when the demand for services has been increasing rapidly and the changing needs of those already availing of our services have never been greater.  Many organisations are struggling to stay afloat and have incurred financial deficits to maintain essential services.  The boards of many registered companies limited by guarantee are concerned that they may be breaching the Companies Acts by trading recklessly.  Board members are worried about the implications of this for their organisations and for themselves personally.  Some organisations are so concerned about this that they are closing services.  Responsibility for services at Cregg House in Sligo, for example, was handed back to the HSE because of real concerns about the deficits being encountered.</p> <p> We are also concerned with regard to the unravelling of much of the progress that has been achieved in recent years in both the quality of the service and the quality of life of the people we support.  Given that the sector that was in the vanguard in the context of promoting quality, we are worried now about the diminution of quality within services.  In the face of the funding cuts, there is evidence of re-institutionalisation at a time when Government policy is to achieve the opposite.  People with intellectual disabilities and their families rightly expect there to be no diminution in either the quantum or quality of the services they receive.  Similarly, the political system expects that despite funding cutbacks, essential services will be maintained and that new services will be developed, for example and as in the current year, to meet the needs of school leavers.  This situation will also obtain next year and in future years.</p><p> The demographic trends in Ireland to which I have already alluded are placing greater demands on services and supports than ever.  Waiting lists for services will inevitably lengthen and a population which is growing older will place greater demand on the sector in terms of meeting changing needs.  As parents age, their ability to care will diminish.  The economic crisis, which is likely to be with us for some years, means that the drive to do more with less resources will continue unabated and the need for us to innovate and do things in a radically different way will remain.</p><p> It is imperative that we protect people with intellectual disabilities from any diminution in the quality of or a reduction in services as we struggle to continue to meet all needs with significantly reduced resources.  As a voluntary sector, we must at all costs avoid a dumbing down of services which have been so assiduously built up over the years.  The sector is fortunate in having staff who are highly committed to the individuals they support.  The challenge for us is to achieve an appropriate mix of people who are competent, skilled and possess the right knowledge and expertise to support people with intellectual disabilities to have meaningful lives.</p><p> In embracing the challenge by which we will be faced in 2013, we are conscious that there is a limit to what can be done in the context of significantly reduced resources.  Many of our organisations are indicating that they have reached the end of the line in terms of their ability not only to maintain existing front-line services but also in the context of even considering the development of new services.  In 2012 alone, a cut of 3.7% in funding equated to &euro;33 million.  In addition, other budgetary considerations, such as increases in PRSI and VAT and the payment of increments, added &euro;11 million to our costs.  Furthermore, the extra resources required in respect of school leavers added a further &euro;10 million to our costs.  All of this means that we were obliged to find an additional &euro;54 million in the current year.</p><p> I indicate how this was achieved in the material circulated to the committee.  We surveyed our members and asked how it should be done.  I need not go into detail other than to state that all of the big-ticket efficiency measures which could be taken have been implemented.  To use the clich&eacute;, we climbed every tree in search of the money.  We remain vigilant in the context of trying to achieve further efficiencies.  However, we have reached the end of the line in the context of achieving major efficiencies and we are seriously concerned with regard to whether this will lead us in 2013 in the context of front-line services.  The consequences for people with intellectual disabilities and their families will be very severe.</p></speech>

Both our pre-budget submission and my opening statement have been circulated to members.  I do not plan to go through the latter word for word because we are pressed for time.  There are three issues on which I wish to focus, the first of which is the specialist palliative care budget.  I would appeal to the Government that there should be no cut to that budget this year.  The second issue I wish to raise involves strategy and the position with regard to end-of-life scenarios.  The third and final matter relates to paediatric palliative care, on which I will provide an update.</p><p>  The Irish Hospice Foundation is the national charity dedicated to all matters relating to dying, death and bereavement in Ireland.  These are matters which are relevant to all of us.  We have all experienced bereavement in some way in our lives and we will all experience death.  Our work centres on development, support and advocacy across all care settings.  We receive no core funding from the State.  Ours is an independent body which relies on the public for its initiatives.  A key point is that high-quality end-of-life care - which includes palliative care - encompasses primary, secondary and tertiary care, all diagnoses, all ages, all care settings and involves most health care professionals.  We believe that with proper planning, investment and commitment good end-of-life care can make a real difference to both the quality and cost of health care.  CSO figures show almost 29,000 people died in Ireland last year and that at least ten people are directly affected by each death.  This is a hugely important sector and we are concerned here with supporting over 290,000 people each year.</p><p>  The budget for specialist palliative care services for this year is &euro;78 million, down from &euro;81 million in 2011.  This &euro;78 million is supposed to run a national service.  In other words, it is supposed to be used to support services and staff in each of the nine hospices, to run day-care services and to support home-care teams, which comprise approximately 160 nurses throughout the country.  By contrast, the budget for one region which comprises two and a half counties and in which three hospitals are located is &euro;94 million.  I am not suggesting that the funding for these hospitals should be cut, I am merely making the point that the Irish Hospice has a budget of &euro;78 million which it must use to try to run a national service.</p><p>  The specialist palliative care budget has been cut by 3% in each of the past two years.  There have also been further indirect cuts as the costs of annual increments or non-pay inflation were not met.  As members will be aware, hospice services have always been obliged to rely on the loyalty of local communities.  It has been very fortunate in retaining that loyalty.  Budgets have traditionally been a combination of voluntary and statutory funding.  The ratio of State to voluntary funding used to be approximately 85:15.  Now it is closer to 75:25.  Members of the public are very loyal to their local hospice groups but there is a real concern that any further erosion of an already small budget will destabilise what is a fragile and underdeveloped sector.</p><p>  Specialist palliative care involves caring for people with life-limiting conditions who have complex needs.  Many are referred to the hospice movement at the end-of-life stage.  These individuals should receive priority consideration in accessing a high-quality service and should not be on a waiting list.  The goal of specialist palliative care is for patients to have access to services no more than 48 hours after referral.  This goal is becoming more and more difficult to achieve.  This is obviously a result of the fact that many services are experiencing staff shortages and are affected by the public sector recruitment embargo.  The concern in the specialist palliative care sector is that if there is a cut in budget for 2013, this will inevitably lead to longer waiting times for those seeking to access services and a heightened risk of further bed closures.  An example in this regard is that Milford Care Centre in Limerick was obliged to place a temporary cap on the number of beds in use from 30 to 28 last year.  A further cut would cause a major disruption to the provision of palliative care.  As already stated, the sector is struggling to maintain high-quality services.</p><p>  There are two facilities which were built with extra bed capacity.  I refer to Marymount in Cork, which 20 additional beds, and St. Francis Hospice in Blanchardstown, with 24 additional beds.  These beds are not being used because there is no funding available.  There is a need for progress to be made on the development of a hospice for the south east in Waterford Regional Hospital and a satellite unit in Kerry.  As members will know, local communities have contributed significantly to the costs of developing inpatient units in these locations.</p><p>  We have a policies and strategies for specialist palliative care in Ireland.  Some recommendations in the most recent report, Palliative Care Services - Five Year/Medium Term Development Framework, have been implemented.  However, most have not.  Palliative care in this country is traditionally recognised as being of a very high standard internationally.  It would, therefore, be a tragedy to see much of the good work done in this regard being reversed.</p><p>  The beauty of specialist palliative care is that those involved in it can care for people in their own homes.  In addition, more people are facilitated in the context of dying at home.  This is generally line with the wishes of patients.  There are excellent home-care services in areas that could be termed "hospice poor", namely, those which do not have inpatient units.  In such areas, however, patients do not have the choice of going to a hospice if their symptoms cannot be controlled at home.  As a result, their only option is to receive care and die in an acute hospital.  As everyone is aware, the latter is an expensive form of care.  This is contrary to national policy.  It is also contrary to the wishes of most patients, most of whom want to be cared for and to die at home.</p><p>  The key message we wish to get across is that people at end-of-life stage should be given priority status within our health service and should be protected.  In that context, there should be no further cuts to specialist palliative care.  Making such cuts would be shortsighted and would give rise to problems for those at end-of-life stage.  After all, we only have one opportunity to get this right.  Those to whom I refer are our most vulnerable citizens and patients.</p> <p>While &euro;78 million goes into specialist palliative care - some planning is involved in the expenditure - international evidence shows that between 10% and 15% of health care budget is spent on care of people in their last year of life.  Therefore, in Ireland that means that at least 1.3 billion of the health budget is spent on end of life care, which would be largely unplanned expenditure.  There is a need for planning.  Initiatives already under way need to be supported, embedded and mainstreamed.</p></speech>

We have Government in this area.  The Hospice Foundation has raised &euro;2.5 million to implement Government policy.  The various elements we have supported would be a consultant paediatrician with a special interest in palliative medicine.  That person has been in place for one year.  There should be eight out-reach nurses in the community, there are three.  Some progress has been made.  I acknowledge the contribution of members of the committee who have helped us.  Last week four other posts were advertised.</p><p>  The key messages are: protect the most vulnerable citizens who are at the end of their lives, therefore, spare the palliative care budget; roll out initiatives which will have an impact in terms of end of life care; and continue to support the families of children with life-limiting illnesses to care at home. </p></speech>

In times of financial constraints we are always looking at more efficient ways of trying to develop services and support those providing the services.  In the whole area of mental health, as there are so many specialties within mental health and many agencies and organisations, State agencies and advocacy groups, is there centralisation of information and access to information on the part of those utilising the various services and supports?  Do we actually know what is happening in the whole area of mental health, given that it is broadly based, and that many agencies deliver support?  Is there a need for a more centralised information system and a more centralised system of the services available to people?</p></speech>

I ask the Chairman, as it has been an important opportunity for each of the groups but also for each of us, if he proposes to act on the information provided?  It should not only be about airing one's concerns and hopes it is what actions the committee might take.  I do not want to be prescriptive but my view is that we should made a case, as a committee, to the Minister, on a number of the recommendations we have heard or else the exercise will not have a real purpose.  That is what I would like to see happen.  I will take them in reverse order.</p><p>  I thank Ms Caroline Lynch.  I have had the pleasure of meeting Ms Angela Edghill who brought me up to speed recently on the work of the Irish Hospice Foundation.  I concur that there should be no further cuts in the budget and that the levels for 2012 be maintained.  The budget is already down to &euro;78 million from &euro;81 million in 2011.  I hope the committee will make a case for the budget.  In a week when we are facing into the children's referendum on Saturday, I fully endorse one of the priority recommendations in regard to the appointment of the outstanding or remaining five children's out reach nurses.  That would be hugely important and I fully endorse that case.  </p><p>  On the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies, I acknowledge the voluntary basis, the community basis, of the component parts of the organisation.  I very much welcome the reaffirmation that parents not only have a strong role in governance over the various entities within the federation but their voice is an essential and valued perspective going forward.  May we have a brief profile of the 650 school leavers accommodated within the current year?  It is to the great credit of the organisation that it has been able to accommodate school leavers within the budgetary restraints that it has had to manage, recognising that it is not only a 15% cut in the past four years but, as rightly pointed out, when added to the cut of &euro;3.7 million this year, plus PRSI, VAT and other increases, the real impact in 2012 is of the order of &euro;44 million as against the &euro;33 million suggested.  I wish the organisation continued success in all its work and I hope this short opportunity today will bear fruit.  </p><p>  I ask Mental Health Reform not to drop the ball on mental health.  I thank Dr. Shari McDaid for his presentation.  I acknowledge his contribution to members in the past 24 hours, along with another interested colleague, on the whole area of mental health provision.  I heard him say yesterday and again I note from his contribution today that he is working on the basis that the &euro;35 million that was mysteriously found in the back pocket of the jeans worn by the Minister State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch was somehow expended.  I have used this imagery previously and I will surely be in trouble with Cork Deputies if not with the Minister of State herself.  Dr. Shari McDaid is working on the basis that this might be applied for the current year but I believe the case for its employment in the current year is almost hopeless, that we have lost it.  Given the overall decrease of 1% in funding for mental health provision in the current year, the situation is grave as I do not see that &euro;35 million being put back into use in the current year.  While we would hope it will be in play for 2013 and as early as possible, will Dr. McDaid elaborate on that issue?  He is hoping to have &euro;35 million now and another to follow in 2013.  I wish that were so but it is important that is emphasised.  </p><p>  To Ms Maria Corbett of the Children's Right Alliance I say well done on all its work.  I hope we are looking at happy days post the referendum on Saturday next.  Given the stark facts she shared with us, almost one-fifth of all children in Ireland were living in households with an income below the poverty line in 2010.  That is a serious matter.  No matter what is achieved on Saturday there is a huge body of work to be done in order to provide for the rights of children as I understand it.  I concur with her that we want to see the UNCRC incorporated into Irish domestic law and that it is not only that children's best interests will be taken into account when the State is taking cases on custody, access and guardianship but also it has a case to answer for its failure to provide for the needs of children in education, health and all the other areas.</p></speech>

I have read its report.  In regard to Appendix 1, the campaign strategy questionnaire, are there any facts and figures showing a reduction in family supports, home visits and so on which could be added to the document for the future?</p><p>  I shall move on to the Irish Hospice Foundation. </p> <p>There is always great joy at the birth of a child in hospital, but to have to go to a hospital because that child is dying or because an older person is dying is a very sad occasion.  My extended family has used the services of the hospice on more than one occasion.  In the context of the last few days of people's lives, it is important to say that general practitioners do an exceptional job.  Many of them go way beyond the call of duty, and that is often overlooked.  In my family's case, our local GP was very much involved.  I have nothing more to say about hospices except that they are marvellous.  They seek to ensure that people depart this world in comfort and with proper care.  Any reduction in the services of the hospices should be opposed.</p><p> Ms Corbett from the Children's Rights Alliance spoke about the new children's support, which I welcome.  However, with 224,000 children still living in poverty, which is in line with 2010, one has to wonder what happened in the past 15 years when the country had so much money.  That is the main issue in terms of what Ms Corbett said.  It is shocking that we still have such high numbers of children living in poverty, having gone through 15 years of enormous prosperity.</p><p> Whatever about general nursing being a vocation, those who choose to go into mental health nursing are unique individuals.  I support the idea of providing mental health services within communities.  The people of my parish are very lucky in that their new primary care centre also provides mental health services, which has had an enormous impact on people I know well.  I was shocked to discover, having spoken to family, friends and neighbours recently, that six people they knew had taken their lives in the past week alone.  The stories are all different and feature people from a wide variety of backgrounds, but they have one thing in common - depression.  Apart from all the young people who are committing suicide, there are quite a number in their 30s and 40s who are completely shattered by depression because of their economic circumstances and the difficulties of raising children and keeping a roof over their heads.  This problem has mushroomed and is almost completely out of control now.  I find it difficult, as a public representative, to give any comfort to people who have lost a loved one through suicide, particularly as a result of depression or mental health difficulties.  It is an issue the Government must take seriously, especially with regard to young people and those in their 30s and 40s who are caught in such a bind that they are ending their lives when they should only be starting out.  I heard a very sad story the other day of a young woman with a seven week old baby who came home to find her husband hanging in the hall.  He could not cope with the pressure of their huge mortgage.  It is a sad reflection on us as a society that this is happening.  I urge Ministers to take this matter more seriously.</p></speech>

I was here earlier but had to leave to attend to other business.</p><p>  All of us who are Government Deputies have the difficult job of arriving at a budget which will not please anyone but which we need to ensure is as fair as possible, and that is important.  In that regard, I ask the Chair if there is any way in which we can influence the Minister in terms of how he handles his budget.  While I would like our adjustments to be done as much through taxation as possible, it would be totally unrealistic to suggest there will be no cuts to services.  Such cuts will mainly affect the three big spending Departments, namely, Health, Social Protection and Education.  We must try to implement cuts in a way that has the least negative impact.  I do not know if the Minister is willing to talk to this committee between now and the budget.</p></speech>

I have a number of questions but before I pose them I wish to pay particular tribute to Ms Corbett and her team for their sterling work in advocating a "Yes" vote in the forthcoming referendum.</p><p>  I ask Dr. McDaid, based on the exceptionally touching and moving interview with Ms Una Butler last Friday, to comment on her proposition that families should be involved and included in any mental health therapy or response when family members present to the medical profession seeking help.</p><p>  We consistently hear the country is bankrupt.  Indeed, the Minister, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, says it every second week.  However, none of us, in this committee or in the Houses, is socially bankrupt.  Every single one of us has a heart and, with regard to the agencies represented at this meeting, I assure them that we will try to represent their views as best we can.</p><p>  Do the representatives have any idea how they will resolve the issue of the &euro;16 million deficit, given that they expect they will face further cuts in December's budget?  Have any of the bodies represented been offered changes to their service level agreements with the HSE?  If so, are there any difficulties arising from those new agreements?  In the particular example of St. Michael's House, it has been argued that funding has gone in one direction while services have gone in another.  In that context, what suffered?  Has there, for example, been a massive reduction in staff-to-client ratios?  In an earlier session I asked representatives of the Disability Federation of Ireland a question which they told me the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies would be best placed to answer.  I have anecdotal evidence that the services on offer by the HSE to special schools for children and young adults with intellectual and physical disabilities are being withdrawn.  I ask the delegates to comment and tell me if it is true.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-08a.1380" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1150" speakername="Colm Burke" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2012110800016#S00600"><p>I thank the Chair and apologise for missing the presentations, although I have read them and found them very comprehensive.  I know we are facing into very difficult times financially, but I wish to move away slightly from that issue.  The Chairman and I attended a meeting with a voluntary organisation recently to discuss the upcoming budget.  Approximately 85% of the budget of the organisation in question was tied up by the Croke Park agreement.  Therefore, if it suffers any reduction, the remaining 15% of its budget will be affected.  This is an enormous problem being faced by many organisations today and there is no easy answer in terms of how we deal with it.</p><p>  At a meeting yesterday with various broadcasters, the issue of negativity in the media, which seems to be a 24-7 phenomenon and which is having a detrimental impact on mental health, was discussed.</p> <p>One person at the meeting, possibly Deputy Michelle Mulherin, referred to the fact that the general practitioner in her local area is now advising anyone suffering from depression to turn off the radio for five or six weeks because of the level of negativity.  I realise the detailed submissions of the deputations are important and this is moving somewhat away from the topic but this is a time when voluntary organisations are making a significant contribution.  This small number of people are making a valuable contribution and there is a need for more people to become involved at community level and across the board to mitigate the negativity.  I realise some local radio stations are doing good work, trying to help people get back to work and promoting various initiatives at community level.  Is there more we can do?  Could we use the media to highlight the positive things taking place here rather than the whole focus being on negativity, which is adding to the air of depression everywhere in rural and urban areas.  This is especially relevant from a mental health point of view.  More and more people are having to avail of services and supports while at the same time the budgets in these areas are being cut.  This issue surfaced yesterday at the meeting.  It is relevant and we all need to work on it.  We are not in this alone.  This is the job of every organisation and Department and everyone involved in politics.  It is also a job for everyone in the media.  I am unsure whether we have engaged with the media on the issue.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputies for the kind words expressed about the Children's Rights Alliance.  They are much appreciated.  I was struck by the comments of the other presenters and the Deputies and Senators with regard to how interconnected everything is.  I am mindful that while I am referring to children we need to consider the impact of the cuts.  We have discussed the budget in a broad sense.  The effects are acute and not only cuts in child income supports but in the areas of education, mental health, home help and everything else.  We should keep in mind the cumulative effect of all of this.  Deputy Regina Doherty noted the importance of ensuring that we are not socially bankrupt.  There is a sense in which we need to get out of our silos and examine what we are doing to society and the impact of the cuts on society.</p><p>  I imagine the child benefit payment will be discussed on the airwaves in the coming weeks.  I emphasise the importance of the payment, which goes into virtually every household where there are children, because it is of its nature a guaranteed universal payment regardless of whether one is working.  There is a great deal of uncertainty in the lives of many families with regard to money coming in and going out.  At least it is a guaranteed payment and I am keen to put its importance on the table.</p><p>  We have spoken about the large number of children in poverty in Ireland.  We should not ignore that the make-up of that large number, one fifth of children, is rather varied.  Within that group there are several vulnerable groups.  In particular I have in mind the children of lone parent families and the children of asylum seeker families living in the direct provision system and the particular additional difficulties these groups face.  There are issues relating to families going through the homeless services as well.  When we discuss the matter we should not be too general or lose the detail because if we are to address child poverty and take it on we should think holistically about how we do it.</p><p>  When we are discussing making cuts and savings we should bear in mind the lifelong impact of being a child who grows up in consistent poverty.  It is very difficult to come back from there.  It is good investment to invest in children during this recessionary time and to ensure that children have a right to grow up free from poverty.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-08a.1384" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Shari McDaid" time="11:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2012110800017#T00400"><p>I am conscious of the time.  There were several questions on mental health and I will try to answer them as quickly as I can.  Deputy Kelleher asked about the need for more information on all the activity in the mental health and associated areas.  The Mental Health Commission is no longer reporting community mental health team staffing levels, although it used to do so.  The HSE does not report this information either.  In 2011 the Department of Health advised the incoming Minister for Health that efficiencies could be generated in the public mental health services through the development of a national mental health information system, as recommended in the document A Vision for Change.  There has been no movement in this area.  We have good information about child and adolescent mental health services and this is being reported annually.  However, we have no equivalent comprehensive information about adult mental health services.  We are calling for a modest investment in next year's budget to try to get at handle on what is happening in mental health services.  In a wider sense the National Office for Suicide Prevention reports annually on the range of voluntary sector initiatives it supports in the area of suicide prevention.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in rightly pointed out that we continue to be optimistic about the &euro;35 million in this year's budget.  We do not expect that &euro;35 million will be spent this year but we remain hopeful for the promised staff to be appointed before the end of the year.  We are calling for these staff to be appointed and for a commitment from the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Lynch, for a further tranche of money next year to cover additional staff, especially for the forensic services, services for intellectual disability and services for older people.  By the end of this year we hope the staff will be in place as promised this year and that the additional staff promised for next year will be put in place as well.</p><p>  I thank Deputy Byrne for her support on the issue of mental health generally.  I am sorry to hear about the particular occasions of suicide that occurred of which she has become aware.  We know that people with a diagnosis of a mental health difficulty are at a higher risk of taking their own life.  Certainly, there is some link with depression.  We know that the risk is very high in the first year when a person is diagnosed and begins treatment.  The question of mental health staff being put under pressure and therefore being unable to provide the level of follow-up that would be considered best practice is a particular concern in terms of the potential impact on the risk of people taking their own life.</p><p>  Deputy Regina Doherty raised the tragic case of Una Butler.  She in turn has highlighted other cases where family members, including children, have lost their lives at the hand of another family member.  We agree that families should be involved as much as possible in an individual's mental health case, subject to the permission of the individual concerned.  We consider this to be good practice and it has been identified as good practice by the Mental Health Commission as part of its guidance and quality framework on the delivery of mental health services.  We believe it is important that metal health services staff fully understand their obligations under child protection legislation and guidelines and that there may be a need for further education of mental health staff on their statutory and other obligations in respect of child protection.</p><p>  Senator Colm Burke raised a broader issue on the role everyone can play in supporting positive mental health in Ireland.  His comments call to mind a story that a person told me about her personal recovery from a mental health difficulty.  The person said that one of the most important people to provide support to her in her mental health recovery was the local newsagent.  Every week when she went in to the local newsagent store to pick up a newspaper or bottle of milk, the newsagent asked how she was and whether she wanted a cup of coffee.  She said that person played a key role in her recovery.  I fully agree that everyone has the potential to make a notable impact on positive mental health.</p></speech>

In my submission, I said that in spite of significant funding reductions we have managed to maintain front-line services to the best of our ability.  Most of our organisations are parents' and friends' associations, so one can imagine that they look at every expense before they go to front-line services.  Up to now, we have been able to manage that.  What has suffered is the quality of the service.  We are seriously concerned about that.  For 2013, all of the big ticket efficiency issues have been implemented and we are now looking at the front line for the first time.  That is a source of huge distress to us.  We have outlined what we are contemplating in the event of further service reductions.</p><p>  Deputy Regina Doherty asked a number of questions.  I will deal with two of them.  At the start of the year when the budgets are announced, we will engage in a service level agreement process with the Health Service Executive.  A service level agreement is, essentially, a contract.  It is a quantum of service for an amount of money.  Of course, voluntary organisations are reluctant to reduce the quantum of service and that feeds into the deficit.  We try to maintain existing services, even in the face of funding cuts.  Up to now, and this relates to my answer to Deputy Byrne, we have managed as well as we can to maintain services, but service level arrangements for 2013 will be far more difficult because we will be looking at service reductions in the event of further cuts.  We deal with the HSE as colleagues.  We do not see them as the big bad wolf.  They are in a very difficult situation themselves.  However, they are acknowledging that for the first time service reduction is something that will have to be contemplated.     </p><p>  I included St. Michael's House in the pack because, although it is just one member organisation all our organisations are suffering.  I mentioned in my presentation that we have a perfect storm here, with the demographic going in one direction, finance and HR resources going in another and the gap between resources and demand on services ever widening.  That challenge for voluntary organisations to maintain a balance is becoming increasingly difficult.  The year 2013 brings us to the unfortunate place where we will have to contemplate service reductions so that we do not exacerbate that situation.</p><p>  I will ask my colleague, Mr. Christy Lynch, to deal with the questions on deficits and HSE special schools.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-08a.1386" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Christy Lynch" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2012110800018#U00200"><p>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked about school leavers.  The vast majority are people with intellectual disabilities.  Most of them are known to our agencies because we, typically, run special schools and respite services.  Most of these families are aligned with our agencies in any event and have an expectation that their children will move into some form of adult support programme.  This is the first year that no funding was available.  For the last few years not enough funding was available, but sometimes a little can be stretched and something achieved.  We responded, but our response relates to Deputy Regina Doherty's question as to why we have deficits.  In sorting out one problem, we created another.</p><p>  For example, this year students left school in June, not knowing what was going to happen in September.  This was very cruel.  We did not know what was going to happen, although we were working very closely with our colleagues in the HSE.  One should not have to sit in front of a mother whose daughter is doubly incontinent, uses a wheelchair, has no speech, has significant medical problems and needs to be fed and dressed, and say to that mother, who looks after her daughter 24 hours a day and seven days a week all year round, that she is being put on a waiting list.  We are parents' and friends' organisations.  We know better than anyone the impact of these things on families.  Yes, we responded but in doing so we created other problems.</p><p>  More and more children with complex medical needs are coming through the school system.  There is an increase in the level of autism, bringing high levels of challenging behaviour.  We are forcing more people into services, typically day services, that are already overstretched and we are asking fewer staff to deal with more people and more complex people.  Real issues are emerging with regard to our viability as companies, because of the deficit.  There are also health and safety issues.  How far can one stretch a piece of elastic before it snaps and something bad happens?  None of us wants to see that.    </p><p>  I have a comment on Deputy Dowds's remarks.  I heard the Minister for Health sum this up before last year's budget, when he addressed a group of parents in his constituency.  He made the point that people with disabilities were always on the margins, even in the best of times.  We agree with that.  I was on the board of the National Disability Authority when we launched the national disability strategy with great fanfare in very good days.   We needed that strategy because there was an acceptance that we came from a very low base.  The Minister made the point that even in times of austerity there are groups in society who need particular protection.  Having lost 15% of our budget, we feel, as my colleague has said, that we have done everything that could reasonably be expected to protect front-line services. </p><p>  For the first time ever in my memory, the Government acknowledged that 1.7% of the 3.7% cut could come off the front line.  This was because the HSE, and not the voluntary organisations, told the Government that all the low hanging fruit had been picked.  Some of our problems go back to the 1980s, when we had similar austerity and we created huge waiting lists.  We never got to the bottom of that, even in the so called good times.</p><p>  We were asked what we will do.  If there is another cut, many of us will go into next year carrying deficits.  We are companies so we cannot sustain that.  We will have to start taking apart front-line services that are essential to people.  If there is another cut on top of that we will have to cut even more.  Otherwise, organisations will follow the example of Cregg House, and it will not be the last, and go back to the HSE and say, "Here are the keys; we cannot do this anymore".</p><p>  A task force is working on a national policy for the reconfiguration of supports to children with disabilities.  It is called Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People.  In theory, I agree with what it is attempting to do, which is to bring equity and fairness into the system across the country.  The policy is to attempt to pool all therapists, with teams dealing with the age groups 0 to 5 and 5 to 18 in geographical areas.  My background is in occupational therapy.  We have never had enough therapists in the system.  Many therapists are linked to special schools and sometimes parents choose a special school in the hope that their child will get therapy.  In the new scenario, all the therapists will be pooled.  The moratorium on recruitment has meant we have been losing therapy posts in the last number of years, and we never had enough anyway.  Butter that was very thinly spread will be spread much more thinly, and this will be dressed up as equity.  Will special schools lose in this scenario?  Yes, they will. </p></speech>

Most of the care for people at end of life is delivered by the local GP.  Specialist palliative care provides support for approximately 25% of deaths.  The local GP is really important.  A programme called primary palliative care is in place, run by the Irish Hospice Foundation and the Irish College of General Practitioners.  It supports GPs, and particularly out-of-hours services.  The Irish Hospice Foundation has also collaborated with Console.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-08a.1396" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1089" speakername="Tom Hayes" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2012110800002#A00200"><p>The meeting is now in public session.  No apologies have been received.</p><p>  This is a special meeting with the Vice President of the European Commission.  It is a great honour for this committee to have the opportunity to engage with the EU Commissioner for Transport, Mr. Siim Kallas, and I hope I pronounced the Commissioner's name properly.   </p><p>  As we all know, on 1 January 2013 Ireland will assume the Presidency of the Council of the European Union for the seventh time.  It is notable that the Presidency will coincide with the 40th anniversary of Ireland's accession to the then European Economic Community in 1973.  Clearly, Ireland will have a significant role to play in influencing the agenda of the EU during that six-month period.  The overarching priority for the Presidency will be to support a range of measures to secure sustainable economic growth and job creation, restore macroeconomic stability and enhance economic governance within the European Union.  </p><p>  During the Irish Presidency of the EU, the Houses of the Oireachtas will host eight conferences of committee chairpersons meetings commencing in January 2013 with the final conference taking place in June 2013.</p> <p>These will include two meetings of the committee of the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs of the European Union and also the conference of the chairpersons of the sectoral committee such as employment and enterprise, agriculture, communications, energy and education.  It is proposed to hold a meeting of the chairpersons of the communications, education and transport committees in June 2013.  The subject matters that may be discussed are the digital agenda, broadband and an intelligent transport system.</p><p> I am delighted to welcome the Commissioner for Transport, Mr. Siim Kallas, to Leinster House.  I am sure I speak for my colleagues when I say how honoured we are that he has chosen to come before the committee.  I trust that he had a pleasant time this morning with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar.  The commissioner is accompanied by Mrs. Desir&eacute;e Oen, a member of his cabinet, and Mrs. Barbara Nolan, head of the European Commission Representation in this country.</p><p> I must advise Mr. Kallas that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I also advise Mr. Kallas that the opening statement he will make to the committee and the proceedings of the meeting will be published on the committee's website.</p><p> Members of the committee are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I now invite Mr. Kallas to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

First, I am originally from Estonia, a small country which has certain historical similarities with Ireland which has always been admired as a country by Estonians.  It is very nice that I am here for a second time.  On the first occasion I met the then Prime Minister and also had the opportunity to visit the Irish Parliament.  I have pleasant memories of my visit in 2003.  I am happy to talk to the committee about European transport policy.  I will make some introductory remarks and then will be available to answer the questions of members.</p><p>  The Chairman mentioned the Irish Presidency.  We met today the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, with whom I have had many previous meetings.  The Irish Government is preparing seriously for the Presidency which is also important for the transport portfolio, given that some important issues will have to be handled during the term of the Irish Presidency.  I would like to refer to some of them.</p><p>  I wish to start with a general observation.  Two and a half years ago when the European Commission started its new term, transport was considered as a nuisance &ndash; only as a problem.  It was not mentioned in any European strategic document.  It was only considered as a problem in terms of CO2 emissions and considered to have other bad accompanying features.  Now we recognise at European level in all strategic documents that transport is a very important sector of the economy.  A total of 8 million people earn revenues from transport, which is a big number.  The figure in terms of GDP is approximately 4%.  If one calculates the numbers involved in transport in conjunction with equipment manufacturers, the percentage becomes even higher.  For example, 12 million workers are employed in car manufacturing.  Transport is a big sector of the economy and also an important sector philosophically.  Again, coming from a country where mobility has been restricted for understandable reasons for a long time, we especially consider that freedom of movement of people, goods, services and capital is one of the essential values of the European Union which can also be felt in countries such as Estonia.</p><p>  It is important to provide for transport policy.  Our White Paper states clearly that the curbing of mobility is not an option.  It is only one sentence in point No. 18.  This is an important sentence for me and the European Union transport policy because there are also other views; that one should force people not to move because transport is bad.  The official position is very clear.  Mobility is a great European value which we must maintain, support and develop.  That means also that we need physical infrastructure.  It is not only a question of rules and texts, but we must also develop physical infrastructure.</p><p>  One interesting project for European integration was developed in 1930.  Its author was a man called Dannie Heineman.  He developed a blueprint for the future European Union and all the elements he outlined are present today such as an authority to guarantee the functioning of the Internal Market, the Central Bank, the European Court of Justice and also infrastructure, including railways.  He called for a trans-European network of railways which he considered as important as other elements of European integration.  People have always considered that the European Union is of great value for many reasons, but mobility is one such value.</p><p>  The White Paper was presented a year and a half ago and we have pursued several of its objectives.  On the current position, I will outline the main points of today&rsquo;s discussion, the most important being the budget.  We are discussing the future European budget and will know by the end of November whether we will have an agreement.  This is very important for the Irish Presidency also because if the agreement is reached, there will be one type of work to deal with accompanying legislation.  More than 70 legislative Acts will be required, including the documents on a trans-European network.  If there is no agreement, difficult negotiations will continue.</p><p>  One could ask what is at stake.  One year ago the European Commission proposed a budgetary change that had two very important new elements, one of which was to create an instrument to connect Europe&rsquo;s facilities.  A total of &euro;50 billion will be spent on the instrument, including &euro;31.7 billion for transport and approximately &euro;10 billion for energy and IT infrastructure.</p> <p> Another important element in this proposal is research and development, which is in the hands of the distinguished Irish Commissioner, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, with whom we have close and good co-operation.  This is to substantially increase our funding for research and development.  We will see what happens.  We are fighting for that instrument.  I will outline the reason the Connecting Europe facility is important.  First, additional resources are needed to take down barriers and eliminate bottlenecks in the functioning of pan-European infrastructure.  Another important element is that this will allow us to develop connections between the eastern and the western parts of the European Union.  I do not want to go into the details but if we do not have this instrument we will not have the resources or the legal framework to finance cross-border projects.  If we compare the &euro;50 billion for the Connecting Europe facility with the &euro;4.5 trillion spent from 2008 to 2011 on supporting the banking system we can see clearly that the cost of infrastructure support is a modest one.  This is a hot topic; let us wait and see what happens in that regard.  The European Commission is participating in the negotiation process but members know as well as I that this is in the hands of decision makers at the highest level in the European Union.  It is a complicated issue, especially concerning the position of this country's big neighbour, but it is also an issue for others.  This is a crucial moment for our transport policy.  What will happen with the Connecting Europe facility?  If this goes in a satisfactory manner we understand there will be cuts, but the cuts have certain limits.  Members will understand from their budgetary discussions that we can cut finance policies but in certain moments we must abandon policies because we cannot do anything without the available resources.  I do not know what will be the limit.  We must wait and see how it develops.  That is the Connecting Europe facility.</p><p> With regard to the Irish Presidency, Ireland has different items to deal with, but the big issue in Europe is the so-called fourth railway package or railway reform, and it is a terribly difficult issue.  What is the problem?  If we compare with other areas of European integration - the Internal Market and other sectors - we can see that railways are the most fragmented and most nationally separated system in the European Union.  If I look for any political commitment to overcome that fragmentation, I do not see much of it.  Every country wants to defend its special features.  We do not always understand the reason.  Every change in railways needs investment and certain rearrangements, but behind technical specifications there are always countries.  Sometimes agreement cannot be reached, but let us hope there will be agreement.</p><p> The railway package is about two things, the first of which is European infrastructure.  It is not the objective of the European Commission to intervene in national affairs but we have an objective to create something which has added European value.  That is important for me.  I always tell people in the Directorate General for Mobility and Transport that our role is to do what cannot be done at national level.  Second, it is about the Internal Market.  We still have isolated sectors in the railway area.  Free competition is avoided and rules for public procurement are neglected; therefore, we want to have a fair and transparent economic environment for the functioning of the Internal Market in the railway area.  That is the second important point.  The list of details is very long and members will probably have an opportunity to discuss this during the Irish Presidency because it is an issue that will come before the Irish Presidency.</p><p> The third major hot topic is the necessity of adjusting our aviation policy in terms of our airspace.  The situation is bad.  We have one major issue which can only be discussed; it is not a legislative proposal, but I will probably come forward with some infringement procedures.  Member states have decided to move gradually towards a European common airspace.  During the volcanic ash crisis, in which I had an instrumental role, we saw clearly that no member state can close or open its airspace alone.  It is impossible.  Therefore, we need some kind of functioning European airspace.  Member states decided more than a decade ago to develop this common airspace, the so-called functional airspace, and 4 December will be the date on which the functional airspace blocks no longer function.  It is very clear.  We will then launch some infringement procedures, but the process has slowed down and nobody has any real enthusiasm for developing it.  This is important, because if we realise the so-called single European sky project through air traffic management reform, it will reduce the amount spent on fuel by 10% or 15% as well as reducing CO2 emissions, because the management of air traffic will be based on satellites and certain computer systems.  It will be much more flexible and we will have fewer delays.  It will function better and everybody is calculating that it will bring benefits.  That is the single European sky project.</p><p> We proposed a so-called airport package but what happened last Monday in the European Parliament was spectacular, and I would like to share my frustration about it.  The package contains one ground handling proposal.  Ground handling is a socially sensitive area but it is important in terms of organising air traffic and for airlines.  I personally met the leadership of the European Transport Workers' Federation and asked its members what they consider to be the most important issues to address if we proceed with this reform.  They said that some of the provisions were in place.  The Frankfurt Airport proposal went to the European Parliament.</p> <p>During the last parliamentary term, I was responsible for budget discharge and lobby registration and now see how the process works in reality.  The lobby from Frankfurt airport did not want to have any opening and succeeded in having a vote such that the European Parliament transport committee rejected the proposal.  Nobody else was involved.  It is not a problem for trade unions; it was Frankfort airport.  It was a case of Lufthansa supported by the Government of Hessen.  The federal Government was not instrumental.  That is life.</p><p> There are other elements to be considered.  The so-called slot proposal was discussed at the last Council meeting in Brussels on 29 October.  The compromise made amounted to nothing.  It sometimes happens in Europe that when one tries to find compromises, it results in a document that changes nothing.  This is exactly what occurred in this case.</p><p> The airport package and airspace issues in general will definitely be discussed during the Irish Presidency.  I just wanted to identify the hot points.  If the level of progress is really bad, we will consider the withdrawal of the proposal as a whole.  Then there will be nothing to do in this regard for the Presidency.  If we continue, it will be a matter for the Presidency.</p><p> The emission-trading scheme for aviation comprises a very difficult issue, as members know.  Europe has adopted a big decision that its airlines, and those from other counties, should pay for carbon dioxide emissions.  It is too much and too early to say there is a trade war but there is much conflict.  Tomorrow, the International Civil Aviation Organization will probably release a compromise proposal.  In so far as I know, it will be acceptable, allowing us to avoid the trade war and solve the emissions trading scheme conflict.  The conflict arises in the first instance with the United States, but there are other countries that follow suit.  I am positive at this stage.</p><p> Although I discussed finances, railways and airlines, there are many other issues also.  However, I do not want to take up too much of the committee's time.  Other issues that will arise concern innovation, clean transport and road transport.  We can discuss these in detail, if necessary.</p><p> I assure the members that we are co-operating very well with Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn and making a substantial contribution to innovation and research work, which are essential for transport, especially intelligent transport systems.  The latter are extremely important in terms of creating intermodal transport networks.  There are many details to be considered in respect of transport, as members know.  There are many positive details on which we can really move.  It is a nice area in which to work.</p></speech>

Her interaction with the Commission generally is very good.  We are fortunate that Ms Nolan is of such assistance to us in that regard.</p><p>  Commissioner Kallas's presentation was very comprehensive so, consequently, I do not have very many questions.  Ireland has a good track record on road safety.  This is based on our progressive and aggressive approach to saving lives on the road, largely through enhancing legislative measures.  Since Ireland is an island nation and since the island effectively has two jurisdictions, we have a difficulty levying penalty points on drivers from outside the State.  While our drivers are subject to our law and penalty-points regime, drivers from the six counties north of the Border are not.  Has the Commission any proposal for a pan-European approach to the levying of penalty points?</p><p>  I will not refer to rail networks because the Commissioner will appreciate that Ireland, as an island, is more dependent on its air links than its rail links.  Has the commissioner any views on the consolidation that has begun to take place in the aviation sector in recent years?  I do not expect him to discuss the Ryanair-Aer Lingus proposal which is before the Commission at present.  From a broad policy perspective, would it be better if Ireland had fewer larger airlines, or would it benefit more from having a greater number of smaller airlines?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-08a.1403" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1083" speakername="Michael Colreavy" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2012110800005#D00400"><p>I thank Commissioner Kallas, Ms Oen and Ms Nolan for attending.  A badly drawn map of Ireland I have to hand shows Dublin, Cork, Galway and Sligo.  I live in the north-west corner of Ireland in a beautiful constituency covering Sligo and Leitrim.  Given its beauty, I would love to see the Commissioner visit it.  A map of Ireland's infrastructure will show there is a rail line from Dublin to Belfast and from Dublin to Sligo.  One will see many rail lines south of the Dublin-Sligo line.  However, north of Sligo and west of the Dublin-Belfast line, there is no rail infrastructure and the roads continue to be very poor.  What are the Commissioner's thoughts on the internal distribution of project funding and on infrastructural development within nations?  What criteria should we be using?  While many decisions are made based on population ratios, these must not comprise the only consideration.</p><p>  The Commissioner referred to access and mobility, on which I agree with him completely.  Access and mobility are as important - if not more important - to people in remote areas as they are to those in centres of population.  Could the Commissioner speak briefly about the factors he believes member states should be taking into account regarding the internal distribution of funding for projects, including cross-border projects?  Much of the road infrastructure between Galway and Belfast, including that in Sligo, is good but there are stretches of the road that are simply not fit for purpose.  This does not encourage mobility and access.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-08a.1404" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Siim Kallas" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2012110800005#D00500"><p>Ireland can be proud of its record on road safety as it has one of the best.  Last year, 2011, was bad overall in that the decline in the number of casualties stopped in Europe.  In Europe, we have substantially reduced the number of casualties but last year was not good.</p> <p>Deputy Dooley has mentioned an important issue but I refer to what was actually decided in December 2010 by the member states' transport Council regarding so-called cross-border enforcement of traffic violations, which will come into force in 2013 - that is, next year.  It means Ireland can punish foreign drivers.  All over Europe the proportion of foreign drivers who cause accidents is much greater than that of local drivers.  Under this legislation, Ireland finally can punish or stop drivers who violate traffic regulations in respect of the so-called four killers - namely, drinking, speeding, not wearing a seat belt and ignoring a red light.  This legislation has been adopted but there is an issue regarding the legislative basis, about which I am probably not competent to answer because I do not understand it.  Basically, a political decision has been made whereby European country X - I do not know the position in respect of Ireland's neighbouring country - can ask its neighbouring country to ask those drivers who have violated rules to pay penalties by country X's rates.  While this decision is in place, there is debate about its legal basis and whether it pertains to police co-operation or transport co-operation.  If it is the latter there is no facility for an opt-out, but if the former, Ireland and the United Kingdom have such an opt-out facility.  During this discussion, the Governments of both countries indicated they were considering an opt-out.  However, everyone, including the United Kingdom, has been positive about the substance.  Consequently, I really do not know what is the present status of this legal debate, although the political decision has been made.</p><p> Air transport, like many other sectors, will consolidate.  This is for sure, especially in the context of global competition.  We have often discussed with European airlines where the first global company will be.  Such a global company will be good.  Countries such as Ireland and Estonia must have connections.  As having direct connections is so vital, something must be done in this regard.  I do not know exactly what but some kind of public support must be available.  At present, the Commission is discussing the so-called state aid guidelines for aviation, which I believe are going for public consultation next week.  It will emanate from the Directorate General for Competition, as it is a competition directive rather than a transport directive.  Members can access the relevant websites or can get in touch via their representatives and can really participate in the discussion process.  In this context, we must consider how to help bodies such as regional airports.  I do not wish to dwell on this at length because there are many nuances.  In some countries, there are too many regional airports and they are competing with one another.  They may be 100 km apart but both are asking for money from taxpayers and governments.  The Commission is not happy with this and it cannot tolerate it.  The guidelines also seek to address this issue.  The day before yesterday, we discussed the political substance of these guidelines with Commissioner Almunia.  Consequently, this is coming.</p><p> As for the distribution of projects concerning infrastructure, there is no arithmetic model.  When preparing for parliamentary hearings I asked my people about the same issue - namely, what calculations can show that one project is better than another - but there is no arithmetic model.  As Deputy Colreavy mentioned in his question, the reality is that implementing the project will bring economic growth.  While accessibility will bring growth, no one can calculate <i>ex ante</i>how big this will be. While there is an understanding that this will bring growth, again, there are nuances in Europe.  Some countries have been successful in implementing lots of transport projects, but thereafter one must maintain new roads and so on and there will be new difficulties in future.  I do not wish to mention specific countries, but some have been too active.  Obviously, this is a matter in which political decision-making and commonsensical calculations must be put together in order to assess and then select necessary projects.  This of course is a matter for the Irish Government because, at European level, we are dealing with cross-border projects.  If we have money, then we will see what projects it is possible to finance.  However, I note that were the member states' governments to give us &euro;500 million, we would have one type of policy, but were we to receive tens of billions, we would have another type of policy.  Obviously, however, this issue always will be in the hands of the member states.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-08a.1406" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/995" speakername="Noel Harrington" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2012110800006#E00200"><p>I also welcome the Commissioner and his officials.  I wish to focus on maritime policy.  As Ireland is an island nation, 90% of its goods are exported through a handful of ports and it is critically important for commerce in Ireland to maintain an effective maritime sector.  The Commissioner might outline to the joint committee how the European Union is supporting and might continue to support the maritime industry with regard to the Motorways of the Sea project and the Marco Polo initiative, whereby funding could be maintained to encourage goods to be transported by sea, thereby encouraging lower fuel emissions.  The proposal is to divert goods from the highways and railroads of the European Union.  While diverting such traffic from roads and rail would be of major benefit at a European level, it also would be perceived as being critically important in an Irish context.</p><p>  My second point pertains to roadworthiness standards.  It is not such a long time since Ireland introduced vehicle testing.  In the European context, can the Commissioner outline to members a flavour of the challenges facing the Commission and his directorate in achieving a European standard throughout the 27 member states?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-08a.1407" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1128" speakername="Paschal Mooney" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2012110800006#E00300"><p>I echo everything that has been said in welcoming the Commissioner.  As he quite correctly noted, Ireland and Estonia share common interests and common priorities within the wider European Union context.  I have two questions, the first of which pertains to a matter I raised at this joint committee some weeks ago and about which I wonder whether the Commissioner is aware.  There are proposals from the United Kingdom's Government to introduce a levy of &pound;100 on access by commercial traffic into the United Kingdom.  I am unsure whether the Commissioner is familiar with this proposal and I have no further details, other than that when the secretariat checked on foot of my request, the response was that it was no stronger than a proposal.  Obviously, however, it is being discussed.  The Commissioner can understand how difficult this would be for Ireland, as has already been indicated, as an island nation with a political divide.  If the Commissioner is not aware of it, perhaps he or his <i>cabinet</i> might inform themselves because this measure will obviously be of great importance.</p> <p>My initial reaction was that it was anti-competitive and went against the Treaty of Rome, but I am not sure what the details are.  I wanted to take this opportunity, as it is within the Commissioner's remit, to inform him if he was not already aware of it.  </p><p> My second and final question concerns the EU budget, which the commissioner has emphasised.  He is right in that we are perhaps more aware of the nuances of our nearest neighbours because we are so close to them and receive all their news media.  There is no question but that Mr. David Cameron will veto any proposal that relates to an increase and, at best, he will perhaps accept a freeze.  The Commissioner may wish to expand a little more but, like the rest of us, he too is in somewhat of a limbo in that he is waiting for these decisions to be taken at prime ministerial level.  It occurred to me, however, that it might be worth exploring at some point.</p><p> One of the difficulties we find is in dealing with Britain as a eurosceptic nation, which has become increasingly eurosceptic as a result of this administration.  It is quite obvious now that Mr. Cameron is a hostage to his significant backbench eurosceptic body.  There seems to be a lack of information coming forward from the European Commission and the European Union in informing the general public in Britain.  I am not saying this is easy because one is up against a hostile media.  For example, last night on the BBC - which is the television news of record, reporting impartially and objectively - all they reported was the debate surrounding either a freeze or an increase.  They talked in percentage terms but no information was given to the general viewer as to what exactly the figures were.  As 1% of the EU's GDP it is a relatively small figure.  However, it was presented in such a way that the percentages represented something extraordinarily large that would impact adversely on the British taxpayer.  That is why I raised the issue.  There seems to be an information deficit but I appreciate that the commissioner is up against a hostile media in the UK.</p></speech>

It is estimated that it would cost &euro;3 billion to electrify Ireland's rail network.  We are not in a position to fulfil that cost at the moment, but I would like to hear the Commissioner's opinion on that.  We are an island nation and are not connected to Europe as such, which will post difficulties for us.</p><p>  What is the Transport Commissioner's biggest current challenge?  What would he like to see being achieved during Ireland's EU Presidency? </p><p>  Ireland has some fantastic roads but we are missing rest stops and service stations along motorways to enable drivers to take a break.  Would a proposal for a rest stop every 50 km be appropriate for a country like Ireland?</p></speech>

How will climate change and fuel security impact on the airline industry in future?  What challenges will we face in that area?  Do our waterways feature in the EU's transport strategy?  I take the Commissioner's point about transport always being seen as a problem and that he does not necessarily want to view it in that way in future.  How cost effective is rail in the movement of people?</p><p>  I also wish to register a complaint which is a hobby-horse of mine.  The EU ruled against insurers in Ireland on gender equality, whereas prior to this ruling female drivers could get cheaper insurance.  The reverse now exists whereby we are being discriminated against because we are safer drivers.  I think that EU ruling is quite unfair.</p></speech>

As has been said already, we are so dependent on marine and air transport for access to this island nation.  Our regional airports are important not only for transport within this country but also for access to the UK and mainland Europe.  We have a public service obligation which operates in peripheral areas, including two of our strongest regional airports in Kerry and Donegal.  Both airports are very dependent on the tourism industry and are a key to attracting investment to both those areas.  What is the Commissioner's opinion on renewing these vital public service obligation contracts to these particular airports?  I cannot see a real future for them without EU subsidies.  They are important for rural development and connectivity both within and outside the country.</p><p>  Marine transport is also important for tourism.  A few years ago, a ferry service was revived between Wales and Ireland, sailing from Cork to Swansea.  There was a major effort, particularly from Deputy Harrington's constituency of west Cork, in conjunction with Kerry.  Private moneys were contributed along with local authority finance to revive that particular route.  Unfortunately, it has been abandoned and due to certain laws and regulations it was impossible for the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to subscribe funding to it.  Nonetheless, that is a vital service and, given our current economic circumstances, we need to get that route back up and running.  Can support be obtained from the EU for that service due to our special case as an island nation?  The European rail network is a vital priority and is pivotal, but we have to make up for it with air and sea transport systems.</p></speech>

We will see if we can make progress with all these issues.  The passenger ship safety review will come up, but it is not linked to the <i>Costa Concordia</i> incident.  We have already prepared it.  The maritime labour convention has basically already been decided politically.</p><p>  The ports policy is in preparation and will be discussed during Ireland's EU Presidency.  </p><p>  The so-called Blue Belt project is an important and positive issue, which probably addresses many nuances in the questions that have been posed.  It was launched by the Belgian EU Presidency a couple of years ago.  We will push ahead with this, together with the Commission's tax and customs departments.  This will be a really positive development for the transportation of goods by shipping within the EU.  It will take down all the customs barriers and other formalities, making life much easier.  We will have a report on the Blue Belt project during the Irish EU Presidency and will discuss it then. </p> <p>The expanding of the European Maritime Safety Agency's activities will be an issue during Ireland's EU Presidency.  This has been a sensitive issue, but the agency has been tremendously efficient and good.  For instance, the information provided by it is used to fight piracy.  The agency was first established to avert environmental disasters at sea after the <i>Erika</i>and <i>Prestige</i>oil spill disasters.  Maritime security is now part of its work and the Irish Presidency can progress the expansion of its activities in this area.</p><p> Roadworthiness tests were discussed at the last Council meeting and will be again at the next one.  The issue is also being discussed in the European Parliament and we are flexible on it.  The basic idea is to improve the technical condition of older vehicles and motorbikes as their roadworthiness is one cause of road accidents.  There needs to be some harmonisation in how to test vehicles for roadworthiness and how frequently it should be done.  Vehicles cross borders and one member state does not want a vehicle from another country blowing out black smoke, for example, when it is not permitted.  This issue will be discussed at the next Council meeting.</p><p> The question on an access charge for commercial traffic in the United Kingdom is very interesting.  I do not know the exact details, but the issue of road pricing will also be discussed in the near future.  I do not believe there will be tough proposals.  However, from a European viewpoint, we can intervene if there is discrimination in how the charge is applied.  The charge must be equal for a citizen of the member state as well as for other EU citizens.  Accordingly, the United Kingdom and Austria cannot charge just vehicles from other countries for access to their roads.  It must be remembered 24 member states already charge for road use, either through the eurovignette, tolling systems and toll roads.  There will be a financing cap in this regard.  In countries with heavy vehicle and transit traffic tension is increasing that these users must pay more.  I raised this issue in my own country 15 years ago and it can only be done as part of a package.  If one introduces road-charging, fuel excise tax which is used for road maintenance must be reduced.</p><p> On the issue of the British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, the British euroscpetics and the EU budget, the Commission has tried hard to resolve it.  I was responsible for the budget discharge in the previous Commission.  I had big meetings, particularly in the United Kingdom, about how moneys were spent in the European Union.  These meetings were good.  There are some weak points in spending that need to be addressed.  Several months ago Mr. Radoslaw Sikorski's, the Polish foreign Minister, made an interesting speech in Blenheim Palace about Britain's role in the Union.  I strongly recommend that members read this critical speech on British myths about the Union and how ridiculous the notion is that the UK Government thinks it can be alone outside the Union.  Funnily, it was not widely published in the UK newspapers.  Press freedom is very special.  There was only one article on the speech in the <i>Financial Times,</i>but it did not receive a wider circulation.</p><p> The electrification of railways is the main concern of the Irish Government.  The biggest strategic challenge facing transport is connecting Europe and improving existing transport infrastructure.  There are other challenges such as air transport and external relations in transport.  There are standards in place to ensure rest areas for drivers along roads.  We have introduced a smart safe parking system and an IT solution to allow drivers to locate these areas.  They are contained in road standards, but it depends on the provision of investment to achieve it.</p><p> Fuel security for airlines is a major issue in Europe.  It is important to introduce fuel efficiencies in this regard.  For example, Rolls Royce, the leading producer of aviation engines, informed me a 1% reduction in the level of fuel consumption through engine improvement would lead to savings of a year's supply.  Fuel costs are of paramount importance to the airlines.  We have adopted a research and development programme, Flightpath 2050, chaired by Mr. Tom Enders, chief executive officer, European Aeronautic Defence and Space, EADS, which has been established in conjunction with the Commissioner for Research, Innovation and Science, Ms M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn.  Its main aim is to direct research and innovation in aeronautical design to reduce fuel consumption.  There have been experiments using blended fuels and bio-fuels.</p> <p>Air transport specialists say that air transport will be the last mode which will change from fossil fuel to bio-fuels, but some blending is possible.</p><p> New investments in railways are so large that they cannot be done only on a commercial basis.  On operational costs, well-organised railway networks are profitable.  High speed trains such as Eurostar and many busy regional networks are also profitable.  The passenger transport railway network in my country is not profitable but the Government supports it.  We calculate that one can take people by taxi from point A to point B for the same cost but, of course, people like railways very much and politicians always must do what people like.  There is a limit, but we still support some public service obligations.</p><p> On the matter of airport state aid guidelines concerning Greece's investments which also can promote tourism, this is a tricky question because it can go too far.  One cannot see clearly what are the limits for air transport, but some countries use Regional Development Fund moneys to promote tourism and also help airlines to bring tourists.  It is probably a more reasonable way.</p><p> On gender balance, it is the Court of Justice which decides.  The Commission is very much in favour of promoting gender balance.  How to do it is another question.  In general, some countries are very successful in this regard.</p><p> On supporting a ferry service, the question is mostly of money.  In my country, the ferry service between islands and the continent is supported by public service obligations.  It depends on whether there is the political will to do it, how to support it, what they decide on money and how fairly it is used.  It is a question for member states.</p></speech>

There are miles of wire barriers on the central reservations of motorways in this country whereas they have been retired from motorways in other countries in the European Union and in the United Arab Emirates.  Other countries felt they were not adequate to stop a heavy goods vehicle from traversing the central reservation onto oncoming traffic on the other side.  Would Mr. Kallas care to comment as to their adequacy?  I get concerned when I see them being retired from motorways in other countries.</p></speech>
