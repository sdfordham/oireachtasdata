We will have a presentation this afternoon from representatives of Tusla.  I welcome CEO, Mr. Fred McBride, chief operations officer, Mr. Jim Gibson, director of transformation and policy, Mr. Cormac Quinlan, service director, Dr. Aisling Gillen and service director for Dublin and the mid-Leinster area, Ms Patricia Finlay.  I thank them for coming here this afternoon at short notice.  The committee is also grateful to the witnesses for agreeing to a shorter meeting this afternoon.  I also welcome members and viewers who may be watching these proceedings on Oireachtas TV.</p><p>Before we commence and in accordance with procedure, I am required to draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.</p><p>They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of a long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House, or any official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> I remind members to switch off their mobile phones - which I forgot to do - because it will interfere with the sound systems.  It affects the ability of the parliamentary reporters to record what people are saying.  It makes it hard for people watching or listening at home to pick up what is being said.</p><p> I advise witnesses that submissions or opening statements they have made to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.  After the presentations, there will be a series of questions from members for approximately one hour and 50 minutes until 4 o'clock.</p><p> The purpose of today's meeting is to discuss HIQA's report and the investigation into the management of allegations of child sex abuse against adults of concern by the Child and Family Agency upon the direction of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  The report arose from the RT&Eacute; "Prime Time" programme which revealed that Tusla had sent notification to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, containing a false allegation of child sex abuse against a Garda whistleblower, Sergeant Maurice McCabe.  In light of these circumstances and concern about more systematic issues that might require a response at national level, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, instructed HIQA to carry out a statutory investigation under the Health Act 2007.  The HIQA board approved this investigation which began in March 2017.</p><p> The investigation report was published yesterday and made a number of recommendations to improve safety, quality and standards of services provided by Tusla regarding referrals of allegation of child abuse involving adults of concern.</p><p> As Chairman, I take the opportunity to thank HIQA for the speed with which it dealt with this statutory inquiry.  To complete a statutory inquiry into such a large organisation in just under a year is no small feat.  I thank HIQA for its very significant input into the activities of Tusla and the policies surrounding it, underpinned by legislation passed by these Houses.</p><p> Before I invite Mr. McBride to make his opening statement, I note for the members the comprehensive document prepared by the secretariat and circulated to them.  If they have an opportunity, they should read it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-20a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fred McBride" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2018062000002#B00200"><p>I thank the committee for giving us the opportunity to talk about the HIQA investigation and report.  We acknowledge and welcome the recommendations.  I also welcome HIQA&rsquo;s acknowledgement that there is now clear strategic direction and a long-term vision of what we want to achieve.  HIQA has made it clear and consistently stated both in this report and in other inspection reports that where a concern about a child is expressed to Tusla and we have information to indicate that the child is at immediate risk, the child gets an immediate response and that response is deemed to be protective and keeps them safe or reduces the risk.</p> <p>  HIQA also confirmed the consistent finding of Tusla staff advocating strongly for the children and families for whom it works.  They have shown a capacity to maintain good relationships and improve outcomes for children.  Of course, we receive 53,000 referrals a year.  We cannot possibly respond to 53,000 referrals immediately and therefore, of course, a degree of prioritisation must take place.  This HIQA report focuses on those referrals where it is not deemed that children are at immediate risk, how we prioritise these referrals and what action we take on them.</p> <p>  It was reassuring for us, albeit a very challenging read in the report, that the investigation report highlights exactly those issues faced by the agency which we had already identified and which we have been proactively addressing, mostly over the past two years.  I know the agency is four years old, but in the first two years we were really just trying to keep services going and it was not until 2016 that additional investment was made available to us - very welcome as it was - that we began to reflect on and analyse the work that needed to be done.  We embarked on a very comprehensive organisational cultural programme and reform.  One of the HIQA external advisers, to whom I spoke the other day, remarked that it was both an ambitious and a radical attempt to change child-protection services, which is what it is.</p> <p>  I point out some of the significant progress we have made since Tusla was established.  By 9 July we will have rolled out what we are calling the national childcare information system, an integrated computerised system.  This will mean that for the first time in this country all our 17 functional operational areas will be on one integrated IT system, which we hope will eliminate inconsistencies that previously occurred with a mixture of paper-based systems and a plethora of obsolete and outdated computer systems.</p> <p>  As the report acknowledged, we have been developing many interagency protocols to assist in working with key partners, particularly in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the HSE.  The report also highlights, particularly in the governance review, that interagency and collaborative working was a consistent strength of Tusla, with many examples of children being safer as a result.</p> <p>  We have also invested considerable time and money in what we call our prevention, partnership and family-support programme, which supports families in their local communities with initiatives such as Parenting 24-7 and Meitheal.  We have developed the child protection notification system so that for children who are subject to a child protection plan there is live and accessible information available on a multiagency basis which the Garda, medical staff and accident and emergency units can access across the country.  In another first for the country, we now have an out-of-hours service that covers the whole country rather than just Dublin and Cork.</p> <p>  Despite that progress, I absolutely agree that there are inconsistencies in our system and in our response to referrals where a child is not identified as being at immediate risk, as highlighted by HIQA.  We are actively addressing this through our new national approach to practice.  The last time the members of the committee visited us in the Brunel building, they had an opportunity to see some of the detail of that national approach to practice, which we are callings Signs of Safety.  We are confident this will bring a consistency throughout the country so that children and families receive a consistent, timely and proportionate response.</p> <p>  We also accept HIQA's findings that we need to further improve our governance and accountability arrangements.  Some further key posts are required in that regard.  Accountability is about identifying problems and taking responsibility for these problems, understanding their causes and putting in place actions to remedy these.  That is exactly what we have been doing for the past two and a half years in particular, but also before that.</p> <p>  The agency is accountable to a board and, as I emphasised at the press conference yesterday, staff are held to account in a proportionate and fair way through robust HR procedures.</p> <p>  I wish to speak about the legislative context and we may get a chance to discuss it in more detail.  In particular I refer to the legislative context concerning retrospective and historical allegations of abuse.  That is where an adult comes forward now to say that something happened to them as a child.  We have been thrust into a space by case law, which places a responsibility on us to balance fair and due process for the person against whom the allegation has been made on the one hand and on the other hand trying to make an assessment of the risk to children now and what we need to do about that.  There are significant legal constraints around that and we may get an opportunity to explore some of that in more detail today.</p><p>Nevertheless, in the past two years we have reduced the number of unallocated retrospective allegations by approximately 60% which, by any industry standard, is a pretty reasonable improvement.  The pace of change has been rapid and I accept the Minister's supportive comments about what we have achieved so far.  We need to increase the pace of change and we look forward to the discussion with the oversight group the Minister intends to set up on how that increase in pace might be achieved.</p><p> We accept the recommendations that HIQA set out and see them as an endorsement of our programme of reform.  We undoubtedly have some way to go but we are actively addressing all the issues to ensure practice across the country is consistent and of a high quality in order that we can provide a timely, proportionate and appropriate response to children and families.  We acknowledge that quality is variable at the moment.</p></speech>

I have one question to ask and I can then open the discussion to members.  The line which jumped off the page from the presentation provided by Mr. McBride, in the context of the HIQA report, was, "the report does not indicate that delays or inconsistencies affected the immediate safety of any child" which begs the question as to how he can be sure of that, given the gravity and context of the report.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-20a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fred McBride" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2018062000002#C00500"><p>The report states that after the examination of certain cases, there was no indication that children were at immediate risk.  There is always a degree of unknown elements with 53,000 referrals a year.  Almost all of them - 98% or 99% - are screened, although they do not all move to an initial assessment.  Somebody looks a referral and decides whether immediate action needs to be taken.  HIQA acknowledges that, from the evidence it looked at, no child who needs an immediate response does not get one.  That is consistent with what we know ourselves because we respond immediately to children who are at immediate risk or in harm's way.  We monitor the cases which are waiting to be allocated and where the circumstances change, we look for any new information that comes in on these cases.  It is entirely possible that a child could be in harm's way without us knowing.  In the case of more than one third of unallocated cases, I would not even call them "unallocated" because they are being actively worked by our duty and intake teams.  It is simply that they do not have a single, dedicated social worker attached to them.  I realise and accept that having a duty team working cases is not ideal but I do not think it means they are unallocated.  That is a debatable point and I do not suggest I am absolutely correct in this regard but I am trying to provide nuance in this respect.</p> <p>  Other cases are monitored by the duty team and when there is any new information suggesting a case be given a higher priority, we do that.  We contact schools, we may visit a child at home and we talk to people in the community.  Can we always know there are no risks to children?  I am sorry but we cannot.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-20a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Gibson" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2018062000002#C00600"><p>It is important to outline our service delivery design.  Before the agency was established, it was quite common for a community care area to have four or five points of contact to refer a matter relating to a child.  Within our service delivery framework, we now have dedicated contact points in each functional area of the Child and Family Agency.  As for the percentage split of referrals to the agency, 60% are for child welfare or children in need cases and 40% are child protection cases.</p> <p>  The system has become more sophisticated.  The HIQA investigative report was a point in time.  We have mentioned the prevention, partnership and family support, PPFS, programme.  In each area, we have a team that reads, evaluates and directs referrals.  For example, 1,300 staff and other members in the non-government sector have been trained in the Meitheal programme and there have been 1,409 requests.  There are 99 family support networks across Ireland that pick up and help families in need and early intervention and support such as this ensures these cases do not materialise as serious child protection concerns.</p> <p>  Some 28,500 children in Ireland have received a family support service and we are ramping the service up.  Every report and inquiry in Ireland concluded there was a dearth of family support services and early intervention programmes and we have worked exceptionally hard and tirelessly since our establishment, with the collaboration of Atlantic Philanthropies, which put &euro;10 million on the table for us, and with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and NUI Galway to develop this side of our business.  A research report will be provided in September, which will show the results of this work and really good outcomes for children in Ireland.  There are 53,000 referrals and they are not just about child protection but are about child welfare as well.  We try to get in early to resolve problems to support families and children.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-20a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1376" speakername="Lorraine Clifford Lee" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2018062000002#C00700"><p>I am utterly disillusioned after reading yesterday's report.  Many of us thought it was a repeat of previous reports, although there are various nuances in this one, and it seems that little or no progress is being made.  I was disappointed with the lack of urgency on the part of Tusla and the blas&eacute; attitude in yesterday's statements, which were to the effect that Tusla got some things right but not other things.  We are talking about very vulnerable children and even if Tusla fails to get it right on one occasion, it is one occasion too many.</p> <p>  The report stated that there had been an issue with the retention of social workers and that there seems to have been a very high turnover.  Can the witnesses outline why this issue exists?</p><p>What attempts are being made to recruit social workers?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-20a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fred McBride" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2018062000002#D00200"><p>We are making major attempts to recruit social workers and we have tried to take back control of what we call social work panels.  They used to be national panels run by the national recruitment service of the HSE.  For the first two years, we were entirely dependent on that system for recruitment.  I am absolutely clear it did not and does not meet our purposes or needs.  It is not quick enough and is too bureaucratic and inflexible.  Over the past two years, we have attempted to take back some degree of control at least over that process by setting up our own Tusla recruiting capacity.  Recently, we have taken back the social work panels from the national recruitment service and have set up regional arrangements for recruitment.</p> <p>  We have also been in touch with third level institutions and we have a third level liaison group.  Through universities and colleges, we are trying to promote Tusla as an employer of choice and ensure people get the support they need when they come to work.  We are trying to work with universities to ensure new graduates are as ready as they can be for the practice, albeit that everybody will need some support in his or her first two years.  I have also personally been to recruitment events outside Ireland trying to recruit social workers, particularly from the North and the UK.  Those are some of the actions we have taken.</p> <p>  We have also been looking at a retention strategy and we have been recruiting in large numbers.  The problem has been keeping hold of staff, to be frank.  We are looking at other measures, such as creating a senior practitioner grade, to try to encourage people to stay in practice.  Currently, career development often means moving into management and we want to give opportunities to people to stay in practice and be rewarded and recognised for their experience.  The turnover of social workers in the Republic of Ireland is 8.8% and in the UK it is 15%.  We have real problems but comparatively speaking, it is not quite as bad as other places.  We really need to work further on that in order to support people in doing this work.  We want people coming to Tusla who really want to do the work.  We cannot have people coming in because they need a job and would rather be working in the mental health, disability or probation areas.  I do not want that and we do not need cases where people stay for a short period and leave.  We need people who are dedicated to this area of social work and who really want to work with us and be supported.</p> <p>  We are also looking at our skills mix and we will have a workforce plan ready in the autumn that will describe the sort of mix we think we require.  It is not just all about social workers, as important as they are, particularly in the area of child sexual abuse.  We need qualified social workers to do that work.  Their work can be supported and supplemented by social care workers, family support workers and our very valuable administrative and clerical staff in order to free social workers to do what they need to.  That work is in train.</p></speech>

I refer to case G, a care order application in the Dublin metropolitan District Court for a young girl who came into care on an interim care order on grounds of neglect.  While she was in care, she made disclosures of very serious sexual abuse by a number of male individuals that formed the major ground for the application.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also interviewed the child a number of times but the Director of Public Prosecutions did not proceed with prosecution.  The care order was granted and a UK forensic psychologist examined all the DVDs of these interviews and gave evidence on the grounds of credibility.  He found the child's account of the abuse was highly credible but was highly critical of the Garda interviews by finding the child had been over-interviewed, which was particularly concerning and almost abusive.  What is Tusla doing to organise joint interviews with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure children are not over-interviewed, perhaps feeding into the abuse process?  What steps are being taken in this regard?</p></speech>

We are looking to train far more people in joint interviewing with the Garda.  As training is provided by the Garda, it is not completely within our control but we are in discussions with the Garda about increasing the numbers of social workers we have trained in joint interviewing to prevent exactly what the Senator mentions, the over-interviewing of children.</p></speech>

They sit under my direction and that programme of work is examining the finalisation of an information-sharing agreement, which is in the final stages at present as it is going through legal review.  The Garda also has asked the Data Protection Commission to review it as well to ensure it is compliant with current general data protection regulation requirements.  We are just about to sign off on a joint protocol with the Garda relating to specialist interviewing in order that there is clarity on how and when social workers are to be brought into those interviews.  There are approximately 14 social workers who are currently active and trained doing interviews and we expect to have ten more trained this year.  As Mr. McBride indicated, we are reliant on the Garda to provide us with that training programme but we are actively looking at it and progressing it all the time.  The Minister has been very supportive of the work on giving consideration to joint teams.  We must think about how that might work practically but we are absolutely committed to ensuring we are doing joint interviews and not re-interviewing children unnecessarily.</p></speech>

We are trying to be realistic in saying we accept the HIQA report and its recommendations and it is an analysis with which we agree with regard to various aspects of services.  That is really all I was trying to say.  I was in no way trying to be at all complacent about the size of the task ahead of us.  It is a huge task.</p></speech>

We appreciate it.  They have acknowledged the systemic failures that exist within Tusla as an organisation.  I do not intend it to be personal when I say that the people at the top of Tusla need to have a cold, hard look at the organisation based on this report.  Perhaps they are doing that.  It is too bad that we hear about the various instances that occur so regularly.  When we, as legislators, are discussing this matter with the witnesses today, we are seeking answers to our questions in order that the public can be somewhat reassured that the most vulnerable children in the State are being looked out for.  Is there a problem with the skills mix that needs to be resolved?  What can the witnesses say to reassure those who are tuning into today's proceedings?  Mr. McBride said at the outset that a child could be in harm's way without the knowledge of Tusla.  I accept that this can happen but I suggest that such cases should be exceptional.  Is that too much for us to expect from the organisation?  I understand why Mr. McBride wants to be realistic about what people can expect.  I ask him to comment on what I have said.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-20a.37" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fred McBride" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2018062000002#E00200"><p>I was trying to say I do not think we can know about every single situation in which a child is at risk.  We can only know about what we find out about, what we are told about, what we see and what we observe.  There are children at risk in many families and situations in Ireland and Tusla and other State agencies do not necessarily know about them.  Sexual abuse, by its very nature, happens behind closed doors.  There are efforts within families and other extended networks to keep it secret.  I have to say that realistically, we cannot know about everything.  As HIQA has reported, when these matters come to our attention and we think there is an immediate risk or a child is immediately in harm's way, we respond immediately and we do something about it.  This report is about how we prioritise our response to cases involving children who are not at immediate risk and how we make sure that response is appropriate, sufficiently timely and proportionate.  While we should not overreact to something, equally seriously we should not under-react.  That is the best way I can answer the Senator's question.  I am trying to be honest and realistic.  We cannot know about every child's situation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-20a.38" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Gibson" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2018062000002#E00300"><p>It is probably quite important to communicate the statistics to the committee.  As we said earlier, we receive 53,000 referrals each year.  We have 24,366 open cases in which there is a concern that children may be at risk.  I mention that to give the committee an idea of the volume of work we are doing.  As we have communicated on a regular basis, the unallocated cases represent the big concern for us as an agency.  It has been mentioned that the number of such cases has been driven down by 51% since 2014.  We recognise that approximately 4,700 cases are unallocated.  In some of those cases, we must try to define what the concern for the referral is.  It is really clear for our business.  If we get a referral about a child who will not wear his coat to school during the winter and his mother is really struggling with that, and at the same time, we get a referral about a young girl who has disclosed to her teacher that her father entered her bedroom and acted in a sexually inappropriate way, we will deal with the latter referral there and then.  We will sort that situation out there and then.  There are many referrals on our system in cases like that of the child who will not wear his coat.  As part of our national approach to practice, we are looking at such cases and drilling down into them.  As I said earlier when I was speaking about the prevention, partnership and family support programme, there is a place and a pathway for those children to go to.  We will look at the child who is not wearing a coat at some stage but not on the day on which the referral is received because our resources are finite.  We will deploy them where children are most at risk.  I hope that helps.</p></speech>

Systemic issues have been mentioned with particular reference to the screening exercise.  Screening has two main goals.  When we get a referral, we have to gather information, analyse it quickly and make a judgment on what we should do in respect of the matter.  Obviously, we check what information we already hold in respect of that family.  That is the task of screening.  One of the most important goals of screening is to identify children who are at immediate risk at that point in time and to respond to that.  It is stated clearly in the HIQA report and every other inspection report that we do this consistently well all of the time.  Beyond that, we look at what response is needed in other cases and how we prioritise those cases.  In 2015, when we reviewed our system to identify the problems with regard to screening and prioritisation, we identified that the existence of inconsistencies and delays in this respect was an issue for us.  Since February of this year, we have been applying the national approach to practice at the front door during the analysis stage.  This has allowed us to bring much better consistency and rigour to the process.  We know that gathering information, supplying good analysis and judgment and involving everyone in that process is really important in effective child protection systems.  As part of our efforts to embed that approach to practice at the front door, we have completed four pilot sites - one in each region around the country - since February of this year.  We are applying the methodology at the front door.  We are looking at unallocated cases in those areas and at new cases coming into the system.  Consultants are sitting beside social workers as they take calls.  They are supporting them in using the national approach to practice.  We are planning to roll out this piece of work across all the other areas by the end of this year.  It will help us to decide what we take in or do not take in.  It will help us to get the right service to the right child for the right reason.  We are embedding that.  During the work we have done to date, staff have been telling us that this approach is leading to more timely responses to priority cases and better analysis from the first call that is received.  When we have been doing this work, we have seen a 30% average reduction in non-allocated cases.  Relationship-based work is first and foremost when social workers are engaging with families and finding networks for children from the outset.  Safety planning is beginning earlier as well.  We are seeing real improvements in what is happening as part of the screening and prioritisation exercise.  New revised guidance for the entire service will come out of that work.</p></speech>

Given the rate of turnover, I find it hard to believe there is no morale issue.  I do not get what the difficulty is when it comes to social workers.  There is an issue when it comes to front-line workers.  The primary managers within Tusla are responsible for putting structures and protocols in place to protect children and front-line workers.  It is clear that such workers are having to deal with many of the frustrations of the public, for example with regard to what they hear in the media.  It is coming straight back at front-line workers.  The witnesses might not have enough time in this slot to come back in on this point.  I will explore it further when I get an opportunity to come in again.</p></speech>

Tusla is dealing with many legacy issues.  This is affecting the reputation of the organisation.  It is incumbent on Tusla officials to address that.  Tusla is sometimes unfairly talked about or hammered for cases that arose before the organisation came into being.  Tusla has to deal with that.  Tusla should deal with that, try to explain where the problems have come from and what it is doing about them.  This is because it affects the morale of staff working in Tusla.  It affects the ability of the agency to recruit and retain staff.  It also affects public confidence in Tusla.  It is important to put out the message that many of these issues are legacy issues.  They are present in many other elements of our country and in various Departments.  That is unfortunate but it is a fact of life.  I am keen to see the agency do a little more to defend itself and articulate better what it is dealing with and why as well as how it intends to deal with those issues.</p> <p>  Reference was made to staffing.  Clearly, Tusla does not have enough social workers.  When we had the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs before the committee this time last year, she was honest in saying that even with all the courses in third-level institutions being full and churning out qualified graduates, we are still playing catch-up.  We are far behind the level at which we need to be.</p> <p>  I accept Mr. McBride's comment to the effect that social workers are enthusiastic and committed.  I do not doubt that for a moment.  They have extremely heavy caseloads and are far beyond safe levels.  I have one specific question.  What is the average caseload for a social worker?  What is the recommended caseload for a social worker?  We may as well put out what exactly we are dealing with.</p> <p>  My next question relates to the alternatives to social workers and how we can use the budget if we cannot find the people we need now.  I know for a fact that social workers go home at the end of each day and then type up their own notes, send emails, stuff their own envelopes and post their own letters.  That is fine when they have the time to do it, but they do not most of the time.  When are we going to see administrative staff come online?  To me, it sounds like an immediate requirement.  Administrative staff should be in place now.  There should be a pool of administrative staff, with one secretary for every five social workers.  Something along those lines would work to take the stress off social workers in having to do the basic day-to-day administration.  That would free up time.  When will that come online?  A total of &euro;40 million has been allocated to Tusla this year.  I assume that we will have similar funding for next year, if not more.  What is it being spent on?  Where is the &euro;40 million being spent this year?  What is it going on?</p> <p>  Are there alternatives to social workers?  Obviously, prevention is far better than dealing with a child who needs to be taken from her home.  Early intervention is key.  What is Tusla doing around creative community alternatives to try to prevent children coming in to care in the first instance?  What is Tusla doing around addiction, counselling and parenting services?  There are basic things that should be done.  Do we need to go into a family home to help families to clean the house or to help the parent get the child to school in morning?  That may involve hiring a taxi.  That is basic stuff.  What level of funding is going into such work this year?  What level of funding will go into that work next year?  What additional services will Tusla bring on stream that will come under the umbrella of creative additional community alternatives?</p> <p>  Other issues arise in respect of early intervention.  What is the plan regarding family resource centres?  Are we going to open more of them?  Where will they be located?  Does Tulsa have enough funding to do that?  Does Tusla need more funding for that next year?  How much is Tusla spending on that this year?  What will Tusla spend on it next year?</p> <p>  Where are the pinch points in Tusla resources?  What does Tusla need?  Do we need to be putting pressure on the Minister and the Government for budget 2019?  We are moving into budget negotiations now.  I am also a member of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  We are now getting in submissions from the various sectors on what they are looking for.  What is Tusla specifically seeking in 2019?</p></speech>

We are going to have to try to answer the questions between us.  Deputy Lisa Chambers asked about the average caseload.  Perhaps Ms Finlay or Dr. Gillen can deal with that.  We have in place a caseload management system.  One thing I would say before Ms Finlay comes in is that we need to be a little careful about numbers.  It is possible to have an unmanageable caseload of ten but a manageable caseload of 20.  It depends on the work the staff are doing.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked a question about Tusla inheriting legacy issues.  She mentioned how, at times, we have been hammered for various things.  In many ways we welcome the opportunity to be here to talk about positive initiatives the agency is undertaking.  I am keen to mention something we can really be proud of as an agency.  The investigations and the work we are doing have found that we provide a child-centred service.  We are passionate about ensuring the voices of children and parents are heard in everything we do.  It is vital that their voices are heard in how we deliver services.  They can influence the way we work.</p> <p>  One example is that we have invested significantly in the training of staff with regard to child participation.  We are keen to ensure that, at all times, this is a cornerstone of our culture.  At present within Tusla we have 45 teams throughout the country.  These teams have been awarded an independent quality mark called the Investing in Children Membership Award.  Those responsible for the quality mark have independently verified that Tusla staff are doing really good strong child participatory work.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the caseload.  I have been a social worker and a social work manager.  A social worker may be allocated 12 children in care.  Of those 12 children in care, it may be that six are really settled in foster care.  They may be doing really well, going to school and may be really attached to their foster carers.  There may be no court work linked to such cases.  The social worker will have a role to visit the child and ensure that the placement is meeting the needs of the child in question.  In contrast, a social worker might have four children in the caseload who are in real difficulty and who have really strong presentation of trauma.  They may be presenting with complex needs.  Their foster carers or family may be really struggling.  Such cases may take far more time.  That is why we have brought in our caseload management system.  This something we are leading on throughout Europe with our caseload management system.  The idea is to provide a weighting to different types of cases.  We provide a reduced caseload weighting for our newer graduates.  Again, it is about retaining them and ensuring they have a manageable workload.</p></speech>

Are Tusla social workers operating with caseloads beyond a level that the agency officials consider to be safe?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-20a.64" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Patricia Finlay" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2018062000002#G00100"><p>As part of the caseload management system, the social worker and team leader regularly review caseloads and apply a rating of manageable or unmanageable.  When a caseload becomes unmanageable, the issue is escalated and brought to the attention of the principal social worker.  Clearly, when a social worker has an unmanageable caseload for a significant period, it causes concerns about burnout and raises retention of staff issues.</p></speech>

Our social workers are now more mobile.  One wonders in this day and age why we did not have mobility earlier.  Social workers use all sorts of mobile device.  It means that they can do work, rather than sit for three hours doing very little while waiting for a case to be called in court.  Case recording was one of the issues highlighted by HIQA.  Social workers can visit families and type up case notes in their car or somewhere quiet which are immediately linked with the national child care information system, NCCIS.  Social workers have told us mobile technology has saved them between five and ten hours a week, which represents real progress.</p> <p>  Prevention has been mentioned.  Dr. Gillen leads the prevention, partnership and family support piece about which we talked.  Does she wish talk more about the matter?    </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-20a.66" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Aisling Gillen" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2018062000002#G00300"><p>Yes, I would be delighted to do so.  As Mr. McBride said, I lead the prevention, partnership and family support programme.  Around 2013, within the Health Service Executive as it was at the time, we set out a question for ourselves and brought in people like the chief executive of Barnados, representatives of the Daughters of Charity and the chief executive of Pobal.  Senior managers in the HSE asked what was needed to really advance family support services.  As a result, our prevention, partnership and family support programme was born.  It comprises a number of strands.  Supporting parenting is the core business for all of us.  Our business is supporting parents across the continuum of care.  Sometimes it is providing top-up advice and support that we all need as parents.  That support leads to mandating in the supervision of parents in more difficulty, for example, at the top end of the continuum.  There is our corporate parenting piece, our children in care piece.  We act in <i>loco parentis</i>for over 6,000 children who are in the care of the State.  In identifying what supporting parents means across the continuum of care and the evidence that tells us how best to support them, parenting 24/7 is a set of key messages based around four practitioners.  If one is working with parents across the life cycle of a child and in different circumstances, what do we need to think about?  For example, fathers matter.  When I sit in on a case conference, I must ensure the voice of the father is heard in the room also.  <br/><br/>My colleague has mentioned participation.  There is a strand of work associated with it.  We have trained 1,300 staff across the country in participatory practice with children and young people.  In such training the child is put at the centre of decision-making in their own lives.  Children are encouraged to be part of the decision-making process in how we design, develop, deliver and evaluate our services.  We have many such examples. <br/><br/>Another piece is our area-based approach - the prevention, partnership and family support programme.  As part of the continuum of services that Mr. Quinlan articulated, we have established within Tusla an early intervention pathway.  We have put in place senior managers for prevention, partnership and family support within the 17 area management structures.  Below them we have senior co-ordinators and co-ordinators who have established 99 child and family support networks across the country.  We operate Meitheal, our early identification of need and practical help tool.  We have many examples of parents who have stood out publicly.  One striking example of success is a non-national lady who came to the country with her husband.  Unfortunately, he left her with three very young children and no money.  She was living in a flat complex that was burned out and  ended up in homeless services, which was good because she ended up back in our services.  she has been part of the Meitheal process for the past two years.  When she came to the country, she could not speak English, but now she can.  Her children are doing well and she is accessing training and employment.<br/><br/>Our high prevention piece is our creative community alternative whereby we work very hard to keep in the community children who are on the edge of care and children who are in care.  That means that we view the child in the context of the family and the community.</p></speech>

They were not getting help from others and were going around to everyone.  We rolled out the scheme on seven sites and hope to expand to 17 next year.  We have achieved efficiencies within our budget to help us with the project.  If we can prevent children from leaving their families and communities, we will not have to spend a significant amount of money per week on private residential placements.</p> <p>  A couple of questions were asked about administration work.  The Deputy is right in saying social workers should not waste time doing filing, etc.  The national child care information system is pretty good and does a lot for social workers.  More importantly, Mr. McBride and I visited an area manager by the name of Caroline in north Dublin who told us that she spent the first three and half months of her current job working on appeals.  It is a fact that we have totally relied on the HSE for a significant period to perform all of these corporate functions, but we need to be self-sufficient.  We have stated this in documents and communications we have sent to the Department which supports our desire to be self-sufficient.  In order to succeed, we are building a regional business and administrative hub based around the service directors in which there will be expertise in managing freedom of information requests, replies to parliamentary questions and getting answers to Members in a more efficient way.  </p> <p>  Health and safety is another matter.  Tusla is a large organisation.  As our CEO has stated, we need to work within many frameworks and show that ours is a safe and consistent agency. </p> <p>  I want area managers to meet their principal social workers to analyse unallocated cases, referrals, the cases of children in care and support our staff in that work.  We have created administrative posts in the past two years at social work team level.  They need such support.</p> <p>  Let us consider the issue of foster care.  HIQA's inspection report identified that we fell down when it came to Garda vetting.  If we did not have everyone vetted in the three year cycle, ours was deemed not to be a safe and effective service.  Having a good administrative support process - a Garda vetting unit within Tusla - generated a significant improvement in that regard.  That is a good example of how administrative issues were dealt with by good and efficient measures. </p> <p>  Family resource centres have been mentioned.  We have spoken about the sad fact that children must tell their stories many times.  We are really good in Ireland in making assessments.  As an agency, we say a child only needs one assessment.  He or she then needs to receive therapeutic support.  As many as 11 more family resource centres are coming on stream.  I am totally responsible for the 6,130 children in the care of the State.  I am not saying they all need a therapeutic intervention, but a good number of them as a result of experiencing neglect and abuse.  We are building therapeutic hubs using our partnerships with the community and voluntary sector.  We have a pilot scheme operating in counties Waterford and Wexford which is working well and children are receiving support.  We want to support children in care.  In north Dublin there is a creative alternative community programme that supports children in foster care who present with challenging behaviours.</p><p>Foster carers need the correct supports.  </p></speech>

We had a discussion on 22 February 2017 when the witness appeared before the committee, and I read that report last night.  The need to integrate 17 IT systems was mentioned.  Many topics have been discussed already, so I am not going to discuss that issue again.</p> <p>   It was said that there was no electronic communication between Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Does Tusla use email?  That is electronic communication.  Why did that not supersede letters or faxes?  I do not even put a fax number on my own literature any more because nobody uses fax machines, but I read, in the report I was given, that the precedent was set as post and faxes.  I understand that the systems are not integrated and a vanilla system is not in place.  Why were PDFs or spreadsheets not put on email so that an electronic record would have been available in the event of an audit carried out by the Garda or any other agency?  Why did that not take precedent over post or fax?  </p> <p>  I would appreciate some comments around HR and accountability.  There seems to have been a disjointed approach taken or some dysfunction in terms of how people applied themselves to their tasks, or indeed the process or model of how they were supposed to engage with their roles.  Who oversaw that?  Who was supposed to make sure that was done correctly?  I have read reports that suggested there was evidence of insufficient oversight to assure the executive and board of Tusla that staff members were adhering to the corporate procedures.  Who oversees that?  What part of the organisation makes sure that that actually happens?  Why is it so disjointed across the different sectors?  </p> <p>  It was mentioned that the electronic communication system will not be in place until 2019, but that the IT system will be available for use in July 2018.  We have been given emails.  Can the witness clarify that?  </p> <p>  In terms of recruitment of social workers, does Tusla have an outline of the recruitment process or model from end to end?  I do not expect the witnesses to articulate it orally, but if a copy of that could be provided to the committee it would be appreciated.  We want to know how many steps or processes a person has to go through in the recruitment chain, from end to end, and what other parts of the public service are involved.  That information would give us an impression of whether the process is too laborious or too long, leading to people dropping out of it.  It would also be good to know if any statistics have been collected around people dropping out of the recruitment process.  Where do they fall out of the process?  Does it represent 60%, 70% or 80%?  Given studies from overseas or in the UK, has Tusla carried out any studies around the blockages in recruitment been carried out?  It would be good to know why people will not come to the Republic of Ireland.</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct.  The data commissioner has carried out a report and we are getting rid of faxes.  Now the electronic communication is done through a portal if a specific referral is required.  Email communication about many other things - more general business - is carried out all the time.  We communicate by email with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na all the time.  Our national childcare information system, NCCIS, will not link in with the PULSE system used by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at the moment.  In the future it will link in with that system, but further work must be done to make that happen.</p></speech>

When one sends an email there is a record of who it was sent by, so there is a trace of information and communication, which leads to accountability.  In the same way, I hope that the new IT system, which has a log-in, will show the person who has entered information or data, as it does in any other enterprise or resource management system.  That is the kernel of my question.  I accept that there was a silo in operation, or a number of different integrated systems that did not relate to each other.  Why was there no policy of electronic communication through email, as opposed to post or fax, while the new IT system was being developed?</p></speech>

This is about modernising that process.  I do not want to speak about another State agency.  I accept what the Deputy has said, and agree that we need to modernise.  We have made one big step in that regard with our integrated childcare system.  If we get a referral or mandated report through the new portal it automatically drops down to the region and area where the report originated.  We had three members of staff working in our IT department until recently.  We did not even have a director of ICT until six months ago.  We are now building that capacity.  This is about modernisation, and being able to track information and communication between staff and between our agency and other agencies.  We have to deal with it.</p> <p>  The connection with the Garda PULSE system is possible, but there are some problems that have to be resolved from an IT, technical and information - data protection - perspective.  It will happen, but it will take time.  We are now using smart equipment, and the level of change we have seen has been significant for an agency that had many different types of databases in 32 areas.  Those 32 areas shrunk to 17 areas when Tusla was established, which was a significant challenge for the agency.  On 9 July every functional area in Tusla will be connected, which will ensure stronger oversight.  That system allows me, as a manager of a social work team, to look at all of the work going on in that team by all of the social workers.  </p> <p>  One of the issues mentioned by HIQA in its report was that we were quite slow to identify poor practice or concern about poor practice.  I am the team leader and I, the principal or the CEO, if he or she wishes, can take that helicopter-like overview of the system.  It can be clearly seen where someone is not recording things, and records which do not show good practice or incidents where a child-centred approach is not taken can easily be identified.  That has really modernised matters for us.  We are on a roll in terms of modernisation, and as one of the Deputies has said, we are aware that we are dealing with legacy issues.  The modernisation of the system was a huge legacy issue for us.  We are modernising now.  We only give laptops to professional people now.</p><p>We do not give them desktops because they are mobile.  We also supplement that with smartphones.  They are connected to their system now, wherever they are.  That is a huge thing.  The next piece is the direct work with children.  Our director is looking at apps that directly engage with children.  Children do not want to sit and talk to somebody.  They want a mechanism.  On the laptop, we will have apps to do direct work with children.  We are mid-stream in this modernisation and we are going in the right direction.</p><p> I email lots of people across the country in different agencies in my role as chief operations officer.  The traditional communication of Garda notifications was by letter and still is but now we are seeing them coming through in our portal.  I think in the last report, there were over 300 Garda-mandated reports that had come through the portal.  We can clarify the figures and give them to the committee.  They are showing that the modernisation is occurring.</p></speech>

Mr. McBride did not read all of his opening statement but it is important the following part of it is read into the record:  "However, it is important to note that the NCCIS is an IT system developed to capture information in respect of children referred to Tusla and was not designed for the purpose of recording retrospective allegations of abuse where there is no known or identified child at risk."  We are after building an ICT system.  We all know now that people come forward when they are older.  Why have we not built that into the ICT system?  Are we going to continue to do that on paper or how are we going to continue to record it?</p></speech>

As far as I am aware, that was not an area of work that we were particularly dealing with at that time although we are dealing with it now.  We have looked at it and while the system was not designed to include that, I am reliably informed that there is a way of including it although some further work will have to be done on the design.</p></speech>

The business process did not include retrospective abuse because it was not an issue for us at the time, as Mr. McBride has highlighted.  The next phase of NCCIS will build that capacity.  Referrals that come into the NCCIS at the moment are child-based referrals because we are a child protection agency.  In any case, we are normally looking for the child we are concerned about, to intervene; even in retrospective abuse cases we are always seeking to find the child who is at risk now, today.  That is how we progress those cases.  We will be able to record information about adults effectively in the system, not as a referral but as what we call "person details" in the system.  We will be able to make a record of the adult victim and the person against whom the abuse allegation is made.  We will have an interim solution in NCCIS going forward.</p></speech>

Why was there a HIQA investigation?  The Minister looked for it and it came out of a retrospective allegation.  That is where this all came from.  I am seeing an anomaly here.  An ICT system has been built but does not address retrospective cases.  We do not have the protocol signed at present.  Is the Children Act fit for purpose to address the roles of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla?  Mr. Quinlan stated that Tusla used not do this retrospective work - where did it fall?</p></speech>

To be clear, retrospective abuse is when a person comes forward today and alleges they were abused in the past, when they were a child, and they are concerned that the person who abused them may be in contact with children today.  Our obligation is to try to identify the child today who might be at risk from that individual.  When we have an identified child and reasonable grounds to suspect that he or she might be at risk, of course we intervene in the situation and such children go up on our system like any other child referred to our service today.</p> <p>  The secondary issue is that when we have this information, this person might, for example, be in a position of employment where they are working with children or might be part of a youth club.  Since the enactment of the legislation, case law has made the interpretation that we have a responsibility to proactively protect children who might be at risk from this person.  In doing so, our obligation is to share relevant information with relevant third parties so that they can make a protective decision.  We are obliged to consider sharing the information with a school authority, for example, so that it can take protective action against that person in the contact they have with children.</p> <p>  In order to share that soft information, as the Deputy can imagine, we have to have a standard of proof.  That is what the court has asked us to ensure.  We have to provide an evidential basis in order to be able to share such information because it affects a person's constitutional rights to employment and his or her good name.  That is where the legislation is weak, as we have pointed out.  We have a clear responsibility but the legislation does not give us authority.  If a victim comes forward today and has a concern, they are normally traumatised and upset.  They may begin to disclose with us and then step away from the process because of the hurt and harm it causes.  We do not have any ability to compel them to come back and speak with us or any powers to compel the person against whom allegation of abuse is being made to come and speak to us.  We are working with a responsibility but without powers of obligation.</p></speech>

We look forward to engaging on what additional solutions that might raise.  I have worked closely with my Department colleagues and victim groups on this issue.  I have also had a lot of contact with the special rapporteur on the matter.  We believe legislative change is required if we are to have a role to play in respect of this matter.  If we do have a role, we will have to do this work jointly with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and with specialist teams of people.  It is a forensic task and one not originally designed for social work.  In that context, we need specialist teams to do the work.  We will also need a form of independent adjudication in respect of these matters.  Case law requires social workers to facilitate semi-judicial processes, where we are asked to allow people to cross-examine each other in respect of these matters and that is not the role of a child protection agency.</p></speech>

If Tusla is to take on this role, does it have the necessary expertise to do it or, at least, the capacity to train or recruit staff to do it?  I note from the report that there is a shortage of this particular skillset to enable Tusla deal with persons that would come forward.</p></speech>

We developed a national service improvement plan to try to allocate those cases to the system.  Back then, there were 1,058 unallocated cases.  We appointed a national lead and regional leads for the national service improvement plan.  As of today, we have allocated all but 103 of those cases.  People get very concerned when they hear of retrospective abuse cases and so on.  Some of the analysis bears out what Mr. Quinlan said in terms of social workers having all of the responsibility without any clear authority.  It should not be forgotten that adults who have experienced an abusive life experience as a child find that incredibly difficult, painful and hurtful.  At times, they come, but pull back.  Our language is really important.  These are complainants.  They are making a disclosure, but they are making a disclosure about a criminal act perpetrated against them.  As stated by Mr. Quinlan, in 71% of retrospective cases we do not get past stage one because the complainants find it hard to tell their story to the extent that gives us sufficient information to progress to stage two.  The 71% relates to cases in the South in respect of which we analysed the work.  We found that often people who make a complaint about a childhood abusive experience cannot engage with us to give us the information we need.  We are doing a lot of work but the substantiation is very low.</p> <p>  As outlined Mr. Quinlan, the direction of travel is co-working with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I worked with a police force in another jurisdiction.  I was trained on how to work with the police on abuse referrals.  That system worked exceptionally well.   </p></speech>

In this regard, the number 65 was mentioned.  I would like to invite my colleague, Ms Patricia Finlay, to bring some clarity to the committee in respect of that number and what we did.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-20a.128" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Patricia Finlay" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2018062000002#K01800"><p>In the investigation report HIQA identified that in 65 of the 671 cases it reviewed as part of its investigation it had sought clarification and assurances from Tusla with regard to the actions it was taking.  We took HIQA's queries very seriously.  In December 2017, we reviewed all the 65 cases identified by HIQA during the investigation process.  The themes identified in those cases include a delay in follow up and queries around timelines in terms of completion of work.  In our review we found that among the reasons for those delays was the complainant being unable to come and talk to us and additional work being necessary to get the complainant to come and tell his or her story about the disclosure.  This is an extremely difficult process for a person.  Very often he or she will have been working with a counsellor or psychiatrist for years to try to come to the point of telling us that story.  As these are retrospective cases, very often dating back 20 or 30 years ago, finding the person subject to the abuse allegation can be difficult.  Sometimes, the person is deceased.</p><p>Sometimes we cannot locate the person as the person has left the country.  That presents challenges in terms of the timeline.</p><p> Those 65 cases were also very complex and multi-layered cases whereby there were significant concerns in terms of intergenerational abuse and the like.  In our analysis of the 65 cases it is important to identify that HIQA and ourselves did not identify any child who had experienced actual harm as a result of either action or inaction by Tusla.  It is important to provide that assurance to the public.</p></speech>

I thank the representatives for attending.  We all acknowledge the steps Tusla has taken to recruit staff, but none of us here is shocked as we have been raising these questions regarding staff numbers constantly with the Minister.  How big is the problem in attracting staff?  How hard is it to get staff into the agency?  Deputy Chambers touched on this briefly but is there a need for more administrative staff?  I do not know if the agency gave a commitment to start recruiting administrative staff.  The biggest workload for social workers is administration.  Looking at this HIQA report it appears that we are back to square one with bad record keeping.  There appears to be a pattern here so perhaps the witnesses will address the question of how big an issue is staffing.  They should be honest and up-front about it.</p> <p>  I also wish to refer to training.  HIQA said in its report that it did not find any strong evidence of effective staff training and development.  That is alarming.  Has a review of the skills sets of staff in Tusla been undertaken to date?  What opportunities for upskilling are available to staff members?  What training is planned to ensure that members of staff are adequately equipped to use the new NCCIS which is due to be rolled out in July?</p></speech>

It is difficult to recruit in terms of social work because there are only so many graduates each year and we are in competition with other agencies such as the HSE, the community and voluntary sector, the Probation Service and so forth.  I outlined earlier some of the more creative measures we are trying to put in place to recruit staff and to retain staff.  Regarding how big an issue it is, at present we have 246 social work vacancies and there is ongoing recruitment to try to recruit for them.  However, there are 156 agency staff filling some of these posts so there is a balance of 90 for which there is ongoing recruitment.  While there are 246 vacancies, we are not always good at explaining the fact that agency staff are covering a significant proportion of those posts.  Agency staff can up and leave but we have in place a plan to convert the agency staff into three year fixed-term contracts to provide some stability.  That is roughly the position with recruitment.</p> <p>  As we mentioned already, administrative staff are very much part of the plan and part of the considerations for changing and improving the skills mix.  It not always about getting in social workers, but also front-line professionals such as social care workers and family support workers and the administrative staff to support them.  We can provide separately a breakdown of the number of staff we are recruiting by grade if the Deputy wishes.</p> <p>  On staff training and development, some time ago we launched our continuous professional development strategy and as part of that we are doing training needs analyses.  People will have personal development plans as a result of that - it is not all in place yet - which will contain their training and development needs on an individual basis for the future.  Signs of Safety is the national approach to practise and we have trained about 1,200 of 1,500 social workers on this new approach.  There is a great deal of staff training and development taking place at present.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-20a.132" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Gibson" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2018062000002#L00400"><p>Some of the analysis on retention has shown the greater number of social workers who leave are aged between 24 and 29 years.  They travel; they go to Australia and America.  There is also the calibre as we move forward.  There is another avenue in which I strongly believe, and Fred McBride and I have discussed it.  There are many mature professional people in the community and voluntary sector who would like to follow a career in social work but due to their financial and family commitments cannot go off to college for four years to do a masters degree.  We welcome the recommendation in the report on the high level group to examine this issue.  If I could ask a training university to develop a course that would allow our staff to go on block release but remain in employment we would get two things - we would get people who are committed to our agency and want to remain in our agency and we would also invest in their professional development through professional qualification.  We need to move quickly on that to bolster our staff.  The demand is outstripping the supply in Ireland at present.  We do not train enough social workers.  There are other avenues for social workers to go to now in disability, elderly and mental health services.  We are in competition with them.  We would like to get to a place where we could have an engagement with colleges.  Our agency provides an immense contribution to the training of social workers by way of professional clinical placements across Ireland.</p></speech>

There was a question earlier about FRCs and &euro;15.6 million of that goes into the FRC programme.  We have 109 FRCs across the country and 11 new ones are coming on stream this year.  We fund organisations such as Barnardos, which is a charity, For&oacute;ige and 698 voluntary community sector providers across the country.  That is a vast skill mix and many of those professionals are involved in our Meitheal process, our child and family support networks, our early intervention and early help with families and supporting families in a family support way across the continuum of care.  If a risk escalates and the child is referred to child protection services the supports for that family retain themselves.  The practical supports of going into the home and supporting that family retain themselves as the child moves up the continuum of care.</p></speech>

How many high risk cases are there at present where children have not been allocated a social worker?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-20a.135" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fred McBride" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2018062000002#L00700"><p>The way we have been categorising these has been as high priority rather than high risk.  We need to have another look at this.  High priority, for example, does not necessarily equate to high risk.  One would think it would but it does not.  A child in care without a social worker could be a high priority, because we have a statutory duty to have a social worker for that child, but the child might well be in a well settled, relative placement where there are no evident risks.  That is an example of where it is a high priority to reallocate a social worker to the child but it is not necessarily a high risk case.</p></speech>

Having being in this position for nearly five years, there are cultural and behavioural issues which need to be addressed.  It was not that long ago that these services were located within 32 health boards.  They all had their own policy frameworks, processes and procedures.  We are trying our very best to break out of that.  The Government has created a national agency for child protection and welfare.  We are doing our damnedest to ensure that people are doing things in a consistent way.  Up to now, that has been a struggle at times.  We are putting in local mechanisms and oversight groups to ensure that when a policy lands, it is implemented consistently.  We are also trying to keep our policies to a minimum.  At one stage, we were producing policies for far too many issues.  Part of the reason people might not have implementing them was because there was just too many.  We are trying to reduce them and keep them to a minimum.  When we do issue a policy, it will come with a clear implementation plan and mandate which people will follow.  That will be overseen by a local governance group.</p></speech>

We want to put children and families back at the centre of what we do and bring good practice as to how we engage with families in order to keep children safe.  Part of the strategy is to align our processes to good practice.  Part of our work going forward will be to align all of those key policies to make sure they make sense to the worker to ensure the practice they are doing with the family is supported.  That is what policies and procedures should do.  They should not be there to conflict with what the practitioner wants to do with the family.  They should be there to support it.  That is a core stream of work within our strategy to help practitioners to be compliant when it fits within the practice they want to do.</p></speech>

There are always bottom lines that we hold in how we keep children safe.  Best practice in child protection is about engaging children and families in participative thinking.  At the end of the day, families have to think through their difficulties and we have to support them in that if children are going to live safely with them.  We will always maintain a rigorous focus on child safety.  The Signs of Safety programme is not a panacea that no child will ever come into care.  It is a way of working effectively with families to keep children safe but always recognising some children will have to come into care to be safe.</p></speech>

To reassure the Deputy, Signs of Safety is a strengths-based approach in working with families.  It is clear, however, that there is a rigorous look at the risk within a family to a high level of detail and how can we keep children safe.  That is hearing from the child, the parents and extended family.  It is broadening that network out to examine how we can keep the child safe.  It is extremely rigorous in its approach.</p></speech>

I will finish my question.  Does that mean all senior staff are involved in ensuring there is absolute capture?  Yesterday's <i>Irish Examiner</i>states:</p><blockquote>Tusla failed to address 65 abuse cases despite concerns children were still at &ldquo;potential risk&rdquo;;<br /><br />Tusla closed 164 suspected child sexual abuse cases despite not knowing if the matters were resolved.</blockquote><p>How can anyone watching these proceedings be reassured when Mr. McBride is telling us that Tusla does not have enough staff, that there is a massive rate of attrition and that there is only a small cohort of senior staff which is not increasing to any great extent?  How can the witnesses assure us that when cases are presented at the so-called front door of Tusla they will be filtered, assessed for risk and managed properly?  Tusla got an additional &euro;40 million last year and its overall resources for 2018 amount to approximately &euro;753 million.  The organisation is in receipt of three quarters of a billion in taxpayers' money, yet HIQA reports are showing utterly disgraceful failures on the part of Tusla.  Are the witnesses not ashamed of the fact that this situation pertains?  I direct that last question to Mr. McBride, as head of the organisation.</p></speech>

We are getting 53,000 referrals, as I said earlier.  The vast majority of them are screened.  Someone looks at them and we make a decision on the basis of the information we have been given as to whether the referral requires an immediate response.  As HIQA has acknowledged and we have said already, if it requires an immediate response, it gets one.  The rest of the referrals work is about trying to prioritise what we need to do, how soon we need to do it and to what level.  As Dr. Gillen said, we are building up the family support side of our service so that if a referral is made to us that does not require a social work or child protection response, but where families still need support, it can be diverted to a less formal type of intervention.  As Mr. Gibson said, almost 30,000 children in families received some sort of family support service as an alternative to going down the child protection or statutory social work intervention route.  At the point of screening, we are saying that all referrals are looked at and a determination is made as to what level of response is required.</p></speech>

I previously provided a breakdown.  We have analysed the key themes in those cases and accept that there were shortcomings and delays.  We have been very open and transparent in acknowledging that there have been delays.  There have also been issues with regard to a lack of standardisation.  It should be noted that in some of those cases, legal injunctions had been brought whereby we approached a person who was subject to an abuse allegation who then brought an application to the court questioning whether we had the power to proceed to interview them on the allegation.  I am very conscious of the fact that I cannot talk about any individual case out of the 65 without running the risk of identifying people.  That said, to provide reassurance to the committee, some of the questions posed by HIQA were around process issues as opposed to any actual harm being caused to a child by either action or inaction on the part of Tusla.  In one case, for example, a child was on our child protection notification system.  These are children-----</p></speech>

Our childcare information system, NCCIS, should very clearly show that a case has been closed off.  It must be borne in mind that we were coming from a position of having paper based systems and two separate ICT systems and there was a lack of standardisation.  Today, however, 15 out of the 17 areas within Tusla are now live on our childcare information system and by 8 July, the entire agency will be live on NCCIS.  The system is set up in such a way that every action performed by a social worker is signed off by either a team leader or a principal social worker.  In terms of that piece, of the 164 cases, the issue was that it was not clearly visible from the system that they had been closed off.</p></speech>

I had to go to the D&aacute;il Chamber earlier so if this has already been answered, I apologise.  How do the witnesses explain the fact that supervisors do not have the appropriate training in managing child sexual abuse cases, including retrospective allegations?  Were the witnesses aware of this and, if so, how can they stand over it?  I also remind the witnesses that I want an answer to the question I posed on quarter 4.  My final question is on CARI, an organisation with which Tusla interacts.  I have relatives living in the Munster area who are waiting for an appointment with CARI for their child.  The child is in a state of turmoil but I will not go into the details here.  Why have I not been able to get an answer as to the reason that child is still awaiting an appointment?</p></speech>

When Tusla was established, specific psychological posts that were to come over to the new organisation were not transferred.  A memorandum of understanding was put in place under which psychology would stay within the Health Service Executive and provide services to Tusla.  We all knew at the time that psychologists within the HSE were overburdened with referrals-----</p></speech>

I assure the Deputy that where a child needs a therapeutic intervention, we have spent that money.  I can show the committee the evidence of that.

When one encounters a group of social workers, one is absolutely taken by the youth in the room.  Since it is important that we be very sharp in our diagnostics when we get referrals, we have loaded senior practitioner posts at the front door.  Also part of this is the signs of safety framework, the objective being to have a very good assessment framework at the front door.  It is a question of determining whether a case is a welfare case that could be managed in the community or a case that requires a response at a much higher level.  We have very experienced people right across the system.</p></speech>

I am not sure whether I answered when Deputy Sherlock was absent but we have certainly said that we - on the move, so to speak - have to train people, particularly those dealing with retrospective allegations of abuse.  It is not an area in which we were traditionally involved as social work professionals.  We have had to expose people to the information and give them the experience, training and skills.  We are now moving to dedicated teams to deal with the issue.  I hope that answers the question.</p> <p>  With regard to Q4, the sum is &euro;5,000 per month.  We have been using the company.  We went through a tendering process and the company was successful.  We are using it to assist with the development of an internal and external communications strategy in general, covering all our communications.  Of course, events such as this and that of yesterday are a part.</p></speech>

We are scheduled to conclude in three minutes so I propose to focus on just one area, namely, certain findings in the report that I am not sure have been covered extensively.  The report refers to children not being assessed after allegations.  Mr. McBride's organisation has identified that they are at risk.  The report refers to assessment in a timely and effective manner.  Reference is made to inconsistencies in safety planning across the State, specifically in respect of allegations of child sex abuse.</p></speech>

If one intervenes too quickly, there is a danger that the child or adult making the disclosure will shut down, as we have seen quite a lot.  When this occurs, one is not able to take the matter any further.  Ms Finlay has given some indication of some of the reasons we cannot progress things, one being that the disclosure is insufficiently detailed.  Alternatively, because of the space we have been put in by case law, we cannot compel the person against whom the allegation is being made to come forward and give any response to it.  Sometimes, therefore, the inquiries run into the sand.  Those are some of the reasons.</p> <p>  It is absolutely true that there are inconsistencies in safety planning.  That is absolutely why we are now developing a national approach to practice to address that particular issue.  Members have heard about the signs of safety initiative.  Some 1,200 out of approximately 1,500 social workers are already trained in that methodology.  We are confident that will lead to much greater consistency and quality of intervention when we intervene.</p></speech>

If the child does, he or she is listed on what is called a child protection notification system, which is a register of children at risk that is available to the Garda and emergency services in the event that the child presents at those services.  There are over 1,200 children on the child protection notification system.  All of those children are allocated and all of them have a child protection safety plan.  Those plans are reviewed regularly &ndash; every six months, at a minimum.</p></speech>

However, as the organisation with statutory responsibility to regulate, promote, encourage and foster the maintenance of high standards and good practice in the delivery of mental health services, we are disappointed that it has taken so long for this opportunity to meet with the committee.</p> <p>  The principal function of the commission is to promote, encourage and foster the establishment and maintenance of high standards and good practices in the delivery of mental health services and to take all reasonable steps to protect the interests of persons detained in approved centres under the Act.</p> <p>  Recently, the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 provided for the establishment of the decision support service, DSS, within the commission as part of a new legal framework that reforms the law relating to the treatment of people who require or who may shortly require assistance in exercising their decision- making capacity, therefore, it expands the functions of the commission beyond mental health.  The DSS forms a key part of the new legal framework for both the provision of information and the regulation of the diverse forms of assisted decision making arrangements.</p> <p>  In the past couple of years, the commission has continued to emphasise the human rights of mental health service users across all of its core functions.  All service users should be involved in decisions about their care and be supported to exercise their legal capacity.  Mental health service users should not be subjected to undue restrictions and should have access to basic general health services.  Residents should have access to adequate living standards in inpatient settings where their privacy and dignity is respected at all times.  These basic rights should be assumed in any modern mental health service and is a minimum we would expect for ourselves, our family and our loved ones.  Furthermore, people who use mental health services need to be afforded the same rights as those who use general health services.  </p> <p>  The commission registers, inspects and regulates mental health services delivered through approved centres.  Over many years of activity, a number of core issues have emerged.  These include the inappropriate admission of children into adult mental health inpatient services; inadequate staffing and variable funding in community child and adolescent mental health services, leading to unacceptable waiting times and forcing young people into emergency services; the continuing inability of some services to put in place an individualised care plan and therapeutic programme, which are the corner stones of a recovery focused, person centred service as per our national policy; the widespread use of restrictive practices such as seclusion and physical restraint as a normalised behaviour in services, which lack sufficient numbers of staff and-or appropriately trained staff; the fundamental and careless lack of attention to basic issues such as dirty and dilapidated premises, which do not ensure adequate privacy and where there has been a disappointing drop in compliance from already low levels; and the provision of services to vulnerable people with long-term mental illness who are accommodated in 24-hour community residences that are not subject to regulatory oversight.</p> <p>  In the view of the commission there is a glaring and inconsistent pattern of standards in service provision.  The lack of any real progress and commitment on these matters undermines the fundamental human rights of those people who use mental healthcare services.</p> <p>  Due to a failure of Government to update the statutory powers of the commission, more people are now using unregulated mental healthcare services, that is, services outside the approved centres, which leads to a significant risk of neglect and abusive incidents occurring.</p> <p>  The commission is calling on the Government, with the Health Service Executive as the statutory provider of services, to initiate a major transformation programme to deal with the service issues highlighted by the commission.</p> <p>  Reform of the 2001 Mental Health Act is urgently needed and the commission urges the Department of Health to take heed of our commentary in this area to ensure that the provision and regulation of a modern mental health service in Ireland is the norm.  If that does not happen, Ireland will continue to provide a level of unsafe and substandard services which are not aligned to best practice and, as stated, breach the fundamental rights of vulnerable people who require such services.</p> <p>  The commission notes the continued endeavours of the Government, the statutory and independent service providers and the voluntary sector in the implementation of A Vision for Change.  The commission has repeatedly indicated that much needs to be done to ensure the delivery of consistent, timely and high-quality services in all geographic regions and across the full range of clinical programmes and age groups.</p><p>The Commission is aware of a review group established to consider progress in the implementation of <i>A Vision for Change</i>.  However, the Mental Health Commission has not received any formal communication from the Department of Health in this matter.  This is a grave cause of concern, given the statutory role of the Mental Health Commission in overseeing quality in mental health care services.<br/><br/>The Commission welcomes the almost annual &euro;35 million budget allocation for spending on additional mental health care services.  The Commission is cognisant that the current level of expenditure on mental health as a proportion of overall health expenditure is still less than the 8.24% target envisaged in <i>A Vision for Change</i>.<br/><br/>The Commission is also conscious of the continued difficulties in maintaining and increasing staffing levels in mental health care services.  From its inspections, it is aware that this has a significant effect on the quality and quantity of services that can be provided.  Given the labour-intensive nature of mental health care, it is imperative that this matter is addressed urgently to achieve full staffing across the mental health care services.<br/><br/>Since its establishment, the Commission has seen significant changes in the provision of services, but challenges remain in the delivery of high quality recovery-oriented services.  Although the Commission believes that staff understand the concept of recovery, it is not evident that this translates into recovery-focused care, particularly in the development of individual care plans.  It is concerning that while compliance has increased, just a small minority of approved centres had individual care plans that were recovery-oriented, with strong service user involvement and multi-disciplinary inputs.<br/><br/>The Commission is of the view that there needs to be an emphasis on changing the corporate culture in the mental health services to bring about the required systematic shift towards recovery in service provision.  In this regard, it will continue to focus on the need for individualised, recovery-oriented services that place service users and families at the centre of activity.<br/><br/>In respect of involuntary admissions, there were 2,337 involuntary admissions in 2017 compared to 2,414 in 2016, representing a slight decrease.  We are pleased to note that over many years there has been a decline in the number of families involved in referring people to involuntary detention, and this is welcome.  Their involvement still stands at 44% and we hope that in the future this figure will be driven down further.<br/><br/>In respect of community residences, the Commission continues to have concerns about 24-hour staffed community residences, which are providing care to a large cohort of vulnerable people with long-term mental illness.  The residences have been found to be accommodating too many people, to have poor physical infrastructure, to be institutional in nature and to lack individual care plans.  A major issue is that the residences are not regulated.  Although the Mental Health Act permits the inspector to visit and inspect &quot;any other premises where mental health services are being provided&quot;, community residences are not subject to regulation by the Commission.<br/><br/>We are currently undertaking a three-year programme and the inspection of 43 residences in 2017 has already been published.  Once again, this report highlighted glaring issues around the size of the residences, the limitation of staffing, the absence of privacy and space, the poor repair of buildings and the degree of institutional care provided in these homes.<br/><br/>Many of those living in 24-hour residences are ex-patients of the large institutions closed over the past 20 years.  This is a vulnerable population, and the emerging patterns from the inspections is that they are a forgotten group of people who are living their lives in unsatisfactory conditions.<br/><br/>It is recommended in the Report of the Expert Group on the Review of the Mental Health Act 2001 that community services should be registered and inspected.  The Commission is of the view that the regulation of 24-hour staffed community residences must be prioritised as a matter of urgency.<br/><br/>A most unsatisfactory situation still prevails, whereby children are being admitted to adult inpatient units.  There were 82 such admissions to 19 units in 2017 compared to 68 in 2016.  The admission of any child to an adult service is unsatisfactory.  A contributory factor to the continued admission of children to adult units is a shortage of operational beds in dedicated child units.  A significant influence is the inability of child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, units to admit children after hours thereby forcing admissions to adult care services.  This trend has been prevalent for many years and is not only an unsatisfactory situation for the child and his or her family but a clear breach of the human rights and dignity of the child.  This matter has been a concern to the Commission for many years.  It needs to be urgently addressed by the Government, the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive, as the main provider.<br/><br/>In 2017, the Commission has also highlighted serious concerns in community child and adolescent mental health teams.  The inspector found these teams to be inadequately staffed and to have considerable variation in funding depending on their geographic region.  There was also a notable variation in waiting lists for CAMHS referrals and in the provision of emergency cover.  While CAMHS should be focused on children and young adults with severe mental illness, the staffing deficits in primary care have meant that children and young adults with mild and moderate mental illness are also reliant on CAMHS services.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the Commission is concerned that there are serious human rights issues to be addressed in relation to the admission of children to adult services and the shortage of operational beds for young service users.  Additionally, the Commission is concerned about the long waiting times for those children referred to child and adolescent mental health services.  It is particularly concerned about the 1,300 vulnerable people with long-term mental illness who are accommodated in 24-hour community residences that are not subject to regulatory oversight.<br/><br/>Fundamentals in in-patient settings, such as individual care plans, privacy, the provision of therapeutic activities and staff training are also areas that require urgent attention.  There continues to be fundamental shortfalls in compliance with basic hygiene, physical repair and space restrictions within many services.<br/><br/>The 2017 inspections have once again highlighted the inappropriate use of seclusion and physical restraint in services which have become in many instances the normalised environment.<br/><br/>As the committee will be aware, there continues to be a chronic shortage of staff and appropriately trained staff.  Notwithstanding this, the Commission is acutely aware that the front-line staff presently operating services are highly motivated and working under extreme pressure to meet the demands made on the service.<br/><br/>The Commission is aware of other issues of access to approved centres which warrant attention.  These include, for example, policies of having to access mental health care services via accident and emergency units, which do not always have appropriately trained mental health staff, and difficulties in gaining admission to approved centres, as well as perceived early discharges.<br/><br/>Much work remains to be done to change service culture and to refocus on the full delivery of <i>A Vision for Change</i>.  Services must be accessible, comprehensive, responsive and timely.  Now more than ever, it is necessary to address systemic issues that hamper the delivery of services and the development of new, more appropriate, services.<br/><br/>Reform of the Mental Health Act 2001 is now a matter of urgency as a significant number of people are now using unregulated mental health care services, both day and residential.  This situation dramatically increases the risk of abusive or neglectful incidents occurring.<br/><br/>The Commission is concerned that over the past five years there has been a consistent pattern in the operation of mental health services.  Year-on-year similar issues such as individual care plans, the admission of children into adult units as well as issues of compliance with regulations, and privacy and medication issues, continue to be highlighted in inspection reports.  This continuing trend is worrying and indicates for the Commission a lack of interest and motivation by both Government and services providers to make meaningful change.  The Commission is strongly of the view that there is apparently little heed given to the commentary of the Commission by the Department of Health or Health Service Executive.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, the Commission will continue to work in supporting the rights of individuals and families who use mental health services and to seek to ensure that the service providers provide the highest quality of service provision in line with best practice, and to which they are entitled as a basic human right.</p></speech>

The committee has had a lot of communication with Ms Patricia Gilheaney.  We did not invite the commission to meet us until now because we thought it was important to meet service providers and users first.  We have read all of the mental health reports thoroughly.  As I said, we did not see a need until now to meet the commission.  </p><p> I invite Dr. Muldoon to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-20a.241" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Niall Muldoon" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018062000002#D00200"><p>I thank the joint committee for the invitation to present to it on a report prepared by my office entitled, Take My Hand: Young People&rsquo;s Experiences of Mental Health Services.  As the committee will be aware, the Office of the Ombudsman for Children is an independent human rights institution which was established under the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002.  My office has a unique combination of statutory functions.  We examine and investigate complaints made by or on behalf of children about the administrative actions, or inactions, of public bodies and promote the rights and welfare of children up to the age of 18 years.<br/><br/>One of the priorities of our strategic plan for the period 2016 to 2018 is to influence positive change for children with mental health difficulties.  In the light of this priority, we decided in 2017 to undertake a consultation process with young people under 18 years receiving inpatient care and treatment for their mental health difficulties.  The aim of the consultation was to facilitate young people in reflecting and sharing their views on mental health services based on their experiences from primary care through to inpatient services.  I thank the 25 young people, aged between 14 and 17 years, who took part in the consultation process.  We engaged with all six adolescent inpatient units in the country.  I thank the management and staff of the five units who facilitated our work with the young people involved, including Linn Dara CAMHS inpatient unit, Dublin; Willow Grove adolescent unit, Dublin; Ginesa suite, Saint John of God Hospital, Dublin; CAMHS inpatient unit, Merlin Park Hospital, Galway; and &Eacute;ist Linn CAMHS inpatient unit, Cork.  I also thank Ms Lorna Walsh, a member of my staff, for her involvement.  The young people involved were asked to consider three broad questions about their experiences of mental health services, namely, what they found helpful; what they found challenging and what changes they would like to see made.  <br/><br/>Different methods were used by the young people concerned to express their views, namely, semi-structured interviews, painting, photography, collage and mind maps.  Some of the images created by them can be viewed in the full report.  On what they found helpful, many of them were positive about the support they received from professionals, family members and other young people in receipt of mental health services.  According to them, professionals who engage and build trusting relationships with them have an important role to play in shaping their experiences of mental health services.  They highlighted that medical professionals who used empathetic approaches and could relate to and communicate well with them and their families contributed to their feeling heard and understood.  The knowledge and experience of teachers and school counsellors, as well as the arrangements put in place by schools to help them to cope, were commended by many of them.  They spoke positively about the efforts family members made to help them, including by travelling long distances to visit inpatient units.  Within the inpatient units, having a support group of peers who had experience and an understanding of the challenges in living with a mental health illness was identified as a valuable source of support.  The benefit of programmes and activities such as music appreciation art, physical activity and life skills groups, was also noted by the young people concerned. <br/><br/>Despite these positives, the young people concerned highlighted a range of challenges that they had experienced, both as mental health services users and more generally.  Many questioned the interpersonal and communication skills of the medical professionals with whom they had engaged.  For example, the use of clinical language caused confusion for some young people and left them feeling they were not believed or understood.  Some professionals were seen to be lacking in empathy and sensitivity, particularly when they made suggestions to &quot;keep trying&quot; and &quot;keep working on it&quot;, even when the young people indicated that they felt &quot;it wasn&rsquo;t working.&quot;The lack of opportunities to be heard was also raised as a significant challenge, both within the inpatient units and in wider services.  It was noted that professionals often communicated directly with the parent or parents as opposed to the young people.<br/><br/>Several of the young people concerned spoke about and questioned what they regarded as a rush to medicate, with the use of medication being suggested very early on in their treatment.  A small number said they had sometimes been physically restrained.  They found this challenging and frustrating and felt it should not be done.  They also commented on the restrictions placed on them within inpatient units owing to low staffing levels and feeling institutionalised, with the main problem being a the lack of things to do.  <br/><br/>Separation from family was a particularly significant challenge frequently mentioned by the young people concerned.  Many spoke about the burden their mental health care had placed on their family and mentioned that it weighed heavily on them and was challenging in coming to terms with it.  <br/><br/>With regard to school, some of the young people concerned felt their teachers and school counsellors lacked specialist knowledge of mental health and explained that their expectations of the supports available had not been met.  They had also missed school owing to their mental health illness.  As a result, their relationships with their friends had also been affected. <br/><br/>Many of the young people concerned spoke about the length of time it took to access CAMHS and the stark differences in the availability and consistency of the service throughout the country.  They described these delays and inconsistencies as being very difficult.  They also referenced the distance between the inpatient units and their homes, with one young person living an estimated six and a half hour drive from the unit.  Another young person spoke about how the lack of adolescent inpatient places had previously resulted in him being placed in an adult psychiatric ward, an experience he described as traumatic.  <br/><br/>The young people who took part in the consultation process recommended changes which they felt would improve mental health services and supports for young people in general.  These recommendations can be found in section 2.3 of the report and include the following: increased supports and awareness raising initiatives in schools, including the availability of additional therapists or guidance counsellors; increased staffing levels in services, including community CAMHS services; the establishment of a youth advisory panel in each inpatient unit to ensure young people would be heard and have their views considered; greater autonomy being afforded to young people in inpatient units to self-regulate and manage their behaviour; and the availability of additional programmes and a less restrictive environment within inpatient units.<br/><br/>Following the consultation process and in the light of the complaints and investigations and policy work of my office, we have identified a number of key areas of concern and corresponding priorities for action.  These are dealt with in detail in the report and include effective co-ordination and communication between those working in the area of children's mental health, as well as on a cross-sectoral basis, are central to delivering mental health services and supports that work for children.  I welcome the recognition in the report of the national youth mental health task force<i></i>that deficiencies in this area need to be addressed.  The delay in making the youth mental health pathfinder project operational is unacceptable, given the commitment of the Government to it.  The project will provide the vital structure to achieve greater co-ordination in the provision of mental health services for children and young people.  It needs to be put in place urgently.  Also, an independent mental health advocacy and information service specifically for children should be established without delay, as recommended by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child and the national youth mental health task force.  <br/><br/>I have serious concerns about the legislative framework for children&rsquo;s mental health services and the slow pace of reform in this area.  I welcome the passage of the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2017 and its focus on inserting rights-based, guiding principles for children into the Mental Health Act 2001.  While these legislative proposals are an important step forward, the Government&rsquo;s commitment to comprehensively revise the 2001 Act as a whole must be progressed without further delay.  To address deficits in policy implementation and provide a single point of focus for everyone who has a role to play in advancing provision for children&rsquo;s mental health, I am calling for the development of a dedicated A Vision for Change for children to provide a dedicated, cross-sectoral national policy framework for children&rsquo;s mental health services.  The framework should set out what clearly the actions that will be taken and by whom, timelines for delivery and associated costs. <br/><br/>On financial and human resources, once allocated, resources should be ring-fenced.  The lack of clear and accessible information on the amount of money being spent on mental health services for children also needs to be addressed.  On human resources, consideration should be given to the appointment of experienced professionals, other than consultant psychiatrists, to roles such as clinical leads, with a view to ensuring children and young people will not be left waiting for the support they need owing to unfilled posts.  I call for all primary and post-primary schools to have access to an independent therapist-counsellor to ensure early intervention will be available to all children when they need it.<br/><br/>I again thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to present my report which I hope will assist it in its work.  I will be happy to answer questions members may have.  The views and experiences of the young people expressed in the report must be brought centre stage and considered meaningfully by all State and non-State actors with responsibilities to develop and implement proposals for reform in this area.</p></speech>

I am a trained primary school teacher, but I retired last September.  I am married and we have four beautiful and much loved children, ranging in age from 20 years to ten.</p> <p>  I knew nothing or very little about children's mental health issues until our own children were involved.  When I started teaching in 1990, there was little mention of children's mental health and I certainly never received any training in it.  My husband and I were unprepared when our oldest child displayed signs of depression and other issues.  Our oldest child first displayed low mood in second year at second level.  We thought it was adolescence or the onset of puberty, but we were so wrong.  After hearing him verbalise suicide ideation numerous times, we sought medical help.  As the case was urgent, CAMHS saw him two days later.  Of course, we were upset.  We did not know how to help him and looked to CAMHS for support and medical help for our son.  Over time, his diagnosis evolved and worsened.  We saw every member of the CAMHS team in their various roles.  He was assessed by all of them.  My professional training informed me that there may have been more to his diagnosis than the initial diagnosis.  Unfortunately. I was correct.  Over the next five and a half years his diagnosis worsened significantly.  As a result of all of his issues, he manifested the most awful behaviour.  I have never seen ADHD manifest like this.  At one stage we were paying &euro;150 a month for his medication and then I found out that every other county was allowing the cost of his ADHD medication under the long-term illness scheme but the area medical officer, AMO, in Wexford would not allow it.  I appealed this decision and it was upheld.  This is only a small thing, but many children benefited overnight.</p> <p>  At times I had to advocate to management for continuity of care and more appointments; however, my letters often went unanswered for many months, if they were answered at all.  As the assessments were concluded, we got a better picture of his diagnosis.  Dr. Kieran Moore, the clinical lead, left no stone unturned for our son.  We had many difficult days; often there would be multiple appointments in a week and we only missed two in the whole five years.  Our son was also an inpatient in a Dublin hospital unit for ten weeks.  That was a horrible experience and a horrible Christmas, one I want to forget.  He returned home for care to the CAMHS team.  The social worker, the clinical nurse manager and the consultant in CAMHS south Wexford are beyond professional.  They did everything they could for our son who was seen by Dr. Kieran Moore very often.  Sometimes the appointments were very difficult, but he did everything he could, including sourcing an external specialist from the United Kingdom.</p> <p>  My personal opinion of the service is that the CAMHS team in Wexford is only a skeletal team.  They offer a service that is barely addressing the huge issue of children's mental health.  The professionals I have mentioned are highly qualified, very experienced and kind to both patients and their families, which makes a great deal of difference when one is so vulnerable, but, alas, other staff are part-time and can only offer appointments on a part-time basis.  To say the least, the appointments they offer are patchy.  At one stage, three staff were on maternity leave, none of whom was replaced.  The consultant was on leave numerous times but no locum was ever provided.  I queried this as it affected my child but to no avail.</p> <p>  The premises are totally inadequate.  There are not enough consultation rooms and no therapies are offered.  Our son was only offered two sessions of psychology in five and a half years.  They did get a recent extension of a tiny portacabin, which is totally inappropriate.  Knowing what I do now, depression and other mental health issues need more than tablets.  There are many therapies that could be made available that work well with children and teenagers, but, alas, the children of County Wexford cannot get them.  First, there are no staff to offer the therapies and, second, there is no accommodation available in the CAMHS premises.</p> <p>  My own experience of advocating for our child taught me many lessons.  We were told that our son was the only pupil in his secondary school to have depression.  That seems incredible in a school of 700 boys.  The same deputy principal has since contacted me numerous times looking for information for other parents who are struggling, just as we did.  If one does not advocate for one's child and speak up, or if you cannot speak up, you will not get the care you need.  Depression is viewed as a disease.  Even a child is considered to be faulty or a lesser person and this was said to us in a primary and a secondary school.  There is huge stigma and shame around children with a mental health issue.  CAMHS never blames parents but society and schools do.  The gossip at pitches, on the sideline and within a small parish can be very hard to take.  Many times we felt alone and had no idea what to do.  We needed more than tablets.  We needed therapy for our son and therapy for our family, but, alas, none was offered or available.</p> <p>  Eventually, on the school's insistence - the school was correct to do so - our child sourced counselling in it.  No counselling was available in CAMHS.  Our other child needed help from CAMHS after a mental health emergency.  Alas, even after promising her help, our child was not seen for six weeks.  They did not respond in a timely or an appropriate fashion.  That made her issues much worse and compounded and exacerbated a fundamental issue of body image and the impact of having a sibling with serious mental issues.  The response of the person was that it was not possible to split in two.  That is not fair.</p> <p>  Our overall opinion of the CAMHS service is that it is starved of resources.  It is segregated from the general hospital, when it should be incorporated into it.  Do we accept segregation of mental health patients away from the population?  When will we learn that the mental health service deserves to be included in the hospital service, not separate from it?  In my opinion, this echoes the discrimination we have seen in the past when children and older people were excluded from society and hidden in mental institutions.  </p> <p>  The service is chronically understaffed.  The staff who are there are of the highest calibre and so professional.  They are kind to children and supportive of parents who are often under enormous strain.  They are under incredible pressure.  The waiting list is now four years long.  Our youngest child is on it.  He cannot fulfil his potential, either academically or otherwise, until he is assessed.  Meanwhile we wait.  He waits and many like him wait.  Other children with critical and complicated issues also wait.  Sometimes they are suicidal and wait; sometimes they need referrals and wait again.  We were referred to three hospitals over the period of five years.  Our son had to have multiple medical tests done elsewhere because CAMHS has nobody to take bloods or do an ECG.  The service in Wexford has no consultant.  His shoes are impossible to fill.  The HSE in its statement stated they were actively recruiting psychiatrists abroad.  That is not good enough.  They just do not understand.  They need to resource the service, employ professionals who are needed, put the CAMHS service into a hospital and offer a service that treats children holistically.  Why would the HSE employ another consultant with no changes to working conditions?  They are not listening.</p> <p>  I have written letters to management and politicians for years, all to the no avail.  This level of service would not be tolerated in the provision of cancer treatment, or any other branch of medicine.  Even the list for cardiac assessment in Crumlin was only 18 months long, the last time I checked.  Would you bring a child with cancer to a unit without an oncologist and just hope for the best?  No, you absolutely would not.  Why should the parents of children from Wexford, north and south, and Waterford have a service with no consultant?  That is an insult to our children and to our intelligence.  There is also a very strong case of inequality and discrimination.  Children are not receiving the care they need based on their address.  It is clear that the political agenda seems to be to open the horrible historical chapters of our past.  Is this done on purpose to divert attention away from the current waiting lists for children?  In County Wexford a person who is in dire need is four years on a list.</p><p>Will we have to wait 40 years to address the current crisis?  I hope not.  The Proclamation of 1916 urged us to treat all the children of Ireland equally.  If I live in Wexford, I wait four years.  If I live in Dublin or Galway, it seems I get a luxury of service.  Both of our oldest children have written of their experiences.  Our son does not mind his name being mentioned as he is in Barcelona but our second child very much minds her name being mentioned.  I will not mention her name but will tell the committee about what happened.  At the end of the day, society should protect the most vulnerable.  Our children are so precious and when they are sick we bring them to the doctor.  Now there is no doctor in a critical service.  It is time to say "enough" and to stop and listen.  Children matter and children's health matters.  If a society is judged on how it cares for its youngest and most vulnerable citizens, then Ireland fails.  I would like everybody here to understand the critical situation in Wexford.  I am passionate about this because I know what can happen, not only to the patient but also to the siblings, family and parents.  We as adults need to be the voice of those children.  We need to change the system, which will not be easy but can be done.</p></speech>

It takes a lot to waive one's anonymity and we genuinely appreciate that Ms Brennan has done so and is prioritising her children.  I concur completely with the Chair's comments. </p> <p>  My first question is to the witnesses from the Mental Health Commission and concerns the key functions of the commission.  What is the witnesses' view of how the commission has delivered on those functions since its establishment in 2002?  Should the commission acquire any other functions?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-20a.252" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Saunders" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018062000002#F00800"><p>When the commission was established and as the Act dictated, it was given the powers to inspect approved centres.  These are residential units that are mostly attached to general hospitals now, where people reside for a period when they are acutely unwell.  Those units have replaced the previous large institutions that we all know about.  For the first number of years, the commission also inspected those services but they have been closed down since.  The Act is very clear that the commission, through its inspectorate, can inspect the approved centres and can put into place changes to improve the quality of service in them.  They are commonly called conditions and there are various other steps beyond them.  The commission has been doing that since it initiated its inspection process in the early 2000s.</p> <p>  The issue to which I alluded briefly is that since that time, and quite rightly, more and more people are receiving mental healthcare services outside of approved centres.  They are going to primary care - to their GP - or to community mental health teams, staffed teams that provide support to people in their local community.  I mentioned the community residences, where people live in group homes in the community.  As time goes on and in line with A Vision for Change, fewer people statistically and theoretically would use the approved centres while more and more people would receive mental healthcare services outside of them.</p> <p>  The Act allows us to inspect any place where mental health services are provided.  However, it does not allow us to regulate or impose changes on those places.  We can inspect any community mental health team in the country and if we find issues that need to be changed we can make recommendations.  However, we cannot enforce them because the Act, which is now quite old, does not allow us to do so.  That is one of the issues around the review of the Mental Health Act.  Provisions are needed to allow the commission to regulate all services.  In my statement, I said that the vast majority of those now using mental health services are using services that are not regulated in the context of what the commission does.  Time and progress have overtaken the original Act.</p></speech>

The Act is 18 years old.  There was a major undertaking by government with all interested parties to review the Act in 2013 and 2014.  That resulted in a review report which makes 160 recommendations.  Everybody who contributed to it realised that the recommendations would bring the Act into the 21st century.  Among them is the change to enforcement but there are also other issues around children's services and how they are managed.  There is a whole range of recommendations that need to be put in place to bring about a more regulated mental healthcare service.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked if that is the way to do it.  We have decided in this country to have a statute which regulates mental healthcare services.  In my opinion, if we are to have a Statute, it needs to be fit for purpose and responsive to modern day services rather than being outdated in relative terms.</p></speech>

To be fair to the mental healthcare services, where a need is pointed out and where it is possible for them to do so, they will make changes and improvements.  The problem, as I suggested, is that the changes and improvements are often beyond the scope of a local service.  There may be resource or policy issues that are national.</p> <p>  The mental healthcare services are unique in the sense that a mental health division was created in 2013.  This was a highly visible structure through which the commission or anybody else could communicate on a national or corporate level with the mental healthcare services at what is called national director level, which is a very high level.  That was quite effective for trying to push change within the system.  However, that system has collapsed and there is no longer a mental health division because it was dismantled within the HSE structure at the end of last year.  As we speak, we are not very clear about the overall corporate responsibility of mental health in the context of all the healthcare programmes that are in place.  It is a constantly changing situation.</p></speech>

I again refer to my commentary on this.  I was very careful in what I said.  There is a sense that we constantly state the facts and realities as we see them.  There is a sense that people listen but also a sense that there is no immediate or long-term response to those issues, not always but sometimes.  This is borne out for us by the fact that the same headlines come up year after year.  The number of children admitted to adult units has been constant for the past five or six years.</p><p>The numbers who do not have individualised programme plans are increasing year on year.  The issues around seclusion are also difficult but none of these issues is new.  They did not just arise this year or last year but have been coming up year after year.  We are highlighting these issues but nothing is happening in terms of making a significant shift.</p></speech>

As far as I am concerned that amounts to the bean counters saying that children do not deserve this project.  It has been signalled within the Civil Service for the past two years that this would be a flagship project for mental health services.  The pathfinder project aims to bring mental health services together, with increased collaboration, over a three-year period.  We should be making it happen as opposed to delaying it for financial reasons.  The committee has already heard about some of the consequences of missed steps when organisations and partners do not work together.  We need to push forward with that as soon as possible.</p></speech>

Would Healthy Ireland fit in there in terms of the overarching policy?  I do not remember people having mental health issues when I was a child but maybe they did and it was just not recognised.  How can we empower young people and their families to help them to manage?  Could Healthy Ireland fit in there?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-20a.271" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Niall Muldoon" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018062000002#G01100"><p>Absolutely, a whole range of good policies are outlined under Better Outcomes Brighter Futures and Healthy Ireland, which aim to improve the lives of children from a very early age.  These policies deal with how to make children physically competent, resilient and emotionally aware, all of which is very positive.  Parents today are also much more emotionally aware and those in the 25 to 30 years age bracket know how to help their children in that regard.  However, we still need to provide services when something goes wrong.  That is why I am suggesting that therapists or counsellors should be available at primary care level.  A report is being launched at St. Patrick's hospital today which finds that some four year olds are displaying signs of anxiety but we can cut out some of the problems at source with very simple stuff.  The aforementioned report is very clear that many of the issues for children are related to marriage breakdown, difficult family relationships, blended families and so on.  These are normal aspects of life now but if children do not sort them out in their heads when they are four or five years old, by the time they are 14 or 15 years old, they can have a real impact.  If we can provide a six-month window of opportunity, we can prevent many problems.  We have a lot of the right policies and thinking but we need the resources to match.</p></speech>

The Mental Health Commission was established in 2002.  Mr. Saunders outlined the principal functions of the commission in terms of ensuring high standards, good practice and so on.  Under legislation, the commission "shall have such powers as are necessary" for the purposes of its functions.  Given that in 2016, we had 68 instances of children being admitted to adult facilities, rising to 82 in 2017, is anybody listening to the commission?  To use HIQA as a comparator, it seems to have the ability to bring about change but it appears the Mental Health Commission does not, to be blunt about it.  This committee is trying to draw up a blueprint for the future so that we can improve matters.  What is missing here?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-20a.274" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Saunders" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018062000002#G01400"><p>The Deputy is correct in saying that there were 68 admissions of children to adult units in 2017.  To put that in context, in 2012 there were 107 such admissions, in 2013 there were 98, in 2014 there were 92, in 2015 there were 96 and there were 68 such admissions in 2016.  There has, therefore, been a shift.  One of the roles performed by the commission is to carry out inspections.  It sees what it sees, makes very clear statements as to whether what it sees is appropriate and makes recommendations for change.  There is a dialogue with the service provider around that and, as I said earlier, in many cases small changes occur as a result of that dialogue.  However, if that dialogue is not sufficient to bring about changes, the commission can impose conditions and timelines within which such conditions must be met.  Compliance is monitored by the commission through the inspectorate.  Inspections would take place on a monthly or three-monthly basis to ensure that the required changes take place.  Again, if one looks through the thousands of pages of our reports, one will see changes brought about by that process.</p> <p>  We have the power to impose much more severe restrictions such as closure.  However, one of the issues in mental healthcare, as everyone knows, is that the vast majority of services are provided by the statutory provider, that is, the HSE.  If one of those services is closed, one is faced with the problem of where the people using that service will go and who will provide an alternative service to them.  In many cases, there is no plan B because the statutory system is providing the services.  We need to be very careful about using more draconian measures.</p> <p>  Having spoken to the inspectorate, I can say that people working on the ground often welcome the commentary of the inspectorate and the commission because it provides very clear direction to them in terms of the changes they can make to improve the services.  When one talks to people across the system, many of them will say that bringing about change is a very co-operative process.  It is not just about saying a service must close or do X or Y.  It is about pointing out the changes that are needed and bringing people up to that change over time.  When one looks at the position historically, one can see that improvements have taken place.  The factors which mitigate against that are often down to the fact that people do not have the necessary resources or are working in buildings that are not fit for purpose.  Often the issues are not localised but are national and, as such, they require a national response.</p></speech>

Does Dr. Muldoon believe the system we are operating is workable or fixable?  Can we get to a satisfactory level of service provision or should we dismantle what we have and start again?  I know there is no silver bullet but I am interested in hearing Dr. Muldoon's views, based on his experience.  Do we have something on which we can work or should we start from a completely different place?</p></speech>

Ms Brennan spoke earlier about the fact that some parts of the country have very good CAMHS and very good mental health services generally.  Galway has been highlighted as one of the best in that regard.  It can be done but it is generally done because of individual personalities who make things work.  It is down to good decisions on who to bring in, what the contracts look like and making it work for an area.  As a system, it is dependent on the individuals within it.  That is why I am seeking a new A Vision for Change specifically for children.  We keep referring to the original document but that was drafted in utopia, when we expected to be able to sell all of our old psychiatric hospitals for hundreds of millions of euro and reinvest that money in services.  We are now in very different circumstances and the Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for mental health has told me that at least 15 psychiatric consultant posts have been unfilled for the past five years.</p><p>We are not producing enough psychiatrists to fill them.  That is where we need to start thinking in a new way, such as how else we can fill those posts and whether there are other posts that could do the same job for a period of time.  There is a bit of both.  The system when it is fully resourced with the right people will work perfectly, but when one has a situation where only one type of professional can fill it and one cannot get that professional one needs to start thinking about who else can fill the post.  That is one part of it, but it is also necessary to resource properly the earlier stage, which is the primary care, the early intervention, the GPs and the stages where young people are identified as quickly as possible.  I would love to see people without their professional hats on discussing how one would set this up as new.  It would be a conversation worth having if we put everyone in a room and asked: "What do we want for our children and grandchildren regardless of what our profession is and what would be the best way forward?"  There are examples of good practice around the country that are not supported by the system but by individuals with real passion and emotion.  That is where we need to get a mix.</p></speech>

There are 15 unfillable posts.  Let us move on and establish a system whereby posts can be filled with people who can be put into them.  That is something we need to consider.</p></speech>

That is not the norm any more.  That is one thing that worked well.  The primary thing to understand is that we do not have enough of a team.  We do not have any other therapy.  One cannot cure depression or alleviate its symptoms with medicines alone.  It requires a three prong approach - counselling, activity and medication.  My child could not get out of bed with the depression he had.  No other therapy was offered.  There was no counselling, psychology, art therapy or music therapy.  There was nothing.  We were left holding the can for long periods of time.  I am not trained psychiatrically.  I had to beg, plead and write: "Please help me.  I do not know what I am doing and I need help for my child."  I eventually sourced it but it was after many letters and calls to Dr. Niall Muldoon.</p></speech>

I was meeting the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly.  I have a few observations for Dr. Muldoon.  I read the report.  The children and service users were very open and honest in it.  I compliment everybody involved with it because we need to get the truth out.  However, there appears to be a repetitive issue here.  On primary care, the committee has called for the development of a realistic plan and timeframe for the provision of 24-7 services, but that is not happening.  Like Dr. Muldoon, we have called for everyone to sit down together and take off their professional hats and put on their thinking caps.  We call it an outside-the-box and common sense approach to CAMHS.  We know the incidence of suicide is higher in certain geographical areas than in others.  My view is that if there is a restriction when it comes to staffing, and there is a diabolical situation at present, we can surely pinpoint geographical areas and get them fully staffed and working there.</p> <p>  Ms Brennan spoke about the lack of services even when one gets into them.  There was just option A and no B or C in terms of treatment for her child, such as talk therapy and so forth.  That is down to staffing.  There is one issue that always aggrieves me.  Why can we not fill the teams we have in CAMHS?  If we cannot, can we not consider the geographical basis whereby if there is greater urgency in CHO areas 2 and 5 we try to staff those fully first?  That decreases the pressure in one area.  I realise it could exacerbate it in others, but the numbers are not as high.</p> <p>  Turning to the Mental Health Commission, we raised staffing here last week.  If we cannot get the recruitment process right in any part of the sections, we have lost.  I submitted a parliamentary question last January and the reply was that the Mental Health Commission recruitment process has 22 stages before there is an appointment.  That is a bad indictment of good resourcing or good thinking.  I have a question for Mr. Saunders on the allocation of funds.  There was an under-drawdown of nearly &euro;9 million in 2005, &euro;5.5 million in 2006 and &euro;3.1 million in 2007, but all the budget was spent in 2008.  From 2009 to 2014 the moneys that were not drawn down amount to approximately &euro;12 million.  Where does that money go?  Does it go back into the system?  Is it ring-fenced for something?  It appears that across the entire area of mental health we cannot tie down a simple specific answer to a question, and when we cannot get answers we seem to go around in a revolving door all the time.  I am very worried when we cannot get clarity on a matter.</p> <p>  With regard to the commission's powers and responsibilities, does it look over some of the Bills we produce?  If we produce legislation is it part of the commission's remit to respond to it?  One example is the Assisted Decision-Making Capacity Act.  Does the Mental Health Commission look at that and agree or disagree with it?</p></speech>

There is something wrong.  Surely if we can produce doctors, psychologists, psychiatrists and so forth we can retain them.  Surely a structure could be put in place.  Much of it is to do with the unions as well.  Let us be honest and frank here.  If we are not going to sort this out the committee will go around in circles.  There will be departments for this, that and the other and a review of a review of a review.  There are 47 or 48 reports now and an average of 500 people die by suicide each year, excluding accidental poisoning, possible filicides, single vehicle crashes and accidental drownings.  We do not know what the numbers are.  That does not even refer to the marginalised society, such as Travellers and so forth, where we have no records.  I am very worried that we are going around in circles and I ask Mr. Saunders and Dr. Muldoon for their opinions on that.</p><p>If we keep going the way we are going at present, will the whole mental health system implode, fall apart and fizzle out, because we seem to be losing every single ingredient to bake the cake in the pot?</p></speech>

At the current rate, with the structures that are in place and the road we are going down - whether it is CAMHS, the whole mental health service or recruitment - if we do not do something drastic and immediate it will implode.

There are psychiatrists who have put 16 years of their lives into one area and then they decide that the only option they have left is to resign in order to force a change.  That is a system imploding as far as I am concerned and that is the collateral damage.</p></speech>

We can tell that the mental health budget is close to &euro;1 billion in general but not how much is spent on children in particular.  We know that 75% of all adult psychiatric issues start in childhood.  No business is set up without knowing what is being spent, where it is being spent and where better resources can be allocated.  When the Irish College of General Practitioners met in another committee with the Chair, they spoke about the need for demographic allocation and disadvantage needs to be considered there.  There is a better way of doing that with the limited resources, namely to find out where the need is greatest and the south east seems to have jumped to the top of that queue but there are other areas that need better allocation.  There is a way of improving the system but we need to start with the basic question of how much we spend on it.  That needs to increase.  We know it is only 6% of our national budget and the European average is around 12%.  We are way behind on that.  We know the money is not enough if the recruitment is not done properly.  Other areas that Ms Brennan mentioned where we could recruit are play, art and drama therapists and other such people who are in professions that have only come on the scene in the last ten to 15 years.  Many of them now have proper oversight and regulations.  They could help us in the areas of primary care and we need to look at the more serious levels as well.</p></speech>

That is part of the issue.  The services are not providing what vision for change wants, namely a model based on doctors, nurses and a whole range of disciplines besides.  The second issue is one of resources.  One of the things we have been identifying is the fact that in CAMHS, for example, the amount of money available throughout the country ranges from a low of &euro;40 to &euro;92 per person per annum.  It is a whole range of different figures depending on where one lives.  That is evident in how services are being provided by other countries.</p> <p>  I refer to manpower.  It is cold comfort to anybody here but A Vision for Change made four or five recommendations on increasing manpower for psychology, social work and other disciplines way back in 2006.  It did not happen and now we are reaping the rewards of that if that is an appropriate phrase.  We do not have enough people coming out of the training schools as are required in mental health.  As has been said, some will emigrate.</p></speech>

I give respect to Ms Brennan.  It is great that her voice is here and more recently it has been proven in this country that ordinary voices such as hers are the catalyst for change.  That is why we need to keep pushing this.  It needs to change but it must come from our ordinary families and children who suffer in this country.  I thank her for appearing before the committee.  We are not that scary but sometimes it can be daunting.</p> <p>  I thank the Mental Health Commission also.  What do they think about a prison becoming an approved centre?  I looked at their annual financial statements in depth for the last two or three years.  I am concerned about how much they spend on their legal representation.  I would like a written submission back to the committee on that.  It seems to be a complete overspend.  It feels like the lawyers are doing what they do best but maybe I am being condemnatory of them.  It is to do with the due process in tribunals.  Mental health tribunals are important and have become extremely important for people's rights in this country but they do not represent the patient in the tribunal as such.  They are only there to make sure that due process occurs but that does not give voice to the patient.  I have grave concerns about the lack of patients' voices in that process because lawyers and legal teams supposedly representing them only tick the box to say that due process has taken place.</p> <p>  Time and again, the Mental Health Commission has visited facilities that were very poor and unfit for habitation such as Portrane.  I know that there are often no alternative facilities but how do they justify registering such facilities and allowing them to continue to offer services even though they are so far below par and unfit?  I understand that we would have no other facilities but maybe that is the push that we need.</p> <p>  I have worked with mental health staff and represented them as a union representative.  There have been several occasions where we have felt like calling the Health and Safety Authority because of situations within our hospitals or approved centres.  That may seem like a last resort measure but perhaps it would send a signal out that something needs to be done.</p> <p>  I thank Dr. Muldoon.  He produced a survey with input from young people.  There were two private CAMHS units and three public.  The committee has discussed this before.  Were there any stark differences between the private and public responses?  What did children find good, bad or indifferent in those?  Some &euro;400 million is spent on psychotropic drugs and &euro;10 million is spent on talk therapies such as play, drama or art and counselling.  He also mentioned the restraint of children, that it seems to have increased and seems to be more drug related, especially with the powerful, synthetic drugs that are out there now.  Could he comment on that and the challenging behaviour that results from those drug induced psychoses?  I agree with the comments on A Vision for Change which was also previously discussed.  We need to have more of a community effort and to look at the appointment of experienced professionals to run the areas of our services that do not have any kind of order within them.</p><p>We put that question to the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland and it was a definite no-no so maybe the witnesses might like to keep pressing that.</p></speech>

I will ask Dr. Muldoon to answer first.  Could Dr. Muldoon and Mr. Saunders remember that we are stuck for time?</p></speech>

The children gave their answers.  We did not take heed of where it was happening in one place or another.  We just wanted a general picture of where everybody was.  That is why we were delighted to get five out of the six units so we could take a full picture around the country.  As regards the &euro;40 million versus &euro;10 million, as far as we are concerned, this is something that will be important redress.  Elements of counselling are happening alongside the use of medication.  Four to one is not the right ratio with regard to that.</p></speech>

We then say that this is what we understand they have told us and check whether they are happy with how we are presenting it.  In this case, we just took what they said, which was that there were a number of situations in which young people were physically restrained in order to administer an injection.  They felt it was done in an inappropriate way, they could do without that happening and there would be other ways it should happen.  They knew they were upset and needed help but they felt there were better ways of doing that.</p> <p>  From our experience with this case, consultation and presentation, nobody had any drug-related issues so I cannot really comment on that.  The committee has discussed the difficulty surrounding dual diagnosis.  That is another issue where a child with a drug addiction or any sort of addiction finds it difficult to access a mental health service.  I would be very much aware of that but not in this particular report.  </p></speech>

This is fundamentally a human right.  People who are detained against their will have a right to have that detention questioned and that is what the mental health tribunals do.  They give a "Yes" or "No" response to those issues.  Of course, it could be improved but that is what the Mental Health Act demands and that is what the commission does under the Act.</p> <p>  In respect of the approved centres, thankfully, all the old unfit-for-purpose institutions are gone.  We are now dealing with units that are attached to general hospitals.  Some of them are quite old.  In fact, most of them existed prior to the Mental Health Commission.  Our brief under the Act is to inspect them and attach conditions and we do attach conditions.  At any one time, a significant number of conditions are in place, which means there are things that people need to improve on.  As I said earlier, the staff in those services at a local level bend over backwards to make those improvements because they know they are heading in the right direction if they do so.  We must accept that they are there.  Often it is the only unit in the county and we cannot just close it overnight because there is no plan B.  The other thing to bear in mind around registration is that it is never simply a case of saying a place is providing a perfect service.  There is always a dialogue around making changes and improvements.  Anyone who works in the system will know that the commission through its inspectorate is very open to that dialogue to make those changes.  </p></speech>

We share Dr. Muldoon's concerns about the lack of clarity and transparency when it comes to where the money is being spent.  This committee has been hitting a brick wall for the past few months.  In particular, I thank Ms Brennan.  She was very courageous and I know she did that for her own child and the children in her own area and our country.I know how difficult that was for her and we really appreciate it.  She hit the nail on the head.  Fundamentally, it is a crucial test for society via politics and we are failing miserably.  In the new politics that we talk about, mental health support should be top of the agenda.</p> <p>  Many of the questions I was going to ask about the Mental Health Commission have already been answered.  Do we have any idea about the number of unregulated mental health care services outside approved centres or where they are located?  What happens when they come to the attention of the commission?  Do we have any statistics in this area?  </p> <p>  I will concentrate on education because that is my background.  I was interested in Dr. Muldoon's recommendation for school-based counselling.  It is something I would be keen to see.  I know it is the norm in many countries so how can we do this?  Does Dr. Muldoon believe that the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health are working together properly to address supports for our children?  Is that interdepartmental collaboration close enough?  Are the Departments working together in innovative ways to support them?  Is the promotion of happiness and mental resilience among our children being addressed at all?  In a recent survey, the majority of primary school principals said that they just do not know.  Children are really stressed out and more anxious than ever before and principals do not know how to cope with it and how to help these children.  Is that interdepartmental approach there?    </p> <p>  There was a reference to some teachers doing some work.  It is quite sporadic.  What needs to be done there to ensure that it is not so sporadic and that we have the proper training for teachers before we reach the stage where we get those counsellors on site?  What is the obstacle there because it cannot be sporadic and down to a post code?  A lot of the time, children in the most vulnerable post codes are being let down so what can be done to ensure it is done across the board?  </p></speech>

Breaking with anonymity was a very powerful, brave and difficult thing to do.  One thing we have learned is that very often, personal experiences do the most in acting as catalysts for change.  It should not have to be like this but very often, it is the thing that empowers some people to sit up, wake up and see exactly what is going on.</p> <p>  I thank Dr. Muldoon for his work in his report in terms of giving a voice to children.  Very often, the most difficult thing we face is giving effect to that voice for obvious reasons such as data protection and access.  Very often, it is the voice that is missing.  There has been a history of too much focus on paternalism in this country that needs to be rebalanced so that our children's voices can be heard.  I very much welcome that.  </p> <p>  I thank Mr. Saunders and the Mental Health Commission for their work.  I know Mr. Saunders does great work both inside and outside the commission.  Very often, inspection reports are the launch pad for parliamentary questions I put and further work.  My first question is for Mr. Saunders.  I recently asked the Department of Health about the longest length of stay with regard to children in adult units.  The Department told me that it does not keep that information or those records.  I think this is quite unbelievable and unacceptable.  It is outrageous that this is the case.  I know the commission has had this information in past reports so I do not know why it is not available from the Department anymore.  For the Department to say it does not know how long children are staying in adult units is outrageous.  Dealing with Waterford, anecdotally, there seems to be a significant increase in the number of children staying in these units for four, five or six weeks.  Perhaps the commission could address that.  Is it just my interpretation of what I am seeing or is it a trend that is becoming more worrisome?</p><p>From talking to parents, I have discovered it is happening because of the lack of alternative supports, which was addressed by Ms Brennan, such as activities or alternative therapies.  Again, that is totally unacceptable.</p><p> Dr. Muldoon touched the most important finding of the commmittee, that being that we do not know how much is being spent on child mental health services.  I ask him to comment on another key finding, which is that &euro;400 million is being spent on psychotropic drugs in our mental health services but only &euro;10 million on talk therapies.  Medication has an important role in treatment but a ratio of 40:1 in its favour over basic talk therapy support gives a very clear indication of the focus of and imbalance in our health services.</p><p> We know that people recover best when treated close to their family, friends and care network.  Dr. Muldoon touched on that when he noted that separation from family is a particularly significant challenge frequently mentioned by young people.  People with eating disorders or members of the deaf community who need specialised supports very often are sent to the United Kingdom for a long time to receive appropriate support.  Those people are completely separated from their loved ones and care network.  The same language may be spoken in the United Kingdom but it is a different jurisdiction and those people are completely alienated from their families, friends and support networks.  I ask Dr. Muldoon to address the consequences of our young people being alienated by being sent out of the country to access medical supports.</p></speech>

Is there an irregularity in terms of payment for medication being granted in some areas but not in others?  Mr. Saunders mentioned that the Mental Health Commission has noted a considerable variation in funding depending on geographical area.  How has that developed?  Is it because of a Minister being from a particular area or is it due to a lack of services such that one area gets more funding than another?</p> <p>  The facility at Linn Dara was mentioned.  I ask the witnesses to comment on the fact that beds are being closed there.  Why is that being done?  It does not make sense to do so if we wish to increase the number of beds available nationwide.</p> <p>  The witnesses addressed transitional services, in particular in regard to CAMHS.  The transition of those aged 18 to 20 is a priority in that regard.  What is being done for such people?  What works and what does not in terms of other models in other jurisdictions?  Are we learning from experiences elsewhere?  Do the witnesses have any suggestions in that regard?</p> <p>  I have other queries but I am allowed to ask only three questions so I will leave it at that.  My main queries regard transitional services, CAMHS and the difficulties which families encounter.</p> <p>  Ms Brennan addressed the difficulties she and her family have experienced.  Is it a familiar pattern for families to wonder where to go, who to see and what happens if the services are not there?  Those are  the first things to strike families.  Families have come to me whose son or daughter needs services and respite but refuses to go into respite or avail of services.  What should families do in such circumstances, in particular if the child is violent, apart from sectioning the child?  I am aware of a case involving a child who was eating off the ground, walking naked indoors and outdoors and had severe mental health problems.  Many of the family members themselves end up on anti-depressants.  I offer that as an example of families such as Margaret's who do not know where to go.  They usually go to politicians but they are the wrong people to whom to go.   Doctors probably do not know what to do, hospitals are too busy to deal with them and the Garda can offer only limited advice.  Where do such families go?  I have asked that question before.  It is probably monotonous for those at home watching or listening to the committee proceedings but these are the type of questions to which people need answers.</p></speech>

Deputy Catherine Martin was the first to ask questions.  I call on Mr. Saunders, to be followed by Dr. Muldoon.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-20a.323" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Saunders" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018062000002#L00600"><p>I thank the Chair.  I will give a brief response, given the time limits.  On unregulated mental health care services, only approved residential centres across the country are currently regulated under the Act.  We regulate those centres and impose conditions and changes.  We can inspect other services but we cannot impose changes upon them.  We have the power to inspect and to make suggestions to community residences, community mental health teams in adults' and children's services and every other type of service but we do not have the power under the Act to enforce those suggestions.  That is the crucial issue and it is part of the review process to which I alluded much earlier in terms of the services.  We know, and it is nothing new to say, that most mental health teams across the country are under-staffed because of supply and other issues.</p> <p>  Deputy Browne raised the issue of duration of stay.  In 2011, the year in which the commission began to highlight the issue of children's admissions to adult units, the average duration in those units was approximately 11 days and children then went back to their families or on to appropriate children's services.  That has now come down to approximately six to eight days per admission.  It is important to understand the background to such admissions.  Some children go into adult services because children's services sometimes will not receive people out of hours.  Parents sometimes choose for their child, their loved one, to be served locally rather than travel 100 miles or more to a children's unit.  There may be a clinical decision that it is the most appropriate location for a child.  CAMHS may not be able to support people locally.  We earlier mentioned that community mental health children's teams are not sufficiently staffed to provide the support a child might require while living in his or her own home and the last resort is often, therefore, for the child to go to a children's service or, in some cases, unfortunately, an adult service.  That may not fully answer Deputy Browne but those are the headline issues.</p> <p>  Deputy Crowe raised a number of issues.  There is a problem in regard to transitional services.  Between the ages of 16 and 18 a person is constitutionally and legally a child but may be exhibiting adult-type behaviours and there is an issue in terms of who deals with such people.  Traditionally in Ireland, the children's mental health service finishes at 18 and the adult mental healthcare service kicks in.  There are logistical issues in regard to how teams co-operate with each other or not, depending on the situation.  The commission and many others have highlighted inconsistencies across the country in that regard, some of which are partly historical.  Some areas of the country historically have better financial resource allocations.  If there was a very large institution in an area, a very large budget would have been provided to support it.  When the institution closed, that budget may more or less stay in the area.</p> <p>  As mentioned by Dr. Muldoon, local clinical and administrative leadership is often the spark that drives change, such that change is promoted by personality or the dynamic of a team rather than having a national consistent change plan.  There are pockets of brilliance and developments across the country.</p><p>They are side by side with the more traditional, under-resourced lack of innovation, for want of a better word, in terms of the type of service they provide.  We end up with the patchwork to which the Deputy alluded.  That is the fact of Irish life in terms of how mental health care services have developed.  I hope I have dealt with all of the questions.</p></speech>

The whole essence of that is to try to create co-ordination and encouragement so that well-being becomes part of the culture of every school.  It is about emotional awareness across teachers, students and parents, so it is the school community that needs to have a well-being culture.  We are trying to promote that all of the time.</p> <p>  Within that, changes are needed.  The Deputy asked whether the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills are working closely together.  They are not working together closely enough.  They both have targets within a number of strategies, such as the Healthy Ireland strategy, Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures and various other strategies.  However, with regard to co-operating with each other, it is not as good as it could be and this is something that can be encouraged.  We need teachers to be valued more than they are at present for the work they do.  We now have a well-being curriculum for junior certificate but we still find this is taken on board by certain teachers who might have fewer hours filled, and it might not always be encouraged as the most important part of the work they do.  There is a lot of work to be done in both the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health.  Co-operation is vital and that is where we need to have things like a counselling service available across the two Departments, and perhaps across other Departments.  They are starting to work on issues such as speech and language therapists being provided in schools, which is a case of co-operation between the two Departments.  If we can do the same with regard to a counselling service, that could work, but there is a lot of work to be done.  Even during the early years in primary school, we can start to encourage children, teachers and any of the professionals working with them to work on the emotional well-being and emotional vocabulary of children.  This would make a huge difference into the future and give them resilience.</p></speech>

Within that, apart from looking after our children, it was referenced by the experts that, despite the need for teachers to be fully there to support their students, the mental health of teachers is often forgotten about.  Is that something we can work on here?</p></speech>

We deliberately named our group the "well-being for teachers and learners" group so that everybody can become a teacher, and the child can teach the adult and vice versa.  We need well-being for both and that is where culture comes in.  If someone knows the teacher is struggling, there is no point asking that teacher to help a child.  We have to provide that service all the way through the school community.</p></speech>

In terms of the work we did with the 25 people in the inpatient units at the time, at the outset we asked them about their journey through the mental health services but we did not ask them about anything other than the mental health services.  What was very interesting was that, consistently, the young people included a focus in their comments on education, the importance of culture in schools and the professional and other supports, including peer supports, available in schools.  In the area for ideas for improvement, they put a very strong emphasis on prevention in terms of work to promote well-being and good mental health, but also on supports being available at that level, informal and otherwise, to build young people's awareness and understanding of their own mental health, if they are experiencing difficulties, and to help them address those difficulties.  It is a very important area to look at.</p></speech>

With regard to geographic supports and the idea that young people have been taken away from their homes, the UN committee is very clear that the highest attainable standard of health care needs to include support and closeness to the highest possible level of support.  The way I always describe it is that it needs to be accessible, appropriate and timely.  The committee will see in our report that one young person was in an inpatient unit six and a half hours away from home and did not see the family for ten weeks.  That is a difficult thing to do at the best of times and we are doing people a huge disservice if that is the best we can offer.  International options are a huge problem, in my view.  We have all sorts of concerns about children who are held in clinical centres in England.  We find this happens with eating disorders because patients need to be PEG fed, for example.  Again, it is an area where we can increase our professionalism in order to bring those young people home.  From our perspective, this is a concern because it damages their rights to the best attainable health care within their own community.  I would also have a question mark as to the clinical and governance system when people are sent across to another country.</p> <p>  Deputy Crowe asked about Linn Dara.  I assume he is referring to last year's closure of 11 beds due to the difficulty in recruiting nurses.  My understanding is that it was back up to full capacity from October or November of last year and I have not heard of any difficulties since then.  However, it does show the vulnerability we have in that recruitment can be a difficulty for us and can lead to problems for children.  An average stay there is about six weeks, which means some 60 young people may have lost out on that opportunity while those beds were closed.  It is something for which we can plan.</p> <p>  Mr. Saunders talked about the 16 to 20 years age group.  We still have CHO areas where CAMHS teams do not take anyone above 16 years of age, which is a disgrace.  We have a centralised operating procedure which says they should do this but some of them are not.  It is not even from 18 to 20 years but from 16 upwards that children are lost to a proper CAMHS service.  We still have a lot of work to do in this regard.</p> <p>  The committee has heard perfectly today about the impact on families.  If we had a service where they looked after our young people when they came in to us, the families would not have to fight, search, navigate, cajole and protest.  None of those things would have to happen and they would still have a difficult time.  If we were to do it properly, we would have a holistic service that provides support for everybody in that family that has an issue in regard to siblings, and parents would have some support.  We have to start by giving the identified child every support possible and making it as easy as possible for the families.  That is where an advocacy service and similar services can help, so they do not have to do all of the fighting.</p></speech>

The area medical officers in Galway and Wexford decided that ADHD was not allowable on the long-term illness card for children, whereas every other county in Ireland was covered and all the other children in Ireland with ADHD were allowed the cost of their medication, which at the time was &euro;150.  I appealed this as I felt it was inequality and discrimination based on where we choose to live, and I won the appeal.</p> <p>  On the question on the schools, the youngest child I ever had who expressed suicidal ideation was seven years old.  We did not have a counsellor in that small rural school and we did not know what to do and had to get an external counsellor.  Counselling in secondary schools has been cut and cut again.  To get a slot for a teenager, one would have to be very lucky.  I know the counsellors in three schools.  One was brought in externally and the other two were on the school staff and teaching, so they were working their counselling around their teaching hours.  It is very difficult, especially in a boys school, as they will not go to the counsellor.</p> <p>  There is one social care system working in the south-east called Hedge Schools Therapy, and I am sure all committee members are aware of it.  It is very difficult to get and it can be accessed only through the HSE.  My son was lucky and they changed his future.  They brought him out cycling and rock climbing, and they took him on one half day from school.  They are social care workers.  All they do is outdoor therapy; they build fires in the woods and build resilience.  Little by little, he began to disclose what had led to him being in CAMHS in the first place, which he has written down.  He has also written an account of his time as an inpatient, which is horrific.</p><p>Little by little, they changed his future and now he is doing well in college.  The services and play therapists are there.  There are therapists and psychologists but somebody is not funding the team.</p></speech>

I will start.  I will address Mr. Saunders and then Ms Brennan.  If there are questions that Mr. Saunders is not able to answer, I would be obliged if he could provide those answers at a later stage so that we can include them in the report.</p> <p>  Who does the Mental Health Commission report to?  Who funds the Mental Health Commission?  If it is the Department of Health, surely there is a conflict of interest?  How can it tell the Department of Health that it is not doing a good job if it is paying the commission to do that?  I am a little concerned about that.  Will Mr. Saunders clarify that?  He said the commission was established in 2002.  As mentioned earlier by Deputy Brassil, the commission has written thousands of pages of reports and, 16 years on, we are still seeing the same problem.  Do you have any power at all?  When I say "you", I do not mean Mr. Saunders but the Mental Health Commission.  Let us be very clear about that.  Does the Mental Health Commission have any power at all?  With all the reports and what it is finding, nothing is changing.  When Mr. Saunders talks about how he thinks the commission should have the right to access external services, to measure, identify and investigate them, that would worry me a little.  Since the commission has very little impact on mental health services, surely if it starts to focus the spotlight on external services, it will be taken away from the HSE?  That worries me because we as a committee are trying to make the HSE accountable.  I would like Mr. Saunders to comment on that.</p> <p>  My next questions are for Ms Brennan.  I want a real, honest, basic answer to this question.  What is she going to do now that the services are going to be removed or stopped?  If they are returned, the chances are that it could be in about a year's time.  To recruit a psychiatrist in the south-east area would take at least a year.  What is Ms Brennan going to do now?  She mentioned the four year waiting list for her child.  What was the waiting list for?  Was it for initial assessment?</p></speech>

I feel that parents are forgotten in this.  The biggest role in a child's life is the parent's.  Ms Brennan has fought for all these services and awareness.  I see that in the different reports.  That is unacceptable because the first port of call is the parent.  The parent will notice signs.  If one is not trained to notice these signs, it is a drawback, because timing is crucial with issues such as this.  A programme should be put in place for parents such as Ms Brennan who need early intervention.  She needs to know the signs.  She has children and is not used to this.  It is a whole new world to her.  In my own area, I see people fighting for medical cards, not being able to afford the cost of doctors and waiting to go on a list for an appointment.  That is unacceptable.</p> <p>  I will go back to Dr. Muldoon and his excellent report.  It is crucial that we set up a national youth mental health taskforce.  Dr. Muldoon's report states that many young people spoke of the length of time it took to access child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  When one gets to a certain age, one knows that there is an issue in the system.  This system is broken.  It is not fit for purpose.  Families are affected.  There are children and parents who are crying out for help.  They are really stressed because they feel that their children need that help.  There is no help there for them either.  The whole system needs to be looked at, as do all these reports, whether they are worked on or money is put into them.  We keep bringing up staffing and I know how crucial it is, particularly with teachers in schools but also with counsellors.  It could start off with the small things, such as extra help in schools or for parents.  It is not massive money and it boils down to funding.  I do not care what anyone says.  There is a massive rural and urban divide.  One can see it.  Different CHO areas all get different funding.  Many will get more than others.  That is unfair.  We need to make sure that everybody gets equal treatment and it is not happening here.</p> <p>  I was reading Mr. Saunders' report on advising the Minister regarding regulations for approved centres.  He has gone through all the different areas.  He says he had inspected 43 residencies in 2017 details of which are published on the site.  He has noticed massive issues.  We know staffing is a massive issue.  There is the absence of privacy, space, poor repairs to buildings and issues with institutional care.  What are the HSE or the Minister doing about this?  These reports are fine and we welcome them but what is being done?  That is the issue today.  It is not acceptable that 82 children were in adult units.  That figure is going back up.  It was 68 in 2016 and in 2017 it is up by 14.  That is unacceptable.  A Vision for Change is not working.  Can everybody get together and start listening to Ms Brennan and the children who are crying out for help, put a programme together and start with the simple things such as getting school counsellors back and helping the teachers?  Train teachers in the signs.  Dr. Muldoon said that one can sometimes even see signs by the age of four.  We all need to address these matters for the long term.  We must develop a system, help and awareness; the Chairman would tell the witnesses that at every meeting I have attended I have stated awareness is the biggest issue.  Parents are not aware and teachers are not aware.  There is the awareness of what they are entitled to and the awareness of signs.  There is such a lack of information and until that is sorted, this system will not work.</p></speech>

I missed the second presentation so some of my comments may have been dealt with.  I will deal with three issues.  The first relates to recruitment and retention.  I heard a Minister this morning, when he was addressing this very issue, say that it was an international problem and that Ireland is no different from anywhere else.  He proposed that tele-psychiatry would be the answer to recruitment and retention.  I would like the witnesses' view on that.  From my experience, the one-to-one personal contact that a patient has with his or her carer, whether a doctor or a nurse, is most important, particularly with regard to continuity of care.  If one is trying to solve mental health issues over the Internet or Skype, it is a poor substitute for having a nurse, doctor or therapist to speak to a person.</p> <p>  The second issue relates to community care teams, specifically CAMHS.  In my area in west Clare, we do not have a consultant psychiatrist.  We have not had a psychologist for six years.  We have half a social worker.  The team is very understaffed.  The problem with that is that those who are left standing are burning out.  Not only do we not have the personnel to fill the gaps, but those who are there are under serious pressure.  There seems to be a lack of urgency in addressing this issue.</p> <p>  The third issue relates to talk therapy and medication.  Many quite serious mental health issues do not involve a biochemical imbalance but the treatment that is given is very potent medication.  I do not think that is appropriate.  I know we referred to &euro;400 million for psychotropic drugs and &euro;10 million for talk therapy but it is not as simple as that.</p><p>Nevertheless, the tendency to reach for the prescription pad is very easy.  If one does not have the top therapists, psychologists and cognitive behavioural therapy available that is the option.  One is treating conditions which do not involve a biochemical imbalance with very potent drugs.  Perhaps the witnesses might address those issues.</p><p> The amount of medication being prescribed for children with mental health issues is quite frightening.  Quite often these medications are not addressing the issue at all, but rather are blunting symptoms instead of treating the underlying condition.  I ask the witnesses to address those issues.</p></speech>

The approved centres are run by the HSE in the main.  There are also some independent services.  The other unregulated services, that is, community mental health teams, are also run by the HSE.  We are not talking about different providers.  All mental health care services, with the exception of the independent private sector, are provided by the only statutory authority, that is, the HSE.  That is how we work.  Many people are using services which the commission cannot regulate forcefully.</p></speech>

I have been told by the radio station that a campaign is about to take place, the details of which I do not know.  After that, I do not know what to do for the betterment of my child but I know that some referrals have already been made to Dr. Kieran Moore in Crumlin.  I do not know what to say about that.  Parents do what they have to do.</p></speech>

CAMHS will not take any referral until a child is seven years of age.  I had my child assessed at the age of four because I could see major signs, which cost me just under &euro;1,000 and was not refunded by any organisation.  He had to be reassessed after a number of years.  The private psychiatrist left the country and we were left with CAMHS.  It tried to assess him and that did not work.  He went back on the list and was re-referred, and now sits at the bottom of the list.  The reassessment is very quick, and all it does is assess whether he has the condition.  We will not have an assessment.  We do not have a specialist.</p></speech>

Parents are in much worse situations than I am.  There are parents whose children are suicidal.  I know my child better than anybody else.  I give him little concentration blocks and tasks at home which is costing me a fortune in Lego kits.  That is the payment he likes.  He gets rewards when he hits a target.</p> <p>  He is entitled to resource hours in school.  As far as I can make out, the teacher has been on leave and there have been three substitutes for her, a situation which is not working.  He has not improved as a result of the resource hours.  It is down to me as his parent and I will do everything.  If it costs me a fortune in Lego, that is fine.  I will do everything to help my child as I have done for the others.</p> <p>  As regards teachers in schools, if one is interested one can opt into mental health care courses given by Professor Fiona McNicholas who provides them in teacher centres.  Teachers have to opt in and get substitute cover.  Those who are not interested do not opt in.  I have been to one course and Professor McNicholas is absolutely brilliant.  I met several secondary school teachers at the courses, some of whom are not trained counsellors but are taking on the role of counsellors in schools.</p> <p>  I would advise committee members to not be so quick to dismiss medication.  It helps in a lot of cases.  A doctor would not prescribe a medicine for a child if it was not needed.  They are not that trigger happy with prescriptions.  They will do what is needed at the time and start on a very low dose.  I have never found a doctor who is prescription happy.  They will do whatever the child needs.  If he or she needs something for concentration, low mood or to calm him or her down, doctors will not give out medication willy-nilly.  </p> <p>  I am at a loss.  The CAMHS team will collapse without a specialist.  We are not even in hospital, yet children with serious psychiatric problems are in a general hospital on a paediatric ward, where there are babies in cots.  They are left there and parents are told staff cannot mind their children because they are not trained in psychiatric illness.  On the two occasions I refer to nobody from the CAMHS team came to visit.  I had to deal with the situation.  I had to sleep on a chair or the floor and mind my child.  That situation needs to be addressed.  It happens quite often.  As Deputy Browne said, children who need to be in a specialist unit are in wards with babies in cots for weeks.  In University Hospital Waterford children are in a private room off an adult ward which is no bigger than a cupboard for weeks with no therapy and nothing to do all day.  I cannot tell the committee what I have seen there.  </p></speech>

Those relating to children were directed to the Ombudsman for Children.  The first concerned recruitment and retention and tele-psychiatry.</p></speech>

I agree tele-psychiatry is not a substitute.  Mental health care services across all programmes are about people reacting with people and support far more than in general medicine and other forms of health.  There is room for tele-mental health or e-mental health, but it has a very specific purpose.  In general, one should never try to replace people with machinery in the area of mental health.</p><p>I agree totally with Deputy Harty on that.</p><p> The second point to note to which the Deputy, and all of us, have alluded is that the community health teams are incomplete.  People are working under pressure to provide a complete service with half the team.  To use the analogy, how will a football team win a game if half its team members are not on the pitch?  It is as simple as that.  It is a complex problem to solve but it is simple.  We do not have the right people in the right place to provide that service across the country.</p><p> On the issue of drugs, I respect all views around that.  There is a history in mental health and in other parts of services of people relying on drugs because of the absence of something else.  Equally, I am sure drugs work in certain cases.  A number of years ago, the commission did a piece of research on benzodiazepines use in older populations and showed clearly that there is usually an over-prescribing of maximum doses in those cases.  One rationale for that would be that there is no other way of managing people's behaviour, which is wrong.  I have no doubt that in medicine generally, people sometimes resort to the prescription in the absence of other solutions.</p></speech>

That is where the system subtlety impacts enormously on people and if that is happening in the case of a child, we have got a serious problem.  Again, it is forcing professionals into doing things they do not want to be doing.</p></speech>

I have a question on age appropriate mental well-being classes in schools.  We recently published a suicide training and prevention Bill.  That was a small move but incoming public sector workers will get a minimum of a programme like SafeTALK, which will give them the coping skills to spot the signs.  Would it be an advantage for that to be rolled out to schools?  In that way, somebody who is working with children or with the public will have the skills to spot people who are in trouble.  I know that is only one part of a bigger issue but as Mr. Saunders said, like the football team, if we do not have all the ingredients we will not be able to make the cake.  This would be the first step to giving the people who are dealing with this area directly, namely, teachers, garda&iacute; and Government officials, the coping skills to spot the signs and help people when they are in difficulty.  In that way we would be nipping the issue in the bud and being proactive instead of being reactive in the future.  Do the witnesses believe that would be a good idea?  It is a simple question.</p></speech>

I will defer to the Ombudsman in his capacity for advocating for children.  However, there are many voluntary and statutory efforts around targeting children's health generally, in both primary schools and, more likely, in secondary schools.  That is important for all the reasons we heard earlier.  It is important because we know that if we get in early, we can inculcate attitudes and change ideas and behaviour.  The issue is how to provide a consistent level of intervention for all children in schools.  I am very aware that many issues in Ireland are addressed locally, again by this idea of some regional spark that has been developed.  Many very good services are provided by voluntary organisations but they are inconsistent because of resource issues and geographical variations.  There is a pattern in Ireland where statutory mental health care services and educational services provided through the educational system are supported by voluntary effort.  That is not a bad thing of itself but it leads to inconsistencies across the entire country.  I will defer to the Ombudsman.</p></speech>

Organisations like the GAA are taking initiatives like mental health first aid courses.  People are queuing up for them because coaches and managers are dealing with this issue.  It is coming into everybody's life and they are very aware it.  Many parents are eager to understand it.  It is a good development but we need to ensure that we do not leave it just to the voluntary sector to help us-----</p></speech>

We will wind up the meeting now.  My concerns have come to the fore today, in particular with the Mental Health Commission.  I see the value and the necessity of the Mental Health Commission when it is investigating involuntary admissions.  There has to be an adequate for people who have no voice.  However, I do not see the point of the role of the Mental Health Commission going around to the child and adolescent mental health services, etc. when nothing is happening.  I query strongly the relationship between the Mental Health Commission and the Department of Health and I would like to have some discussion about that at a later stage.</p> <p>  I thank Mr. Saunders, Ms Smyth, Dr. Wrigley, Dr. Niall Muldoon, Dr. Karen McAuley and, more than anybody else, Ms Margaret Brennan.  I would say to her that when it comes to making changes, the only thing I have seen work in recent years is when the people are behind us.  We need the entire public to get behind us on this issue and then we really will see changes.</p></speech>

I ask members to turn off their mobile phones or to put them to airplane mode.  This meeting has been convened to consider the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015.  I welcome The Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for health promotion and the national drugs strategy, Deputy Catherine Byrne, and her officials to the meeting.  As there are a number of related amendments, groupings arise and those groupings have just been circulated.</p></speech>

The amendments propose to provide for the creation of an offence in the case that a person advertises, or causes to be advertised, an alcohol product on an information society service unless all reasonable steps are taken to ensure the advertisement cannot be viewed by children.  These steps include whether age verification controls have been used to prevent access by children to an advertisement.  This amendment uses the framework of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive which comes under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten.  My officials have previously consulted that Department and the Department of Justice and Equality on this matter.</p> <p>  The Audiovisual Media Services Directive is a sector-specific directive for television and services that are similar to television.  I am informed that the extension of its scope is to include any audiovisual content on any platform would cut across several EU directives and other regulations.  In addition, I have concerns about the effectiveness of this proposed provision.  For example, if it was introduced for websites hosted in Ireland, advertisers could simply move to websites which are not hosted in Ireland to avoid the necessity to comply with this proposed amendment.  Finally, I am unclear as to how effective age verification controls could be implemented under the proposal.  A reliance on self-disclosure is not a robust method of enforcement as children may simply claim to be over 18 and, therefore, access the alcohol advertising.  European legislation, similar to the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, which addresses all the issues regarding intermediary or online platforms, is required to address the issues involved and I do not propose to accept the amendments.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 30 proposes to change the broadcasting watershed times in the Bill that applies to radio broadcasts to make them the same as those that apply to television.  The watershed times were set out to prohibit alcohol advertising during times when children might be in the audience.  For radio, the watershed times provide that alcohol advertisements can be broadcast at times children are at school during the week and at any time on weekends.  These times were agreed in consultation with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, which have the expertise in this area.  I am conscious that we are introducing new prohibitions on advertising with this Bill and inherent in this new regime will be the potential loss of advertising revenue to broadcasters.  However, I am determined that we address the proven impact that advertising alcohol to children can have.  On that basis, I will follow the advice given, and targeting this measure to times when children are likely to be in the audience for radio to ensure that this measure is both effective and proportionate.  Section 21 provides that the Minister for Health must carry out a review of the advertising sector after three years.  On this basis we can examine thee provisions again after we have had an opportunity to see their effects in practice.  For these reasons, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

I am happy to withdraw them at this stage but I reserve the right to resubmit on the basis that we all acknowledge that there is an issue that needs to be dealt with.  It might be necessary to resubmit the amendments on a later Stage.</p><p>In the intervening time, I would be amenable to discussions with the Department as to how we can ensure children are not the target of online advertising.  I am happy to withdraw the amendment on the basis that the Minister agrees that further discussion may take place, but I may resubmit it.</p></speech>

A lot of effort has been put into curbing alcohol advertising in the real world, on television and on radio but 50% of advertising spend in Ireland is now online.  That is because it is highly effective and it targets industry growth in this area.  I encourage the Minister of State to talk to the Minister for Health and his officials about this.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the Minister of State is outlining the views of the Minister but I wish to make a broader point on Internet advertising.  We have to move beyond saying it is impossible to regulate online advertising on the grounds that it can simply be shifted offshore.  While the Minister of State is not championing this, we have moved into the digital world and we sound like a bunch of analog politicians talking about a world we do not understand.  I encourage her to talk to her Government colleagues and officials because we cannot dismiss proper regulation of Internet advertising for reasons that may have been valid a decade ago, namely, the fact that it is an international business or businesses can use offshore platforms, etc.  We need to get our heads around this and if it requires a multinational or an EU approach, we should figure out how to make that happen.</p></speech>

Customers might be asked if they want a cup of tea or even a glass of water but they are rarely asked if they want a glass of Prosecco because it is is simply handed to them.  Years ago, one could only get alcohol in certain restricted circumstances but now it seems to be thrown at people in every venue.  The purpose of these amendments is to curb that practice.  I am interested in the Minister of State's views on the practice and on my proposals to curb it.</p></speech>

I support the intention behind them but I do not propose to accept them on the basis that section 23 provides for the Minister for Health of the day to make regulations to address exactly the type of issues being targeted here.  Under that section, the Minister can make regulations to prohibit or restrict the sale of alcohol at a reduced price or giving it free on the purchase of another product or service.  The target here is buy-one-get-one-free offers; selling alcohol at a reduced price for a limited period, defined as three days or less, for a price less than what it cost the day before the limited period; promotions such as happy hours promotions; anything that is intended or likely to encourage those present at a place, other than a private residence, to drink alcohol harmfully; selling alcohol at a reduced price or giving it free in a manner likely to encourage the consumption of alcohol in a harmful way; and advertising or promoting the sale of alcohol in ways that are prohibited or restricted.</p> <p>  The definition of "sell2 under section 2 is comprehensive and includes supplying for the purposes of selling or exposing for sale or distributing free of charge.  The type of promotions being addressed by these amendments are provided for under the Bill with the added flexibility under section 23 that such promotions can be tackled in regulations.  Addressing these concerns by regulation means that we can respond quickly should a new form of promotion arise that had not been previously contemplated.  In addition, I am concerned about the risk of unintended consequences in changing the definition of a term that is used throughout complex legislation such as this Bill.</p> <p>  I support the intention of these amendments but on the basis that the issues of proposing to supply an alcohol product for the purpose of promoting the use of another service and proposing to supply an alcohol product in the purchase of another good or service are dealt with under section 23, which provides the Minister of the day with the power to make regulations to address them, I do not propose to accept the amendments.</p></speech>

I am not necessarily convinced, though I am happy to withdraw at this stage but I reserve the right to resubmit.  The national cancer control programme found that 12% of all breast cancers over the course of a decade in Ireland were associated with alcohol consumption.  This is a serious public health issue.  I am not convinced that measures elsewhere in the Bill will have the effect the Minister of State suggests.</p></speech>

It is proposed that the Minister for Health of the day should also have regard to data from health services relating to alcohol related presentations at health facilities.</p><p>The Bill already provides at section 10(5) that the Minister shall have regard to health-related risks and other societal harms caused by alcohol consumption when determining changes to the minimum unit price.  In addition, it provides that other matters considered appropriate can be taken into account.  The provision as it stands, therefore, allows the Minister for Health to take the following health service databases and research instruments into account in setting the minimum unit price: the Hospital In-Patient Enquiry, HIPE, system, which is a computerised health information system designed to capture hospital activity data - my Department, in association with the ESRI, is engaged with the collection, processing and analysis of inpatient and day patient activity from all public acute hospitals nationally for the HIPE system; the National Self-Harm Registry Ireland, which is a national system of population monitoring for the occurrence of hospital treated self-harm; the Health Research Board, which is the lead agency in Ireland supporting and funding health research and works in collaboration with my Department providing research and an evidence base for alcohol control policies,<i></i>and the Healthy Ireland Survey, which is a self-reported, interviewer-administered survey conducted with individuals aged 15 and over and covers a variety of topics including alcohol consumption.</p><p>As the Bill already provides that the information identified by the Deputy must be considered I do not propose to accept this amendment.</p></speech>

For example, the calorie content in alcohol, which is a health issue.  I would have no objection to the indication on alcoholic beverages of calorie content.  It is recognised that some beverages, including non-alcoholic beverages, have a huge calorie content and that they have a detrimental effect on people's health.  The Minister of State might undertake to consider the matter further as what is provided for in the Bill is not as specific as I would like.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-20a.434" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1436" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018062000002#D01700"><p>I move amendment No. 9:</p><blockquote>In page 13, line 31, after &ldquo;form&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, in both the English and Irish language,&rdquo;.</blockquote> <p>The proposal is that the warnings on the labelling and on premises in the various places envisaged by the Bill would be in English and Irish.  There are various reasons for this, one being cultural in terms of recognition of the Irish language.  In the course of my research on this issue, I reviewed court rulings.  In 2008, a teacher brought the Government to court, insisting that health warnings on cigarette packets be in English and Irish.  The court ruled against the then Minister for Health and the State and, as we all know, cigarette packets now carry warnings in English and Irish.  I support this Bill.  As we know, there will be challenges to it.  For cultural reasons and to recognise the position of the Irish language in the State, taking cognisance of precedents in the courts and to close down potential challenges on labelling, advertising and warnings in licensed premises, I hope this will be accepted.</p></speech>

We are talking about labelling.</p><p>Depending on the amendments made on Committee Stage, labelling will be prescribed by the Minister.  In principle I support the amendments but I have a question from a practical point of view.  Will Deputy Donnelly agree to hold this off until Report Stage?  My suggestion is purely on the basis that it would give the Minister of State time to come back with details on how this will happen practically.  If we are going to have labelling in Irish and English, what scale of label are we going to have across the various products?</p><p> I hope that the process by which this could be done would involve the warning on some versions of products in English and on some versions in Irish rather than potentially having both.  We need to consider the size and scale of the label.  If everything has to be bilingual it would be a concern with regard to costs and overheads for producers.  The Minister of State may not have the relevant practical information.  I support the idea in principle but I would like to hear practically how it would be transposed.  The Minister of State may need time to sort this out before Report Stage.  That is simply my suggestion for Deputy Donnelly.</p></speech>

I am making my remarks less out of concern for the producers, as echoed by others, and more out of concern for the message.  It is vital that the label conveys the message.  My fear is that in a bilingual context the print would shrink to the point where the message would be lost.  We absolutely support bilingual labelling in all of this for all the reasons outlined.  Obviously, that is important.  However, it is equally important that the message contained therein &ndash; I am going for the first pun of this session &ndash; is not watered down in any way.</p></speech>

The amendments to sections 12(1), 12(4) and 12(5) propose that the health warning and the information required on the label of alcohol products and notices in licensed premises and on websites where alcohol products are sold should be in both English and Irish.</p> <p>  I am conscious that to achieve the objective of the Bill the provisions must be workable.  A balance must be maintained between what is beneficial to the health of the consumer and the obligation placed on commercial operators.  It is also important that the health information being provided on the label clearly conveys the message to the consumer.</p> <p>  In August 2015 research was commissioned by Amarach Research on alcohol labelling to provide recommendations on labelling of alcohol products and on communicating critical information regarding the health and social risk of drinking alcohol.  The research found that the inclusion of messaging in the Irish language served to confuse the message.  The health warning and information required under this section provides a unique opportunity to communicate health promotion messages directly to consumers.  This is the first time that such information will be provided to the Irish consumer.  I want to maximise the impact for the amount of space usable on the label.</p> <p>  The case of tobacco warnings as a result of an EU directive that require the warning to be in all languages of countries does not apply.  I have before me the report from Amarach Research on alcohol labelling &ndash; all 200 pages of it.  It is available for any member of the committee who seeks a copy.  I do not propose to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

I am sorry to hear that.  I acknowledge that the Minister of State is reading out the response on behalf of the Minister.</p> <p>  The Minister and I discussed this.  The clear understanding he gave me was not what the Minister of State has read out.  My clear understanding was that we would discuss it and that it would be acknowledged and that I would withdraw the amendment to give the Minister time to bring in something that was checked.  It is regrettable, having had that conversation with the Minister, Deputy Harris, that the position now being laid out is entirely to the contrary.  The Minister of State is dismissing it on multiple grounds.</p> <p>  I was willing to withdraw it based on a conversation I had with the Minister.  Clearly, that position has changed.  As such, I am no longer willing to withdraw it and will press the amendment.</p></speech>

If the contents of the label are so small it could detract from the message we are trying to get across.  Having heard the contribution of Deputy Donnelly I will reflect on it now.

We are all representatives of the Irish people and, therefore, the Irish language is important.  However, there is a practical issue.  I had discussions with the Minister separately.

I welcome the amendment being put forward by the Minister of State on labelling.  It is a practical amendment, like the amendment put forward by Deputy Sherlock on the size of the label, and I support it.  The other amendments are not being pushed on the basis that the provisions in the Bill already deal with the issues relating to multiple health warnings on one label.</p><p>Following on from discussions Deputy Sherlock and I had with the Minister in recent days, we are satisfied that the provisions being brought forward and the practical measures by which he is going to implement them satisfies the requirements.  We can also discuss it again on Report Stage.  On the basis of the changes the Minister is introducing and his practical implementations we will not press the amendments.  We will also support the Minister's amendment.</p></speech>

We could be here all day discussing the links, which are established.  This is a serious public health issue.  As a committee we need to send a very clear message with regard to labelling.  I am happy at this stage that we can proceed on the basis that the Minister is indicating via his amendment that there will be warning labels.  I put on record that the warning labels must be stark.  They must fulfil their purpose, be informative and let people know exactly what is involved and what the dangers are.  The Minister has indicated that we will have further discussions on the issue but I wish to record my dissatisfaction with the fact that a newspaper has suggested we will take a step back on a matter of public health that we are discussing.</p></speech>

It is very important that we as a committee are very clear on the link between cancer and alcohol, and that any labelling is not just tokenism but is very stark, clear, unambiguous and fit for purpose, and that the information is clear to people looking at bottles rather than just box ticking.  I support Deputy O'Reilly's comments on the link between alcohol and cancer on labels and that we would not dilute the message in any way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-20a.465" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018062000002#F00400"><p>I agree with the two previous speakers.  A health committee must be very careful about what it says and does and what message it sends out in terms of adherence to good practice.  The issue that has arisen in this particular case concerns the space devoted to warning people who might consume alcohol.  That is understandable.  I presume Irish products are no more carcinogenic than products from the United States, France or any other country in Europe or outside it.  The worry is that perhaps the impression might be given abroad that Irish products are particularly harmful when other products constitute a similar threat.  We accept that warnings are required on labelling but we must be sure that goods imported into this country by competitors carry the same level of warning and I am not certain we can enforce that.</p> <p>  I have not gone through the directives and even though I can remember most things I do not remember the detail of the relevant one off the top of my head.  It is sad.  I agree in principle but I add a note of caution on the inherent danger.  It is a bit like the proposal for a capital transaction tax.  It is great if everybody does it.  I have no problem with that at all.  If it is done by everybody right across the board, including for imported goods, we are then on an even footing.  However, if it is only applicable to us in this jurisdiction, notwithstanding the directive, then we could place ourselves at a disadvantage.  All in all, I am supportive of the health element of the proposal as referred to by my colleagues.</p></speech>

The scientific evidence is compelling in this regard.  It is very welcome that the amendments are not being moved.  I acknowledge that.  It is important that we as a committee hold that line.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-20a.467" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1307" speakername="Catherine Byrne" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018062000002#F00700"><p>I am responding to amendments Nos. 10, 13, 15 and 19 to 25, inclusive.  Opposition amendments Nos. 10, 13 and 20 propose the removal of the amendments to the labelling and advertising provisions made in Seanad &Eacute;ireann which inserted a warning on the direct link between alcohol and fatal cancers.  Amendment No. 10 proposes to remove this warning from the labels of products.  Amendment No. 13 proposes its removal from the notice on licensed premises and amendment No. 20 proposes to remove the warning from advertisements.</p> <p>  At the time of the introduction of the cancer warnings in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, the Minister for Health expressed the view that having a specific warning for cancer could create a hierarchy of diseases and potentially have the effect of implying that other equally serious conditions are less important.  The original intention of the health warnings provision was to ensure that consumers are informed of the generality of health risks associated with alcohol and not to highlight one particular risk.</p> <p>  Since that time the measure of including a cancer warning on labels was assessed at EU level under Regulation No. 1169 of 2011 on the provision of food information to consumers.  On 2 May the European Commission communicated its decision that it was not issuing a negative opinion on the provision.  A negative opinion would have effectively blocked the provision from being enacted.  As no negative opinion was issued there is no block at EU level to this measure being enacted.  The Commission response stated that it would further assess this issue when the draft regulations on the format of the warning are submitted to it.</p> <p>  The purpose of this measure is to provide health information to the consumer on the link between alcohol and fatal cancers.  It is no more than that.  The result of the provision will be that consumers will be made aware of the settled international scientific consensus that there is a link between alcohol and cancers and he or she can make a decision on that basis.</p> <p>  Rather than discussing why we should introduce this measure perhaps the real questions is why should we as consumers not know about the direct link between alcohol and fatal cancers.  The 2016 Healthy Ireland survey found that only 21% of respondents were aware of the link between alcohol and breast cancer when drinking more than the recommended number of standard drinks and only 16% of women between the ages of 15 and 24 knew of it.  Only 40% knew of the risk in relation to bowel cancer.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 13 proposes to delete the reference to the link with cancer on the notices that will be placed on premises which sell alcohol in reusable containers such as by the glass in an on-licensed premises.  I do not see why the consumer who buys alcohol by the glass should not have access to the same information as one who buys it in a labelled container.  Amendment No. 20 removes the warning from advertisements.  The provisions on advertising are designed so that consumers can make informed choices about drinking alcohol but also to ensure that advertisements for alcohol products will no longer be able to portray alcohol as being entirely positive and risk free.</p><p>Billions of euro have been spent each year on the advertising of alcohol and research demonstrates it is effective.  As legislators, we have the responsibility to balance the risk-free messaging in advertising with factual information about its risks.  For these reasons I do not propose to accept the amendments.</p><p> Deputy Durkan spoke about competition and this will apply to all products sold in the State and will not apply to any products intended for sale outside the State.  There will be no case where an Irish product will be required to have such information and compete with products manufactured elsewhere.  Deputy Kelly dealt with labelling with cancer warnings.  As Minister of State with responsibility for health promotion I know it is very important to communicate to members of the public the proven harm that alcohol can cause to health and that the wide range of serious illnesses caused by alcohol includes cancer.  I also acknowledge the work of the Irish Cancer Society on this matter.  Members of the Opposition may push an amendment to remove the cancer warning but it can be dealt with again on Report Stage if the amendment is withdrawn.  In the meantime I will speak to the Minister about this again.  I do not know if that would be helpful.</p></speech>

It is not about airport pubs but rather in "duty-free", although sales are not always duty-free.  It is about sales on the air side of security for someone getting on a plane.  The thinking is we want to see the best of both worlds.  We must meet our public health obligations and the proposal is for that to be done in the same way as has been accepted for licensed premises.  At the same stage, we want to ensure the Irish product leaving the country is competing on a level playing field.  The proposal relates to what the legislation refers to as a "tax-free shop".  It is essentially on the air side of security for somebody getting on a plane.  The sales in those areas would have exactly the same warnings as have been deemed appropriate for licensed premises in the State.</p></speech>

If we are going to take our obligations seriously, we need to back labelling and warnings, no matter where the alcohol is being sold.  There is no difference between a unit of alcohol sold other than air side versus that sold on the air side.  This is a public health measure and we must be open about the health risks.  This should hold regardless of where the alcohol is sold.</p></speech>

It is practical and something we were drafting ourselves to be tabled on Report Stage.  We are happy with the amendment being put forward.  This is a health committee and we must take cognisance of requirements and our duty relating to health issues arising from alcohol use.  I share the sentiments of my colleagues in that respect but we must also be practical in how this exercise would have an impact.  Given the industry we have and the volume of jobs around the country, about which all of us should be conscious, this is a practical amendment and it deserves to be considered and supported.</p></speech>

This provision echoes the approach to that taken to licensed premises in the Bill selling products that do not have a label.  However, there is a significant difference.  It is fair to say that we are all likely to spend more time in a restaurant or pub than in an airport shop.  The time spent in a licensed premises means that the message on the notice has more time to attract our attention, once or several times, and perhaps even encourage discussions on its contents with those around us.  There is no similarity between this and an airport, which for the majority of consumers is a place that we are passing through in a hurry with an eye on a flight time.</p> <p>  One of the strengths of this provision as it currently stands is that no unfair competition is created within the State.  Every retailer in the State must sell products with the health information on them and they are not forced to compete with another retailer who does not have to have this information on its stock.  It will undermine the fairness of the provisions if retailers in airports are allowed to sell products without that information on the product.  Finally I do not wish to introduce any unnecessary complexity for suppliers that deal strictly with the domestic market.  The provision as it stands requires that all products sold in the State must have health information.  I see no reason to introduce a further requirement that suppliers will have to distinguish between products for airports and products for other retail outlets in the State.  For these reasons I do not propose to accept these amendments.  In light of this morning's debate, I am prepared to suggest that the Deputies can revisit this on Report Stage if that is of any help.</p></speech>

It is the second amendment I have discussed.</p><p>It is the second time I was given an assurance by the Minister for Health and the second time that it would appear, notwithstanding an additional sentence at the end of the Minister of State's response, that the assurances I was given have not translated into the committee room.  It is deeply regrettable because we need to be able to have conversations in good faith with the Government.  On that basis, I do not accept the Government's position.  I think it is an absolutist position.  Were we not to accept that we were meeting our public health obligations by following exactly what we are doing in licensed premises, then we are clearly not meeting our public health obligations in licensed premises.  Either the regulations applied to licensed premises work or they do not.  The idea that a sign works in a pub but does not work in a shop is ludicrous.  One can either read a sign and impart information from it or one cannot.  The idea that there is a certain number of times one has to walk past the sign, the idea that one has to be in the proximity of the words for a particular amount of time before understanding what those words say is patently ridiculous.  It is absolute nonsense.  On the basis that the arguments being put forward by the Government are ludicrous and regrettably for a second time in a row are at odds with undertakings I have been given, I will be pressing amendment No. 18.</p></speech>

This requirement was provided for in an amendment to the Bill that was accepted on Report Stage in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I note other Deputies have also proposed removal of this provision.  I am proposing to remove it as a result of its assessment by the European Commission.</p><p>The provision was assessed under Directive EU 2015/1535, laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical regulations and of rules on information society services.  That assessment examined the provision in the context of Article 34 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  Article 34 prohibits a legislative measure which has an equivalent effect to a quantitative restriction on imports.  Member states are allowed by Article 36 of the treaty to enact such a measure for the protection of health only if it can be shown that the measure is proportionate.  To be proportionate, a measure must not go beyond what is necessary in order to attain its objective.</p><p>In its comments on the requirement that at least one third of the size of the printed material on the alcohol product be given over to evidence-based health warnings, the European Commission said that it was not proportionate.  It is the Commission's view that the objective of the protection of health through provision of health warnings on alcohol products could be met by a lesser restriction, such as a requirement that the health warning be of a smaller, yet visible, size.  The purpose of providing for health warnings on alcohol products is to make us all aware of the health risks associated with alcohol so that we can make an informed choice.  If those warnings are visible, then the objective is achieved.  The requirement that a proportion of the printed material be given over to such a warning does on the face of it go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives.  It might prove very difficult for Ireland to defend the measure in the Court of Justice of the European Union.  For this reason I propose to remove this requirement and, as was the original intent of the Bill, provide for the forms of warnings on labels to be determined in regulations to be made under section 12(10)(a).</p></speech>

The warning will not take up one third of the space on bottles.  That would have been over the top.  If we were to go to that extreme, we would be better off just telling people that the products being sold were poison and should not be consumed at all.  We need to impose a health warning so that every person consuming the product knows that it has certain side effects.  Food irradiation has similar effects, but we have no warnings on our fruit, vegetables and so on yet.</p> <p>  How will this system work in practice and will it achieve the intended outcome?

They already have a requirement to label different products for different markets, so I am not sure this would be as onerous as we imagine.  Equally, those from outside the State who wish to sell in the State will have to comply with our rules, however that happens.  My understanding is that can happen in a variety of ways.  Either labelling can be done where the product is manufactured or the distributors can attach an additional label, which is the case with other products.  A multiplicity of labels for different markets already exists within the industry.  We simply would be requiring a specific label for this State.  The hope is that we will be a leading light and other countries will eventually take our lead, which would make the requirement significantly less onerous as one label became more useful in more countries.  While I respect the concerns echoed by Deputy Durkan, I am not sure they are as significant in a practical sense as we might imagine.</p></speech>

The provision relates to one third of the printed material.  Many medical products use concertina labels, so something could be a part of the label without actually being seen.  It is hidden in a little envelope of sorts on the side.  We should be conscious of that and ensure that "one third of labelling" means "one third of visible labelling" rather than "one third of total labelling on the bottle".</p> <p>  The idea that putting a label on a bottle is a massive job and has a significant cost is almost like saying there is someone going around with a roll of labels sticking them on each bottle.  It is a cheap and simple thing to do, but it is being beefed up into something far greater.  We can get this to work for imported medicines with overlabelling, so I cannot see any barrier to doing the same in respect of alcohol.  We are labelling for the Irish people and the Irish market, and we do not need to be overly concerned about other countries' behaviour.  With the smoking ban, we were the leading country.  As Deputy O'Reilly mentioned, we could be the lead in this respect as well and other countries could follow suit.</p> <p>  I do not ever want to fall out with Deputy Durkan, but the irradiation of food having a similar carcinogenic effect as alcohol is just a little bit of a sweeping statement for the health committee on a Wednesday morning.</p></speech>

If that is what it is, then so be it, but I would like to hear more about what is being done to ensure the health warnings nonetheless remain prominent.  Alcohol is more carcinogenic than most people in the State and around the world realise.  I have been reading up on the evidence, which is stark.  If the Government is removing the one third stipulation, how does it intend to ensure the public will be still aware of the health implications?</p></speech>

There will be an identification of calories on the label.  There will be also a link about alcohol and health issues pointing to the HSE website at the bottom of the label.</p> <p>  As to the question of who is responsible for the health labelling of alcohol products, the Department sought legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General so that we might be able to give Deputies a comprehensive response.  The offence under the Bill relates to selling alcohol products within the State without the required warning and information.  Any person who sells an alcohol product without the required warning and information can be prosecuted under the section.  The range of persons who can be prosecuted includes wholesalers, manufacturers and retailers.  If a product is manufactured in the State without the required labelling information and products are sold to a retailer or wholesaler in the State, the manufacturer can be prosecuted.  The wholesaler and retailer also may be prosecuted if they sell the product on without the required labelling.  It is not an offence to import for sale in the State an alcohol product that does not bear the required information and warning.  However, a person who imports an alcohol product that does not have the required labelling and sells the product within the State without affixing the required information and warning will be prosecuted.</p> <p>  Regarding Deputy Donnelly's question, this will be done by way of regulations, which will have to include a provision that labelling will be visible.  I have no idea how the label will appear until those regulations are in place.  I am sure the questions of what the label looks like, how it will be positioned and how the contents will be visible will be subject to scrutiny, but people should not have to bring magnifying glasses with them to the supermarket just to read the labelling.  This matter will be addressed in the regulations.</p></speech>

It is a step in the right direction.  The label has to serve its purpose and be visible.  The original intent was for the label to draw attention to the fact that the product contained something deleterious to a person's health.</p><p>However, in the circumstances, the best that can be done is to make the warning available so that it can be read.  Incidentally, not all warnings and ingredients labelling on products sold throughout the country at the present time are visible.  Perhaps they are visible if one has a microscope.  The rule concerning one third of the labelling was designed to make the printed information on products sufficiently large to be able to see it in all kinds of circumstances.  The fact that there is a warning needs to draw attention to the health issues involved.  </p><p> I agree entirely with the proposal and hope that it will comply with EU law.  I am told that the EU has indicated that it will, but one never knows.  The proposal, if enacted, can be challenged, as can all legislation.</p></speech>

It is not just a public health measure but also a child protection measure.  All evidence suggests that the earlier a person is initiated into alcohol consumption, the greater the likelihood of negative alcohol-related outcomes later in life.  As such, one of the key aims of alcohol policy should be to delay that initiation into drinking among young people.  Many of the measures in this Bill are targeted at that.  For example, alcohol-related merchandise will not be sold in sizes suitable for children under this Bill, which is a good idea.  However, the prohibition on outdoor advertising within 200 m of schools, while welcome, suggests that children only exist within the school environment.  They have to come and go from school, they socialise and they live in communities.  Where there is outdoor advertising, it is not possible to simply shield the eyes of the child.  It does not work like that.  The logic is that advertising will not be permitted within 200 m but will be allowed within 201 m.  If we are serious about this it has to be more than a simple box-ticking exercise.  Concrete measures must be taken on child protection.</p><p>The second amendment defines a &quot;public place&quot;.  If the purpose of the Bill is child protection and protection of public health, these amendments should be given serious consideration.</p></speech>

They would result in an effective prohibition on all outdoor advertising.  This is the first time that alcohol has been legislated for as a public health measure and that the advertising of alcohol has been addressed from a public health perspective.  As a first step in restricting the advertising of alcohol products outdoors, it was considered appropriate to target the restrictions at areas most frequented by children and young people.  The Bill, therefore, provides that a person shall not advertise, or cause the advertisement of an alcohol product in a park or open space owned or maintained by a local authority or the Office of Public Works, OPW; in or on a public service vehicle; in or on a train or on a light rail vehicle; in or at a train or bus station; at a designated bus or Luas stop, in or at a school, including its grounds, or within 200 m of the perimeter of the grounds; in or at a place where an early years service is carried on or within 200 m of its perimeter; or in or at a playground owned or maintained by a local authority or within 200 m of the perimeter of such playground.</p> <p>  Section 21 provides that there must be a review of all the advertising provisions within three years of the commencement of that section.  The issue of advertising restrictions will be revisited as part of this review.  I do not propose, therefore, to accept the amendments.</p></speech>

A balance has to be struck.  One place where advertising is not being prohibited is on the hoarding around pitches.  If we take Deputy O'Reilly's comments on board, it means bringing young children to a match where, for 90 minutes or two hours, they are essentially staring at alcohol advertising that is wrapped around the pitch.  That is not being taken out by the Bill as it is.  I would like to be able to bring children to a match without them having to stare at hoardings that are advertising alcohol.  Is there any provision to review the regulations around advertising in the future?</p></speech>

Section 21 provides that all of the advertising provisions must be reviewed within three years of the commencement of the section.  However, the Minister for Health of the day can review any provisions in any Bill as time goes on.  That is very much what the Bill is about.  There are restrictions.  Perhaps they are not what we all want.  I refer particularly to football grounds.  There will be no advertising painted on the pitch but there will be advertisements around the exterior of the pitch.</p></speech>

We should do our best.  We need to be mindful and cautious at the same time that even doing our best will not be enough to eliminate all exposure to advertising of that or any other nature.  There is sufficient evidence from experiences over the past number of years that children are being exposed to promotional material of an alcoholic and non-alcoholic nature that is not beneficial to them or their future well-being.  We need to be cautious and recognise there may be more measures we can and should take in these areas to protect children from damage now and in the future.  We need to recognise the issues, not only those relating to alcohol, and that we should consider them at the same time because they have an equally detrimental and serious effect on the well-being of children.  I agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy O'Reilly but I caution that we may have to revisit other areas.  We have no control over advertising and aspects of social media.  Advertising is a broad description.  This is an issue in other areas.  I would like to know the ministerial view on that.  As a former spokesperson on communications, when there was discussion on how the Internet and cyberspace would be governed in terms of good practice, I recognised the need to impose penalties on those who breach the rules in a meaningful way.  If we do not do that, we could have a problem down the road.  I support the concept but it is a wider issue and needs re-examined in this and different contexts.</p></speech>

This is a practical first step in the right direction.  It may not tick all the boxes but as we continue, hopefully it will.  A core aim of the Bill is to delay alcohol consumption by children and young people and reduce the harm caused by the misuse of alcohol.  The Bill also has significant relevance to children living in Ireland.  Where a child enters his or her own local shop or garage, he or she will not see alcohol products or alcohol advertising in the general area of the shop.  Clothing intended for wear by children that refers to or promotes an alcohol product will not be manufactured, imported or sold in the State.  When a child watches TV between 3 a.m. and 9 p.m. alcohol advertising will not be aired.  When a child attends an event specifically for children, he or she will be exposed to alcohol images or messages.  When a child attends and age-appropriate film in a cinema, he or she will not be exposed to alcohol advertising.  As a child enters or leaves his or her school or cr&egrave;che, and in the surrounding 200 m, he or she will not be exposed to alcohol images or messages.  When a child plays in a public authority park, he or she will not be exposed to alcohol advertising.  As a child waits for and boards public transport or a school bus, he or she will not be exposed to these images or messages.  These are all clearly stated in the Bill.  It is the Minister's intention that the Bill will address the consumption of alcohol particularly by young people and the difficulties we have in this country with the consumption of alcohol, especially among young people and young adults.</p></speech>

There is evidence that young people are exposed to a huge volume of alcohol advertising and the reason they are is the people who are paying for it believe the advertising works.  Pairing a healthy activity like sport with an unhealthy product such as alcohol is inappropriate.  The earlier a person begins alcohol consumption, the more likely it is he or she will develop harmful drinking patterns.  We also need to address the culture whereby alcohol consumption is closely associated with celebrating sporting success.  We need to break the link between a healthy activity and an unhealthy product.</p><p>This again speaks to much of the intention of the Bill, which concerns child protection, and it is from this perspective we propose this amendment.  The steering group on a national substance abuse strategy recommended that the drinks industry's sponsorship of sporting and other large public events be phased out.  This is therefore not a solo run; it is based on sound evidence and research.</p></speech>

Opposition amendment No. 28 proposes to prohibit sports sponsorship by 31 December 2023.  This topic was examined and debated at length prior to the publication of the Bill.  A consensus could not be reached on a prohibition on sports sponsorship.  There have been many discussions about the pros and cons of banning alcohol sponsorship of sports in Ireland.  The main arguments in favour of a ban have centred around concerns about patterns of alcohol consumption and related harms and the "normalising" of drinking this sponsorship purportedly brings about.  The arguments against such a ban were that the funding gap left by such a move would be extremely difficult to bridge, affecting all levels of sports, including grassroots levels for young people.  There is a lack of specific evidence that such a ban would be effective.  During discussions with the Joint Committee on Health and Children at the time, the then Minister, now Taoiseach, indicated that in the medium term a ban on alcohol sponsorship was not realistic.  Therefore, as a beginning, the measures in the Bill aim to restrict the alcohol advertising permitted at sporting events and the sponsorship of events in which the majority of participants or competitors are children, events aimed particularly at children or events involving the driving or racing of motor vehicles.  The Bill provides at section 21 that there must be a review of all the advertising provisions within three years of the commencement of that section.  The issue of sports sponsorship will be revisited as part of this review.  For these reasons, I do not propose to accept these amendments.</p></speech>

The evidence is there.  The steering group on a national substance abuse strategy found that there was evidence and the GAA has moved to ban gambling sponsorship.  Clearly, therefore, there is evidence to support this as a proportionate measure.  If we are to discuss issues of child protection, we need to discuss with what children being exposed to this form of advertising will associate alcohol consumption.  Serious consideration needs to be given to this.  It is not true to say the evidence does not exist.  The evidence is out there and is more than ample at this stage.</p></speech>

There are issues surrounding children, their exposure to alcohol in general and celebratory events, to which Deputy O'Reilly has already referred, at which alcohol and other products are readily available, the combination of which is seriously deleterious to children's health and well-being.  It is no harm to bear in mind the effects.  I do not intend to enumerate them but I do feel there needs to be a separate warning in respect of events of a particular nature in any event, even if this legislation were to cover them.  I can think of a number of celebratory events in which young people naturally get involved and which they have reason to celebrate, but there needs to be some control over the extent to which the celebrations go.  Numerous events have been brought to our attention over the years whereby, with the benefit of hindsight, we can say that if they did not happen, there might have been different outcomes, not tragic outcomes.  We can visualise in our minds the broad spectrum of events this encompasses.  They are many and varied, and I do not want to identify any of them specifically at this stage, other than to say it is no harm to bear them in mind.  The public health warning can go a certain distance and achieve a certain amount, but not necessarily always, to alert the young person to the danger of particular circumstances and events.</p></speech>

As I said previously, the Bill represents the very first time in this country that we have been at this stage.  I understand the circumstances surrounding the use of alcohol and other substances, particularly in respect of the other hat I wear as Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy.  I understand the combination of alcohol and drugs and what it can do.  There are provisions within the Bill concerning children and sporting or track and field events, and even swimming pools, such that children cannot be exposed to alcohol advertising.  We are taking a real step in the right direction with this Bill.  In the future I am sure there will be other opportunities for Deputies from all sides to come back again on the Bill.  As I said, this is a matter of changing a culture and looking at how we advertise.  Most of all, it is a matter of informing young adults and younger children in particular about the health issues surrounding the consumption of alcohol.  The Bill is a very first step in the right direction.  It might not tick all the boxes, but we are where we are, and it is time we approached the matter in a cohesive manner whereby we have co-operation between people to progress the Bill.</p></speech>

In addition, the amendment corrects a printing error that occurred between the Bill as initiated and its reprinting on Committee Stage in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Finally, it redrafts the provision for clarity.  Subsection (6) of section 18 relates to a publication that is published by or on behalf of the holder of an off-licence where such a publication is intended to promote the sale of alcohol products in the off-licensed premises.  As set out in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill as initiated, it was intended that such publications would be exempted from certain requirements of section 18 in recognition that they are of a special category.  The intention was to exempt such publications from the prohibitions in section 18(2) on alcohol advertisements on the front and back cover of a publication and on any wrapper or other covering in which they are contained.</p><p>In addition, it was intended to exempt them from prohibition in section 18(3) on the importation of publications which have more than 20% of their advertising space given over to alcohol advertisements or which contain advertisements in breach of section 18(2).  The provision, as currently drafted, does not reflect the policy intentions owing to a failure to update references when a proposed subsection was removed from section 18(2) of the Bill as initiated; a failure to update references when an amendment to section 18(3)(<i>c</i>) in Seanad &Eacute;ireann split the subsection into section 18(3)(<i>c</i>) and section 18(3)(<i>d</i>); and a printing error which replaced the reference to subsection (3)(<i>c</i>) with a reference to subsection (3).<br/><br/>I am making no policy changes with this amendment and its sole purpose is to reflect what was intended and set out in the Bill as initiated.  This amendment will mean that under section 18(6), in respect of a publication which is published by or on behalf of an off-licence holder for the purposes of promoting the sale of products in the premises, the prohibition from publishing a publication in which more than 20% of the advertising space is used for the advertisement of alcohol products in section 18(1) should not apply, the prohibition in section 18(2) on alcohol advertisements on the front and back cover or on any covering or wrapping of a publication shall not apply and the prohibitions in section 18(3) on importing a publication in which more than 20% of the advertising space is being used for advertisement of alcohol products or on importing a publication which contains an advertisement that contravenes section 18(2) shall not apply.  I hope that makes sense.  </p></speech>

This agreement was negotiated on behalf of Ireland by a team comprising officials from my Department, who are with me, experts from Ireland's astronomical academics and industrial representatives.</p><p> As members are no doubt aware, the agreement was the culmination of several months of intense work and collaboration between the team and the European Southern Observatory, ESO, representatives.</p><p> The Government committed to initiate negotiations with ESO for Ireland&rsquo;s membership as an action in Innovation 2020, Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for research and development, science and technology.  As part of a study commissioned in 2015, ESO was identified as a pivotal international research organisation, posing significant benefits to Ireland.</p><p> International co-operation in research and innovation plays an important role in the development and sustainability of a world class research and innovation system.  International co-operation maximises the impact of international and national investment in research and innovation and develops international relations.  Membership of ESO will help develop Ireland&rsquo;s global footprint and support international relations with other members of the organisation and, in particular, with the host nation for the telescopes, Chile.</p><p> Benefits of ESO membership are significant, primarily that Irish researchers will be afforded an opportunity to work with facilities that would never be possible for Ireland to achieve alone.  The skills that will be developed by students and researchers, such as high volume data analytics, photonics and software education, are advanced and industry relevant.  In addition, Irish companies will be fully eligible to receive contracts from ESO, covering all business areas from provision of services to technical studies and delivery of advanced equipment.</p><p> The terms of Ireland&rsquo;s membership are based on the ESO Convention and Protocols, our negotiations were focused mainly on the financial contributions.  A special deal was tabled by ESO during initial discussions in 2016 with the previous director general.  This deal would calculate Ireland&rsquo;s membership based on 2017 prices rather than 2018.  The deal was secured by the negotiating team resulting in a saving of just under &euro;400,000.  As Ireland is joining in the final quarter of 2018, the cost for this year is &euro;0.75 million, increasing to &euro;3.46 million for next year, subject to indexation.</p><p> I am aware that several members have a keen interest in Ireland&rsquo;s membership of international research organisations and the development of our research and innovation capabilities.  I welcome the members' interest and encourage continued engagement with them.  I would, however, remind members that this committee is to discuss the terms and conditions of ESO membership.  Ireland has taken significant steps in recent years in achieving membership of Elixir, LOFAR and now ESO, as per our commitments in Innovation 2020. </p><p> I thank the select committee for affording me this time.  I am happy to take any questions.</p></speech>

The Sinn F&eacute;in Party will be supporting the motion.  We are very happy to support this great move by the Minister of State as we believe it will benefit indigenous companies in the sector that will be able to bid for contracts from ESO.  We also recognise the significant benefits and opportunities that membership will bring to the academic, scientific and research communities.  This is a positive move and it is something we are keen to see more of, in particular with CERN.  I convey Sinn F&eacute;in's support for the Minister of State's proposal in this regard.</p> <p>  Will the Minister of State outline the value of the contracts that will be available to Irish companies each year as a result of our membership of the European Southern Observatory?  What type of opportunities in the fields of research or study will come from our membership of ESO?  Will Irish membership give us decision-making power in ESO?</p> <p>  I understand the special contribution fee of &euro;14.66 million will be paid over a period of 11 years.  I do not have a problem with that.  Do the other member countries pay the same amount?  Is the special contribution an additional fee to the cost of yearly membership?  How much is yearly membership?  Does the Minister of State anticipate that it might increase in the coming years?  If the fee increases, how will it be worked out?  In the unlikely event that we need to leave the organisation, how is that facilitated?  Sinn F&eacute;in raised CERN in its pre-budget submission for the 2018 budget and will do so for budget 2019.  Is there an update on the position in regard to becoming a member of CERN?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-20a.624" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1351" speakername="John Halligan" time="16:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JES2018062000002#B00400"><p>I will deal with the cost.  Some previous reports had indicated greater savings based on the accession calculation for 2017.  However, this was not based on the gross domestic product, GDP, nor net national income, NNI, which is the figure  on which ESO calculates member states' rates.  While Ireland's GDP increased significantly in 2015, the NNI did not reflect the same dramatic increase.  We have been very lucky in a sense in that we have been able to negotiate a good deal up to 2028, which is a reasonable deal compared to other states.  Some 15 member states have joined ESO for good reason.  We had come under immense pressure, and rightly so, from people such as the Deputy and others who are very interested in research and development and have a great knowledge of it that we should join these organisations.</p> <p>  Ireland will have two seats on the ESO Council - one will be taken by an astronomer and the other by a Government representative.  We will also have a representative on the financial committee, which is important, and on the science and technology committee.  We will also have an industrial liaison officer.  The nomination process for these posts is under way.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the industrial return, which is measured through the ratio of expenditure in each member state and the percentage contribution to the budget spent on certain categories of contracts.  Big consortia, such as IBM, InnaLabs, SensL, NASA, SGroup, Openet, ESA and Technology Ireland, have been advocating that we join.  We are one of the few countries in western Europe which is not a member of ESO and we are missing out in many ways in disciplines such as astronomy.  Let me remind members that Ireland has a great history in astronomy.  At one stage, we had the biggest telescope in the world, located in Birr Castle.  There is an interesting statistic that, as a percentage of the population, there are more members of Astronomy Ireland than there are of other such organisations in any other country in the world.  If one looks at the telescope we opened, the I-LOFAR telescope in Birr, which is one of the biggest telescopes in the world, Ireland was chosen because of our astronomers and the knowledge of astronomy.  We will be able to compete for business.  Given the expertise of this community, it is well positioned to avail of opportunities provided by ESO membership.  We will also be able to bid for contracts.  Remember it will take ten years to build the telescopes and that will give an opportunity to some of our top researchers, universities and companies already dealing with the European Space Agency to win contracts.  That is a good win for Ireland.</p></speech>

As we are joining ESO, there is a cost associated with developing that infrastructure.  Based on the membership of ESO and our net national income, our contribution to ESO will be &euro;14.66 million.  As mentioned, we got the opportunity to spread that payment over a period of ten years.  In addition to that special contribution, we will make an annual membership contribution of approximately &euro;2 million.  That means that the cost per year is approximately &euro;3.5 million but, of course, that will be subject to indexation as costs for the organisation rise and as the number of members in ESO change.</p></speech>

Representatives of CERN will come to Ireland in July and we will have a further meeting with them to discuss the prospects of joining CERN.</p> <p>  People may ask why we are joining the European Southern Observatory, ESO, over CERN.  The reason is very simple.  Researchers and developers involved in astronomy in Ireland are regarded very highly and have a considerable impact.  The Department made the decision to join ESO, which I think is the correct decision at this time.</p> <p>  The Deputy is correct, and I have spoken to him on a number of occasion about CERN.  We have to join CERN at some stage.  We will provide a further update to the committee when we meet representatives of CERN in July.  We can apply for full membership, which is expensive, but to be honest, we do not that level of finance available.  There is also a category of associate membership, but the problem with associate membership is that it only gives us 10% of the credits back.  I do not think associate membership is a good deal but my officials will negotiate with CERN in July.  We will keep the members informed of how the negotiations go.  All the members present want Ireland to join CERN and we think we should join it.</p></speech>

I have addressed the Cabinet on the issue of joining ESO, which we think is very important for Ireland, our researchers, our universities and our businesses.  It has been a tough fight for my officials to make sure we join ESO.  We will keep fighting to join CERN.  I would be confident that Ireland will be a member of CERN.</p></speech>

This is an important step forward for Ireland and for the Irish astrophysics community.  I was involved in this work last year.  I joined the Minister at the switch on of the international LOFAR telescope at Birr Castle.  It was a great day for the astrophysics community.  Some seeds were sown and some processes are in train already.  The Minister and some of us talked at length on how this process might advance.</p> <p>  I pay tribute to people, such as Mr. Joe Hogan who was a great advocate for ESO membership and brought some of his business expertise to the process in terms of making the business case.  Dr. Peter Gallagher is an outstanding astrophysicists, a person we can be proud of in the international science community but based in Trinity College at present.  I know Dr. Gallagher was instrumental in making the case for ESO membership and he explained to me and many others the many benefits that would flow from it and how it would benefit the community and the level of access they would have to the equipment, facilities and research data available through ESO.</p> <p>  I also attended the astrophysics conference in Maynooth last year, where the key note subject on the agenda was whether we would join the ESO.  I know there was delight in the community when it was announced on budget day that we were to join.  I am delighted that we are ratifying this.  Deputy Quinlivan asked enough questions and covered any questions I had.  This is a really positive development and I am delighted to support it.</p> <p>  I know we will not diverge into it, because the topic under discussion is the European Southern Observatory, but since we have introduced the topic of CERN to the debate, I would like to see Ireland joining all the international consortia and research collaborations because we get so much back.  Each of these groups and each of the associations have a multiplier effect.  When I joined the Minister of State at the European Space Agency, about 18 months ago now, we learned about the 7:1 multiplier effect, so that for every euro invested in space technology and the space agency, one gets &euro;7 back, between contracts awarded, research opportunities and study opportunities.  The same goes for ESO, which we are ratifying today, and for CERN.  In CERN the figure is more in the range of 3:1 or 4:1, depending on how one calculates it.  There is a significant opportunity.  I welcome the Minister of State's comments and I know from private and public discussions of his interest and commitment in the matter, so I look forward to progressing it.</p> <p>  I understand completely the argument about why full membership of CERN is preferable to associate membership, but it might be worth looking at the Israeli model.  What Israel has done is to go down the path where one has a higher level than associated membership and one gets between 25% to 30% back, above the 10% back that one gets as an associate member and one is on a fast track to full membership.  That might be a model to look at.  I understand the budgetary constraints but I am delighted the Minister of State and the Department are committed to that course of action.  We will have to try to find ways around budgetary constraints but I look forward to next year or the year after when the committee will be in a position to join CERN.  I hope it will happen sooner rather than later.</p></speech>

We chose to join ESO.  We will meet representatives of CERN, as the Deputy said, in July and we will see whether we can negotiate a deal with it.  As I said, and at the risk of repeating myself, we are all anxious - I am more anxious than anybody - to join CERN.  We should do so, but right now we are in a very difficult financial situation in terms of trying to leverage more money to join CERN in this fiscal year.  We will not be able to do it.  As Deputy Lawless said, it is possible that we may be able to do a deal with CERN-----</p></speech>

Ireland has an option, provided for in Article 3.1 of Protocol 21 annexed to the Treaty of Lisbon, to opt-in to individual proposals in the area of freedom, security and justice.  The protocol provides that Ireland has three months, from the date a proposal or initiative is presented to the Council, to notify the Presidency of the Council in writing of its wish to take part in the negotiation, adoption and application of any such measure.  The three-month period for this proposal is due to end on 16 August.  The exercise of this opt-in is subject to the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  </p> <p>  Ireland can also accept a proposal at any time after it has been adopted, but in such a case, it will not have been in a position to vote on the final content of the proposal.  It must also be noted that Ireland made a declaration appended to the Treaty of Lisbon of its intention to opt-in to measures in the area of freedom, security and justice to the maximum extent it deems possible.</p> <p>  This proposal, as published, has a number of key elements relating to the fourth and fifth anti-money laundering directives.  These include: access to the bank account registries to be set up under the fifth anti-money laundering directive, by the competent authorities in each member state responsible for law enforcement, and in Ireland's case this will probably be the financial investigation unit, FIU, and the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB; the sharing of information by the FIU with other law enforcement competent authorities in Ireland; an exchange of information between FIUs of different member states; access by Europol to bank account information and exchange of information between Europol and FIUs; and procedures and data protection safeguards relating to the exchange of information processes to be created.  My officials have consulted the Office of the Attorney General.  They have been advised that there is no legal impediment to Ireland opting into this proposal. </p> <p>  While the proposal broadly reflects existing law and practice in Ireland, both the financial investigation unit and the Criminal Assets Bureau have indicated to my officials that this proposal, as part of the broader anti-money laundering framework, will further enhance the effectiveness of the fight against money laundering, terrorist financing and associated predicate offences in providing for increased co-operation in a timely manner between FIUs, law enforcement authorities, including Europol, and other competent authorities.</p></speech>

However, I wish Members to note that the secretariat was not sent a copy of his statement prior to the meeting so Members did not receive it.

I, too, will be similarly brief.</p> <p>  The function of this committee is to give consideration to the directive.  Having read the document that was circulated, I suppose by the Council of European Union, but it was given to us, I would be supportive of us opting in, in respect of this proposal.  Financial crimes have become more complex and multi jurisdictional.  Therefore, we need to constantly upgrade our laws to ensure that we keep up with the people who engage in financial crime.</p> <p>  I have two questions for the Minister on Brexit and realise that they may be difficult to answer.  We must be extremely careful because we have a land border on this island.  Obviously a lot of crime is also perpetrated between Ireland and the UK.  What is the Minister's apprehension, concern or belief as to what will happen in respect of co-operation between the two jurisdictions and the money laundering directives that exist at present, irrespective of this new directive?  Is he satisfied that co-operation will continue with the United Kingdom afterwards?   </p></speech>

While obviously it is difficult for one to predict with certainty what the final outturn of the UK negotiations on the withdrawal or, indeed, the consequent future relationship between the UK and the European Union, in the justice and home affairs area, I must acknowledge an intent, on the part of the UK authorities, as far as possible, to continue with the very high level of co-operation that exists in the security and crime areas.  I would hope that that would continue, notwithstanding.</p> <p>  As I am sure Deputy O'Callaghan will be aware, one of the challenges that we have, in terms of our legal system, will be on the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union.  We will, in all likelihood, be the sole common law member.  That will present a challenge to us.  It is one that we are aware of.  It is one that, in terms of our engagement with our UK colleagues, will in all likelihood give rise to a greater level of concentration on the part of Ireland.  I am sure there will be resource implications too, in terms of our continued participation with EU colleagues, notwithstanding the withdrawal of our colleagues in the common law jurisdiction of the UK.   </p></speech>

My party supports this proposal.  It is absolutely right and true that financial crime of this kind has become more complex and that more resources will be required by the relevant authorities over time.</p> <p>  I was not in a position to participate in the Second Stage debate and Deputy Quinlivan participated on my behalf.  He raised a number of questions but some of them were not answered and these matters relate to the legislation that we are dealing with subsequently.  Today, we are not discussing the legislation.  However, these matters are closely linked to the fourth and fifth anti-money laundering directives and it is better that I ask my questions here rather than speak to amendments.  One question was partially answered but I seek clarity on it and another question was not answered.  The first question was where we raised our concerns about the fact that there is discretion available to member states, in terms of the obligation under Article 31.  The article outlines that states must apply a full public register of beneficial ownerships of trusts, as per the directive.  The Minister, in his response, outlined the fact that the legislation for beneficial ownership registers is being developed by the Department of Finance.  I know that the Minister for Justice and Equality does not have responsibility for that matter but it obvious that there has been some correspondence.  He said that it will apply to special purpose vehicles, that is body corporates.</p><p>Although the list will be initially viewable by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other appropriate authorities, the fifth money-laundering directive provides for wider access to parts of the beneficial ownership information.  He then goes on to state that we will be in full compliance with the fourth and the fifth money-laundering directives.  Can I take it from that that the State is not exercising any discretion in regard to Article 31 but, rather, will apply it in its totality?</p></speech>

However, in terms of access to registers, the intention is that the articles will be transposed in accordance with the fourth directive, which means that there will be access to the companies register by competent authorities, the financial intelligence unit, FIU, and anyone who can show what is termed a legitimate interest.  The FIU and competent authorities will have access to the trust register.  That may be subject to modification, taking account of the further requirements of the fifth directive, which will come into force in late July.</p></speech>

The issue was raised in regard to the gambling sector and the potential for the gambling and bookmaking sector to be used for money laundering.  There is latitude and discretion here.  Does the Government consider that this sector may carry substantial risks?</p></speech>

They are obliged to take all measures under the Act into account, including the ongoing issue of due diligence as regards their relationship with their customers, as required by the directive.  Further legislation to bring other gambling service providers within the scope of the legislation is needed.  That will include sectors that have not been deemed to be low risk and it is currently being prepared by my Department and the Office of the Attorney General.  The committee is aware that broader legislation on gambling is being dealt with by the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, and a broader gambling control Bill is currently under consideration for drafting.  However, the existing gaming clubs are familiar with their obligations and duties under the current legislation.</p></speech>

It is not difficult to imagine that a bookmaker could be used to launder money using a certain combination of bets, although some of the money may be lost.  This area must be considered and the Minister has indicated his intention to do so.  It goes beyond the issue of gambling control.  That is good legislation and must be supported but we must also address this area in the context of the risk of money laundering.  Aside from private member gaming clubs, we must look more broadly at the sector and give that further consideration in ongoing legislation.</p></speech>

It is expected that the directive will come into force 20 days after publication in the <i>Official Journal of the European Union</i>, which is expected by the end of June or early July.

Has the Minister looked at models being implemented in central European countries?  The Netherlands has considered a move towards efinancing of all public services by removing the cash element in order to avoid money laundering.  We need to consider whether we could advance legislative proposals to be ahead of the curve not only in the public sector but also high risk areas such as gambling because money laundering is taking place, in particular in that sector.  That could be done by greater utilisation of efinance such that there is formalised transactional component .  The Department should consider being ahead of the curve on this issue because in ten years time we will be a cashless society.  The world is moving towards paying by mobile and general efinance.  We need progressive legislative measures to help combat money laundering.</p></speech>

The Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance, among others, keep in regular contact in conjunction with their colleagues throughout Europe.  Of course, we at all times seek to comply with best international practice and standards in regard to money laundering.  This fifth directive will further enhance our laws and we are happy to intensively engage with other European countries in order to ascertain best practice.  In the area of gambling specifically referred to by Deputy Chambers, all members of the committee acknowledge that further work must be done in that regard in terms of our domestic legislation I hope that there will be progress on both the legislation and the setting up of an independent regulator this year.</p></speech>

We can be ahead of the curve in terms of international best practice by moving private and public services away from current methods.  Compliance generally would be enhanced by allowing for electronic transactions.  Some European states are conducting pilot projects to which we should have regard.</p><p>We can look at some of the pilots that have happened there.  The Netherlands, for example, is moving most of its public services to electronic transactions, which removes the potential for people who are avoiding tax or are not compliant.  We need to be ahead of the curve on this.  I recognise that the Criminal Assets Bureau has done excellent work but I think the day-to-day transactions need to be focused on too.</p></speech>

There are 200 Border crossings.  The relationship that the Republic of Ireland has with Northern Ireland is great.  A fantastic relationship has been built over the last number of decades with the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI.  Even the Minister, in his former job as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, made connections.  We are talking about prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution.  Every one of those words is a connection that we have between the North and South.  There is much uncertainty there.  I know October will be a very important time, with Brexit and such.  Are we ready for this?  We all know that the UK will eventually leave the EU.  It is important that the EU and Ireland keep this close relationship.  I come from a Border area, as I said.  Over the last few years, there has been a big stop to the criminal activity going in the last decade.  The last thing we want to do is see this happen again.  It is important that we pull all the stops out with the EU and UK and keep it going the way it is.</p></speech>

I recently had the opportunity, visiting the Border area with Deputy Fitzpatrick, to see first-hand the challenges faced by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in a Border area.  As I said earlier in response to Deputy O'Callaghan, we are not in a position now to say with certainty what the final outcome will be.  Suffice to say that there is contingency planning right across the agencies, but in particular with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I met Garda management last week, specifically about its Brexit plan and strategy.  I am satisfied that every effort is being made to ensure that we continue to have the type of relationship between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and PSNI that we currently have and that our laws post-Brexit will be reflective of an intent on the part of both jurisdictions to ensure that criminal activity is not only investigated but prosecuted in a successful manner.</p></speech>

The Chair will be aware from his former career that there are not too many cheque cashing offices in the country.  The role and function of the cheque cashing office did not extend the cashing of a cheque or the exchanging of the cheque for money, in times when people were paid by cheque one day a week and did not have a bank account or access to a bank but used the services of a cheque cashing office.  My understanding is that there are no more than six to eight remaining in the country, one not too far from here.

They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.

We are honoured to be here and feel passionate about the bachelor of arts in visual arts, BAVA, on Sherkin Island, accredited by the Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT.  For those who do not know, Sherkin Island is known internationally and locally as the "Island of the Arts".  The BAVA programme is a key driver in the island's economy.  It is a grassroots initiative taken by the island community which grasped the key issue of population decline and decided to build an economy through the arts.  There are five people living permanently on the island as a result of the programme.  In a time when traditional island incomes such as farming and fishing are in decline we have created skilled jobs in the community for three roles divided between four people.  This brings great benefit to the island.</p> <p>  Approximately &euro;60,000 in funding is required every year to deliver the programme.  For an investment of &euro;60,000, a programme valued at approximately &euro;415,000 is delivered by the community, DIT, the West Cork Arts Centre and voluntary input.  We market Sherkin as the island of the arts.  We have done surveys - further surveys are needed - which show the economic spin-off of the bachelor of arts in visual arts programme for the area is approximately &euro;150,000.  The BAVA programme provides value for money and is a very successful arts course.  It is a full-time four-year degree programme accredited by DIT.  Students attend classes on site for four years every alternate weekend.  Classes are held in a local community hall.  The facility is nothing fancy, which proves that high-end quality education can be delivered anywhere.</p> <p>  The programme was established by the Sherkin Island Development Society, DIT and the West Cork Arts Centre as a degree course in 2007, following a successful pilot programme which ran from 2000 until 2006.  As the community partner, SIDS is responsible for accommodation and facilities, including the community hall, and direct employment of an arts facilitator, information technology facilitator and administrator.  Between 2012 and 2016, the programme was co-funded by the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and Cork County Council.  In May 2016, the co-funding agreement was altered to provide that the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht would contribute 60% of funding and Cork County Council would contribute the remaining 40%.  The costs are broken down as &euro;45,000 for wages and employers' pay-related social insurance, PRSI, and &euro;15,000 for running costs, which include maintenance, insurance, professional fees, rent and materials.  The course provides value for money.</p> <p>  Within these four walls, in this great building, the Government and local authorities are seeking measures to tackle depopulation and other problems in rural Ireland.  The Sherkin Island community has an innovative programme which it wants to keep and secure for the future.  The bachelor of arts in visual arts is tried and tested.  It provides employment, directly supports 5% of the full-time residents on the island, brings inward investment and contributes to the island's social, cultural and economic life.  As the island of the arts, Sherkin Island has a sustainable tourism product.  We are a big part of the Wild Atlantic Way and cultural Ireland.  The BAVA programme is a significant part of our identity in west Cork.  It drives the reputation of the island as a centre of culture and the arts.  It is a service for which there is a demand and need.  For this reason, we need to keep it and secure its future.</p><p>We need preapproved funding for communities so that we do not have to have &euro;60,000 upfront every year.  It is a big ask for a small community to find that amount of money and to decide whether to borrow it and pay interest on it.  We thank all our partners, particularly our funders in the Department who have been on board and supported us down the years, as well as Cork County Council which has committed to another three years in funding.  It looks like we have secured the funding going forward and we are looking for a sustainable way to make this programme work.  It is a massive draw, not only to Sherkin Island but to west Cork and rural Ireland.  It does not have to be done in arts - it can be for any type of education.  We have lost our primary school and we are struggling to get an education for our kids at primary level so it is important to hang on to our arts degree programme on the island.  We will tackle the primary school issue in another way but we have to hang on to some level of education and the arts are a huge part of our identity.</p><p> Ms O'Neill Collins will talk about the arts side of the programme.  She is an artist, a facilitator, and islander and a founder of this.  She is passionate about it and she knows the arts inside out. </p></speech>

When I first came, fishing and farming were important for the island but, unfortunately, they have disappeared and the arts are now our strength.  Sherkin Island is unique and people are now coming to the island, when they used to have to leave the island.  This project could be tried on any of the islands.  The most important thing is that, instead of a gallery, artists use the beach, the farms and the kitchens.  Any college could set up in a rural area but in this case the community is very involved.  A student working on REPS got involved with the farmers and did something on social dancing, which brought people out of themselves and led to information being shared.  The farmers, fishermen and ferry people all share their information on the history and culture of the place and the artists feed into that.</p> <p>  When a show is done for the degree course it stays on the island for two days and some 1,000 people come onto the island.  Many artists, writers, poets and musicians live in the island population and from September to May some 40 more come in, which makes a huge difference to the pubs and restaurants, the hotel and the hostel.  In the winter time there is an extra buzz from all this.  Without it the island would be dead.  People stay for weekends and do installations, videos etc.  There is a lot of contemporary art and the islanders have a sense of pride in it all because they feel ownership of it.</p> <p>  I was able to raise my children on the island and if I did not have the job I would have had to commute.  Many people have been involved and everyone has given blood, sweat and tears to make it work.  One gets worn down when one is always hunting for money.  We go to the United States for St. Patrick's Day and showcase our artists, which is special for an island of only 90 people.  I want my kids to come back and bring their kids but without this course a lot of things will die.  The funders came and saw the amount of energy on the island and the diversity of what was happening.  Artists work with exciting political issues and personal things and it feeds into Uillinn, the west Cork arts centre, and it is a hub that keeps going.  We all are in the same situation and have to get on.  It would be amazing if the Government and the powers that be could give it the energy it deserves.</p> <p>  Some 15 people are applying for the next run and we were blessed to have the Museum of Modern Art involved.  The Tate Modern in Liverpool was also involved and Dr. Michael Birchall opened the show for us.  He was blown away by it.  Jesse Jones represented Ireland at the Biennale and came to lecture here.  These are big names and we are proud to have them in Sherkin.  If we could just have a bit more the world would be our oyster.</p></speech>

We offer the largest number of art and design degrees in the State at undergraduate and postgraduate level.  Located in the heart of the Liberties in Dublin 8, the NCAD is a small college with just over 1,200 students and 600 part-time evening students.  The benefit of this is that we are flexible and capable of responding to local needs.</p> <p>  The impact of the NCAD is felt far beyond the campus on Thomas Street.  Our graduates are innovators, co-creators and self-starters and are evident in all aspects of the economy from public engagement through working in public institutions, to technology and industry.  We have a long history of connecting our students and programmes with partners in education, the cultural sector and civil society.  Our contribution to enabling wider participation in the arts is seen in the work of our students as they follow their paths out of college across a range of fields and our school of education trains our country's art teachers.  All our students are encouraged, though their education, to think about the role of their practice as they leave college and the ways they can connect their work to either a specific audience or a specific context.</p> <p>  The NCAD has a long and very embedded commitment to access to art college and we will outline the access policy today.  We will reflect on some of the complex and deep-rooted social and economic factors that can militate against wider participation in the arts and how, since 2005, we started to tackle under-representation in the NCAD using a participatory and inclusive approach.</p></speech>

We have built relationships and established partnerships within the local community, with 35 DEIS primary schools and 42 DEIS secondary schools.  We also have a range of outreach programmes in the greater Dublin area and County Dublin.  Our focus is on bringing students into the campus.</p><p>This remains a key priority in terms of the access days we provide, our student shadowing programmes where the students spend time working along NCAD students, and our mentoring programme through which our student teachers mentor access students interested in a career in art and design.  We also provide portfolio scholarship programmes over the summer and during the year for students from disadvantaged areas.  We recognise the critical role played by teachers in raising academic aspirations for disadvantaged students and we have a whole range of pre-entry programmes of engagement with primary and post primary schools.  We have a supplementary admissions route.  We have post-entry support and, more recently, we provide a postgraduate studio support residency programme for our graduated access students.</p><p> In terms of the barriers to higher education in art and design, admission policies generally in Irish colleges are very competitive and selective, and entrance to art college can represent a double disadvantage for students with little cultural capital and little knowledge of the field.  Increasingly, many middle-class families avail of private tuition for their children such as grinds or portfolio courses, summer schools and trips abroad to galleries and museums, to gain some advantage in this competitive educational terrain.  For our access students the prospect of getting into an art college can be very complex.  The portfolio alone is a huge challenge with somewhat vague career prospects for those people in the art and design industry, particularly if they choose to do fine art, which is a pretty precarious profession.  Our access students, who come from a non-traditional route, may look different when they come to college.  They may feel different, act differently or dress differently.  It is very important for us to be able to make our access students, with whom we have made contact through the schools, feel that NCAD is their home and that they can come back and consider a career in this field.</p><p> In terms of a cross-institutional collaborative approach, I am sure many committee members are aware of the HEA funded programme for access to higher education, PATH.  It is aimed at widening participation throughout third level for those most disadvantaged and minority groups in our society.  NCAD is working alongside Trinity College Dublin, UCD, Marino Institute of Education and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology in a three-pronged approach to widening participation.  Path one is based on initial teacher education and trying to increase the number of learners from this particular area who go into the further education sector.  Path two involves the 1916 bursaries.  I am not sure whether the committee is aware of them, but this year 80 bursaries were given out to students from disadvantaged backgrounds across the five colleges.  Path three is bridges to learning, which deals with more in-depth for work packages under the umbrella of Dublin as a learning city.  This includes open learning modules in the universities and mentoring students from minority groups in the third level sector.  NCAD is particularly involved in leading the creative arts summer school, which starts next week, across the five campuses.  This is rolling out now and we are looking forward to a very co-ordinated approach across the sectors.</p><p> The community engagements in which we are involved are very much a range of local partnerships in the arts and beyond.  I will not go into huge detail, but these include IMMA with which we have a very strong relationship because we are on a cultural corridor in Thomas Street, luckily, and the national galleries and museums and Collins Barracks are all very close to us in the heart of the city.  We have a strong relationship with IMMA in terms of our school's visual culture, fine art and education.  We have future creators, which is an after-school digital learning programme for young people co-funded with Digital Hub.  Rialto youth project involves Easter and summer art programmes in NCAD in collaboration with our cultural institutions.  We also have student placements. mentoring and campus engagement with smaller groups such as SOLAS and Tallaght Community Arts.  NCAD runs an entrepreneurship summer camp with Axis Ballymun and the Rediscovery Centre in Ballymun.  This is a snapshot for the committee of some of the work NCAD does in our access programme.</p></speech>

All art and design students are challenged through their learning to consider how their creative work will find a place in society and to think about the context for their work with potential audiences and the potential for their work as artists in collaborating with people working in specific contexts and different audiences.  We are starting a new initiative in September, studio plus, which is a new voluntary year for students between second year and third year.  The programme will encourage them to take their work out of the campus and work in different places in the community around us.  An example of this is our collaboration with Mercer's Institute for Successful Ageing in St. James's Hospital.  Throughout all of next year we will have students embedded in that unit.  The studios will be there and the teaching will take place in that institute.  It has an incredible innovative creative life programme and the students will be part of this.</p> <p>  For 25 years NCAD ran a learning programme in Portlaoise Prison, with NCAD staff providing opportunities for creative engagement for people in prison, critically at the same level of those being offered to people in third level education.  A lot of participants in that programme then went on to partake in further education in art and design.  In the context of today's discussion, we mention this as a past programme because we think it is a really good and clear example of where long-term investment and engagement really do lead to change.</p> <p>  The other learning we wanted to bring to the table from our history of engaging beyond the campus with people in creativity is the value of cross-sectoral collaboration, where we think beyond the silos in which we operate, which are often dictated by funding models more than anything else.  Professor Jordan mentioned an example of this.  As an educational institute we have collaborated with national cultural institutions such as IMMA.</p> <p>  We welcome the commitment of the committee to broadening participation in the arts, and we recommend that Government initiatives to support this are reflective of the ongoing work happening in a range of organisations in the educational sector and in cultural institutions, and that there is a commitment at policy level to longitudinal research in arts participation, something that has never really happened at a significant level in Ireland.  This would provide us with real evidential data of the impact of the creative arts for all of us to build informed strategies so we can really think about how, through creative art, we can meet the needs of our changing society in future.</p></speech>

We are honoured to be able to speak today about the Bealtaine Festival.  We will speak about the demand, role and need for the festival in Ireland and beyond, the personal value that accrues from the festival to the individuals who participate in it, the State value and benefits that come from it in a secondary way and in the context of the policies around us, and we will make some recommendations at the end.</p> <p>  I thought I would present with some images and I was going to show a range of images from this year's festival.  At the centre of the festival are individuals, who are at the centre of all arts activity.  This is obvious in the images of people who dominate the festival and in the images of groups of people connecting with each other.  It is about the personhood of the individual, which is something that gerontologists talk about all of the time.  It is hugely important to all of us no matter what age we are but particularly as we get older.  It is about the social connections that come from attending our festival.  These were the two key points I was going to make through using images.</p></speech>

We believe creativity is a lifelong journey, and the life course of people engaging in the arts and creativity is key.</p> <p>  I will make some points on aging and the arts, which might be new to some committee members but certainly will not be new to others who are here.  I do not need to go over the figures.  We all know that Ireland, as a western country, is getting older and by 2040 approximately one in four of us will be 65 and over.</p><p>That is something the State is considering well in advance.  It is positive that we are living longer and healthier lives.  It should not be seen in a negative light, which is something we are used to from some media coverage.  It means people continue to be engaged and have more time to be engaged in different activities.  They demand rich and meaningful engagement.  As a State, we must take care of that, which is what we are doing with the festival.</p><p> There is a demand for the festival and we see that every day it runs.  We see it in what is said to us after people have been to an event and we see it in the audience surveys we carry out every single year.  We see it in the evaluation we do every single year.  We have 100,000 people who come to our festival from every county in Ireland.  We see it also in the emails we get from all over the world from people who say they do not have a festival like this.  They tell us the work is amazing and ask what they can do.  We also have people from across the world who come to our festival.  I met five people from Japan, Canada, the UK and Germany who came specifically for the festival this year.  There is definitely a demand.  In 2017, Age UK carried out wellbeing research which surveyed 100,000 older people in the UK.  The No. 1 factor contributing to their wellbeing was access to creativity.  That was ahead of financial security and health, which was pretty meaningful.</p><p> Regarding aging and the arts, I mentioned earlier that there are many benefits to all art activity.  The reason we get involved in the arts are the personal benefits first and foremost.  They provide the intrinsic value and are about how we create a sense of identity for ourselves and meaning throughout the arts.  That is incredibly important as we get older.  It is there throughout our life course but as we get older, there is sometimes a suggestion that one's self identify has stopped somewhere along the way.  That is simply not true.  We continue to create and recreate our sense of self and the festival focuses on that.  Selfhood is key to it.  From those personal benefits, however, come societal and State benefits.  I mentioned the social connection that comes from attending the festival and meeting one's friends there.  We also run an audience network where we put together older people who want to come to the festival and to arts events in general.  We co-ordinate those events around the country and actively put people together.</p><p> If one wants to look at it from a public policy perspective rather than simply from a consideration of the personal benefits, the confidence and connections which emerge from the festival obviously contribute to social cohesion.  Our Sherkin Island friends here outlined the importance of that.  We see it also in the Bealtaine festival.  There are also physical benefits which are sometimes harder for people to see.  Research has proven that there are cognitive benefits from a focused and deep engagement in arts activities.  Those things are crucial for older people.  It is very important for the State to take that into account along with the sense of wellbeing which is at the centre of the festival.</p><p> To say a little about the festival itself, it is produced by Age and Opportunity Ireland, which is a national organisation that promotes wellbeing and quality of life in older age through education, sport and culture, which is where we come in.  We are funded through the Arts Council and the Health Service Executive and we are all about partnerships.  The festival takes place every single day of every May of every year.  We cannot do it without the partnerships we have in each and every county.  We are extremely community connected.  We have a network of thousands of organisations and events every year.  This was founded in the 1990s in response to a need and we have a long pedigree now.  A founder member, Ms Helen O'Donoghue, curator at the Irish Museum of Modern Art, is with me here.  The identified need was the need for access to the arts and creativity at all ages and, in particular perhaps, as we get older and have a bit more time to get back to things we did not have time for when we were working.  That is when one is not working in the arts, of course.</p><p> The festival is about access first, but also about representation.  We need to be able to see ourselves in the world around us to have that sense of selfhood.  As one gets older, some people, albeit not all, can feel more invisible.  The arts provides a very public way for people to see themselves mirrored in the world around them.  We try to tell the stories of all of us as we get older and we try to hold ourselves up very publicly to the world through the arts with the festival.  It is about visibility and representation.  It is about showing the individual's spirit, no matter what one's age.  One can be 80 and just as feisty and different an individual as a 20 year old.  One of the things that happens as one gets older is that one is homogenised into a ghettoised block as if one is part of a special interest group.  It is as if one loses a sense of self and is somehow amorphous.  As all of us who are getting older know, it does not work like that.  The framework for all of this is a celebration of the contribution of older people in Irish public life and the arts.  It is really about celebrating the contribution of age.</p><p> In a policy context, we feel we could do a bit better.  Obviously, we fit into broad Government policies, some of which are set out in the documents before the members.  Those policies are very much about older people staying active and sometimes creativity is tagged on.  We fit into arts policies most specifically.  Most recently, one pillar of Creative Ireland is creative communities which is about enabling every community to be creative.  As the festival takes place all over the country, we believe we very much fulfil that policy objective.  We are also part of Making Great Art Work, which is the Arts Council's policy document, but we are implied rather than listed.  Young people are very much part of that document.  Our view is that the policy needs to take account of the life course of all of us.  In the same way that young people are very important, and I do not take away from that for a minute, older people could be recognised explicitly rather than implicitly in a policy context.  There is also, of course, Culture 2025.</p><p> I will leave the committee with a couple of recommendations.  We meet a strong need.  The arts have a very particular role to play in older life in relation to identity, meaning, activity and health.  Because of those social and personal benefits, we feel we address an equity issue.  If I were to leave the members with one thing, it would be the need to look at the life course of people engaging in the arts in relation to policy.</p></speech>

Arts and Disability Ireland is the national development and resource organisation for arts and disability.  Our role is to champion the creativity of artists with disabilities and to promote inclusive experiences for audiences with disabilities.  Guided by our strategic plan, Leading Change in Arts and Culture 2017-2021, our board, staff, stakeholders and funders, including our principal funder, the Arts Council, Arts and Disability Ireland works nationally through a series of multi-annual partnerships across the arts and cultural environment.  In 2017, this has resulted in 18 projects, 17 accessible performances and exhibitions and support for 24 artists in the creation of new work, showcasing, mentoring and training across nine local authorities.</p> <p>  In 2014, Arts and Disability Ireland was invited by the Arts Council to devise and manage a new funding scheme for artists with disabilities in Ireland.  Entitled "Arts and Disability Connect", the scheme is now in its fifth year and has supported 47 awards and distributed more than &euro;132,000.  The only scheme exclusively open to artists with disabilities, it was designed to serve as an entry point to the broad range of bursaries, project and production awards, commissions and collaborations available through the Arts Council and local authority arts offices.  However, we have identified while managing the scheme the need for a separate production award and the creation of new family-friendly work.</p> <p>  In 2006, Arts and Disability Ireland initiated the very first of our access services for audiences with disabilities with audio described performances at the Abbey Theatre and during the Dublin Theatre Festival.</p><p>Over the years a small number of venues and festivals have started providing Irish Sign Language, ISL, and, more recently, relaxed performances.  Currently, we are the sole provider of audio description and captioning to the arts in Ireland.<br/><br/>Arts &amp;amp; Disability Ireland's audio description and captioning across Ireland peaked in 2014, with 23 and 30 performances, respectively, but declined to nine and seven in 2017.  If we compare that to Scotland, last year there were 248 audio described and 68 captioned performances in 2017.  A deaf woman told me that her seeing a captioned performance of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i><b></b>at the Abbey Theatre came 17 years after she had studied the play for her leaving certificate.<br/><br/><b></b>A Strategy for Equality, the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, was published in 1996 and identified a network of national venues where audio description, captioning and ISL should be made available but 22 years later, these recommendations have yet to be realised in their entirety and are certainly something collectively we need to revisit.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 introduced the new public sector duty under section 42 of that legislation.  This is an encouraging tool to enable public bodies to embed human rights and equality, including disability.  However, the section offers no direct legal remedy for failure to comply.  Consequently, we encourage the committee to consider how the public sector duty under the 2014 Act will be realised in the context of an arts and culture environment.<br/><br/>In 2017, Arts &amp;amp; Disability Ireland commissioned the Going Out survey with the aim of understanding how people with disabilities engage with arts and culture in its broadest sense.  The largest quantitative audience survey of its type ever undertaken in Ireland, Arts &amp;amp; Disability Ireland reached 523 respondents with the strategic input of the National Disability Authority and over 20 other disability organisations.  The research indicates clearly that people with disabilities attend the arts, so it makes good sense to make arts attendance accessible to people with disabilities.  This is 643,131 people and 64% want to attend arts events more often.  If we made it possible for just half of them to come one more time, bringing a friend or family member with them, the arts and cultural sector stands to earn an additional &euro;7 million.<br/><br/>If I were to use one example to illustrate our vision for the arts, it would be Ignite.  This 2013 to 2015 partnership between the Arts Council, Arts &amp;amp; Disability Ireland and local authorities in Mayo, Galway and Cork created three new commissions each worth &euro;60,000, led by internationally recognised artists with disabilities.  This culminated with Cork Ignite on Culture Night 2015, Simon McKeown&rsquo;s 28-minute, large-scale projection that filled the fa&ccedil;ade of Cork College of Commerce and involved visual artists and musicians with disabilities from across the city.  With Ignite, we achieved so much of what is great about the arts, including collaboration, partnership, innovation and spectacle for an audience of 10,000 people.  We also illustrated that public investment in arts and disability can create opportunities for people with disabilities to contribute to the arts and cultural life of Ireland at the highest level and cause a city to stop and notice.  As one citizen of Cork put it:</p><blockquote>I never thought that I&rsquo;d be sitting down on the banks of the River Lee, in the month of September, on a cool autumn evening, enjoying myself.  It was out of this world.</blockquote><p>If there is time, Ms Leah Johnston, Arts &amp;amp; Disability Ireland's project manager, who worked on much of the statistical information and research, and I would be happy to take questions at the end.</p></speech>

We have seen through all the presentations that arts is plural and it is about having a collegiate approach.  There are those in our society who are seeking an engagement with the arts and there are people creating the product and developing the service that arts can offer.</p> <p>  McAuley Place is pretty unique in many ways and it is a pleasure and honour for me to be its chairman, given that I am not originally from Ireland.  I am from Northern Ireland.  I took over the chairmanship of McAuley Place last November and it has been an absolute privilege to interact with those who have such a vision for a wonderful environment as McAuley Place.</p> <p>  For those who do not know it, McAuley Place is located in Naas, County Kildare.  It is primarily a housing association - that was the original intent - and it provides 53 units of accommodation for those advancing in years.  It is first-class accommodation that is home for people, and the primary aim of McAuley Place is to provide a home.  For those who do not know me, I was previously chairman of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive for ten years.  I have always used the phrase, "It is not where you live but how you live".  Accommodation can be built that suits a location but it might not suit the people who want to live there.  The environment in which one lives dictates how one lives and how one conducts one's life in accordance with circumstances.  The arts play a major part in creating that environment so people can enjoy the social interaction that comes with living in whatever environment they inhabit.</p> <p>  McAuley Place has expanded and is a &euro;1 million-plus community enterprise.  Its income streams are generated from rental income, tea rooms, charity shops, a community centre and cultural activities and donations.  There is a fantastic sense of spirit within the town centre.  The resident base is varied and covers many traditions, and visitors and those who participate in our activities are from many traditions and nationalities.  There is a mix of genders and people from rural and urban backgrounds.  There are people who have come to live in an urban environment who were previously in rural areas and it is fantastic to hear their view on engagement with the arts.  We have created an environment where people can enjoy living while contributing to how we develop that environment.  Ms Margharita Solon had the vision for McAuley Place and I am honoured for her to be here today.  We are a double act in many ways and she will contribute on the aspects of her vision being translated into reality through the delivery of some programmes and activities.</p> <p>  We have much more to do.  There is a housing requirement - a term I use carefully - but we must get the right type of housing and the right environment in order to create the right communities and develop the correct ethos for living.  We must also create a culture where the arts and those involved with the arts understand what is meant by people "living".  It is not about creating something people do not want but rather creating something that people can buy into.  We must work with those in the arts family to refine and advance the product.</p><p>This is critical because we live in a new world of digital connection and we must bring that world into the arts, which is a challenge for us.</p><p> In many ways our biggest challenge in McAuley Place is Government policy, where Government policy sits in relation to Government resources and how that is matched with the collective vision of everyone in this room and others outside.  It is a question of how we bring this pluralism of vision, resource and policy to the table and how we can advance our thinking accordingly.  We have one big vision, which is our health-through-learning centre, on which Ms Solon will elaborate in a few moments.  That vision is still just a vision for us because the reality is that we find it difficult to find the right funding streams for us to take it forward.  The commitment of our organisation is that we will have to do that ourselves.  We have to go into advance borrowings as an organisation but we want to create and breathe life into that vision and create an additional, very positive activity stream for McAuley Place.</p><p> I believe McAuley Place brings a sense of hub to living in Naas.  Most people, if not everyone, around Naas knows McAuley Place; our challenge is to get to know them.  Their knowing us is fine, but we must know them.  We must advance our thinking in society.  We must do arts with society but also within society.  The challenge is to get the "with" and the "within" on the right platform.</p><p> I will hand over to Ms Solon.</p></speech>

We are absolutely honoured and privileged to have him here.</p> <p>  Dr. Byrne made the really interesting statement that we are hearing an awful lot more about an ageing society and that by 2040 there will be so many people over the age of 65.  In 2020, I will be 65.  What do I want?  This is about me and my ageing.  This is about my one year old grandson - no one ever had a grandchild before me - and the kind of society I want for him and where I want my 30 year old kids to be.  I want them to be in a place like McAuley Place where the arts connect us.  It is not that the old ones are over there, the children are in the cr&egrave;che over there, the disabled are over there and there is a programme going on here.  We are a community and we all live together, and the commonality between all of us is our creativity, which is part of the aspiration of Creative Ireland.  When I am 65, when I have a little more time, I want to learn how to arrange flowers like they do in the craft group in McAuley Place.  I want the opportunity to publish my own poetry in a poetry book in McAuley Place.  I want the opportunity to be in an arts project like the intergenerational community arts project that went on for over a year and brought carers, people with disabilities, people with learning challenges, unemployed people and everyone else all together.  However, there were no labels or badges.  The people connected because they were learning and doing something together.  One lady who participated in this arts project had terminal cancer.  She was living in McAuley Place.  Within two weeks of her moving into McAuley Place, she halved her pain medication.  Her condition was still bad, still deteriorating, but the arts, creativity and connection were releasing dopamine that was making her feel far better than any medical prescription could.</p> <p>  As Mr. Rowntree said, we want to develop our vision for this old building, this health-through-learning centre.  People still look at us and say, "What?" and we say "health through learning".  Likewise, people asked us why we were providing housing in the heart of the town for older people and said such housing is always on the periphery of the town.  "Housing with intergenerational what?" they asked.  "With intergenerational facilities," we replied.  They asked us what we meant by a creative model rather than a medical model.  Now they are coming from all over Ireland to see what it is we have done.  I have absolutely no doubt but that when, not if, we get the funding to complete this health-through-learning centre, it will be another flagship not only for Ireland, but beyond Europe.  Our health-through-learning centre will consist of a community lounge, just like a residents' lounge in a hotel.  If one is from the community, one can be in the lounge.  A label is not needed.  It is not that one is unemployed, has mental health issues, has disabilities, is new to the town or is an asylum seeker.  That does not matter.  If one is from the town, one can go into the community lounge.  One can go through the community lounge and out into an incredible urban woodland garden with a river running through it, where one can connect with the environment and with nature.  It is an amazing space that makes one feel well.</p> <p>  Then one can go into the three creative making rooms, where we have activities such as woodturning, weaving, flower arranging and basket making.  There are opportunities for people from NCAD to do this outreach with us, exactly the same thing Ms O'Neill Collins was talking about: repopulating areas.  Naas has been devastated with ribbon development outside the town, but McAuley Place is bringing people back in.  It will bring even more people back in so it has an economy of scale in itself.  We are doing all that we are already doing with what we have.  As Mr. Rowntree said, this is creating an even better hub in order that when, not if, we develop more houses, we do not need to replicate everything about McAuley Place.  McAuley Place is the hub that connects to these other satellite communities that we have created, that are intergenerational, creative and artistic.</p></speech>

If I may be so bold as to put one or two forward, I believe it is in the interests of us all to look at the social capital we have available to us and to maximise the opportunity from that.  This is not about efficiency savings; it is about best value.  It is about stretching the envelope of opportunity as opposed to restricting the envelope of spend.  I believe that social capital needs to be understood and interrogated further.  Many organisations have huge amounts of social capital, as does Government, and we should do more research to look at what we can bring to the table and how we structure that in the form of partnerships, strategic alliances, closer associates, etc.</p> <p>  We should look at training and development in a structured fashion for volunteers, particularly around arts and culture.  We should look at models of intervention that add accreditation and value so people can feel rewarded in a different fashion for what they do because they have some badge of respect that says they have contributed and their contribution has been understood and acknowledged.</p> <p>  We must have a more co-ordinated policy around intergenerational activity which looks at appreciation, respect and development in these areas, where the outflows add to the other recommendation I have outlined.  We also need to establish a nationwide network of key hubs, which I think can be done quite swiftly, key centres into which people can feed.  Those can then have sub-hubs, but we need a nationwide network of regional hubs through which we can filter ideas, learning and development, and then we can outflow from those in a structured fashion.  The co-ordination of the arts is the simplistic part, its development is more long term, but the understanding of the arts is the job we have in hand.  We must work harder and more smartly at understanding the value and the contribution the arts make to how one lives, not where one lives.</p> <p>  Again, on behalf of McAuley Place, I thank the committee.</p></speech>

That was fascinating.  I thank the witnesses.  We appreciate it.  I will open the discussion up to our colleagues now to ask questions.  Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell was the first with her hand up.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-20a.780" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1427" speakername="Marie Louise O'Donnell" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22018062000002#G00500"><p>It is most refreshing to be around colleagues and what John McGahern called freshwater people.  People who work in the arts are always freshwater people - good trout.  I thank all the witnesses for being here because we got from them a really tremendous sense of the arts as it relates to youth, education, lifelong learning and the elderly.</p> <p>  I will ask a few very specific questions and then the witnesses can come back in and answer me as they see fit.  The first question is could the committee visit Sherkin Island?  What is the standard of the work?  Will Ms Moran and Ms O'Neill Collins talk to me a little about that?  Why do I not know more about it?  They can be thinking about these questions as we go.  Ms O'Neill Collins's contribution about any college coming to a rural area was a brilliant idea, and I would link it into something Ms Solon talked about, namely, that combination of people coming in and bringing their own knowledge and others learning from them as well as gifting their own knowledge.  The course is validated through DIT.  If we want to recognise the course more, do we give it more money?  Is that what the witnesses want?  Will they nail that for me and why I do not know more about it?</p> <p>  I know the Bealtaine Festival very well.  I admire it and think it is extraordinary.  Dr. Byrne makes the same point Ms Solon makes, that access to creativity is access to great health and that great health is great creativity.</p><p>The witness makes that point from that extraordinary survey.  I was at a big organisational event this morning about positive ageing and life ageing in towns and villages.  Creativity was only tagged onto things.  It was not central to what people were discussing.  Will the witness expand on the point that political parties, and perhaps all Departments, should have an arts section?  If the organisation was looking for one thing for this committee to make real what would it be?</p><p> Can the representative from Arts and Disability Ireland say if Ignite being reignited?</p><p> Can the representative of the NCAD tell us a little about the Mercer Hospital ageing unit and the Creative Life Centre?  Why has the college not argued for 25 extra points in the Central Applications Office, CAO, system to open up the arts for study by students?  We readily do it for mathematics.  What other things would the representative like to see NCAD doing, if it had a wish list?</p><p> On McAuley Place, could the committee visit it?  Can the witness tell the committee a little more about its music series, its art, its environmental art, the Alzheimer's choir and the food hall?  I know about them but the committee might like to hear about them.</p><p> My questions are really about what we can do.  Much of this can be policy and talk, which is very good and ethereal, but what can we do?  We are discussing something really interesting.  If we are going to age and age well, creativity must be the start of it.  When people talk about technology they always talk about creativity.  When they talk about economics they also talk about creativity.  However, we do not look at it artistically or we tag it onto something else or we have our eye on the main chance that it is to do with tourism and it makes money.  However, it is brilliant in itself.  If we started from that premise we might go further.</p><p> The witnesses might have other things they want to say that they might not have said earlier or that my questions might have sparked in them.  These are not examination questions but for expansion.</p></speech>

She made the point that we tag the arts onto something else.  Sherkin Island Development Society does that.  That is how we get our funding and our validation.  It is tagged onto tourism, the economy or something because if we just look at it as it is it is sometimes not recognised for how great it is.  Majella O'Neill will be able to tell the committee about that shortly.</p> <p>  With regard to a visit, everybody in the room is welcome to visit Sherkin Island.  We will put them on a ferry on a beautiful day and they can all visit.  We are very lucky that the programme co-ordinator from DIT, Dr. Glenn Loughran, is amazing.  We have visiting lecturers.  As Majella O'Neill mentioned, we had Jesse Jones and Dr. Michael Birchall from the Tate Modern.  Throughout the course of the academic year DIT has people visit and give lectures.  We open that up to the community so they are probably the best times for people to visit.  We will let the members know about it.  We are lucky that DIT puts so much into it.  It is a Dublin based college and it recognises the value of this outreach programme, the access to education, being within the community and the value the community puts on it.</p> <p>  As to why the committee does not know about it, I am looking for a diplomatic answer to that.</p></speech>

From our point of view and from the point of view of Sherkin Island a small committee runs it and DIT puts a lot into it.  Over the last 18 to 24 months we were in real danger of losing the programme.  All of our energy and focus were going into trying to save it and contacting local people.  When one is focusing on trying to fight a fire it is hard to try to promote it and tell everybody what we are doing.  That becomes secondary because one is worried about whether it will be in place two months hence.  That was our reality until May this year.  That is why we were invited to speak here.  It has been sorted.  We are delighted with our funders in the Department and Cork County Council but the future is the issue.  It is a community of 90 people and we must find a sustainable method of funding so the members of the community, who got up off their bums and did something positive, do not have to find &euro;60,000 up front to fund it.  That is not sustainable for a small community in rural Ireland.  We need to have a meeting where everybody can discuss how to do this and whether there is a way of pre-funding it.  It is the same thing year in, year out.  We are providing the same reports and all the information is available so the issue is how, with our partners and funders, we can come up with a solution to this.  Working together is the only way forward.</p></speech>

The things the programme has done could be given as a project to the school of communications in Dublin City University, DCU, or the school of communications in Cork.  I would love to see it.  I am not saying to act like a lady of the night, but it helps.  One must share oneself around to get the best for something the group has done primarily alone.  It is a wonderful idea.  It is so fresh, real and different.</p></speech>

For example, the Arts Council has a participation strand of policy and we are not listed under that but we are funded under it.  It has a supporting artists strand of policy whereas the festival supports older artists.  We are not listed.  It is about being explicit about the need to support the live course.  If younger people are picked out we feel that older people should be picked out too in terms of policy support.  That leads to the need for stable funding.  Every year we must make a separate application to the Arts Council.  We are very appreciative of its support but it is annual.  We have little stability and little forward planning is possible.  It is a 12 month turnaround and we usually do not know what funding we have until January, sometimes December, and it happens in May.  It is difficult.  The policy and the funding are definitely connected.</p></speech>

That is my point.  Is there a place for it to be explicit within Departments that arts play a part in everybody's life and that they might not have the problems of this, that and the other if they looked at the arts in the way the witnesses have described?</p></speech>

In theory, we should be able to leverage funding in different Departments through Creative Ireland, but that has not arisen yet.</p></speech>

However, the Arts Council would say that its invitation to collaborate is a scheme that is beginning to deliver in a similar way.  With regard to tourism, I am not as afraid of that as many people in the arts are.  In fact, I want a piece of it.  It gives great visibility to people with disabilities in terms of the high quality work we can create, as we showed with Cork Ignite.  It is said that 28,000 people come to the city of Cork for Culture Night and we got 10,000 of them.  That is incredible visibility.</p></speech>

The key thing about the creative life programme is that it is informed by the Irish longitudinal study on ageing, TILDA.  There was an in-depth assessment over a long period of what was needed to support successful ageing.  As all other speakers noted, it identified absolutely that engagement with creativity was one of the things that could support successful ageing.  Therefore, encouragement to engage with creativity is embedded in their treatment.  On the NCAD's involvement, it means that our students learn through actively being involved in the programme in working with patients and organising events in hospitals.  Does that answer the Senator's question?</p></speech>

Professor Jordan mentioned the HEA funded programme of access to higher education, PATH, which has just started.  We always have short-term initiatives such as Ignite; therefore, there is additional funding for a moment and then it is gone.  For us, there is ongoing work on access and being able to encourage a broader base into the stream of arts education because that is from where our art makers will come.  That is one of the fundamental aspects in breaking down the socio-economic barriers to people seeing themselves as having the right to participate or be part of the creative community, as Professor Jordan discussed.  Changing that stream of people coming into arts education is one way by which we can address the issue.  The access programme is critical in that regard.  It is something about which we are thinking generally in the NCAD.  The idea of what an artist can be is really changing, as we have seen in all of the presentations.  I referred to the need to challenge young artists to think about what it now means to be an artist or designer or whatever categories into which we put people in terms of the boundaries we put around them.  An artist is not just a person sitting in a studio producing objects that disappear into a commercial system and are bought.  There is so much more potential in how their creativity can play a role in society.  That depth of vision is what we, as an art and design institute, identify as something we will need to embed in future makers because that is where the opportunities will be.</p></speech>

We can all be creative, innovative, appreciate and mainstream.  It is important that the arts not be seen as a survival course; they must be seen as something that is endorsed and a business that represents those who are investing their skills and time in an enterprise.  What we have to do is help the arts to mould and others around them into a fabric that society appreciates and understands is required and that it also sees as sustainable.  One cannot develop the arts until one develops the framework and foundations on which they are set, as otherwise they are doomed to fail.  As I said, there is a need for a combined platform of policy, strategy and resources.  The resources can be brought to the table by the arts, but they must also be underpinned by social and investment capital from the State.</p></speech>

For example, we host the Past Times Community Choir which operates under the guidance of a choir leader.  People come from local nursing homes, carers come from the local community, individuals who are socially isolated also come, as do other members of the local community who want to be part of the choir.  They all come to McAuley Place and the buzz in the place is amazing.  When one comes, there is an art exhibition that changes every two weeks to encourage and support local artists.  That means that if I live in McAuley Place and I am unable to get out, or if I come into the tea room, I see all of this amazing art around the place.  Ann McKenna, an artist from Kildare, is now exhibiting.  Her work is amazing.  She does fantastic work based on Irish mythology.  Some weeks ago we had the Vanishing Ireland exhibition which was unbelievable.  We have hosted all sorts of musician.  Christy Moore had a private concert for all of the residents, staff and volunteers which was so hush hush that they were all sitting down in the arts and culture centre and did not know who was coming; they just knew that it was a VIP.  Then the door opened and they realised it was Christy Moore who was unbelievable.  He ended up in the kitchen with the staff and volunteers with his mug of tea.</p></speech>

If one is in the tea room, one can smell the home baking and see the people in their tutus going to ballet class.  It is intergenerational, artistic and creative.  It could be the yoga group or the tai chi class that is coming into the tea room.  There is a cross-section which is intersecting all of the time as they come and go.  One of the residents is organising a concert on Friday night and bringing in two jazz musicians, as a fundraiser for McAuley Place.  One always expects the unexpected.</p></speech>

I have been very much taken by everyone's contribution, the energy shown and the unique approaches.  I feel inadequate as a public representative that I do not see and hear more about them.  Even if the committee does not do so, I will definitely visit McAuley Place and Sherkin Island and Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell will come with me.  I have no questions for the delegates, but I have many for the committee and politicians.  I think Dr. Byrne has referred to how the delegates do not know until January what they will do every year; for example, there could be a project in May.  Funding and policies are issues, but the question of timing is also to the fore.  I come across many groups that work on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis and do not know until funding is announced that they will be in business in a particular year.  That is a failing on the part of our structures within government, no matter who is in office.  We need to address it to give those such as the delegates a better sense of permanence by setting out a five-year funding plan for each organisation.  </p><p>I congratulate everyone and thank him or her for coming.  The delegates should not thank us, rather we should thank them.</p></speech>

Sometimes we live in a bubble and do not know what is happening in the real world.  It is the real world that brings most of us here.  The evidence given by so many of the groups has been an education for me and all of us.  The McAuley Centre is a place I would really like to visit.  I am involved in a lot of rural community groups.  We have gone a small way towards where the McAuley Centre is, but we could learn a lot more and we would like to do so.  I second what Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell said about the committee paying a visit to the McAuley Centre, Sherkin Island and Skibbereen.  We might also attend the Bealtaine Festival while we are at it.</p></speech>

Having never understood what they were, I have seen so many people in local community hospitals become involved in the arts.  They find so much joy in places such as Schull, Skibbereen, Bantry Hospital, Bandon, Kinsale and Dunmanway.  I have seen them in community hospitals and nursing homes and it means so much to the patients.  We have travelled that road and by now community hospitals are places we would all like to be inside.</p><p>I am not being too parochial about things with regard to Sherkin Island but I am delighted that Ms Aisling Moran and Ms Majella O'Neill Collins are here today to give evidence.  They were supposed to appear before the committee four or five months ago but the snow struck.  That might have been a stroke of luck because it may have allowed a bit more time for the issues that were outstanding and a cause of major concern some time to get sorted.  I recall that Aisling rang me at 7 o'clock that morning to ask if this committee meeting was going ahead.  I said "Absolutely" but then I pulled back the curtains in my apartment in Rathmines and said "It is not; it is off, end of story".  Aisling said that Tom might not agree with me.  I said that I did not care what Tom said that the meeting was off.  I said "Forget it.  I will not be going outside my own door, let alone have you coming up from Sherkin Island."</p><p> To be honest, islands are suffering and haemorrhaging in many respects.  Islands are fighting an uphill battle.  There are eight islands in my constituency and I meet with islanders.  I go to the islands and I hear the issues but we are fighting the battle.  Sherkin Island lost its school a few years ago, which was a major blow to the island.  This degree course is a lifeline not only for the island but has a major financial benefit for other businesses in places such as Baltimore, Skibbereen, Union Hall, Glandore and Leap.  These places will all benefit because of the people who come to Sherkin Island for this visual art degree.  I commend the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht for funding this course.  I also commend the local authority, the commitment of the Dublin Institute of Technology and the work done by the Sherkin Island development society over the past few years to continue this.  It went through a major difficulty at the beginning of the year but the stakeholders stuck with the task and remained focused, and thankfully the funding eventually became available to continue the course.</p><p> One Saturday approximately a month ago I went to the island for the graduation.  The local council chief executive officer, Mr. Tim Lucey, was there along with another local representatives and local people.  We were stunned at the large number of people flocking to the island that day.  It probably happens on other days too, but on that particular day the people were coming to see the event.  It clearly stunned me and others to see the benefits - not that I had any doubts about it - and I am glad the situation was resolved and is moving forward.  There is now a focus and they know where they stand for the next number of years.</p><p> The islands are facing a tough time and this initiative is unique.  I fought very strongly to make sure it stayed as it was.  There are negatives and positives.  When the school closed on Sherkin Island, the children of the island needed to get a ferry to school.  Perhaps some people do not call it a chaperone, but the parents are fighting very hard to get a chaperone to take the children on the ferry because parents are trying to work.  These are some of the big disadvantages.  The particular service is not in place at the moment as we are waiting for the Department to see if it can be put in place.  Bere Island had a public health nurse who was there full time but who has now been brought back to the mainland.  Every time it involves a fight to keep a service.</p><p> I was on Sherkin Island recently doing a clinic.  There was no phone line for six months because of Storm Ophelia and no agency cared.  If the islanders do not fight and shout, very few others will.</p><p> There are also positives about the eight islands I represent.  On Long Island, off Schull, which I visited recently, a couple from the UK has just opened a bed and breakfast.  Collins is their name but they are no relation.  There is talk about building a community centre on Whiddy Island.  We are aware of the amount of work done by Tim O'Leary with the Bank House.  Dursey Island has its new cable car.  Cape Clear Island and Bere Island are all fighting for services.  John Walsh does great work on Bere Island.  This art degree course is a great story for Sherkin Island and it has secured the future going forward.  Everybody needs to be commended in this regard, and for making sure the funding is kept in place.</p><p> I appreciate the opportunity to say all of this.  When it looked like the course was doomed, we were going to afford the stakeholders the opportunity to give evidence to the committee and to let the nation know the benefit of the course not just to Sherkin Island, but to the whole State.  However, as I said, the snow intervened and this may have allowed a little extra space and breathing time for this matter to be resolved.  Thankfully, it has been resolved and I am delighted all the witnesses are here today.  I second Senator O'Donnell's proposal that the committee members visit the islands.  It would be great to educate ourselves and to see what is going on, although we may or may not get to all the islands.  I would be quite happy to do that.</p></speech>

In 2017 the Arts Council introduced a new strategic funding scheme.  Arts and Disability Ireland was lucky enough to be one of eight organisations selected for that multi-annual funding.  This means that we got our funding, like everybody else, in December 2017, for January-December  2018.  From September 2018, however, we will know what our funding is for 2019.  While it is a modest step forward, and the number of organisations involved is small - it is just eight of all the client organisations - it is something this committee can explore a bit more with the Arts Council and perhaps encourage it to roll the model out to more organisations in the future.</p></speech>

We are all interlinked and there is huge commonality between all of us.  Policy was one of the issues referred to.  When we consider this policy, our island imports third level education but we cannot educate our youth.  We are inter-generational, but on the flip side in five years' time, we will lose all our children because one cannot get a primary level education on Sherkin Island.  One can, however, get a third level degree.  It makes no sense and the policy works against us.  The policy exists for the mainland.  The Senator asked how come the committee did not know about Sherkin Island.  I am letting the committee know about the other issue we have, and which people need to know about.</p> <p>  The representatives from the National College of Art and Design spoke of progression.  Our students' progression shows how they go on to master's degrees and PhDs, and we have all the figures on this from the BA in visual art course.  They also go on to work in places such as McAuley Place centre, they contribute to the Bealtaine festival and they work with people who have a disability and there are people on the programme with a disability.  We are all holding hands on this, and we all need to be recognised together.  To have the opportunity to appear before the committee today is massive, especially for us, although I am sure for everyone else as they have said.  We thank the committee for that opportunity.</p> <p>  A question was asked about the standards.  The standard of art coming out of the degree course on Sherkin Island is phenomenal.  Ms O'Neill Collins will speak to the committee about this aspect as it is her area of expertise.  I am in the background all the time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-20a.818" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Majella O'Neill Collins" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22018062000002#K00500"><p>It is.  We have 64 students who have gone through over the last 15 years.  None of those students has just left and put their tools away.  They are practising artists, they do PhDs, they travel abroad and they are involved in arts and health.  There is a plethora of things they are involved in.  The West Cork Arts Centre in Skibbereen helps to give them jobs and everything feeds into everything else, but the most important thing is the community's involvement.  There is ownership there.  If a community feels the respect when people come in, that the community is part of it also, then the world is the artist's oyster at that point.  We have an 86 year old graduate.  When she embarked on the course everyone thought she was definitely going to go down a very safe route artistically.  This student, however, became very involved in video.  She came to the course painting and drawing, but she actually learned technology and has just opened an exhibition.  The students who have gone on keep coming back.</p> <p>  I was so proud on the day that Dr. Michael Birchall from the Tate Modern came over from Liverpool.  I thought that we had arrived because people outside of Ireland were now looking at us.  Yet, we use all our energy to basically keep the lights on because the funding does not come.  Somewhere along the line some members of the committee will have to come and see us.  They should do so at the end of May when the degree students put on an exhibition in the abbey.  The abbey is not open during the year but it opens for those two days.</p></speech>

I have visited Sherkin Island and know it well.  It is a beautiful island.  There is no better experience than being on an island.  People constantly speak of the need for connectivity but sometimes we also need to disconnect and there is no better place to achieve disconnection than on an island.  Members have asked many of the questions I intended asking.  One of the points underlined, however, was that we do not need to locate all third level education in Dublin or the other big cities.  Thousands of people are moving from counties around the country into the big towns and cities where they are encountering serious problems such as the accommodation crisis.  Something like an outreach campus in different parts of the country could allow students to remain in their locality and facilitate the cross-pollination of their ideas.  These could eventually develop for the counties in question, rather than having everything located into Dublin.</p> <p>  On the arts and older people, somewhere along the line we have inverted our value system in regard to older people.  We talk about being a more inclusive society but in many ways we fracture people from general society.  One of the points made, and it is a line I like, was that we are one community.  That is an important part of policy development in that the more integrated we are, the stronger and better we will be at all levels.  What has been the reception among older people for the services and the arts the organisations are delivering?</p> <p>  Mr. Naughton's point about a woman who read a book by Shakespeare but only consumed the play 17 years later was amazing.  It was not something that I had thought about previously.  Mr. Naughton also referred to large drop in the number of audio described performances.  Perhaps he could talk us through why that has happened and what steps are needed to reverse this decline.  </p> <p>  I have one question for all of the witnesses.  The stable funding model is key because all those with whom I work who receive State funding find that continually chasing this funding exhausts a good chunk of their resources.  The Government and Departments hate multi-annual funding because budgets change and the idea of committing to the future presents a challenge for them.  What is the best way to address this issue with the Departments?</p> <p>  My final question is one that people do not like to discuss in these types of forums.  The Departments that fund the work of the witnesses' organisations measure them in certain ways.  In what ways are they measuring outputs and in what ways should they measure them?  I ask the witnesses to deal with those questions. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-20a.822" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Margharita Solon" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22018062000002#L00400"><p>I will comment first and Mr. Rowntree will follow me.  When we were trying to build McAuley Place originally, it took us three years to get our first planning permission.  When we finally went to the relevant Department for funding, we were told that we would not get it.  Our understanding was always that we would get funding once we secured planning permission.  It was at that stage that we were told we were evaluated in respect of bricks and mortar.  If we had gone for a greenfield site on the periphery of the town, a new building would have cost less than working in the heart of the town on a listed building.  We said this was surely about more than bricks and mortar.  It was about brownfield development, bringing new life into an area of the town that had not been working very well, engaging the whole community, keeping people out of nursing homes and promoting the arts as a tool for well-being.  We were told, however, that we could only be evaluated in respect of bricks and mortar.  The process is skewed.</p> <p>  It costs &euro;25 an hour for one hour of care for an older person.  We provide community-based care for older people and enabling people to remain independent in their own homes.  I refer to one hour of care.  There are 168 hours in a week.  McAuley Place should be evaluated on what it is doing to keep older people in their own homes but engaged and connected, including intergenerationally.</p> <p>  I will make one more point, after which Mr. Rowntree may wish to comment.  The Chairman asked about the reaction of older people to the arts.  I will give a fantastic example of an older couple where the wife was instrumental in setting up adult education in Naas.  As they had no children, they did not have grandchildren and were not connected with younger people.  They were participating in an arts project and the gentleman was the carer for his wife.  She was thrilled to see him engaged intergenerationally with all these people but he was also thrilled to see her engaged with them.  The participants broke up into groups and worked with the arts facilitator.  We will call this gentleman Jim, which is not his real name.  He came over to me that evening and said, "You are never going to believe this but Jane came over to me and asked if I would be her partner in this project".  He did not know why a primary school child would want to be connected to him.  He could not believe it but the child did not see the age or connectivity or anything else.  Jim's wife died and although they did not have children or grandchildren, he is still connected with the wider community.  He comes to the tai chi classes in McAuley Place and has lunch in the tea rooms.  I could speak of such cases for the rest of the evening.  </p></speech>

My mother is 96 years old and she said that one of the things that kills her the most is that she has no new stories to tell.  If she is watching, if she is going out and seeing things - even if she does not participate - there is a stimulus and the brain synapses are firing because something new is being seeing and eventually we get little Jane coming over and asking for help.  It is osmosis and a person just becomes part of it eventually, if it is there, as opposed to having to go and sign up to be in it.  If it is all around a person, it percolates up and he or she becomes part of it.</p></speech>

There are many activities that we do not promote effectively.  We do not offer the invitation effectively to people to participate and we do not seek the audience.  We expect the audience and we have to be smarter about seeking it.  If someone goes to those people, knocks on their door, makes contact and asks if they would like to participate, I guarantee that most of them will say "Yes".  That is because someone has taken the time to visit them.  They will come then.  There is life and there has to be life beyond city boundaries.  If we do not have that, we will kill rural Ireland.  It is that simple.</p> <p>  We have a demographic timebomb and it is ticking.  We have to consider how to address the impact of that timebomb in respect of urban versus rural.  If we concentrate all our services and activities in urban areas, the impact will be more isolation in rural communities.  Communities will not die, not people, because let us face it, when we talk about communities dying, we also mean people will die.  We have to prevent that.  We have to make interventions which are structured and the arts are critical to that success.  </p> <p>  The Chair also asked about indicators of success.  We have to move away from expenditure driven indicators to performance and outcome driven indicators.  The Government has to be smarter about the questions it asks in respect of what is brought to the table.  Turning to the big process, all the organisations here, and others, have to be given the opportunity in the bidding process to state what outcomes they will deliver in return for the expenditure they seek.  They must then be held to account for those outcomes.  That is a smarter way to do business.  If we are to drive the arts into a business environment, then we have to encourage arts organisations to think of themselves as businesses.  We have to let them tell us their story and measure them against the outcomes that business would expect to be held against.  This is not about allocating funds and just seeking an expenditure trail.  We have to go way beyond that.  If we have these focused outcomes, the Government, in its summary report, will have a great news story to tell the public.  </p></speech>

These issues were raised in one of the other questions.  Bealtaine was founded in 1995 and has grown in each of the 23 years since.  It depends on the participation of more than 100,000 people living in every county in Ireland, so it is self-evident in one way.  That is not said complacently but the organisation would not exist 23 years after it was founded if there was no demand.  As I alluded to earlier, we carry out a survey every year.</p><p>We are required to do so, but we also want to know what people think of what we do.  The results are completely overwhelming in the sense that people say things that are very personal to us.  For example, they have said, "This has helped me find a sense of self," "I need more activities like this," "I came with my carer" or "I came with my son or daughter," and "it helps us to connect to go to things together."  There is a strong demand for this, but, as I said, it has been around for 23 years and depends on the participation of more than 100,000 people every year.</p><p> On the issue of trying to reach people, we are in partnership with other organisations.  We are in partnership with the National College of Art and Design, NCAD, in the creative life programme in Mercers Hospital that Professor Glennie mentioned.  We reach people in medical settings, but we approach them in a non-medical way, as described by Ms Solon.  We are in partnership with Arts and Disability Ireland in trying to create greater access for older people in general to the events we run.  We are working through that network.  We are in partnership with the Irish Museum of Modern Art which Ms O'Donoghue represents, as well as Age and Opportunity Ireland.  That is a smattering of the hundreds of organisations with which we partner.  </p><p> A key initiative is a residency programme we run in a care home setting.  It has been very important.  We definitely need more support for the programme.  Very often care home settings are not like McAuley Place which is the standard bearer for a creative care home setting.  There are many absolutely miserable care home settings.  The programme is competitive.  Each time we have run it - twice - there has been great upset when care homes did not win.  Sometimes mass is considered to be an activity in a care home setting, as is bingo.  Members can take their pick.  When an artist goes into such a setting to work for two or three months, it changes completely not only the residents but also their families who see a noted change in them.  The staff working in the organisations learn the importance of creativity. </p><p> On the question of measurement, as we live in a neoliberal world, in general, measurement has become quantitative.  We understand the need to judge things in terms of figures.  That is one way of measuring things, but it is a very poor way to measure the arts and life in general.  We would all say the impact of the arts and culture is long-term.  Therefore, we need a long-term measurement.  The change will not happen in one day or one year.  Arts and culture have a long-term impact, which is the reason it is very rich over time which changes lives.  There are long-term studies and national surveys in Ireland.  We all hope the arts are tied into all of the national surveys.  In that context, the qualitative measurement is equally as important as the quantitative measurement.  None of us has a problem with keeping figures, even though we have a very low capacity to do so.  Capacity is needed to keep figures.  People need to monitor them, but it is the qualitative internal change that really matters.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-20a.828" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P&aacute;draig Naughton" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22018062000002#M00200"><p>To answer that question and picking up from where Dr. Byrne finished, for the first time this year Arts and Disability Ireland worked with Bealtaine.  One of the reasons we were interested in doing so was that the majority of people with a disability acquired it.  That is particularly true of older people.  We have found anecdotally - this is something we started to test and explore with Bealtaine - that the way to encourage people who acquire disabilities, older people in particular who need audio description and captioning, or the loop system, is to get them to say they need these systems or to make use of them.  That is part of the reason behind the work we are doing with Bealtaine.</p> <p>  To answer the question on the drop in the use of audio description and captioning as it relates to the theatre from 2014 through to 2017, there are a number of reasons for it.  One is that the model we were using with the Arts Council to deliver audio description and captioning nationally was its touring and dissemination at work scheme.  It was funding theatre, performance and visual arts companies to tour nationally.  The number of tours has got smaller in recent years.  They are visiting fewer venues and the tours are shorter.  That has meant fewer opportunities to provide audio description and captioning.  When we started to provide audio description and captioning on national tours, the first production, pre the touring and dissemination at work scheme, was Fishamble's "The Pride of Parnell Street" in 2011 when we visited eight venues.  It is now untypical for a tour to be that long or for us to get the opportunity to work on a tour that long.  We are in discussions with the Arts Council to change the model, whereby we would work with specific venues.  That was one of the reasons I mentioned the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  There are still recommendations that could, if properly activated, make a big difference.  If we were to move to a venue-based approach, we could take a longer term view and support a number of shows each year at specific venues throughout the country to develop them as hubs and an audience for access.  </p> <p>  The issue of resources is a concern which I have heard the operators of venues discuss regularly.  I am heading to Belfast to attend the Theatre Forum conference.  Those who are members of Theatre Forum have spoken about this issue extensively.  They are feeling squeezed.  The Arts Council, local authorities and others want to support the arts groups that come into venues, but they do not necessarily want to support their running costs.  The truth is that in the short to medium term access will cost them a good deal of money, more than what they have.  There will, therefore, be a need for more investment.</p></speech>

I am now the director of the NCAD; therefore, I have worked between two departments.  Since taking over as director of the NCAD, having regard to the relationship with the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education and Skills, what is expected of us is much clearer.  There is a very clear policy framework under which we operate.  There is also a very developed conversation about what our role is in that policy framework.  It may not be a policy with which we always agree, but there is a very clear set of objectives.  As the director of a national cultural institution, there was no real evaluation because there is still an absolute absence of policy at national level on what is expected from the arts sector.  The conversation about evaluation did not happen.</p> <p>  I also say, more generally , in terms of a conversation about participation, that it is very important to think about how it can be supported.  To echo a little of what Dr. Byrne said, it has to be seen in a broader, more holistic sense than just numbers.  What is often left out in these conversations is consideration of supports for those who are making the culture in which we want people to participate.  Recently much emphasis has been placed on support of participation in enabling audiences which is incredibly important, but it must be balanced by support for the makers.  Speaking for an education institute that is making the future makers, we want them to be able to come to a country where our artists can sustain a viable practice and stay here.  Many artists leave because currently it is a very difficult place in which to maintain a professional practice.  We are in jeopardy of losing generations of artists.  We have all heard about the value of the work all of our artists across all sectors contribute to society.  That is very much lost in much of the discussion on arts funding and the thinking about the arts in Ireland.</p></speech>

A couple of my friends recently attended a festival on Inis O&iacute;rr.  Is it apparent to Ms Moran or Ms O'Neill that conversations are taking place locally, nationally and internationally between agencies and educational institutions on the arts on the islands?  Have they connected with arts initiatives on other islands such as the festival on Inis O&iacute;rr?  What is their view of the arts on the islands?</p> <p>  My boyfrend raved about the NCAD degree show and I heard great things about it elsewhere.  I thank Professor Glennie and Professor Jordan for the facilitation of the powerful performance of "Not At Home on St. James's Street".  The NCAD is located in one of my favourite parts of the city.  I travel that way on the bus to Inchicore.  It is a changing area and the NCAD's sense of place is obviously strong.  What are the delegates' views on the development of the area?  There seems to be much gentrification.</p> <p>  As regards the NCAD's outreach programme, Dominic's Community Centre in Tallaght was part of the programme while I was mayor of South Dublin County Council.  What can Professor Glennie tell me about the current position in terms of the arts in prisons?   I know that the NCAD is no longer involved, but has the space been left vacant or has the role been filled?</p> <p>  On the Bealtaine Festival, creativity begins in communities, at home and at school and such festivals provide a great platform for emerging artists.  One of my first gigs was at the Harold's Cross community festival.  Is Ms Byrne of the opinion that people are a loyal audience?  She mentioned that she kept in touch with people, formed a network and built audiences.</p> <p>  Ms Johnston of Arts and Disability Ireland may have wished to make a contribution during the opening statements.  She may wish to use her time in response to me to make her points.</p> <p>  I thank the representatives of McAuley Place for their attendance.  We have heard that care homes can be a miserable environment.  I have carried out some research into the subject.  The first openly LGBT generation of older people may be considering entering nursing homes.  Some may have the fear of God in going back into an institution.  I am sure there are many creative people in McAuley House which is a great example of looking forward to that stage of life.  On intergenerational interaction, I attend a music session every week with my 70 year old neighbour and it is one of my favourite parts of the week.</p> <p>  I thank all of the delegates.  I hope I have not asked too many questions.</p></speech>

Our neighbours, St. James's Hospital and the Digital Hub, are centres of new thinking and innovation, of which we see ourselves as part.  A very strong identity is coming from the area in terms of it being a place where the future will be imagined, whether by artists, the research being carried out in St. James's Hospital or the work being done in the Digital Hub.  As Senator Fintan Warfield stated, there is a very strong history and sense of community in the area and it is very important that it be retained.  The potential of creative practice is relevant in that regard.  Several of our projects have worked with groups.  We encourage students to work directly with community groups such as Bridgefoot Community Gardens or the big ongoing European funded project which is looking at the space of the artist in a local community.  A local parade was one of the events to emerge from the latter project.  In such environments creative practice is one of the tools with which people understand the sense of place.  The critical engagement with space is very often enabled by engagement with creative practice, to which we remain very committed.  Dublin 8 is emerging as a very exciting area.</p></speech>

On the changing stages and evolving phases in the area, it is very important not to forget the demographic represented in the Dublin 8 area, particularly in social housing.  There are many questions about the development of the area.  Culture lies at the heart of many of the community development movements from parish level to community activism.  The NCAD and the IMMA have worked for years to that end and I would like to see that work recognised, developed and supported.</p></speech>

However, we want to become a year-round development agency such that we will not just be associated with the festival that takes place in May.  We are seeking support in that regard.  Some people tell us that our festival matters but ask why we only have it in May.  We would retain it as the flowering of everything that happens throughout the year, but we want to have ongoing activity.  We started it in a small way though our residency schemes in nursing homes, which are expensive but have longitudinal benefits.  I mentioned cultural companions, a kind of cultural buddy network for older people.  It is a key audience development initiative of ours which we are expanding.  It was originally offered in approximately five counties, but we did not have enough funding for it to continue.  It is now very successful in Dublin, but we are trying to roll it out again elsewhere.  It is developing in counties Wexford and Clare.  However, it is needed nationwide because it addresses social isolation, as well as issues of common interest.</p></speech>

When we surveyed them, 94% of people with disabilities said they had cut back on at least one of their social activities in the previous five years.

We are very appreciative of his comments.  I reassure him that McAuley Place is very welcoming for everyone and will continue to be so.  We hope to build on this.</p> <p>  We would love to see more benchmarking data across the platform.  We would like to see data available in order that we could compare ourselves not just in Ireland but also in other regions and see how we bring it to the table.  I also believe we have to measure not just success but also look at restrictions.  We have to look at the impacters that impact on success.  That would inform policy development which would then inform the strategies which would, in turn, inform the bidding process and the outcome and measurement provisions.  The critical aspect is how we look at the arts in their collective and plural fashion and across many platforms.</p> <p>  We do have an issue where in many deprived communities education is one thing that impacts on continuing deprivation.  So many people who are educated leave those communities.  We have to continue to develop role models within them in order that we can sustain lifelong learning in them.  There is no point in having a goal of creating an educational intervention if it is not retained and sustained within communities.  The arts are part of that framework of success which is critical to the success of the regeneration and continued development of communities.</p></speech>
