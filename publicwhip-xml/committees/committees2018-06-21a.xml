    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-21a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018062100002#A00700"><p>I thank the Chairman.  Key areas of responsibility of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade include foreign policy advice and co-ordination, promotion of Ireland&rsquo;s economic interests abroad, management of the country&rsquo;s development aid programme and provision of passport and consular services for Irish citizens.  The activities and running costs of the Department are funded under two Votes.</p> <p>  Gross expenditure under Vote 28 - Foreign Affairs and Trade amounted to &euro;215 million in 2016.  Administration subheads accounted for 71% of that expenditure.  The largest element of this was the salary costs of some 1,280 staff, which came to just under &euro;79 million.  Office premises expenses of &euro;23 million included costs associated with Ireland&rsquo;s network of embassies and missions abroad.  The bulk of the non-administrative expenditure related to contributions to international organisations and grants for support services for Irish emigrants.  Receipts into the Vote comprised mainly fees related to the issue of passports and visas, and other consular services.  These receipts were approximately &euro;12.3 million, or 30%, ahead of the level projected for the year, probably reflecting the first impacts of the UK Brexit vote in mid-2016.  A net surplus of just over &euro;8.7 million was liable for surrender to the Exchequer at the end of the year.</p> <p>  Vote 27 - International Co-operation is administered by the Department&rsquo;s development co-operation division and funds approximately two thirds of Ireland&rsquo;s official development assistance, with a particular focus on sub-Saharan Africa.  The 2016 appropriation account for the Vote records gross expenditure of nearly &euro;485 million.  A surplus of nearly &euro;2 million was liable for surrender to the Exchequer.</p> <p>  Chapter 14 of my report was compiled to provide an overview of the control systems in place in respect of bilateral assistance provided under Vote 27 and to review changes in the Department&rsquo;s administrative procedures for bilateral assistance following a significant fraud in Uganda in 2012.  Some &euro;386 million, or just over half of Ireland&rsquo;s development assistance, was applied as bilateral assistance.  Bilateral assistance is the provision of direct assistance to a developing country through a variety of channels, including the country&rsquo;s government agencies, non-governmental organisations, international agencies and missionary societies.  The remainder of the development assistance budget was applied as multilateral assistance, where contributions to international agencies or organisations are pooled and applied for development purposes.  </p> <p>  Figure 1, which is now on screen, shows the breakdown of bilateral assistance in 2016.  As can be seen in figure 1, a key element of Ireland&rsquo;s programme is the targeted delivery of assistance to eight selected key partner countries under long-term strategic partnerships.  Assistance provided under these partnerships is managed primarily by the Irish embassy in the partner country.  A five-year country strategy plan is drawn up for each of the key partner countries, outlining a framework of how the embassy will accomplish certain target outcomes.  A review of the country strategy plans for each of the eight key partner countries conducted as part of the examination identified that only five of the strategies were current.  The Department&rsquo;s objective is to have new strategies completed and approved in time to coincide with expiring strategies.  However, where there are significant changes in the key partner country, either regionally or nationally, or where a mid-term review suggests that a strategy is worth continuing, the strategy may be extended.</p> <p>  Given the nature of development assistance and the context in which it is delivered, the risk of fraud, corruption and misappropriation are significant factors to be taken into account by all donor countries.  Following the discovery in 2012 of a significant fraud involving Irish funds in Uganda, the Department has revised its assurance process for the development assistance programme.  More emphasis is now being placed on pre-funding assessment, monitoring and evaluation of projects and systematic review of external audit findings.  Members of the committee who travelled to Tanzania last month will have had the opportunity to examine the practical application of that framework.</p> <p>  At the time we were completing the report, the Department had not reported publicly on suspected frauds in funded organisations or on the percentage of assistance funds that is lost to fraud.  In 2016, 12 instances of fraud were reported in funded partner organisations amounting to potential losses of &euro;312,000 or 0.043% of Irish development assistance funding provided in 2016.  When recovered amounts of &euro;126,000 were accounted for, the potential net loss was 0.026%.  This is broadly in line with the levels reported by a number of government aid agencies in other jurisdictions.  The Department has agreed a recommendation to develop a methodology to publish information in respect of frauds and alleged frauds affecting Irish Aid funds awarded to partner organisations, most likely through its departmental annual report.</p></speech>

I ask Mr. Burgess to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-21a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Burgess" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018062100002#B00200"><p>I thank the Committee of Public Accounts for inviting me to assist it in its consideration of the 2016 appropriation accounts for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade - Votes 27 and 28 - and Chapter 14 of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s 2016 report on the control of Ireland's bilateral assistance programme.  As the Chairman mentioned, I am joined by some colleagues from the Department who may be helpful to the committee: Ms Fiona Penollar, who is our director of passport services; Ms Barbara Cullinane, who is our head of strategy and performance; Mr. Ruair&iacute; de B&uacute;rca, who is the head of Irish Aid, Ms Caitr&iacute;ona Ingoldsby, who is the head of our Irish abroad unit; and Mr. Austin Gormley, who is the head of our corporate services division.  I know the committee has been supplied with material which provides a factual summary of the main areas of departmental expenditure and receipts in 2016.  I do not propose to repeat that orally.  The programme structure for Vote 28 corresponds with the Department's strategy statement, which sets out its work in five priority areas: providing a service to Irish citizens, engaging actively in the European Union, promoting our values internationally, advancing our prosperity and strengthening our influence.  Vote 27 is structured around a single expenditure programme based on poverty and hunger reduction.</p> <p>  We have been building strength around a cluster of issues which are disproportionately important to longer-term development.  We have done this while keeping the most vulnerable people in mind at all times.  Some of the most important issues in this context are access to education and health opportunities for women and girls, support to civil society, social support for the most vulnerable people, good governance, small-scale agriculture and childhood nutrition.  The humanitarian challenges arising from conflict, political instability and climate change have reached unprecedented levels in Syria, Yemen, Myanmar, South Sudan, the Horn of Africa, southern Africa and northern Nigeria.  It is estimated 3 million people were forced to leave their homes as a result of conflict and persecution in 2017, bringing the number of refugees and displaced people to an all-time high of 68 million.  Against this background, we have directed new funding to more recent crises while maintaining a visibility and influence beyond our size, especially in refugee-hosting countries such as Uganda, Ethiopia and Tanzania.  It is against this background of change and challenge that the Government has committed to publishing a White Paper on Ireland's international development co-operation programme that will guide progress towards meeting the target of allocating 0.7% of gross national income to overseas development assistance by 2030.  I acknowledge the work of Members of the Oireachtas in compiling a report on Irish Aid earlier this year.  This useful report is informing our thinking as this work is brought forward.</p> <p>  I want to address an issue which is topical for most if not all offices in the Oireachtas.  I refer to the impact that the unprecedented demand for passports is having on the delivery of passport services to the public.  Responsive public service is the bedrock of this Department's work.  This can take the form of support for emigrant communities, consular care for Irish citizens abroad or the delivery of passports.  We aim for continuous improvement in our service on the one hand, and easier access to services for our citizens on the other.  Everything else is built on this foundation.  I say this as someone who spent some of the most satisfying years of my career living and working with Irish communities abroad.  For some years now, we have been working towards a thorough overhaul and renewal of the passport system aimed at providing a better, more responsive and more accessible service.  The Irish passport card was a significant innovation and the first of its type.  This facility for our citizens is unmatched by other countries.  Our passport booklet is rated among the four most advanced and secure in the world.  This is one of the reasons Irish citizens need so few visas for international travel, including to the US.  The ongoing development of our online service allows citizens to apply from home and receive their passports in a matter of days.  This goes hand in hand with robust procedures to verify and protect the identities of applicants.</p> <p>  As we take pride in what we do, it is a matter of immense frustration for us that some categories of passport application are taking longer to process than we had planned, that we are unable to answer all telephone calls to the Passport Office and that many people are concerned they will not receive their passports in time for their travel plans.  I see the efforts being made by my colleagues in the Passport Office to get us back on target.  I also see their immense grace under pressure as they answer telephone calls and deal with callers to the office.  Our responsibility to verify and protect the identities of the citizens involved and ensure the integrity and international reputation of the Irish passport means that lost and stolen passports and first-time applications take longer.  If one calls the Passport Office, however, one should get an answer.  If we are frustrated at what we cannot do, our customers are even more so.  The telephone service is not what it should be at present and I apologise for that.</p> <p>  It important to provide reassurance that the service is working well for the most part.  All applications processed online are issued within days.  For those using this channel, the service from the Passport Office has improved immeasurably over the past 12 months.  All renewals are being issued on time.  This improvement on last year has been achieved even though the past six months have been the busiest in our history, with our activity having increased by 8.5% since last year.  Most queries are being answered, with approximately 9,500 queries being answered in the past week.  Processing times are in line with international norms and are coming down.  I believe we will meet all our targets by next month.  In the meantime, nobody affected by these delays who is at risk of missing a travel deadline has been turned away.  In the short term, probably before the end of this year, child renewals will go online.  This will reduce waiting times and extend the benefits of the new system to more families.  This would not be possible without the support of the members of this committee and their colleagues across the Oireachtas who have helped us to get clear information to applicants, who have guided them through the process and who have brought urgent cases to our attention.  I acknowledge this assistance and thank Deputies and Senators for it.</p> <p>  Votes 27 and 28 support a great diversity of work undertaken on behalf of the State and its citizens.  I have referred to the commitment of our colleagues in the Passport Office.  I see that commitment across the mission network, which itself comprises great diversity.  I was delighted to attend yesterday's launch by the T&aacute;naiste of the Department&rsquo;s LGBT+ staff network, which is the first such network in the Civil Service.  This complements the considerable amount of work that is already under way to advance gender equality in the Department.  This initiative is part of an agenda that seeks to foster a culture of respect and equality to the benefit of staff, of the Department and, ultimately, of those we serve.  Across its offices in Ireland and its missions overseas, the Department has staff members of approximately 70 nationalities.  They speak 40 languages and work in 90 locations worldwide to support Irish citizens and represent Ireland's voice and interests on the international stage.  My colleagues and I are ready to respond to any questions that may be posed by the members of the committee on additional issues across our Votes.</p></speech>

Before I call the first speaker, I want to mention one aspect of the passport situation briefly.  We might come back to it later.  I thank Mr. Burgess for the information on processing times, which we have received in the last day or so.  I want to verify some of what Mr. Burgess has said and highlight the problem areas that exist.  Am I right in saying that the only applications which can be made online are renewals?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-21a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Burgess" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018062100002#B00400"><p>Only adult renewals can be done online at present.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-21a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018062100002#B00500"><p>I do not think Mr. Burgess said exactly that.  Over 100,000 renewals have been processed so far this year.  Over 90% of them have been processed within ten working days.  As we all know, some renewals are processed within two or three working days.  That is an excellent service.  I will mention the biggest issue that people have.  Traditionally, many people go through the passport express system.  There have been 100,000 renewals through that system so far this year.  The Passport Office's target is to deal with passport express applications within 21 days.  The real problem is that approximately 50% of such applications are not dealt with within the target time.  So far this year, approximately 27,000 such applications have taken up to six weeks and a further 22,000 have taken up to eight weeks, which is two months.  The difficulty is that when people go through the passport express system, they think it will take three weeks or thereabouts.  When six weeks have passed and they are due to travel the following week, but they have not yet received their passports, it can be very difficult to retrieve their applications from that channel of application to speed them up in another way.  That is the difficulty people are having with passport express applications.</p> <p>  In essence, we are moving on.  I would like to draw a comparison with an area of another Department.  There was a time when people used to tax their cars by going to the local authority office.  Then they started doing it by post, and now over 70% of people tax their cars online.  Their applications are turned around within 48 hours and they get their tax discs back.  The Passport Office needs to go there.  It is going there.</p><p>Passport Express is the slow lane and the online service the fast lane.  I acknowledge that first-time applicants cannot use the online service, but people need to be told that while the turnaround target is three weeks, this is not possible in 50% of cases.  If many of those who had used the Passport Express service had known about the delays, they would have used the online service.  The Department needs to encourage people to renew their passports online, where possible.  It needs to be more proactive in that regard.  Staff in post offices are probably aware that 50% of applications submitted via the Passport Express service will not be processed within the target period, but it is not their job to inform people of this.  It is the responsibility of the Department to encourage people to use the online service, where possible.  I accept that staff in the Passport Office are under tremendous pressure, but the Department needs to step up the move to the online service, where possible.  Will Mr. Burgess comment briefly before we move on to the next item of business?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-21a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Burgess" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018062100002#C00200"><p>I accept that Passport Express is the slow lane, but in its day, it provided an effective and rapid turnaround service.  We anticipated the pressure that would be exerted on the Passport Office this year.  From the outset of the year, we have engaged in an intensive communications campaign aimed, in particular, at getting the word out locally that, where possible, people should make their applications online.  We have done approximately 35 local radio interviews and also worked heavily through local media.</p> <p>  Most Passport Express applications are processed on time within the 15-day target.  Where applications made via Passport Express are first-time applications or for the replacement of a lost passport, a series of checks kick in, which delays processing.  The frustration is being felt by families who have booked holidays where one child has not previously held a passport.  The passports are bundled together, but owing to the making of a new application, we are working to a different timeframe.  Where we know that someone is at risk of missing a deadline, we will pull the application and process it.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the extraordinary work done by personnel in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, with many of whom I have had the privilege of dealing in the past few months on passport applications.  I have no complaints about the manner in which they carry out their duties.  I also recognise with some appreciation Mr. Burgess's reference to the launch of the LGBT+ staff network, particularly among his own staff, which is commendable, given the week that is in it.</p> <p>  I propose to focus first on the overseas aid programme and later the passport service.  I was one of the three members of the committee who travelled recently to Tanzania, with the clerk, staff of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Mr. de B&uacute;rca.  It was an eye-opening and extremely worthwhile visit to understand what the Irish overseas aid programme delivers.  It is without doubt a worthwhile project across the globe.  While some of my experiences were harrowing, others were incredibly uplifting.  I also thank Mr. de B&uacute;rca for the information he supplied the ambassador, Mr. Sherlock, and his staff in Dar es Salaam and also his personal staff for their extraordinary hospitality.</p> <p>  There is reference in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and also in Mr. Burgess's opening statement to the publication of statistics and analysis of fradulent transactions within the budget.  In his opening statement Mr. McCarthy referenced that the figure of 0.026% was in line with international norms.  My understanding is it is the after recovery figure.  The figure of 0.43% for 2016 is above the norm.  Perhaps Mr. McCarthy might comment on the matter.</p></speech>

If it was 1% on a gross basis, it would be of concern.  When a percentage is so small, the anomalies from year to year are likely to throw up something like it.  I am not be too concerned that it is slightly above some of the figures.  The figures we have quoted in the chapter are for a very small selection of countries.  Internationally, there is not that much information available.  One would need a broader spread of countries presenting this type of information which has to be built up.  To me, watching the figure from year to year would I think yield value for the committee.</p></speech>

Since the 2016 report, we have recovered an additional &euro;60,000.  The process of recovery is continuous and does not stop until we recover the full amount.  In many cases we do not recover the full amount, but it remains a continuous part of our work.</p> <p>  There was a question about international norms.  We work closely with the audit network in other aid agencies and development partners.  Our evaluation and audit team hosted the international auditors' network in Dublin recently.  The intention is to identify and advance best practice among peers.  We see this as a fundamental part of our work.</p></speech>

Some countries publish information and we are looking to do so.  Our network's audit and evaluation team meets the auditors and evaluators to discuss dynamic relationships with organisations which we fund.  This information exchange is intended to avoid getting into a situation where one ends up with suspected fraud.  It is about sharing information on organisational management systems and early information on where we suspect there may be weaknesses.  This allows us to get ahead of any fraud.  The meetings take place on a regular basis.  Often there are only allegations and suspicions rather than proven facts, but actions may be taken on what turn out to be proven facts.  Our work is often prophylactic.  In at least one instance there was theft from a warehouse and no fraud within the system.  We are waiting to see if there will be a insurance payout in this case.  There is a difference between fraud in an accountancy sense and in the sense fraud is understood by the man on the street.  The latter includes trucks which are robbed or warehouses which are burgled.  It does not mean that there is systemic fraud, although even in cases of robbery there may be some insider dealing.</p></speech>

On the positive side, the sustainable development goals provide us with a very specific agreed comprehensive framework for global development.  It is a guide which we did not have in 2013.  That, in itself, is a strong argument for looking again at our policies.</p> <p>  In the past five years the demands on humanitarian assistance as a result of climate change and conflict have been very significant, as has the pull on our development assistance.  We have contributed over &euro;100 million in responding to the Syrian crisis alone since 2012.  The context in which Irish Aid is operating is changing and many of the long-term development partnerships we have are in countries which are also dealing with the issue of climate fragility and very significant refugee-hosting countries.  There is now a compelling reason to stand back and look at the good use being made of our aid and the prospect of a significant increase within a relatively short timeframe requires us to give thought to how best we can use it.</p></speech>

There are extraordinary delays in turnaround compared to the United Kingdom and France.  My office has done some work on this issue and there is anecdotal evidence of the same thing happening in comparison to the USA.  I am trying to understand why it takes so long to obtain a visa.  There are differences of opinion in certain processing offices in different countries and sometimes it depends on the region involved.  I do not say this as a slight on anybody, but I have come across cases where visas were granted, albeit months later, having been refused on a couple of occasions.</p><p>It can be terribly frustrating for an individual who is living and working in the State and contributing tor the community and to the State who wants someone to come over but they are not able to do it.  I am aware of cases where the person goes to visit family in the UK instead because it is easier to get into the UK, even though he or she is not a British passport holder.

I will skip over to the passport issue.  I appreciate the information that has been provided.  Every person I speak to who has gone online and received their passport has expressed surprise at how quickly it has come through.  There is a reaction, especially online, at how extraordinary it is to get a passport on a Tuesday morning that was applied for perhaps on a Sunday morning while the applicant was in his or her pyjamas.  We can see this reaction online.</p> <p>  The negative is that sometimes applications can take longer because of the volume.  If a person is given a realistic projection of how long it might take he or she will not mind if it takes and extra day or two.  The problem we now have, however, is that the stated processing time is up on the website in black and white, and a person may apply and be left waiting.  In my experience this can happen with a lot of people who have new applications, or when a person has an expired passport.  If the service gave people a realistic timeframe I believe they would be far more accepting, especially coming up to the summer when it is going to be busy.</p> <p>  The witness outlined the process of verification very well in his opening statement and explained that the integrity of the system must be maintained, and this is completely accepted.  Is the issue about the number of staff available or is it a printer availability issue?  How many printers are there to print passports across the State? Is there a requirement for more printers?  Has a cost-benefit analysis been conducted on whether it would be a benefit to acquire another printer?  Are the witnesses aware of the per item cost to the Exchequer of each passport application, including the staffing costs, the processing costs and the passport itself?  If the Department does not know this it should.</p></speech>

It is important for the committee to get as much information as possible.  What are the alternatives?  What is the Department looking at with regard to improving the service?  At the outset of the meeting the Chairman and I said how we appreciate the kinds of pressures the service is under.  Would providing an additional printer speed up the process or is it more about the verification process and the staffing hours that are required?</p></speech>

Ms Penollar will speak about the cost per passport.  We have the printer capacity and the machinery that we need.  We have three passport printing machines that are capable of printing more passports per year than we actually process currently.  The blockage in the system is the delay with the checks required for first-time applications and lost passports.  These are far more complicated and they take more time.  On the website we state 33 days, which is the actual turnaround time, but it has been coming down progressively.</p> <p>  On resourcing, we issue the greater part of our passports in the first half of the year.  Over the last couple of years we have seen the surge coming a little earlier each year than it had the previous year.  We take on temporary staff in order to manage this.  We recruit and train these staff and we try to have them in place early.  We had a particular difficulty this year, which lies at the heart of the delays in processing at the moment.  Although we had intended to have temporary staff in place by 1 January, the vetting process for those staff took longer than it had in previous years.</p></speech>

The Garda vetting took longer so we did not have our full complement of temporary staff in January when we needed them.  The management of the balance between temporary staff requirements and full-time staff, and the time that the temporary staff get on board, is a critical factor for us in the Passport Office.  The Deputy has asked what we are looking at for next year and this is one of the issues we will look at particularly closely.</p> <p>  We are involved in a major modernisation process in the passport service and this will address all of these problems over time. We are about half way through that process at the moment.  The introduction of online passports for child renewals, which is on target, will make a significant difference to the processing times and the delays next year.</p></speech>

We have taken it on in blocks and phases.  This involves replacing the software, replacing the machinery and phasing in of improvements over a period of time.  It must be done in a phased way but the most significant improvement over the past year was the adult online renewals.  The child passport renewals online are due to follow.</p></speech>

We must ensure that the guardians of a child have given their permission for the child to have the passport.  The significant difference for child passport online applications is that we will still require signatures.  There will be a required page to be sent in that will purely be the consent of guardians for the child to have the passport.  This is a fundamental principle for the protection of the child and is a significant difference.</p></speech>

Currently there is no requirement for the guardians' consent to be witnessed by a Garda specifically, but we really want to target that witness to being someone who knows the child and has interaction with the guardians, for example a person in the child's school or a public health nurse or doctor.   A witness from that sphere makes much more sense.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the cost per passport.  There are many elements that go into processing the passport.  For commercial reasons I will not go into the specific costs associated with the actual book cost but it is in the region of &euro;10 per standard passport.  A child gets a passport for five years and an adult can get a passport for ten years, so there is proportionally more work in approving a child application.  A standard passport costs between &euro;40 to &euro;50, not including the central costs.  When that is considered and taken into account, the average cost of the child or adult passport is very similar to the fees charged.</p></speech>

We recently went on a trip to Tanzania, and as has already been said by my colleague Deputy Alan Farrell, our hosts went above and beyond the call of duty.  I want to thank the ambassador.  I drew a blank on the name of the head of development, Ms Bronagh Carr.  I give particular thanks to her, and also to Ms Olivia Kinabo, who is with us today.  I will come back to some of the issues in a minute.  On a positive note, the trip was certainly very good.  It certainly was not a junket and it was well worth it.  We experienced a range of projects.  A group of people with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, AIDS, gave us the privilege of seeing them dancing.  We saw a connection between an Irish doctor and Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin.  That hospital is crumbling at the seams in my opinion, yet it was able to work very closely with the doctor and their staff in Tanzania, with both sides learning about the diagnosis of rare cancers. </p><p> I also want to thank the Passport Office.  The word "grace" has been mentioned.  I will get to the negatives in a minute, but certainly my experience with the Passport Office, under great pressure, has been that they operate with great grace.  The interface with the citizen is extremely important.  Of course, the passport is a vital document, so I thank the witnesses for that.  </p><p> Regarding the accounts, a clear audit has been given but there are a number of questions I would like to ask.  I have read it all and I was a tiny bit confused.  I think I am clear now.  Bilateral aid just about gets the bigger amount, and then there is the other aid.  Bilateral aid comes under international co-operation.  I wish to ask the Comptroller and Auditor General if I am correct in that or am I mixed up?  There is multilateral aid and bilateral aid.   </p></speech>

Some &euro;32 million was given to the European Development Fund in 2016.</p> <p>  In regard to the complexity of the funding streams, looking at the amount of funding we give in humanitarian assistance at the moment, we find that the Department has a humanitarian budget line which is specifically used for this.  However, we are also providing humanitarian assistance in our country programmes where there is fragility, refugee populations or instability in those countries.  Moreover, both the European Union and the UN are providing humanitarian assistance as well, and we fund both core activities and specific activities of those organisations.  The overall picture is quite complex.  </p></speech>

I add that it is very difficult to work inside Syria, and our capacity to perform oversight is very limited because we cannot put staff at risk.  As a rule, inside Syria we work with UN agencies or the International Committee of the Red Cross and Red Crescent.  They have robust systems of internal oversight and we can work with them inside the country.  Outside of Syria, people providing support to Syria are a much more mixed group.  We work with some NGOs.  We also work with some international organisations, depending on who is best placed to provide a response.  Given the huge numbers of people involved, there is a scale issue.  That is why working with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees is the most effective and efficient mechanism for us in some instances.</p></speech>

There are many very strong arguments for each of those missions, but one of the really strong arguments for opening and establishing a presence in Amman is that a large part of the crisis assistance to Syria, and indeed the crisis in Yemen, is headquartered in Amman Jordan as well.

That is done.  There is always a challenge between what people want and what resources are available.  That is a different management question but the review of staffing complements has been done.  It was recommended that key senior mission staff should have the skills necessary to manage significant budgets and risks.  That is part of our ongoing training and as such is under way.  Mr. Burgess and I have been working with other members of the senior management team, including the chief financial officer, to carry out a series of visits to all of our missions.  Where we assess that there are skills deficits, we will ask people to do more.  Recommendation No. 7 was on formal management training.  That is part of our pre-posting training suite.</p></speech>

I wonder why the change does not come before.  We are then left asking whether the change has occurred after the synthesis report, after the questions that were raised or after the fraud in Uganda.  That is why I am asking in that context and Mr. de B&uacute;rca is telling me the recommendations have been implemented and the last two are in the process.</p> <p>  I have a practical question on buildings, land and premises.  It appears in both accounts.  I ask about this all the time in terms of what is rented and what is purchased and owned.  Looking at Votes 27 and 28, land and buildings on page 11, is there a schedule of such land and buildings?  How is valuation carried out?  How are decisions made on buying or renting property?  The same applies to Vote 28 on page 11, land and buildings.  If we open the two together under capital assets, one figure is &euro;7.639 million while the other is &euro;156.548 million.</p></speech>

It is a small unit which we are currently expanding.  One of the reasons we are expanding it is because the property market is dynamic and also because needs change in some missions.  We have a policy now of looking at purchase options where that makes sense and where there are long-term savings.  One issue we face in respect of our property budget is rapidly escalating rents.  In many cases, our larger missions are in cities where rents are particularly high and increasing rapidly.</p></speech>

Our constituency offices are a barometer of what works and what does not.  People come into us when something does not work.  Elements of something might work very well while other aspects do not.  We all have the personal experience of people coming to us.  The Department indicated earlier that no one had failed to travel where they had a requirement, but I have had a few.  I had someone who could not get a passport and missed a wedding.  I have had one or two other cases within the last year which would fall into that category.  It is not always entirely the Department's fault if someone looks at his or her passport a week or two before an event, but I have seen cases where it was a couple of weeks before but the person still did not manage to travel.  One particular case sticks out because it was felt to be very hurtful in the family.</p> <p>  Certainly, the online process is working and making a significant difference and I am very pleased to see that the service has been expanded.  The reason people come to our office due to passport express service is because the word "express" and the timelines given give rise to an expectation that people are within time.  However, it then goes a week or two beyond the date but the person has not sent in his or her travel documents as he or she expected fully to receive the passport back within the timeline.  When they cannot get through to the passport office, they get on to us.  That is the scenario.  As such, something must be done to address the communications issue where there is an expectation that it will take longer than the stated time.  It is taking up to eight weeks to get a passport.  It would be useful to communicate that if people are going to travel within eight weeks, they should forward their travel documents.  That would allow the office to determine the applications where it will run into a difficulty.</p><p>This is the experience we have had.  As much as some people believe politicians want constituents to keep queueing up and coming through our doors to access passport services, that is actually not the case.  We want the systems to work for people.  The issue is one of identifying solutions.</p><p> There has been a sizeable increase in the numbers of passport applications arising from Brexit.  Ireland is in a very precarious position because of Brexit.  I presume these numbers will not tail off but will continue at current levels for some time as British people working in the European Union seek to secure a passport from one of the other EU states.  A large cohort of British people would qualify for an Irish passport through Irish parentage rules.  Has the service been future proofed in terms of staffing?  How is this being handled?  Have the increases been projected out in terms of increased staff and, if so, will Mr. Burgess tell us about this?</p><p> Irish passports are sought after and important internationally.  They are European Union passports.  Obviously, they are sometimes lost or stolen and, possibly, misused.  How does the Passport Office deal with that issue?  Does it have a unit or section that deals with it?  Are there costs associated with this?  Is the theft or misuse of an Irish passport solely a matter for the criminal code of the jurisdiction in which it takes place?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-21a.139" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Burgess" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018062100002#H00200"><p>There are people who miss connections because they do not have a passport, and I acknowledge this.  What I was saying was that nobody who is caught up with these delays, who submitted a passport with one expectation in terms of the processing time and then found their application was delayed, and who came to our attention and of whom we are aware, has missed a flight because we will always pull that passport application and try to process it for that person.  If people discover they have lost their passport on the morning they are due to travel, they will miss their flights.  This is happening quite a lot.  We are making determined efforts to ensure nobody suffers by missing a connection because of the delays being experienced in the Passport Office.</p> <p>  Accurate communication is fundamental and information has to be put into people's hands.  We took the view when we looked at our communications for this year that prevention is much better than cure.  Therefore, we have put a lot of effort into communicating clearly ahead of time that if people are travelling this year they should look at their passports early.  We have tried to give clear guidance, through Members of the Oireachtas and local media, on how to do this.  We have kept our processing times accurate on the Department's website.  Communication is fundamental and one of the issues at present is that people feel they cannot reach us, and this is a real problem and concern for us.</p> <p>  On the Brexit dimension, the increase arising through Brexit is not the major part of the increase in demand we are experiencing.  We see most of the Brexit-related increase through Northern Ireland and the UK, and each of these two categories constitutes approximately 10% of the total number of applications coming into the Passport Office.  So far this year, the numbers coming in from Northern Ireland are approximately comparable to last year.  There is no significant spike there, although there is a slight increase.  The increase in applications from the UK is approximately 20% compared with last year.  That is a 20% increase this year on a 10% slice of the passports.  The greater part of the increase has to do simply with the fact that more people are travelling and applying for passports.  People who did not travel in previous years, for one or other reason, are applying now.  This is the greater part of the increase.</p> <p>  We do projections every year, and we have done projections on a range of scenarios on the likely increase arising directly from Brexit.  I will ask Ms Penollar to say a few words on this.  By and large, our projections in the previous year have been in line with what we see each year.  I do not think we have got the projection part of it wrong so far, and we are projecting a range for next year.</p></speech>

I mentioned that we manage the surge in passport applications in the first half of the year with temporary staff.  We are finding it harder this year to hold on to the temporary staff we recruited and trained in January.  They are leaving because they are getting other opportunities, so staff turnover is higher in the Passport Office.  This means we need to look again at the balance between full-time staff and temporary staff when we come to next year.</p> <p>  On stolen passports, I will ask Ms Penollar to speak about the integrity dimension, which is a big part of the passport's work, and which goes unspoken and unreported to a large extent.</p></speech>

On a weekly basis, we have updates on our website on exactly where we are on turnaround times so people know before they choose a channel which one to go down.  It is a lot harder for us when someone is in the Passport Express system.  On one of our busiest days in May alone we received 10,000 applications.  The Deputy can imagine the difficulty we would have extracting one application from 10,000 applications.  The challenge for us is that when we extract an application from Passport Express it has a natural knock-on effect on other people who may not have contacted us because they understood their application would be processed within a certain time.  If we extract applications, other people will be affected so it is very much a balancing act.</p> <p>  The turnaround times shown on the website are live and valid.  Today on the website the turnaround time for first-time, lost or stolen applicants is 33 days for the first time this year and it is 15 days for renewals.  The actual turnaround time is 14 days for renewals and 31 days for the others, but we like to give a buffer as it gives us a bit of flexibility.</p></speech>

Regarding the lost or stolen passports, since 2013 when we introduced a new passport with over 80 security features, we have not actually found an incident where someone has been able to tamper in any credible way with a passport.  Because of the security features it is very hard to substitute a photograph.  It is very hard to doctor the passport.  That is a huge pillar of our protection.</p> <p>  We also have an integrity unit which has very close links, not only here with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and others involved in integrity issues, but also with Interpol.  We have international groupings where we meet and discuss latest trends and risk profiling.  We put an awful lot of emphasis on protecting the integrity because it is so important for every passport holder.  The integrity of the passport means that, as the Deputy says, we can travel.  We have that visa-free travel.  We are either number four or five in the world as a passport for visa-free travel.  That is primarily down to the integrity of the actual physical passport but also the process.  That again comes back to the turnarounds in some areas.</p></speech>

Two centres are funded - the cultural centre in Paris and the arts centre in New York.  Based on replies to parliamentary questions a sizeable amount of funding is given to the arts centre in New York from the US side - way more than is provided from Ireland.  Why have those two locations been selected?  Is it because there is a benefit?  I can see the benefit from New York.  Why, for example, would the cultural centre in the UK not feature where there might be a more significant population than in Paris?  Why does that happen?</p></speech>

When the Irish arts centre in New York was originally conceived - it was not a Government project, but a project that was taken on largely by the Irish community in New York itself - they were conscious of the fact that almost every European community in New York has a platform for its culture in New York.  The Irish arts centre in New York, which was a very small operation, was teaching dance, giving language classes and offering a venue to host young Irish artists who were coming over.  It was really done on a very modest basis.  I think the community itself felt it wanted a platform that was comparable with what other communities have but also was a worthy platform for Irish culture in the US.  By far the greater part of the funding for that project has come from New York City Council-----</p></speech>

I acknowledge the work of our diplomatic corps.  Deputy Farrell and I, through our membership of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, would have occasion to deal with our embassies a couple of times a year and see their work at first hand.  I also have seen this recently in respect of the Inter-Parliamentary Union.  Mr. Burgess talked about communication.  The recent RT&Eacute; documentary showing the working of our missions was very important in getting that out to the wider public.  I acknowledge that at the outset.</p> <p>  A key role of our ambassadors is linked to the promotion of this country, its economic base and the strength of our firms on a global basis.  In that context Martin Shanahan from IDA Ireland spoke about and spoke highly of that work when he was here.  One of the key countries is undoubtedly the US given its influence here in terms of investment.  This week some Members of the Oireachtas have refused to attend celebrations at the US Embassy in the Phoenix Park because of the actions of the US President.  His actions involving the imprisonment of people in meshed cages on the border would not be seen in "Game of Thrones".  I think this man is trying to style himself on Ramsay Bolton, such is the cruelty of the actions he is overseeing</p> <p>  I ask the Secretary General to outline the impact of these globally viewed actions on relations between us and US representatives in the Phoenix Park.  I am conscious of the fine line, given the work of people like Martin Shanahan and the investment he speaks of.  Does that play a role in restricting the Department's response both here and in our embassy in the US when there might be an intention to want to go harder?  It is an extremely important issue this week.  That Members of these Houses are refusing invitations from the US Embassy is a very serious matter from a diplomatic point of view and I would like to hear the Secretary General's thoughts on that.</p></speech>

There is an open and at times robust discussion on many issues, including global and regional.  That is a part of the relationship and it has been a part of the relationship for quite some time now.</p><p>Ireland-US relations are probably unmatched in their richness and complexity outside the European Union.  Martin Shanahan was reflecting one aspect of those relations, which are incredibly important to us but are actually very important to the US as well.  Close to 100,000 US workers are employed by Irish investors in the US. </p></speech>

Therefore there is a reciprocity in this relationship that is very important.  There is a people-to-people dimension to this relationship that is very important as well.  We have vibrant emigrant communities in the US.  We have a vibrant and caring diaspora in the US that has been incredibly important to us and remains so in terms of our own peace process.  We have a very rich cultural relationship as well.  All of that needs to be borne in mind when we talk about these issues.</p></speech>

I do not expect Mr. Burgess to comment politically but I am asking if, from a diplomatic point of view, those actions which are not shared by this country place a strain on those relations.</p></speech>

We were talking earlier, for example, about the situation in Palestine; in the West Bank and in Gaza.  The US withdrawal of funding for UNRWA is having a significant impact on the ground.  In respect of the US withdrawal from the United Nations Population Fund, UNFPA, an organisation we work with closely which deals with issues of gender and equality that we care about deeply, we can see the impact of that on the ground as well.

In the case of the Embassy to the Holy See, I think we have two local staff and a small chancery very close to the Vatican.  That mission has done an extraordinarily good job on limited resources in a very limited period.  It is an example of what we can do with modest resources.  The Global Ireland document refers to looking again at this model.  If there is a single assigned diplomat, in respect of sickness or annual leave there are duty of care considerations for us as a Department.  That would give us concern about the model and the Global Ireland document does refer to progressively phasing it out and increasing the resources we have in very small embassies.</p> <p>  On the cost cutting, that was done on financial grounds.  That is my understanding within the Department and I have never seen any suggestion or evidence to the contrary.</p></speech>

Mr. Burgess touched on the strategy in terms of communication going back to the earlier part of the year and focusing at a local level and on local media.  What lessons have been learned from that in looking towards rolling it out more broadly?  What worked well and did not work well?</p> <p>  At a national level, a few weeks ago the Department got a whole Joe Duffy show to itself.  One knows one has made it when one gets a whole Joe Duffy show.  Communications happen on two fronts.  They happen on a macro level whereby the Department wants to get its message out to advise people as to the best channels to obtain the documents they need.  The biggest thing we would find as public representatives is the frustration people are feeling with the communications at a micro level.  Could Mr. Burgess touch on the communications strategy and on what has worked well on a micro level?  I appreciate that the Department cannot deal with every single telephone call that comes through but it is a frustration for people.</p></speech>

There are people from divisions right across the Department - from Mr. de B&uacute;rca's division in Irish Aid, Mr. Gormley's in corporate services, and Ms Cullinane's in strategy and performance - who are volunteering, working with the Passport Office to help them on communications, particularly on web chat.  We have taken resources from elsewhere to work the phones and we have resources now helping us to deal with the passport backlog as well.  This is a collective, corporate effort across the Department.</p></speech>

That is the biggest issue.  It is one thing acknowledging a representation, phone call or email.  How is it panning out in terms of actually following that through to an end result?</p></speech>

We have the tracker system, with which I am sure many members are familiar.  Over 60% of our conversations with people are to the effect that they saw something on the tracker and they are asking whether it is true.  It is important to give that reassurance.  If we are aware of someone who is travelling on a date who is in any way affected by the delays, we ensure that those people are moved along.  We look at between approximately 200 and 400 people a day with whom we are having such contacts.  That is because we are in the peak of the peak at present.  We have ridden the crest of the wave and are now coming down.  If we were having this conversation in four weeks' time, it would be very different with regard to volumes etc.  It is important that we take on board those lessons and that in future, we put measures in place to ensure that we can improve our communications constantly.  Web chat has been a major development for us this year and has really changed how we are able to interact with people.  In a web chat scenario, one operator can have conversations with six or seven people at a time, which is very different from phones and is a much better situation.  As the Secretary General said, we have, in the past number of weeks, increased our resources there.  We have moved from perhaps a relatively low base but have tripled our web chat in the last four weeks, and we continue to do that, because that is a lesson learned in respect of where we want to go.</p> <p>  With regard to moving from local to national media, a reason we have focused on local media is because it gives more intimacy.  A challenge we have when communicating about passports, which I am sure members have come across many times, is that people only apply once every ten years.  If they are in between that ten-year cycle, to be frank, the message does not really resonate with them because they are not in that position.  That is the huge challenge.  Perhaps when they go to the bedside locker and realise that the passport that they were convinced was in the safest place ever is not there, it is not immediately clear to them what that message was.  The focus on local media is to bring it into that background noise so that they will recall it.  We have found that has worked this year.  We will only increase it and make it work better for us as we go forward.</p></speech>

With regard to elections, there has been much talk of extending the franchise to Irish citizens abroad.  I sit on the Seanad electoral reform group myself.  That has been spoken about with regard to elections too.  Many other countries use their embassies abroad to facilitate that with elections.  What opinion do the witnesses have about replicating that?  Would we be equipped to do that, both from a cost and a practicality point of view?</p></speech>

It is the way our embassies and missions are set up.  Some are very small, modest offices that do not lend themselves to being polling booths.  It is related to our spread.  We are not where even some of the classic Irish communities have been.  We are only opening now in New Zealand, where there is a very large emigrant Irish community.  Newer, recent Irish communities are much more dispersed than the older Irish communities.  In Australia, we have a large Irish community in Perth and in Melbourne.  They will not come to Canberra or to Sydney to vote.  We have also looked at how other systems operate.  I will ask Ms Caitr&iacute;ona Ingoldsby from our Irish Abroad unit to talk about this.  We have been looking at this closely to see how it might be operated.</p></speech>

That options paper currently identifies postal voting as the preferred option for a number of reasons that the Secretary General has outlined.  E-voting is a possible future solution but according to colleagues from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, it is not universally accepted as secure.  Postal voting is the preferred solution at present.  Because our citizens are so displaced and our representational footprint is small compared with the number of citizens we have abroad with, for example, Perth being a five-hour flight from Canberra or Sydney, would we expect our citizens in Perth to take a five-hour flight to cast a vote when casting one by postal vote might be easier?</p></speech>

I raised the issue of online voting with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government yesterday, stressing that point.  We have seen it in smaller nations which have increased their franchise, even in domestic parliamentary elections.  There is a big distinction between electronic voting and online voting.  Online voting allows one to capture that.  I think it would allow our citizens abroad to participate in the democratic process.</p></speech>

The reason I do not want to know is because I want to make the point that, with the turnaround times the Department has, with all the information there, with the web chat, which is a fantastic initiative, and all those steps, it is unfortunate that Members of the Oireachtas, collectively, have to be involved in the process.  I acknowledge that we aid the process and that there are always individuals who might need a bit of extra help, which is what we are here for.  The fact that it is 400 a week is about 375 too many.  I might get a dozen or two dozen in the run-up to the summer and then sporadically across the rest of the year.  Is it an online accessibility issue, a regional issue or a rural issue?  Forgive me, I cannot see Fiona's full name.  Is it Penolly?</p></speech>

Deputy Cassells will be delighted to hear that given his former profession.  It is vital that this is done.  It is not simply that it would reduce what we have to do &ndash; I do not have a problem doing the work &ndash; but at the end of the day the Department is providing the service and we might aid the service.</p> <p>  One important point is that I have to do everything on email.  I have no wish to be taking up the time of personnel in the Passport Office but I would like to be able to telephone them on a dedicated Oireachtas line, as is provided in various other Departments.  That is a necessity.  Maybe it should have limited opening hours but I believe it would aid the process.  If I sent an email about Austin Gormley's passport application, I might get a response.  I would get an acknowledgement but I might not get a response until close of business the following day.  That is not really a big issue, but we have all highlighted cases where it is critical and crucial that we can get in contact.  Deputy Murphy mentioned the person who missed the wedding.  I have no wish to be in a queue, frankly.  I imagine the officials understand that my office deals with a great many issues.  That is something to bear in mind.  If the webchat can be promoted as a mechanism available to the public, it would be fantastic.</p> <p>  I am keen to go back to the total cost of embassies.  It would be helpful for us to be provided with the document that the Chairman has already requested, that is to say, a document with a breakdown of rent versus buy.  We have discussed the matter previously, especially in the crash period between 2011 and 2013, when we were closing embassies among other steps.  The cost of the embassy in Japan was highlighted because it was the most expensive real estate in the world.  Anyway, there is a point at which the State must make a decision on whether it is far better to buy than rent when we have escalating costs and fluctuations in the property market.  We could even use the analogy of the Irish property market - it is a good example.  If a person bought property in 2008 he is lumbered with it for life, whereas if he bought in 2012 he would have paid less than half the price or even less again depending on the property.  One suggested policy direction for the Department to take, in consultation with the Minister, is to upscale the number of purchases that we should pursue rather than a policy of rental.  This is especially relevant in the context of the six new embassies &ndash; which are very welcome &ndash; that are to be opened next year.  Some of these are additional facilities in countries where we already have a base.  However, in other cases there is no base.  The officials referenced Ukraine, which is strategic for us.  Deputy Cassells and I work on the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.  The Russia-Ukraine relationship is important and so on.  I spotted the Ukrainian ambassador wandering around the halls of Leinster House first thing this morning.  The constant interaction with those two countries is important.  The price of property in Kiev is probably only a drop in the ocean compared to Tokyo but the idea should be pursued as far as possible.  The final point I had intended making has been covered.</p></speech>

I figure it is always going to be a mixed portfolio and it will look a little different depending on where we are.  In Cairo, for example, where we have concerns around security and the safety of our staff at the embassy, we are co-located with the Dutch.  We take tremendous benefits from that, not only the natural benefits from working with closely with another EU partner but from some of the systems the Dutch bring because they have a foreign Ministry of scale.  One of the things that we look at as we open more embassies is the option of co-location.</p> <p>  It makes absolute sense in the areas where we have major strategic interests and where the perspective is for rents to continue increasing.  Japan is always going to be an important relationship and platform for Ireland.  That is where we begin in the short term.  Anyway, I completely agree: more often than not when we consider the arguments for purchase the long-term benefits are significant and weight in its favour.</p> <p>  There are some issues around accommodation.  Many of our embassies are very small and families have different needs.  When I was in New York I had my two children with me.  We were a family.  I was succeeded by an officer who did not have children.  We were in accommodation that was rented as standard by the Department.  Sometimes the needs of the individual officer vary as well and in smaller locations it may make sense to look at short-term rentals.  The arguments for purchase in the longer-term generally stack up &ndash; I agree with that.</p></speech>

Only recently we had the president of a university before the committee.  He was in accommodation for &euro;3,000 per month on taxpayers' money.  That is simply an example.  Whether that is good value for money is a matter for us to examine.  Anyway, that mentality has persisted in recent years.  That is why I made my comments.</p> <p>  I have some specific questions on fraud and I will come back to justice and aid in a moment.  Page 20, dealing with Vote 28, refers to fraud and suspected fraud.  What is the update on that note?  It states that the Department initiated an investigation that was at an early stage.  The note dates from 2016 but we are in 2018 now.  Has that been completed?  Where are we on that?</p></speech>

We ask all our recruits to go out to schools to talk to transition year students about how to take care of themselves.  Irish people are travelling at an older age as well.  They are vulnerable to falling ill and having health problems while they are abroad.</p><p>Irish people are travelling further afield in south-east Asia, further from our embassy network where consular complex cases can arise which can consume a great deal of time and attention.

In the last few years, Irish citizens have been killed in a terrorist attack in Tunisia.

It will take 60 years to reach the target that has been changed on I do not know how many occasions and we see so much money going into defence.  I have other words for that.  Mr. Burgess probably cannot comment because it is policy.  The Department is doing great work, albeit with some questions around various issues that have been dealt with.  We are struggling to come up to that percentage of 0.7% of GDP yet we have any amount of money for defence projects.

We have detailed sustained activities in other countries which are not <i>ad hoc</i>and we are increasingly trying to take a regional view of our programming.  We have a country programme in Ethiopia, for example, and we have a programme in Uganda.  Uganda is receiving a lot of refugees from South Sudan.  Ethiopia is in a fragile region.  We are increasingly trying to take a look at how our programming has a wider regional impact, and it does do so.  It is misleading and artificial to draw a line between development programmes and humanitarian assistance and the profound insecurity that one finds in these regions as well.  The Irish Defence Forces, for example, have assisted with training in Somalia, which is one of the most insecure parts of the world.  We have assisted as well in Chad, in Mali and in the Congo and the attempts to provide human security for citizens in these profoundly unstable areas has to be seen also as contributing to the conditions which allow for sustainable development in those countries too.</p></speech>

At some stage, there needs to be a recognition at Government level that we cannot go on without looking at what is causing this in the first place and our role and the EU's role in that in terms of policy.  We have policies that are leading to the lack of stability yet we are struggling to bring a little assistance and aid.</p></speech>

What is causing the conflict in the first place and what is leading to 65 million refugees?  We must look at that on a policy level and begin to question.  This aid is fantastic but it is tiny and it is trying to make up for what we are doing wrong in the first place.</p></speech>

We are involved in the Global Compact for Migration, which is an effort to address some of the underlying issues.  As we develop the new White Paper, it is clearly one of the questions of the age.  We try with our development co-operation programming to address some of the root causes which are around poverty and development questions to a large extent.  In addressing poverty and development issues in Africa or elsewhere, we must be careful not to make our aid an instrumentalised issue.  It is not just about targeting migration.  It has to be about the defined needs of the populations we work with.  There is a delicate balance that we will have to work out.  That is where having a presence on the ground through embassies is very important.  It helps us to fine tune the responses to what locals need.</p></speech>

It was like being at home in Ireland.  Tanzania has the fastest economy in east Africa.  We were asked to look at gender violence, which we are very familiar with here.

I cannot remember the gentleman's surname.  I think his forename was John and he was an impressive person.  However, there was a noticeable absence of any overview on climate change.  Mr. de B&uacute;rca may be able to confirm that our food provision and other programmes have an environmental aspect which recognises that there may be by-products that might, for example, damage a water table, and that things could be done in another way.  Mr. de B&uacute;rca is nodding, which I will take as a "Yes".  I do not want to delay proceedings.</p> <p>  The only thing we have not touched on at all was suspected fraud, or rather suspected irregularities, within the Department, which is referred to in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.

Our tradition is that if we pledge money, we pay it.  Sometimes, we pledge over a multiannual period and we keep track of that in the Department.  If we pledge &euro;20 million over three years, we ensure that we have paid it out by the end of the third year.  By and large, we have done that.  The only time I am aware of when we undershot was in or about 2010 when, for reasons to do with the economy here, there were big budget cuts.  In that instance, we tried to do it in a way which was agreed and notified to allow partners to plan.</p></speech>

There is in Vote 27 a special provision which is not in use in other Votes whereby there is a buffer in relation to bilateral and other co-operation grant funding.

What one thinks what will spend on 1 January is not necessarily what one's outturn is.  We try to balance it and reprofile during the year, but there is always a margin on foot of due diligence, prudence or because something is finished.

We are talking about expanding the number of missions overseas.  The Department has described a scenario in which there can be a change in the profile of people taking over in terms of family situation and so on.

I will give an example from my own experience.  I moved into accommodation that was provided when I was in New York.  It was furnished to representational standard, but we lived in a small space at the back.  We had three bedrooms, a small living room and a kitchen.  That was our family space and we brought our own furniture to accommodate it.  In an embassy, if one has a representational function, the furnishings are provided as part of the official set-up of the building.  Officers on a short-term assignment have the option of renting a furnished apartment or bringing some of their own furniture.  Most want to bring some of their own immediate surroundings to provide a sense of home.</p></speech>

As we are at the end of the lifetime of the current roster, in the next two weeks a new call for applications will be made.  Our intention is to try to get approximately 200 people on the roster.  It will be a competitive interview process.  There will be a full note on it on our website with the call for applications.  We will send a copy to the committee.  Language is one criterion because in some of the countries people do not speak English.  We want to get good people in order that the process will be competitive.  I imagine that not everybody who will apply will meet the threshold, but we hope to get 200 good people on the roster.  The number of elections held per year varies, but, on average, there are around 20 electoral missions a year, either EU or OSCE missions.  During the lifetime of the register we try to give everybody an opportunity, but we have to take account of language and other criteria which the organising bodies impose on us.</p></speech>

However, that was not enough for those who had sought the information and they wanted proof.</p> <p>  On Vote 27 and the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, overseas development assistance, ODA, was approximately &euro;725 million in the year under review.  There was another &euro;485,000 approximately in the Vote.  There is also a reference to a figure of &euro;240 million from other sources.  I think it was said the figures were included in Irish Aid's annual report.  Will somebody send us a snapshot to show from where the other figure comes?  Who is responsible for publishing Irish Aid's annual report?</p></speech>

Agreed.  Is it agreed that there is nothing arising that will not be on the agenda?  Agreed.</p> <p>  There are three categories of correspondence.  Category A relates to briefing documents and opening statements.  Correspondence item 1392A is a briefing document from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for today's meeting.  We note and publish that.  It has already been discussed.</p> <p>  Document No. 1411A is the opening statement from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for today's meeting.  We note and publish that.  It has already been discussed.</p> <p>  Correspondence item 1405A from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade provides statistical information on passports requested by the committee.  We note and publish that.  We had a detailed discussion on that earlier today.</p> <p>  Correspondence category B is correspondence from Accounting Officers or Ministers or both and follow-up to Committee of Public Accounts meetings.  A number of members are not present and others have not had an opportunity to read some of the correspondence.  I have been asked to hold a number of items of correspondence over to next week.</p> <p>  Correspondence item 1370B from the Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, dated 11 June 2018, provides an information note requested by the committee on the funding scheme in place for local authorities to provide housing for refugees.  We note and publish that.  We had a detailed discussion on that earlier today.</p> <p>  Correspondence item 1371 is from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills and is dated 11 June 2018.  I have been asked by members to hold that over until people have an opportunity to consider it.  The same applies to the next item, correspondence item 1380 from Dr. Graham Love, chief executive of the Higher Education Authority.  Due to members not being present I have been asked to hold that over to the next meeting.  Correspondence item 1384B also  is from Dr. Graham Love of the Higher Education Authority dated 15 June 2018.  I have been asked to hold that over and it will be on our list next week.</p> <p>  Correspondence item 1385B from Ms Dee Forbes, director general of RT&Eacute;, dated 15 June 2018, is in response to an email received from an individual querying information provided to the committee regarding the possibility of having an RT&Eacute; 2+1 channel.  Ms Forbes clarifies that RT&Eacute; 2+1 does not currently exist, which is something I asked.  I think we will hold that over.  There is a second item of correspondence.  I express my exasperation.  We had a detailed conversation with the Department about getting an RT&Eacute; 2+1 channel on the Sky platform.  We received a detailed reply last week which does not answer the question and does not correct the record.  In the meantime, we have received a further letter from Dee Forbes of RT&Eacute;, which again does not fully clarify the matter.  They are all just talking around the system.  We asked a direct question and had the debate here about putting the RT&Eacute; 2+1 channel up on the Sky platform and we have now established that the channel does not even exist.  It may get permission and then make the channel; I do not know the details of the technology.  We will hold this over because we are expecting further correspondence to clarify what I thought was a simple question.</p></speech>

That item is held over until the next meeting.</p> <p>  The next item, correspondence item 1387B from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, dated 12 June 2018, is held over to the next meeting.</p> <p>  Correspondence item 1388B received from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, dated 5 June 2018, relates to the local government funding baseline review and consultation process.  We note and publish that.  I encourage all members of the committee and all Members of the Houses to make a contribution to that consultation process because it exercises the minds of many public representatives.</p> <p>  Correspondence item 1389B is from Mr. Tadhg Daly, chief executive officer of Nursing Homes Ireland.  The document is a formal agreement between the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, and Nursing Homes Ireland.  This was provided at last week&rsquo;s meeting.  We are just noting and publishing that.</p></speech>

I made the point that it did not resolve the question of whether issues of price fixing were discussed by Nursing Homes Ireland but were never actioned.  Because they were never actioned, no action could be taken by the CCPC.  It actually states here that it can confirm-----</p></speech>

It states "NHI hereby confirms that NHI and, to the best of its knowledge, its members did not at any stage implement any collective actions..."  Therefore we know it did not implement any, but the question was whether it was discussed.</p> <p>  The document continues to state: "NHI hereby undertakes..."  All of the undertakings are the issues that were in the public domain that appeared in the minutes.  It is quite interesting.  Essentially NHI is saying it promises not to implement what it said it did not talk about.  We need to note that we were stonewalled.  The witness had a right not to answer questions when he was here.  However, the CEO was not in a position to confirm or deny whether the word "boycott" was used.  He simply said he did not use it.  This document indicates there was an agreement with the CCPC that it did not action what was potentially discussed at that meeting and that it would not do so in future.  It is set out in the document.  It vindicates us in pursuing this.  I acknowledge that there is now a written legal agreement that it will not.  However, it certainly raises questions for the organisation about it putting itself in that position in the first place.  It ended up having to sign such an agreement with the CCPC.</p></speech>

Why is there a commitment not to discuss a certain issue if there was not a feeling it had been discussed?  That is the point he is making.  In any event that is now published by Nursing Homes Ireland here as a result of last week's meeting.  The point the Deputy makes speaks for itself.  We note that and the Deputy's comments are also recorded.</p></speech>

It relates to a note on the lab screening data; copies of emails or other correspondence from the national director of acute hospitals in which he forwarded correspondence received on 13 July 2017 from the CEO of the University of Limerick group; and a note on the contract with the laboratories and whether there is any provision which gives recourse to the State to pursue a laboratory where an indemnity to the patient is invoked.</p></speech>

We will note and publish that and wait for the rest of the information.</p> <p> Correspondence item 1394 is from Mr. Ray Mitchell of the HSE in regard to a matter raised at our last meeting regarding offering open access to all records to Dr Scally.  What does that letter say?  It is a short note.  We will note and publish that.</p> <p>   In correspondence category C, items 1342C, 1355C (i) to (vi) and 1362C in regard to wards of court were held over from our last meeting.  We will hold them over until our next meeting.</p> <p>  Item 1347, relating to GoSafe cameras, was held over from the last meeting.  Some members who are not present asked that it be held over as they are not here.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is 1350.  It was received from an individual regarding a submission to the committee on protected disclosures in the Irish Prison Service.  I was asked by members who are not present to hold that over to the next meeting.</p> <p>  Correspondence item 1386C is an anonymous letter from an individual who made a protected disclosure in regard to wrongdoing at a location in Limerick.  It requests that the committee make inquiries with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Again, members not present have asked for that to be held over.</p> <p>  Correspondence items 1398C and 1399C, dated 18 June 2018, are from Deputy MacSharry and draw attention to issues in regard to the selection and operation of the election observation roster by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  This matter was dealt with during our engagement with the Department this morning.  The Department has a panel which is expiring.  The Department representatives said they hope to establish a new panel but that will not be done until the end of the year, so the current panel will remain in place until then.  The Department will publish criteria in the next two weeks and invite interested members of the public to put forward their names for consideration.  A new panel is about to be established.  Is that of benefit?  I am summarising what was said this morning when that topic was specifically discussed.  We are to receive a detailed note on why the current panel was allowed to expire without this action being taken in advance.  The witnesses stated that there were staffing issues.  We asked for a detailed briefing note this morning and we will receive that shortly.  We will note and publish that item and wait for the response.</p> <p>  I will return to correspondence item 1316, received on 11 May 2018 from the former vice president of Cork Institute of Technology, CIT, regarding matters discussed at the committee meeting on 22 March 2018.  We held this item over.  At our meeting on 22 March in regard to public private partnerships, PPPs, a number of points were made regarding the former vice president and his role as contract manager at CIT&rsquo;s National Maritime College, which he says were untrue or misleading.  He has written to the committee to state that he was not here to respond to those points.  We are providing this opportunity for him to correct the record.  At the request of the committee, the clerk has liaised with the individual to summarise the main points of his letter.  It is an extensive letter and I do not wish to read it all, so will just give the main points.  I ask any member with observations on what I am about to read into the record to listen carefully and take me up on it if he or she so wishes.</p> <p>  First, the individual clarifies that he was not the contract manager during the construction phase and accepts that, as a scientist, he would be unlikely to have the skills to oversee the construction phase.  The committee acknowledged that already at our meeting on 24 May.  Second, following the hand-over of the building, he oversaw the operational phase on request of the Department of Education and Skills.  He believes it is not accurate or fair to say that he did not have the relevant skills to oversee the operational phase.  Third, the individual states he was never employed by companies that were subsets of the college.  However, the committee notes that he was an unpaid director.  That was put on the record on the last occasion this was dealt with and we again note it now.  Fourth, following retirement, he was employed one day a week by Cork Institute of Technology to support the college in a number of areas but that what was involved required attendance in the college on three or four days a week.  Fifth, in respect of his retirement party, he states that CIT did not contribute to this but that it was paid for by friends and colleagues who attended.  Sixth, he states that any problems with the building were the responsibility of the PPP company and it was required to meet the costs.  That was also stated at the meeting on 24 May.  In summary, the individual was greatly upset by what he believes were false and misleading statements made about him while he was not present to defend himself.  We have now provided an opportunity for the record to be corrected. Can we note and record that item of correspondence?  Noted.</p> <p>  The committee has received five items of correspondence from an individual regarding matters arising from the amalgamation of Kiltoghert Co-operative Agricultural and Dairy Society and the North Connacht Farmers' Co-operative Society in 2000.  These items have not been circulated.  The correspondent makes a number of allegations in regard to irregularities in the amalgamation process, procedural and behavioural matters relating to the Garda and procedural failures by officials of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The substantive items in regard to the amalgamation process of co-operatives and allegations in regard to the Garda are not within the remit of the committee.  For informational purposes, issues relating to the amalgamation should be addressed to the Registrar of Friendly Societies in the Companies Registration Office and allegations in regard to the Garda should be dealt with by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, not the Committee of Public Accounts.  Given that serious accusations are made about specific individuals, with the consent of the committee I propose that the items not be circulated and that we inform the individual that we will not consider the matter further.  I propose that we return the documentation to the individual.  If any member wishes to see the documentation before it is returned, he or she may contact the clerk.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>

There is enough to do at the moment.  We will move on and return it with that covering note, explaining those two points.</p> <p>  The next item is statements and accounts received since the previous meeting.  The first one is a clear audit opinion on Dublin City University and the usual issue around the third pension funding in the public sector.  That is normal.</p> <p>  The next item is a clear audit opinion from the Commission for Communications Regulation.</p> <p>  The next item is from the Health Information Quality Authority, HIQA.  A qualified opinion has been given because of its retirement benefit entitlements, which are only met as they become payable.  That is a regular issue arising in respect of public sector bodies concerning payment for pensions.</p> <p>  The next item is the Louth and Meath Education and Training Board, ETB.  It should be remembered that these are the accounts for 2015, so they are a bit behind times.  We highlighted last year that there was a specific problem with this ETB.  Attention is drawn to the disclosure in the statement of internal control.  An invoice redirection fraud on the board in November 2017 resulted in the loss of an estimated &euro;246,000.  That is shocking.  We have to write to the ETB for a fully detailed report as to how that happened.  There is also a question of weakness in the board's control regarding accumulated PLC fee income and bank accounts.  There is a further on the delays in finalising the financial statements in 2015 due to changes in senior personnel in the ETB.  We were made aware of that in public here last year when the ETB appeared before the committee.  We need to write to the ETB for a detailed note about that loss of &euro;246,000 and the invoice redirection fraud.  I do not know anything about it, so I believe we need detailed information about it.</p> <p>  The next item is the Clare and Limerick ETB.  It has supplied its audit opinion and, again, there is a level of non-compliance with national procurement guidelines.  We will have to come back to that issue across the entirety of the public service because it is cropping up every week.</p> <p>  The next item is from Waterford Institute of Technology for the year ending 31 August 2016.  Attention is drawn to the going-concern status of the institute, which had an accumulated deficit of &euro;4.4 million to the end of August 2016 and which did not provide for pension benefits in the financial statements.  That is normal, but the issue of the deficit still arises.  The accounts were prepared on the basis that the institute will continue to receive State funding.  That is probably a reasonable assumption.  However, the Comptroller and Auditor General cannot give a cast-iron guarantee that that will happen.  He has to draw attention to the fact that this place can only continue to trade if it continues to get funding.</p></speech>

They are not allowed to borrow.  They are also not allowed to have deficits.  That is the difficulty here.  Waterford Institute of Technology is not the only offender, but it would be useful if the committee wrote to the Higher Education Authority to ask for a breakdown of the finances of each institute of technology to ascertain which were in deficit.  This would give us a picture of how Waterford Institute of Technology compares to others.  Can that be done?</p></speech>

It is important we get updated accounts.  We will ask for a report which covers all of the institutes of technology.</p> <p>  The next item is a clear audit opinion from the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.</p> <p>  The next item is a clear audit opinion from the HSE.  The attention of the committee is drawn to some non-competitive procurement, inadequate monitoring and the oversight of grants to outside agencies.  The statement of capital income and expenditure shows a surplus from 2016 of &euro;15 million brought forward even though sanction was not obtained to do so.  The HSE is on the work programme for this committee and it is due to appear here on 5 July.  We can discuss all of those issues on that day.  We will note it in the meantime.</p> <p>  The next item is a clear audit opinion from the National Asset Management Agency.</p> <p>  The next item is a clear audit opinion from the language body.  Its accounts have been jointly audited with the Northern Ireland Comptroller and Auditor General.</p> <p>  The next item is a clear audit opinion from Trinity College Dublin.  However, attention is drawn to the deferred pension funding, and the disclosure of a cyber fraud on the Trinity Foundation in 2017, at a cost to the university of &euro;975,000.  That is staggering.  We have found out about two educational bodies today that were subject to cyberfraud or invoice redirection fraud, being Louth and Meath ETB to the tune of &euro;246,000, and Trinity College Dublin to the tune of &euro;975,000.  That is &euro;1.25 million of taxpayers' money.</p></speech>

If we see any further examples we will have to look at that specifically.  We have seen two examples of fraud.  The money taken from the foundation may not have been taxpayer money but rather money from donations, but if the foundation loses money the deficit will have to be made up eventually.</p> <p>  The next item is the work programme.  On Thursday, 28 June, the Tax Appeals Commission and the Revenue Commissioners will appear at the second session at 11.30 a.m. to deal with tax debt write-offs, withholding taxes and the appropriation accounts.  The Tax Appeals Commission is a new organisation.  There has always been a tax appeals commissioner, but there is a new structure in place.  It is a new organisation with a separate Vote, so it will be dealt with separately.  On 5 July, the HSE will appear before the committee.  On 12 July, the National Treasury Management Agency will appear before the committee, including the State Claims Agency and all the organisations under its remit.</p> <p>  Is there any other business?  I want to refer to one item of business in private session.  Can we go into private session for a moment?  Is there anything else to deal with in public session?  We have to deal with two issues in private session, namely, one item of correspondence and the discussion document circulated by the committee secretariat about preparing information for a periodic report.  It depends on how much time people have had to look at the document in advance, but we do have to clear it quite quickly.  It does not have to be finished today.</p></speech>
