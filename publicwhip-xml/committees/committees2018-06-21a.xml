    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-21a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018062100002#A00700"><p>I thank the Chairman.  Key areas of responsibility of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade include foreign policy advice and co-ordination, promotion of Ireland&rsquo;s economic interests abroad, management of the country&rsquo;s development aid programme and provision of passport and consular services for Irish citizens.  The activities and running costs of the Department are funded under two Votes.</p> <p>  Gross expenditure under Vote 28 - Foreign Affairs and Trade amounted to &euro;215 million in 2016.  Administration subheads accounted for 71% of that expenditure.  The largest element of this was the salary costs of some 1,280 staff, which came to just under &euro;79 million.  Office premises expenses of &euro;23 million included costs associated with Ireland&rsquo;s network of embassies and missions abroad.  The bulk of the non-administrative expenditure related to contributions to international organisations and grants for support services for Irish emigrants.  Receipts into the Vote comprised mainly fees related to the issue of passports and visas, and other consular services.  These receipts were approximately &euro;12.3 million, or 30%, ahead of the level projected for the year, probably reflecting the first impacts of the UK Brexit vote in mid-2016.  A net surplus of just over &euro;8.7 million was liable for surrender to the Exchequer at the end of the year.</p> <p>  Vote 27 - International Co-operation is administered by the Department&rsquo;s development co-operation division and funds approximately two thirds of Ireland&rsquo;s official development assistance, with a particular focus on sub-Saharan Africa.  The 2016 appropriation account for the Vote records gross expenditure of nearly &euro;485 million.  A surplus of nearly &euro;2 million was liable for surrender to the Exchequer.</p> <p>  Chapter 14 of my report was compiled to provide an overview of the control systems in place in respect of bilateral assistance provided under Vote 27 and to review changes in the Department&rsquo;s administrative procedures for bilateral assistance following a significant fraud in Uganda in 2012.  Some &euro;386 million, or just over half of Ireland&rsquo;s development assistance, was applied as bilateral assistance.  Bilateral assistance is the provision of direct assistance to a developing country through a variety of channels, including the country&rsquo;s government agencies, non-governmental organisations, international agencies and missionary societies.  The remainder of the development assistance budget was applied as multilateral assistance, where contributions to international agencies or organisations are pooled and applied for development purposes.  </p> <p>  Figure 1, which is now on screen, shows the breakdown of bilateral assistance in 2016.  As can be seen in figure 1, a key element of Ireland&rsquo;s programme is the targeted delivery of assistance to eight selected key partner countries under long-term strategic partnerships.  Assistance provided under these partnerships is managed primarily by the Irish embassy in the partner country.  A five-year country strategy plan is drawn up for each of the key partner countries, outlining a framework of how the embassy will accomplish certain target outcomes.  A review of the country strategy plans for each of the eight key partner countries conducted as part of the examination identified that only five of the strategies were current.  The Department&rsquo;s objective is to have new strategies completed and approved in time to coincide with expiring strategies.  However, where there are significant changes in the key partner country, either regionally or nationally, or where a mid-term review suggests that a strategy is worth continuing, the strategy may be extended.</p> <p>  Given the nature of development assistance and the context in which it is delivered, the risk of fraud, corruption and misappropriation are significant factors to be taken into account by all donor countries.  Following the discovery in 2012 of a significant fraud involving Irish funds in Uganda, the Department has revised its assurance process for the development assistance programme.  More emphasis is now being placed on pre-funding assessment, monitoring and evaluation of projects and systematic review of external audit findings.  Members of the committee who travelled to Tanzania last month will have had the opportunity to examine the practical application of that framework.</p> <p>  At the time we were completing the report, the Department had not reported publicly on suspected frauds in funded organisations or on the percentage of assistance funds that is lost to fraud.  In 2016, 12 instances of fraud were reported in funded partner organisations amounting to potential losses of &euro;312,000 or 0.043% of Irish development assistance funding provided in 2016.  When recovered amounts of &euro;126,000 were accounted for, the potential net loss was 0.026%.  This is broadly in line with the levels reported by a number of government aid agencies in other jurisdictions.  The Department has agreed a recommendation to develop a methodology to publish information in respect of frauds and alleged frauds affecting Irish Aid funds awarded to partner organisations, most likely through its departmental annual report.</p></speech>

I ask Mr. Burgess to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-21a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Burgess" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018062100002#B00200"><p>I thank the Committee of Public Accounts for inviting me to assist it in its consideration of the 2016 appropriation accounts for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade - Votes 27 and 28 - and Chapter 14 of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s 2016 report on the control of Ireland's bilateral assistance programme.  As the Chairman mentioned, I am joined by some colleagues from the Department who may be helpful to the committee: Ms Fiona Penollar, who is our director of passport services; Ms Barbara Cullinane, who is our head of strategy and performance; Mr. Ruair&iacute; de B&uacute;rca, who is the head of Irish Aid, Ms Caitr&iacute;ona Ingoldsby, who is the head of our Irish abroad unit; and Mr. Austin Gormley, who is the head of our corporate services division.  I know the committee has been supplied with material which provides a factual summary of the main areas of departmental expenditure and receipts in 2016.  I do not propose to repeat that orally.  The programme structure for Vote 28 corresponds with the Department's strategy statement, which sets out its work in five priority areas: providing a service to Irish citizens, engaging actively in the European Union, promoting our values internationally, advancing our prosperity and strengthening our influence.  Vote 27 is structured around a single expenditure programme based on poverty and hunger reduction.</p> <p>  We have been building strength around a cluster of issues which are disproportionately important to longer-term development.  We have done this while keeping the most vulnerable people in mind at all times.  Some of the most important issues in this context are access to education and health opportunities for women and girls, support to civil society, social support for the most vulnerable people, good governance, small-scale agriculture and childhood nutrition.  The humanitarian challenges arising from conflict, political instability and climate change have reached unprecedented levels in Syria, Yemen, Myanmar, South Sudan, the Horn of Africa, southern Africa and northern Nigeria.  It is estimated 3 million people were forced to leave their homes as a result of conflict and persecution in 2017, bringing the number of refugees and displaced people to an all-time high of 68 million.  Against this background, we have directed new funding to more recent crises while maintaining a visibility and influence beyond our size, especially in refugee-hosting countries such as Uganda, Ethiopia and Tanzania.  It is against this background of change and challenge that the Government has committed to publishing a White Paper on Ireland's international development co-operation programme that will guide progress towards meeting the target of allocating 0.7% of gross national income to overseas development assistance by 2030.  I acknowledge the work of Members of the Oireachtas in compiling a report on Irish Aid earlier this year.  This useful report is informing our thinking as this work is brought forward.</p> <p>  I want to address an issue which is topical for most if not all offices in the Oireachtas.  I refer to the impact that the unprecedented demand for passports is having on the delivery of passport services to the public.  Responsive public service is the bedrock of this Department's work.  This can take the form of support for emigrant communities, consular care for Irish citizens abroad or the delivery of passports.  We aim for continuous improvement in our service on the one hand, and easier access to services for our citizens on the other.  Everything else is built on this foundation.  I say this as someone who spent some of the most satisfying years of my career living and working with Irish communities abroad.  For some years now, we have been working towards a thorough overhaul and renewal of the passport system aimed at providing a better, more responsive and more accessible service.  The Irish passport card was a significant innovation and the first of its type.  This facility for our citizens is unmatched by other countries.  Our passport booklet is rated among the four most advanced and secure in the world.  This is one of the reasons Irish citizens need so few visas for international travel, including to the US.  The ongoing development of our online service allows citizens to apply from home and receive their passports in a matter of days.  This goes hand in hand with robust procedures to verify and protect the identities of applicants.</p> <p>  As we take pride in what we do, it is a matter of immense frustration for us that some categories of passport application are taking longer to process than we had planned, that we are unable to answer all telephone calls to the Passport Office and that many people are concerned they will not receive their passports in time for their travel plans.  I see the efforts being made by my colleagues in the Passport Office to get us back on target.  I also see their immense grace under pressure as they answer telephone calls and deal with callers to the office.  Our responsibility to verify and protect the identities of the citizens involved and ensure the integrity and international reputation of the Irish passport means that lost and stolen passports and first-time applications take longer.  If one calls the Passport Office, however, one should get an answer.  If we are frustrated at what we cannot do, our customers are even more so.  The telephone service is not what it should be at present and I apologise for that.</p> <p>  It important to provide reassurance that the service is working well for the most part.  All applications processed online are issued within days.  For those using this channel, the service from the Passport Office has improved immeasurably over the past 12 months.  All renewals are being issued on time.  This improvement on last year has been achieved even though the past six months have been the busiest in our history, with our activity having increased by 8.5% since last year.  Most queries are being answered, with approximately 9,500 queries being answered in the past week.  Processing times are in line with international norms and are coming down.  I believe we will meet all our targets by next month.  In the meantime, nobody affected by these delays who is at risk of missing a travel deadline has been turned away.  In the short term, probably before the end of this year, child renewals will go online.  This will reduce waiting times and extend the benefits of the new system to more families.  This would not be possible without the support of the members of this committee and their colleagues across the Oireachtas who have helped us to get clear information to applicants, who have guided them through the process and who have brought urgent cases to our attention.  I acknowledge this assistance and thank Deputies and Senators for it.</p> <p>  Votes 27 and 28 support a great diversity of work undertaken on behalf of the State and its citizens.  I have referred to the commitment of our colleagues in the Passport Office.  I see that commitment across the mission network, which itself comprises great diversity.  I was delighted to attend yesterday's launch by the T&aacute;naiste of the Department&rsquo;s LGBT+ staff network, which is the first such network in the Civil Service.  This complements the considerable amount of work that is already under way to advance gender equality in the Department.  This initiative is part of an agenda that seeks to foster a culture of respect and equality to the benefit of staff, of the Department and, ultimately, of those we serve.  Across its offices in Ireland and its missions overseas, the Department has staff members of approximately 70 nationalities.  They speak 40 languages and work in 90 locations worldwide to support Irish citizens and represent Ireland's voice and interests on the international stage.  My colleagues and I are ready to respond to any questions that may be posed by the members of the committee on additional issues across our Votes.</p></speech>

Before I call the first speaker, I want to mention one aspect of the passport situation briefly.  We might come back to it later.  I thank Mr. Burgess for the information on processing times, which we have received in the last day or so.  I want to verify some of what Mr. Burgess has said and highlight the problem areas that exist.  Am I right in saying that the only applications which can be made online are renewals?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-21a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Burgess" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018062100002#B00400"><p>Only adult renewals can be done online at present.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-21a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018062100002#B00500"><p>I do not think Mr. Burgess said exactly that.  Over 100,000 renewals have been processed so far this year.  Over 90% of them have been processed within ten working days.  As we all know, some renewals are processed within two or three working days.  That is an excellent service.  I will mention the biggest issue that people have.  Traditionally, many people go through the passport express system.  There have been 100,000 renewals through that system so far this year.  The Passport Office's target is to deal with passport express applications within 21 days.  The real problem is that approximately 50% of such applications are not dealt with within the target time.  So far this year, approximately 27,000 such applications have taken up to six weeks and a further 22,000 have taken up to eight weeks, which is two months.  The difficulty is that when people go through the passport express system, they think it will take three weeks or thereabouts.  When six weeks have passed and they are due to travel the following week, but they have not yet received their passports, it can be very difficult to retrieve their applications from that channel of application to speed them up in another way.  That is the difficulty people are having with passport express applications.</p> <p>  In essence, we are moving on.  I would like to draw a comparison with an area of another Department.  There was a time when people used to tax their cars by going to the local authority office.  Then they started doing it by post, and now over 70% of people tax their cars online.  Their applications are turned around within 48 hours and they get their tax discs back.  The Passport Office needs to go there.  It is going there.</p><p>Passport Express is the slow lane and the online service the fast lane.  I acknowledge that first-time applicants cannot use the online service, but people need to be told that while the turnaround target is three weeks, this is not possible in 50% of cases.  If many of those who had used the Passport Express service had known about the delays, they would have used the online service.  The Department needs to encourage people to renew their passports online, where possible.  It needs to be more proactive in that regard.  Staff in post offices are probably aware that 50% of applications submitted via the Passport Express service will not be processed within the target period, but it is not their job to inform people of this.  It is the responsibility of the Department to encourage people to use the online service, where possible.  I accept that staff in the Passport Office are under tremendous pressure, but the Department needs to step up the move to the online service, where possible.  Will Mr. Burgess comment briefly before we move on to the next item of business?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-21a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Burgess" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018062100002#C00200"><p>I accept that Passport Express is the slow lane, but in its day, it provided an effective and rapid turnaround service.  We anticipated the pressure that would be exerted on the Passport Office this year.  From the outset of the year, we have engaged in an intensive communications campaign aimed, in particular, at getting the word out locally that, where possible, people should make their applications online.  We have done approximately 35 local radio interviews and also worked heavily through local media.</p> <p>  Most Passport Express applications are processed on time within the 15-day target.  Where applications made via Passport Express are first-time applications or for the replacement of a lost passport, a series of checks kick in, which delays processing.  The frustration is being felt by families who have booked holidays where one child has not previously held a passport.  The passports are bundled together, but owing to the making of a new application, we are working to a different timeframe.  Where we know that someone is at risk of missing a deadline, we will pull the application and process it.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the extraordinary work done by personnel in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, with many of whom I have had the privilege of dealing in the past few months on passport applications.  I have no complaints about the manner in which they carry out their duties.  I also recognise with some appreciation Mr. Burgess's reference to the launch of the LGBT+ staff network, particularly among his own staff, which is commendable, given the week that is in it.</p> <p>  I propose to focus first on the overseas aid programme and later the passport service.  I was one of the three members of the committee who travelled recently to Tanzania, with the clerk, staff of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Mr. de B&uacute;rca.  It was an eye-opening and extremely worthwhile visit to understand what the Irish overseas aid programme delivers.  It is without doubt a worthwhile project across the globe.  While some of my experiences were harrowing, others were incredibly uplifting.  I also thank Mr. de B&uacute;rca for the information he supplied the ambassador, Mr. Sherlock, and his staff in Dar es Salaam and also his personal staff for their extraordinary hospitality.</p> <p>  There is reference in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and also in Mr. Burgess's opening statement to the publication of statistics and analysis of fradulent transactions within the budget.  In his opening statement Mr. McCarthy referenced that the figure of 0.026% was in line with international norms.  My understanding is it is the after recovery figure.  The figure of 0.43% for 2016 is above the norm.  Perhaps Mr. McCarthy might comment on the matter.</p></speech>

If it was 1% on a gross basis, it would be of concern.  When a percentage is so small, the anomalies from year to year are likely to throw up something like it.  I am not be too concerned that it is slightly above some of the figures.  The figures we have quoted in the chapter are for a very small selection of countries.  Internationally, there is not that much information available.  One would need a broader spread of countries presenting this type of information which has to be built up.  To me, watching the figure from year to year would I think yield value for the committee.</p></speech>

Since the 2016 report, we have recovered an additional &euro;60,000.  The process of recovery is continuous and does not stop until we recover the full amount.  In many cases we do not recover the full amount, but it remains a continuous part of our work.</p> <p>  There was a question about international norms.  We work closely with the audit network in other aid agencies and development partners.  Our evaluation and audit team hosted the international auditors' network in Dublin recently.  The intention is to identify and advance best practice among peers.  We see this as a fundamental part of our work.</p></speech>

Some countries publish information and we are looking to do so.  Our network's audit and evaluation team meets the auditors and evaluators to discuss dynamic relationships with organisations which we fund.  This information exchange is intended to avoid getting into a situation where one ends up with suspected fraud.  It is about sharing information on organisational management systems and early information on where we suspect there may be weaknesses.  This allows us to get ahead of any fraud.  The meetings take place on a regular basis.  Often there are only allegations and suspicions rather than proven facts, but actions may be taken on what turn out to be proven facts.  Our work is often prophylactic.  In at least one instance there was theft from a warehouse and no fraud within the system.  We are waiting to see if there will be a insurance payout in this case.  There is a difference between fraud in an accountancy sense and in the sense fraud is understood by the man on the street.  The latter includes trucks which are robbed or warehouses which are burgled.  It does not mean that there is systemic fraud, although even in cases of robbery there may be some insider dealing.</p></speech>

On the positive side, the sustainable development goals provide us with a very specific agreed comprehensive framework for global development.  It is a guide which we did not have in 2013.  That, in itself, is a strong argument for looking again at our policies.</p> <p>  In the past five years the demands on humanitarian assistance as a result of climate change and conflict have been very significant, as has the pull on our development assistance.  We have contributed over &euro;100 million in responding to the Syrian crisis alone since 2012.  The context in which Irish Aid is operating is changing and many of the long-term development partnerships we have are in countries which are also dealing with the issue of climate fragility and very significant refugee-hosting countries.  There is now a compelling reason to stand back and look at the good use being made of our aid and the prospect of a significant increase within a relatively short timeframe requires us to give thought to how best we can use it.</p></speech>

There are extraordinary delays in turnaround compared to the United Kingdom and France.  My office has done some work on this issue and there is anecdotal evidence of the same thing happening in comparison to the USA.  I am trying to understand why it takes so long to obtain a visa.  There are differences of opinion in certain processing offices in different countries and sometimes it depends on the region involved.  I do not say this as a slight on anybody, but I have come across cases where visas were granted, albeit months later, having been refused on a couple of occasions.</p><p>It can be terribly frustrating for an individual who is living and working in the State and contributing tor the community and to the State who wants someone to come over but they are not able to do it.  I am aware of cases where the person goes to visit family in the UK instead because it is easier to get into the UK, even though he or she is not a British passport holder.

I will skip over to the passport issue.  I appreciate the information that has been provided.  Every person I speak to who has gone online and received their passport has expressed surprise at how quickly it has come through.  There is a reaction, especially online, at how extraordinary it is to get a passport on a Tuesday morning that was applied for perhaps on a Sunday morning while the applicant was in his or her pyjamas.  We can see this reaction online.</p> <p>  The negative is that sometimes applications can take longer because of the volume.  If a person is given a realistic projection of how long it might take he or she will not mind if it takes and extra day or two.  The problem we now have, however, is that the stated processing time is up on the website in black and white, and a person may apply and be left waiting.  In my experience this can happen with a lot of people who have new applications, or when a person has an expired passport.  If the service gave people a realistic timeframe I believe they would be far more accepting, especially coming up to the summer when it is going to be busy.</p> <p>  The witness outlined the process of verification very well in his opening statement and explained that the integrity of the system must be maintained, and this is completely accepted.  Is the issue about the number of staff available or is it a printer availability issue?  How many printers are there to print passports across the State? Is there a requirement for more printers?  Has a cost-benefit analysis been conducted on whether it would be a benefit to acquire another printer?  Are the witnesses aware of the per item cost to the Exchequer of each passport application, including the staffing costs, the processing costs and the passport itself?  If the Department does not know this it should.</p></speech>

It is important for the committee to get as much information as possible.  What are the alternatives?  What is the Department looking at with regard to improving the service?  At the outset of the meeting the Chairman and I said how we appreciate the kinds of pressures the service is under.  Would providing an additional printer speed up the process or is it more about the verification process and the staffing hours that are required?</p></speech>

Ms Penollar will speak about the cost per passport.  We have the printer capacity and the machinery that we need.  We have three passport printing machines that are capable of printing more passports per year than we actually process currently.  The blockage in the system is the delay with the checks required for first-time applications and lost passports.  These are far more complicated and they take more time.  On the website we state 33 days, which is the actual turnaround time, but it has been coming down progressively.</p> <p>  On resourcing, we issue the greater part of our passports in the first half of the year.  Over the last couple of years we have seen the surge coming a little earlier each year than it had the previous year.  We take on temporary staff in order to manage this.  We recruit and train these staff and we try to have them in place early.  We had a particular difficulty this year, which lies at the heart of the delays in processing at the moment.  Although we had intended to have temporary staff in place by 1 January, the vetting process for those staff took longer than it had in previous years.</p></speech>

The Garda vetting took longer so we did not have our full complement of temporary staff in January when we needed them.  The management of the balance between temporary staff requirements and full-time staff, and the time that the temporary staff get on board, is a critical factor for us in the Passport Office.  The Deputy has asked what we are looking at for next year and this is one of the issues we will look at particularly closely.</p> <p>  We are involved in a major modernisation process in the passport service and this will address all of these problems over time. We are about half way through that process at the moment.  The introduction of online passports for child renewals, which is on target, will make a significant difference to the processing times and the delays next year.</p></speech>

We have taken it on in blocks and phases.  This involves replacing the software, replacing the machinery and phasing in of improvements over a period of time.  It must be done in a phased way but the most significant improvement over the past year was the adult online renewals.  The child passport renewals online are due to follow.</p></speech>

We must ensure that the guardians of a child have given their permission for the child to have the passport.  The significant difference for child passport online applications is that we will still require signatures.  There will be a required page to be sent in that will purely be the consent of guardians for the child to have the passport.  This is a fundamental principle for the protection of the child and is a significant difference.</p></speech>

Currently there is no requirement for the guardians' consent to be witnessed by a Garda specifically, but we really want to target that witness to being someone who knows the child and has interaction with the guardians, for example a person in the child's school or a public health nurse or doctor.   A witness from that sphere makes much more sense.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the cost per passport.  There are many elements that go into processing the passport.  For commercial reasons I will not go into the specific costs associated with the actual book cost but it is in the region of &euro;10 per standard passport.  A child gets a passport for five years and an adult can get a passport for ten years, so there is proportionally more work in approving a child application.  A standard passport costs between &euro;40 to &euro;50, not including the central costs.  When that is considered and taken into account, the average cost of the child or adult passport is very similar to the fees charged.</p></speech>

We recently went on a trip to Tanzania, and as has already been said by my colleague Deputy Alan Farrell, our hosts went above and beyond the call of duty.  I want to thank the ambassador.  I drew a blank on the name of the head of development, Ms Bronagh Carr.  I give particular thanks to her, and also to Ms Olivia Kinabo, who is with us today.  I will come back to some of the issues in a minute.  On a positive note, the trip was certainly very good.  It certainly was not a junket and it was well worth it.  We experienced a range of projects.  A group of people with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, AIDS, gave us the privilege of seeing them dancing.  We saw a connection between an Irish doctor and Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin.  That hospital is crumbling at the seams in my opinion, yet it was able to work very closely with the doctor and their staff in Tanzania, with both sides learning about the diagnosis of rare cancers. </p><p> I also want to thank the Passport Office.  The word "grace" has been mentioned.  I will get to the negatives in a minute, but certainly my experience with the Passport Office, under great pressure, has been that they operate with great grace.  The interface with the citizen is extremely important.  Of course, the passport is a vital document, so I thank the witnesses for that.  </p><p> Regarding the accounts, a clear audit has been given but there are a number of questions I would like to ask.  I have read it all and I was a tiny bit confused.  I think I am clear now.  Bilateral aid just about gets the bigger amount, and then there is the other aid.  Bilateral aid comes under international co-operation.  I wish to ask the Comptroller and Auditor General if I am correct in that or am I mixed up?  There is multilateral aid and bilateral aid.   </p></speech>

Some &euro;32 million was given to the European Development Fund in 2016.</p> <p>  In regard to the complexity of the funding streams, looking at the amount of funding we give in humanitarian assistance at the moment, we find that the Department has a humanitarian budget line which is specifically used for this.  However, we are also providing humanitarian assistance in our country programmes where there is fragility, refugee populations or instability in those countries.  Moreover, both the European Union and the UN are providing humanitarian assistance as well, and we fund both core activities and specific activities of those organisations.  The overall picture is quite complex.  </p></speech>

I add that it is very difficult to work inside Syria, and our capacity to perform oversight is very limited because we cannot put staff at risk.  As a rule, inside Syria we work with UN agencies or the International Committee of the Red Cross and Red Crescent.  They have robust systems of internal oversight and we can work with them inside the country.  Outside of Syria, people providing support to Syria are a much more mixed group.  We work with some NGOs.  We also work with some international organisations, depending on who is best placed to provide a response.  Given the huge numbers of people involved, there is a scale issue.  That is why working with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees is the most effective and efficient mechanism for us in some instances.</p></speech>

There are many very strong arguments for each of those missions, but one of the really strong arguments for opening and establishing a presence in Amman is that a large part of the crisis assistance to Syria, and indeed the crisis in Yemen, is headquartered in Amman Jordan as well.

That is done.  There is always a challenge between what people want and what resources are available.  That is a different management question but the review of staffing complements has been done.  It was recommended that key senior mission staff should have the skills necessary to manage significant budgets and risks.  That is part of our ongoing training and as such is under way.  Mr. Burgess and I have been working with other members of the senior management team, including the chief financial officer, to carry out a series of visits to all of our missions.  Where we assess that there are skills deficits, we will ask people to do more.  Recommendation No. 7 was on formal management training.  That is part of our pre-posting training suite.</p></speech>

I wonder why the change does not come before.  We are then left asking whether the change has occurred after the synthesis report, after the questions that were raised or after the fraud in Uganda.  That is why I am asking in that context and Mr. de B&uacute;rca is telling me the recommendations have been implemented and the last two are in the process.</p> <p>  I have a practical question on buildings, land and premises.  It appears in both accounts.  I ask about this all the time in terms of what is rented and what is purchased and owned.  Looking at Votes 27 and 28, land and buildings on page 11, is there a schedule of such land and buildings?  How is valuation carried out?  How are decisions made on buying or renting property?  The same applies to Vote 28 on page 11, land and buildings.  If we open the two together under capital assets, one figure is &euro;7.639 million while the other is &euro;156.548 million.</p></speech>

It is a small unit which we are currently expanding.  One of the reasons we are expanding it is because the property market is dynamic and also because needs change in some missions.  We have a policy now of looking at purchase options where that makes sense and where there are long-term savings.  One issue we face in respect of our property budget is rapidly escalating rents.  In many cases, our larger missions are in cities where rents are particularly high and increasing rapidly.</p></speech>

Our constituency offices are a barometer of what works and what does not.  People come into us when something does not work.  Elements of something might work very well while other aspects do not.  We all have the personal experience of people coming to us.  The Department indicated earlier that no one had failed to travel where they had a requirement, but I have had a few.  I had someone who could not get a passport and missed a wedding.  I have had one or two other cases within the last year which would fall into that category.  It is not always entirely the Department's fault if someone looks at his or her passport a week or two before an event, but I have seen cases where it was a couple of weeks before but the person still did not manage to travel.  One particular case sticks out because it was felt to be very hurtful in the family.</p> <p>  Certainly, the online process is working and making a significant difference and I am very pleased to see that the service has been expanded.  The reason people come to our office due to passport express service is because the word "express" and the timelines given give rise to an expectation that people are within time.  However, it then goes a week or two beyond the date but the person has not sent in his or her travel documents as he or she expected fully to receive the passport back within the timeline.  When they cannot get through to the passport office, they get on to us.  That is the scenario.  As such, something must be done to address the communications issue where there is an expectation that it will take longer than the stated time.  It is taking up to eight weeks to get a passport.  It would be useful to communicate that if people are going to travel within eight weeks, they should forward their travel documents.  That would allow the office to determine the applications where it will run into a difficulty.</p><p>This is the experience we have had.  As much as some people believe politicians want constituents to keep queueing up and coming through our doors to access passport services, that is actually not the case.  We want the systems to work for people.  The issue is one of identifying solutions.</p><p> There has been a sizeable increase in the numbers of passport applications arising from Brexit.  Ireland is in a very precarious position because of Brexit.  I presume these numbers will not tail off but will continue at current levels for some time as British people working in the European Union seek to secure a passport from one of the other EU states.  A large cohort of British people would qualify for an Irish passport through Irish parentage rules.  Has the service been future proofed in terms of staffing?  How is this being handled?  Have the increases been projected out in terms of increased staff and, if so, will Mr. Burgess tell us about this?</p><p> Irish passports are sought after and important internationally.  They are European Union passports.  Obviously, they are sometimes lost or stolen and, possibly, misused.  How does the Passport Office deal with that issue?  Does it have a unit or section that deals with it?  Are there costs associated with this?  Is the theft or misuse of an Irish passport solely a matter for the criminal code of the jurisdiction in which it takes place?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-21a.139" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Burgess" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018062100002#H00200"><p>There are people who miss connections because they do not have a passport, and I acknowledge this.  What I was saying was that nobody who is caught up with these delays, who submitted a passport with one expectation in terms of the processing time and then found their application was delayed, and who came to our attention and of whom we are aware, has missed a flight because we will always pull that passport application and try to process it for that person.  If people discover they have lost their passport on the morning they are due to travel, they will miss their flights.  This is happening quite a lot.  We are making determined efforts to ensure nobody suffers by missing a connection because of the delays being experienced in the Passport Office.</p> <p>  Accurate communication is fundamental and information has to be put into people's hands.  We took the view when we looked at our communications for this year that prevention is much better than cure.  Therefore, we have put a lot of effort into communicating clearly ahead of time that if people are travelling this year they should look at their passports early.  We have tried to give clear guidance, through Members of the Oireachtas and local media, on how to do this.  We have kept our processing times accurate on the Department's website.  Communication is fundamental and one of the issues at present is that people feel they cannot reach us, and this is a real problem and concern for us.</p> <p>  On the Brexit dimension, the increase arising through Brexit is not the major part of the increase in demand we are experiencing.  We see most of the Brexit-related increase through Northern Ireland and the UK, and each of these two categories constitutes approximately 10% of the total number of applications coming into the Passport Office.  So far this year, the numbers coming in from Northern Ireland are approximately comparable to last year.  There is no significant spike there, although there is a slight increase.  The increase in applications from the UK is approximately 20% compared with last year.  That is a 20% increase this year on a 10% slice of the passports.  The greater part of the increase has to do simply with the fact that more people are travelling and applying for passports.  People who did not travel in previous years, for one or other reason, are applying now.  This is the greater part of the increase.</p> <p>  We do projections every year, and we have done projections on a range of scenarios on the likely increase arising directly from Brexit.  I will ask Ms Penollar to say a few words on this.  By and large, our projections in the previous year have been in line with what we see each year.  I do not think we have got the projection part of it wrong so far, and we are projecting a range for next year.</p></speech>

I mentioned that we manage the surge in passport applications in the first half of the year with temporary staff.  We are finding it harder this year to hold on to the temporary staff we recruited and trained in January.  They are leaving because they are getting other opportunities, so staff turnover is higher in the Passport Office.  This means we need to look again at the balance between full-time staff and temporary staff when we come to next year.</p> <p>  On stolen passports, I will ask Ms Penollar to speak about the integrity dimension, which is a big part of the passport's work, and which goes unspoken and unreported to a large extent.</p></speech>

On a weekly basis, we have updates on our website on exactly where we are on turnaround times so people know before they choose a channel which one to go down.  It is a lot harder for us when someone is in the Passport Express system.  On one of our busiest days in May alone we received 10,000 applications.  The Deputy can imagine the difficulty we would have extracting one application from 10,000 applications.  The challenge for us is that when we extract an application from Passport Express it has a natural knock-on effect on other people who may not have contacted us because they understood their application would be processed within a certain time.  If we extract applications, other people will be affected so it is very much a balancing act.</p> <p>  The turnaround times shown on the website are live and valid.  Today on the website the turnaround time for first-time, lost or stolen applicants is 33 days for the first time this year and it is 15 days for renewals.  The actual turnaround time is 14 days for renewals and 31 days for the others, but we like to give a buffer as it gives us a bit of flexibility.</p></speech>

Regarding the lost or stolen passports, since 2013 when we introduced a new passport with over 80 security features, we have not actually found an incident where someone has been able to tamper in any credible way with a passport.  Because of the security features it is very hard to substitute a photograph.  It is very hard to doctor the passport.  That is a huge pillar of our protection.</p> <p>  We also have an integrity unit which has very close links, not only here with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and others involved in integrity issues, but also with Interpol.  We have international groupings where we meet and discuss latest trends and risk profiling.  We put an awful lot of emphasis on protecting the integrity because it is so important for every passport holder.  The integrity of the passport means that, as the Deputy says, we can travel.  We have that visa-free travel.  We are either number four or five in the world as a passport for visa-free travel.  That is primarily down to the integrity of the actual physical passport but also the process.  That again comes back to the turnarounds in some areas.</p></speech>

Two centres are funded - the cultural centre in Paris and the arts centre in New York.  Based on replies to parliamentary questions a sizeable amount of funding is given to the arts centre in New York from the US side - way more than is provided from Ireland.  Why have those two locations been selected?  Is it because there is a benefit?  I can see the benefit from New York.  Why, for example, would the cultural centre in the UK not feature where there might be a more significant population than in Paris?  Why does that happen?</p></speech>

When the Irish arts centre in New York was originally conceived - it was not a Government project, but a project that was taken on largely by the Irish community in New York itself - they were conscious of the fact that almost every European community in New York has a platform for its culture in New York.  The Irish arts centre in New York, which was a very small operation, was teaching dance, giving language classes and offering a venue to host young Irish artists who were coming over.  It was really done on a very modest basis.  I think the community itself felt it wanted a platform that was comparable with what other communities have but also was a worthy platform for Irish culture in the US.  By far the greater part of the funding for that project has come from New York City Council-----</p></speech>

I acknowledge the work of our diplomatic corps.  Deputy Farrell and I, through our membership of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, would have occasion to deal with our embassies a couple of times a year and see their work at first hand.  I also have seen this recently in respect of the Inter-Parliamentary Union.  Mr. Burgess talked about communication.  The recent RT&Eacute; documentary showing the working of our missions was very important in getting that out to the wider public.  I acknowledge that at the outset.</p> <p>  A key role of our ambassadors is linked to the promotion of this country, its economic base and the strength of our firms on a global basis.  In that context Martin Shanahan from IDA Ireland spoke about and spoke highly of that work when he was here.  One of the key countries is undoubtedly the US given its influence here in terms of investment.  This week some Members of the Oireachtas have refused to attend celebrations at the US Embassy in the Phoenix Park because of the actions of the US President.  His actions involving the imprisonment of people in meshed cages on the border would not be seen in "Game of Thrones".  I think this man is trying to style himself on Ramsay Bolton, such is the cruelty of the actions he is overseeing</p> <p>  I ask the Secretary General to outline the impact of these globally viewed actions on relations between us and US representatives in the Phoenix Park.  I am conscious of the fine line, given the work of people like Martin Shanahan and the investment he speaks of.  Does that play a role in restricting the Department's response both here and in our embassy in the US when there might be an intention to want to go harder?  It is an extremely important issue this week.  That Members of these Houses are refusing invitations from the US Embassy is a very serious matter from a diplomatic point of view and I would like to hear the Secretary General's thoughts on that.</p></speech>

There is an open and at times robust discussion on many issues, including global and regional.  That is a part of the relationship and it has been a part of the relationship for quite some time now.</p><p>Ireland-US relations are probably unmatched in their richness and complexity outside the European Union.  Martin Shanahan was reflecting one aspect of those relations, which are incredibly important to us but are actually very important to the US as well.  Close to 100,000 US workers are employed by Irish investors in the US. </p></speech>

Therefore there is a reciprocity in this relationship that is very important.  There is a people-to-people dimension to this relationship that is very important as well.  We have vibrant emigrant communities in the US.  We have a vibrant and caring diaspora in the US that has been incredibly important to us and remains so in terms of our own peace process.  We have a very rich cultural relationship as well.  All of that needs to be borne in mind when we talk about these issues.</p></speech>

I do not expect Mr. Burgess to comment politically but I am asking if, from a diplomatic point of view, those actions which are not shared by this country place a strain on those relations.</p></speech>

We were talking earlier, for example, about the situation in Palestine; in the West Bank and in Gaza.  The US withdrawal of funding for UNRWA is having a significant impact on the ground.  In respect of the US withdrawal from the United Nations Population Fund, UNFPA, an organisation we work with closely which deals with issues of gender and equality that we care about deeply, we can see the impact of that on the ground as well.

In the case of the Embassy to the Holy See, I think we have two local staff and a small chancery very close to the Vatican.  That mission has done an extraordinarily good job on limited resources in a very limited period.  It is an example of what we can do with modest resources.  The Global Ireland document refers to looking again at this model.  If there is a single assigned diplomat, in respect of sickness or annual leave there are duty of care considerations for us as a Department.  That would give us concern about the model and the Global Ireland document does refer to progressively phasing it out and increasing the resources we have in very small embassies.</p> <p>  On the cost cutting, that was done on financial grounds.  That is my understanding within the Department and I have never seen any suggestion or evidence to the contrary.</p></speech>

Mr. Burgess touched on the strategy in terms of communication going back to the earlier part of the year and focusing at a local level and on local media.  What lessons have been learned from that in looking towards rolling it out more broadly?  What worked well and did not work well?</p> <p>  At a national level, a few weeks ago the Department got a whole Joe Duffy show to itself.  One knows one has made it when one gets a whole Joe Duffy show.  Communications happen on two fronts.  They happen on a macro level whereby the Department wants to get its message out to advise people as to the best channels to obtain the documents they need.  The biggest thing we would find as public representatives is the frustration people are feeling with the communications at a micro level.  Could Mr. Burgess touch on the communications strategy and on what has worked well on a micro level?  I appreciate that the Department cannot deal with every single telephone call that comes through but it is a frustration for people.</p></speech>

There are people from divisions right across the Department - from Mr. de B&uacute;rca's division in Irish Aid, Mr. Gormley's in corporate services, and Ms Cullinane's in strategy and performance - who are volunteering, working with the Passport Office to help them on communications, particularly on web chat.  We have taken resources from elsewhere to work the phones and we have resources now helping us to deal with the passport backlog as well.  This is a collective, corporate effort across the Department.</p></speech>

That is the biggest issue.  It is one thing acknowledging a representation, phone call or email.  How is it panning out in terms of actually following that through to an end result?</p></speech>

We have the tracker system, with which I am sure many members are familiar.  Over 60% of our conversations with people are to the effect that they saw something on the tracker and they are asking whether it is true.  It is important to give that reassurance.  If we are aware of someone who is travelling on a date who is in any way affected by the delays, we ensure that those people are moved along.  We look at between approximately 200 and 400 people a day with whom we are having such contacts.  That is because we are in the peak of the peak at present.  We have ridden the crest of the wave and are now coming down.  If we were having this conversation in four weeks' time, it would be very different with regard to volumes etc.  It is important that we take on board those lessons and that in future, we put measures in place to ensure that we can improve our communications constantly.  Web chat has been a major development for us this year and has really changed how we are able to interact with people.  In a web chat scenario, one operator can have conversations with six or seven people at a time, which is very different from phones and is a much better situation.  As the Secretary General said, we have, in the past number of weeks, increased our resources there.  We have moved from perhaps a relatively low base but have tripled our web chat in the last four weeks, and we continue to do that, because that is a lesson learned in respect of where we want to go.</p> <p>  With regard to moving from local to national media, a reason we have focused on local media is because it gives more intimacy.  A challenge we have when communicating about passports, which I am sure members have come across many times, is that people only apply once every ten years.  If they are in between that ten-year cycle, to be frank, the message does not really resonate with them because they are not in that position.  That is the huge challenge.  Perhaps when they go to the bedside locker and realise that the passport that they were convinced was in the safest place ever is not there, it is not immediately clear to them what that message was.  The focus on local media is to bring it into that background noise so that they will recall it.  We have found that has worked this year.  We will only increase it and make it work better for us as we go forward.</p></speech>

With regard to elections, there has been much talk of extending the franchise to Irish citizens abroad.  I sit on the Seanad electoral reform group myself.  That has been spoken about with regard to elections too.  Many other countries use their embassies abroad to facilitate that with elections.  What opinion do the witnesses have about replicating that?  Would we be equipped to do that, both from a cost and a practicality point of view?</p></speech>

It is the way our embassies and missions are set up.  Some are very small, modest offices that do not lend themselves to being polling booths.  It is related to our spread.  We are not where even some of the classic Irish communities have been.  We are only opening now in New Zealand, where there is a very large emigrant Irish community.  Newer, recent Irish communities are much more dispersed than the older Irish communities.  In Australia, we have a large Irish community in Perth and in Melbourne.  They will not come to Canberra or to Sydney to vote.  We have also looked at how other systems operate.  I will ask Ms Caitr&iacute;ona Ingoldsby from our Irish Abroad unit to talk about this.  We have been looking at this closely to see how it might be operated.</p></speech>

That options paper currently identifies postal voting as the preferred option for a number of reasons that the Secretary General has outlined.  E-voting is a possible future solution but according to colleagues from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, it is not universally accepted as secure.  Postal voting is the preferred solution at present.  Because our citizens are so displaced and our representational footprint is small compared with the number of citizens we have abroad with, for example, Perth being a five-hour flight from Canberra or Sydney, would we expect our citizens in Perth to take a five-hour flight to cast a vote when casting one by postal vote might be easier?</p></speech>

I raised the issue of online voting with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government yesterday, stressing that point.  We have seen it in smaller nations which have increased their franchise, even in domestic parliamentary elections.  There is a big distinction between electronic voting and online voting.  Online voting allows one to capture that.  I think it would allow our citizens abroad to participate in the democratic process.</p></speech>

The reason I do not want to know is because I want to make the point that, with the turnaround times the Department has, with all the information there, with the web chat, which is a fantastic initiative, and all those steps, it is unfortunate that Members of the Oireachtas, collectively, have to be involved in the process.  I acknowledge that we aid the process and that there are always individuals who might need a bit of extra help, which is what we are here for.  The fact that it is 400 a week is about 375 too many.  I might get a dozen or two dozen in the run-up to the summer and then sporadically across the rest of the year.  Is it an online accessibility issue, a regional issue or a rural issue?  Forgive me, I cannot see Fiona's full name.  Is it Penolly?</p></speech>

Deputy Cassells will be delighted to hear that given his former profession.  It is vital that this is done.  It is not simply that it would reduce what we have to do &ndash; I do not have a problem doing the work &ndash; but at the end of the day the Department is providing the service and we might aid the service.</p> <p>  One important point is that I have to do everything on email.  I have no wish to be taking up the time of personnel in the Passport Office but I would like to be able to telephone them on a dedicated Oireachtas line, as is provided in various other Departments.  That is a necessity.  Maybe it should have limited opening hours but I believe it would aid the process.  If I sent an email about Austin Gormley's passport application, I might get a response.  I would get an acknowledgement but I might not get a response until close of business the following day.  That is not really a big issue, but we have all highlighted cases where it is critical and crucial that we can get in contact.  Deputy Murphy mentioned the person who missed the wedding.  I have no wish to be in a queue, frankly.  I imagine the officials understand that my office deals with a great many issues.  That is something to bear in mind.  If the webchat can be promoted as a mechanism available to the public, it would be fantastic.</p> <p>  I am keen to go back to the total cost of embassies.  It would be helpful for us to be provided with the document that the Chairman has already requested, that is to say, a document with a breakdown of rent versus buy.  We have discussed the matter previously, especially in the crash period between 2011 and 2013, when we were closing embassies among other steps.  The cost of the embassy in Japan was highlighted because it was the most expensive real estate in the world.  Anyway, there is a point at which the State must make a decision on whether it is far better to buy than rent when we have escalating costs and fluctuations in the property market.  We could even use the analogy of the Irish property market - it is a good example.  If a person bought property in 2008 he is lumbered with it for life, whereas if he bought in 2012 he would have paid less than half the price or even less again depending on the property.  One suggested policy direction for the Department to take, in consultation with the Minister, is to upscale the number of purchases that we should pursue rather than a policy of rental.  This is especially relevant in the context of the six new embassies &ndash; which are very welcome &ndash; that are to be opened next year.  Some of these are additional facilities in countries where we already have a base.  However, in other cases there is no base.  The officials referenced Ukraine, which is strategic for us.  Deputy Cassells and I work on the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.  The Russia-Ukraine relationship is important and so on.  I spotted the Ukrainian ambassador wandering around the halls of Leinster House first thing this morning.  The constant interaction with those two countries is important.  The price of property in Kiev is probably only a drop in the ocean compared to Tokyo but the idea should be pursued as far as possible.  The final point I had intended making has been covered.</p></speech>

I figure it is always going to be a mixed portfolio and it will look a little different depending on where we are.  In Cairo, for example, where we have concerns around security and the safety of our staff at the embassy, we are co-located with the Dutch.  We take tremendous benefits from that, not only the natural benefits from working with closely with another EU partner but from some of the systems the Dutch bring because they have a foreign Ministry of scale.  One of the things that we look at as we open more embassies is the option of co-location.</p> <p>  It makes absolute sense in the areas where we have major strategic interests and where the perspective is for rents to continue increasing.  Japan is always going to be an important relationship and platform for Ireland.  That is where we begin in the short term.  Anyway, I completely agree: more often than not when we consider the arguments for purchase the long-term benefits are significant and weight in its favour.</p> <p>  There are some issues around accommodation.  Many of our embassies are very small and families have different needs.  When I was in New York I had my two children with me.  We were a family.  I was succeeded by an officer who did not have children.  We were in accommodation that was rented as standard by the Department.  Sometimes the needs of the individual officer vary as well and in smaller locations it may make sense to look at short-term rentals.  The arguments for purchase in the longer-term generally stack up &ndash; I agree with that.</p></speech>

Only recently we had the president of a university before the committee.  He was in accommodation for &euro;3,000 per month on taxpayers' money.  That is simply an example.  Whether that is good value for money is a matter for us to examine.  Anyway, that mentality has persisted in recent years.  That is why I made my comments.</p> <p>  I have some specific questions on fraud and I will come back to justice and aid in a moment.  Page 20, dealing with Vote 28, refers to fraud and suspected fraud.  What is the update on that note?  It states that the Department initiated an investigation that was at an early stage.  The note dates from 2016 but we are in 2018 now.  Has that been completed?  Where are we on that?</p></speech>

We ask all our recruits to go out to schools to talk to transition year students about how to take care of themselves.  Irish people are travelling at an older age as well.  They are vulnerable to falling ill and having health problems while they are abroad.</p><p>Irish people are travelling further afield in south-east Asia, further from our embassy network where consular complex cases can arise which can consume a great deal of time and attention.

In the last few years, Irish citizens have been killed in a terrorist attack in Tunisia.

It will take 60 years to reach the target that has been changed on I do not know how many occasions and we see so much money going into defence.  I have other words for that.  Mr. Burgess probably cannot comment because it is policy.  The Department is doing great work, albeit with some questions around various issues that have been dealt with.  We are struggling to come up to that percentage of 0.7% of GDP yet we have any amount of money for defence projects.

We have detailed sustained activities in other countries which are not <i>ad hoc</i>and we are increasingly trying to take a regional view of our programming.  We have a country programme in Ethiopia, for example, and we have a programme in Uganda.  Uganda is receiving a lot of refugees from South Sudan.  Ethiopia is in a fragile region.  We are increasingly trying to take a look at how our programming has a wider regional impact, and it does do so.  It is misleading and artificial to draw a line between development programmes and humanitarian assistance and the profound insecurity that one finds in these regions as well.  The Irish Defence Forces, for example, have assisted with training in Somalia, which is one of the most insecure parts of the world.  We have assisted as well in Chad, in Mali and in the Congo and the attempts to provide human security for citizens in these profoundly unstable areas has to be seen also as contributing to the conditions which allow for sustainable development in those countries too.</p></speech>

At some stage, there needs to be a recognition at Government level that we cannot go on without looking at what is causing this in the first place and our role and the EU's role in that in terms of policy.  We have policies that are leading to the lack of stability yet we are struggling to bring a little assistance and aid.</p></speech>

What is causing the conflict in the first place and what is leading to 65 million refugees?  We must look at that on a policy level and begin to question.  This aid is fantastic but it is tiny and it is trying to make up for what we are doing wrong in the first place.</p></speech>

We are involved in the Global Compact for Migration, which is an effort to address some of the underlying issues.  As we develop the new White Paper, it is clearly one of the questions of the age.  We try with our development co-operation programming to address some of the root causes which are around poverty and development questions to a large extent.  In addressing poverty and development issues in Africa or elsewhere, we must be careful not to make our aid an instrumentalised issue.  It is not just about targeting migration.  It has to be about the defined needs of the populations we work with.  There is a delicate balance that we will have to work out.  That is where having a presence on the ground through embassies is very important.  It helps us to fine tune the responses to what locals need.</p></speech>

It was like being at home in Ireland.  Tanzania has the fastest economy in east Africa.  We were asked to look at gender violence, which we are very familiar with here.

I cannot remember the gentleman's surname.  I think his forename was John and he was an impressive person.  However, there was a noticeable absence of any overview on climate change.  Mr. de B&uacute;rca may be able to confirm that our food provision and other programmes have an environmental aspect which recognises that there may be by-products that might, for example, damage a water table, and that things could be done in another way.  Mr. de B&uacute;rca is nodding, which I will take as a "Yes".  I do not want to delay proceedings.</p> <p>  The only thing we have not touched on at all was suspected fraud, or rather suspected irregularities, within the Department, which is referred to in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.

Our tradition is that if we pledge money, we pay it.  Sometimes, we pledge over a multiannual period and we keep track of that in the Department.  If we pledge &euro;20 million over three years, we ensure that we have paid it out by the end of the third year.  By and large, we have done that.  The only time I am aware of when we undershot was in or about 2010 when, for reasons to do with the economy here, there were big budget cuts.  In that instance, we tried to do it in a way which was agreed and notified to allow partners to plan.</p></speech>

There is in Vote 27 a special provision which is not in use in other Votes whereby there is a buffer in relation to bilateral and other co-operation grant funding.

What one thinks what will spend on 1 January is not necessarily what one's outturn is.  We try to balance it and reprofile during the year, but there is always a margin on foot of due diligence, prudence or because something is finished.

We are talking about expanding the number of missions overseas.  The Department has described a scenario in which there can be a change in the profile of people taking over in terms of family situation and so on.

I will give an example from my own experience.  I moved into accommodation that was provided when I was in New York.  It was furnished to representational standard, but we lived in a small space at the back.  We had three bedrooms, a small living room and a kitchen.  That was our family space and we brought our own furniture to accommodate it.  In an embassy, if one has a representational function, the furnishings are provided as part of the official set-up of the building.  Officers on a short-term assignment have the option of renting a furnished apartment or bringing some of their own furniture.  Most want to bring some of their own immediate surroundings to provide a sense of home.</p></speech>

As we are at the end of the lifetime of the current roster, in the next two weeks a new call for applications will be made.  Our intention is to try to get approximately 200 people on the roster.  It will be a competitive interview process.  There will be a full note on it on our website with the call for applications.  We will send a copy to the committee.  Language is one criterion because in some of the countries people do not speak English.  We want to get good people in order that the process will be competitive.  I imagine that not everybody who will apply will meet the threshold, but we hope to get 200 good people on the roster.  The number of elections held per year varies, but, on average, there are around 20 electoral missions a year, either EU or OSCE missions.  During the lifetime of the register we try to give everybody an opportunity, but we have to take account of language and other criteria which the organising bodies impose on us.</p></speech>

However, that was not enough for those who had sought the information and they wanted proof.</p> <p>  On Vote 27 and the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, overseas development assistance, ODA, was approximately &euro;725 million in the year under review.  There was another &euro;485,000 approximately in the Vote.  There is also a reference to a figure of &euro;240 million from other sources.  I think it was said the figures were included in Irish Aid's annual report.  Will somebody send us a snapshot to show from where the other figure comes?  Who is responsible for publishing Irish Aid's annual report?</p></speech>

Agreed.  Is it agreed that there is nothing arising that will not be on the agenda?  Agreed.</p> <p>  There are three categories of correspondence.  Category A relates to briefing documents and opening statements.  Correspondence item 1392A is a briefing document from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for today's meeting.  We note and publish that.  It has already been discussed.</p> <p>  Document No. 1411A is the opening statement from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for today's meeting.  We note and publish that.  It has already been discussed.</p> <p>  Correspondence item 1405A from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade provides statistical information on passports requested by the committee.  We note and publish that.  We had a detailed discussion on that earlier today.</p> <p>  Correspondence category B is correspondence from Accounting Officers or Ministers or both and follow-up to Committee of Public Accounts meetings.  A number of members are not present and others have not had an opportunity to read some of the correspondence.  I have been asked to hold a number of items of correspondence over to next week.</p> <p>  Correspondence item 1370B from the Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, dated 11 June 2018, provides an information note requested by the committee on the funding scheme in place for local authorities to provide housing for refugees.  We note and publish that.  We had a detailed discussion on that earlier today.</p> <p>  Correspondence item 1371 is from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills and is dated 11 June 2018.  I have been asked by members to hold that over until people have an opportunity to consider it.  The same applies to the next item, correspondence item 1380 from Dr. Graham Love, chief executive of the Higher Education Authority.  Due to members not being present I have been asked to hold that over to the next meeting.  Correspondence item 1384B also  is from Dr. Graham Love of the Higher Education Authority dated 15 June 2018.  I have been asked to hold that over and it will be on our list next week.</p> <p>  Correspondence item 1385B from Ms Dee Forbes, director general of RT&Eacute;, dated 15 June 2018, is in response to an email received from an individual querying information provided to the committee regarding the possibility of having an RT&Eacute; 2+1 channel.  Ms Forbes clarifies that RT&Eacute; 2+1 does not currently exist, which is something I asked.  I think we will hold that over.  There is a second item of correspondence.  I express my exasperation.  We had a detailed conversation with the Department about getting an RT&Eacute; 2+1 channel on the Sky platform.  We received a detailed reply last week which does not answer the question and does not correct the record.  In the meantime, we have received a further letter from Dee Forbes of RT&Eacute;, which again does not fully clarify the matter.  They are all just talking around the system.  We asked a direct question and had the debate here about putting the RT&Eacute; 2+1 channel up on the Sky platform and we have now established that the channel does not even exist.  It may get permission and then make the channel; I do not know the details of the technology.  We will hold this over because we are expecting further correspondence to clarify what I thought was a simple question.</p></speech>

That item is held over until the next meeting.</p> <p>  The next item, correspondence item 1387B from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, dated 12 June 2018, is held over to the next meeting.</p> <p>  Correspondence item 1388B received from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, dated 5 June 2018, relates to the local government funding baseline review and consultation process.  We note and publish that.  I encourage all members of the committee and all Members of the Houses to make a contribution to that consultation process because it exercises the minds of many public representatives.</p> <p>  Correspondence item 1389B is from Mr. Tadhg Daly, chief executive officer of Nursing Homes Ireland.  The document is a formal agreement between the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, and Nursing Homes Ireland.  This was provided at last week&rsquo;s meeting.  We are just noting and publishing that.</p></speech>

I made the point that it did not resolve the question of whether issues of price fixing were discussed by Nursing Homes Ireland but were never actioned.  Because they were never actioned, no action could be taken by the CCPC.  It actually states here that it can confirm-----</p></speech>

It states "NHI hereby confirms that NHI and, to the best of its knowledge, its members did not at any stage implement any collective actions..."  Therefore we know it did not implement any, but the question was whether it was discussed.</p> <p>  The document continues to state: "NHI hereby undertakes..."  All of the undertakings are the issues that were in the public domain that appeared in the minutes.  It is quite interesting.  Essentially NHI is saying it promises not to implement what it said it did not talk about.  We need to note that we were stonewalled.  The witness had a right not to answer questions when he was here.  However, the CEO was not in a position to confirm or deny whether the word "boycott" was used.  He simply said he did not use it.  This document indicates there was an agreement with the CCPC that it did not action what was potentially discussed at that meeting and that it would not do so in future.  It is set out in the document.  It vindicates us in pursuing this.  I acknowledge that there is now a written legal agreement that it will not.  However, it certainly raises questions for the organisation about it putting itself in that position in the first place.  It ended up having to sign such an agreement with the CCPC.</p></speech>

Why is there a commitment not to discuss a certain issue if there was not a feeling it had been discussed?  That is the point he is making.  In any event that is now published by Nursing Homes Ireland here as a result of last week's meeting.  The point the Deputy makes speaks for itself.  We note that and the Deputy's comments are also recorded.</p></speech>

It relates to a note on the lab screening data; copies of emails or other correspondence from the national director of acute hospitals in which he forwarded correspondence received on 13 July 2017 from the CEO of the University of Limerick group; and a note on the contract with the laboratories and whether there is any provision which gives recourse to the State to pursue a laboratory where an indemnity to the patient is invoked.</p></speech>

We will note and publish that and wait for the rest of the information.</p> <p> Correspondence item 1394 is from Mr. Ray Mitchell of the HSE in regard to a matter raised at our last meeting regarding offering open access to all records to Dr Scally.  What does that letter say?  It is a short note.  We will note and publish that.</p> <p>   In correspondence category C, items 1342C, 1355C (i) to (vi) and 1362C in regard to wards of court were held over from our last meeting.  We will hold them over until our next meeting.</p> <p>  Item 1347, relating to GoSafe cameras, was held over from the last meeting.  Some members who are not present asked that it be held over as they are not here.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is 1350.  It was received from an individual regarding a submission to the committee on protected disclosures in the Irish Prison Service.  I was asked by members who are not present to hold that over to the next meeting.</p> <p>  Correspondence item 1386C is an anonymous letter from an individual who made a protected disclosure in regard to wrongdoing at a location in Limerick.  It requests that the committee make inquiries with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Again, members not present have asked for that to be held over.</p> <p>  Correspondence items 1398C and 1399C, dated 18 June 2018, are from Deputy MacSharry and draw attention to issues in regard to the selection and operation of the election observation roster by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  This matter was dealt with during our engagement with the Department this morning.  The Department has a panel which is expiring.  The Department representatives said they hope to establish a new panel but that will not be done until the end of the year, so the current panel will remain in place until then.  The Department will publish criteria in the next two weeks and invite interested members of the public to put forward their names for consideration.  A new panel is about to be established.  Is that of benefit?  I am summarising what was said this morning when that topic was specifically discussed.  We are to receive a detailed note on why the current panel was allowed to expire without this action being taken in advance.  The witnesses stated that there were staffing issues.  We asked for a detailed briefing note this morning and we will receive that shortly.  We will note and publish that item and wait for the response.</p> <p>  I will return to correspondence item 1316, received on 11 May 2018 from the former vice president of Cork Institute of Technology, CIT, regarding matters discussed at the committee meeting on 22 March 2018.  We held this item over.  At our meeting on 22 March in regard to public private partnerships, PPPs, a number of points were made regarding the former vice president and his role as contract manager at CIT&rsquo;s National Maritime College, which he says were untrue or misleading.  He has written to the committee to state that he was not here to respond to those points.  We are providing this opportunity for him to correct the record.  At the request of the committee, the clerk has liaised with the individual to summarise the main points of his letter.  It is an extensive letter and I do not wish to read it all, so will just give the main points.  I ask any member with observations on what I am about to read into the record to listen carefully and take me up on it if he or she so wishes.</p> <p>  First, the individual clarifies that he was not the contract manager during the construction phase and accepts that, as a scientist, he would be unlikely to have the skills to oversee the construction phase.  The committee acknowledged that already at our meeting on 24 May.  Second, following the hand-over of the building, he oversaw the operational phase on request of the Department of Education and Skills.  He believes it is not accurate or fair to say that he did not have the relevant skills to oversee the operational phase.  Third, the individual states he was never employed by companies that were subsets of the college.  However, the committee notes that he was an unpaid director.  That was put on the record on the last occasion this was dealt with and we again note it now.  Fourth, following retirement, he was employed one day a week by Cork Institute of Technology to support the college in a number of areas but that what was involved required attendance in the college on three or four days a week.  Fifth, in respect of his retirement party, he states that CIT did not contribute to this but that it was paid for by friends and colleagues who attended.  Sixth, he states that any problems with the building were the responsibility of the PPP company and it was required to meet the costs.  That was also stated at the meeting on 24 May.  In summary, the individual was greatly upset by what he believes were false and misleading statements made about him while he was not present to defend himself.  We have now provided an opportunity for the record to be corrected. Can we note and record that item of correspondence?  Noted.</p> <p>  The committee has received five items of correspondence from an individual regarding matters arising from the amalgamation of Kiltoghert Co-operative Agricultural and Dairy Society and the North Connacht Farmers' Co-operative Society in 2000.  These items have not been circulated.  The correspondent makes a number of allegations in regard to irregularities in the amalgamation process, procedural and behavioural matters relating to the Garda and procedural failures by officials of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The substantive items in regard to the amalgamation process of co-operatives and allegations in regard to the Garda are not within the remit of the committee.  For informational purposes, issues relating to the amalgamation should be addressed to the Registrar of Friendly Societies in the Companies Registration Office and allegations in regard to the Garda should be dealt with by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, not the Committee of Public Accounts.  Given that serious accusations are made about specific individuals, with the consent of the committee I propose that the items not be circulated and that we inform the individual that we will not consider the matter further.  I propose that we return the documentation to the individual.  If any member wishes to see the documentation before it is returned, he or she may contact the clerk.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>

There is enough to do at the moment.  We will move on and return it with that covering note, explaining those two points.</p> <p>  The next item is statements and accounts received since the previous meeting.  The first one is a clear audit opinion on Dublin City University and the usual issue around the third pension funding in the public sector.  That is normal.</p> <p>  The next item is a clear audit opinion from the Commission for Communications Regulation.</p> <p>  The next item is from the Health Information Quality Authority, HIQA.  A qualified opinion has been given because of its retirement benefit entitlements, which are only met as they become payable.  That is a regular issue arising in respect of public sector bodies concerning payment for pensions.</p> <p>  The next item is the Louth and Meath Education and Training Board, ETB.  It should be remembered that these are the accounts for 2015, so they are a bit behind times.  We highlighted last year that there was a specific problem with this ETB.  Attention is drawn to the disclosure in the statement of internal control.  An invoice redirection fraud on the board in November 2017 resulted in the loss of an estimated &euro;246,000.  That is shocking.  We have to write to the ETB for a fully detailed report as to how that happened.  There is also a question of weakness in the board's control regarding accumulated PLC fee income and bank accounts.  There is a further on the delays in finalising the financial statements in 2015 due to changes in senior personnel in the ETB.  We were made aware of that in public here last year when the ETB appeared before the committee.  We need to write to the ETB for a detailed note about that loss of &euro;246,000 and the invoice redirection fraud.  I do not know anything about it, so I believe we need detailed information about it.</p> <p>  The next item is the Clare and Limerick ETB.  It has supplied its audit opinion and, again, there is a level of non-compliance with national procurement guidelines.  We will have to come back to that issue across the entirety of the public service because it is cropping up every week.</p> <p>  The next item is from Waterford Institute of Technology for the year ending 31 August 2016.  Attention is drawn to the going-concern status of the institute, which had an accumulated deficit of &euro;4.4 million to the end of August 2016 and which did not provide for pension benefits in the financial statements.  That is normal, but the issue of the deficit still arises.  The accounts were prepared on the basis that the institute will continue to receive State funding.  That is probably a reasonable assumption.  However, the Comptroller and Auditor General cannot give a cast-iron guarantee that that will happen.  He has to draw attention to the fact that this place can only continue to trade if it continues to get funding.</p></speech>

They are not allowed to borrow.  They are also not allowed to have deficits.  That is the difficulty here.  Waterford Institute of Technology is not the only offender, but it would be useful if the committee wrote to the Higher Education Authority to ask for a breakdown of the finances of each institute of technology to ascertain which were in deficit.  This would give us a picture of how Waterford Institute of Technology compares to others.  Can that be done?</p></speech>

It is important we get updated accounts.  We will ask for a report which covers all of the institutes of technology.</p> <p>  The next item is a clear audit opinion from the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.</p> <p>  The next item is a clear audit opinion from the HSE.  The attention of the committee is drawn to some non-competitive procurement, inadequate monitoring and the oversight of grants to outside agencies.  The statement of capital income and expenditure shows a surplus from 2016 of &euro;15 million brought forward even though sanction was not obtained to do so.  The HSE is on the work programme for this committee and it is due to appear here on 5 July.  We can discuss all of those issues on that day.  We will note it in the meantime.</p> <p>  The next item is a clear audit opinion from the National Asset Management Agency.</p> <p>  The next item is a clear audit opinion from the language body.  Its accounts have been jointly audited with the Northern Ireland Comptroller and Auditor General.</p> <p>  The next item is a clear audit opinion from Trinity College Dublin.  However, attention is drawn to the deferred pension funding, and the disclosure of a cyber fraud on the Trinity Foundation in 2017, at a cost to the university of &euro;975,000.  That is staggering.  We have found out about two educational bodies today that were subject to cyberfraud or invoice redirection fraud, being Louth and Meath ETB to the tune of &euro;246,000, and Trinity College Dublin to the tune of &euro;975,000.  That is &euro;1.25 million of taxpayers' money.</p></speech>

If we see any further examples we will have to look at that specifically.  We have seen two examples of fraud.  The money taken from the foundation may not have been taxpayer money but rather money from donations, but if the foundation loses money the deficit will have to be made up eventually.</p> <p>  The next item is the work programme.  On Thursday, 28 June, the Tax Appeals Commission and the Revenue Commissioners will appear at the second session at 11.30 a.m. to deal with tax debt write-offs, withholding taxes and the appropriation accounts.  The Tax Appeals Commission is a new organisation.  There has always been a tax appeals commissioner, but there is a new structure in place.  It is a new organisation with a separate Vote, so it will be dealt with separately.  On 5 July, the HSE will appear before the committee.  On 12 July, the National Treasury Management Agency will appear before the committee, including the State Claims Agency and all the organisations under its remit.</p> <p>  Is there any other business?  I want to refer to one item of business in private session.  Can we go into private session for a moment?  Is there anything else to deal with in public session?  We have to deal with two issues in private session, namely, one item of correspondence and the discussion document circulated by the committee secretariat about preparing information for a periodic report.  It depends on how much time people have had to look at the document in advance, but we do have to clear it quite quickly.  It does not have to be finished today.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee and on behalf of the Chairman, Deputy O'Loughlin - who unfortunately cannot be here this morning and for which I apologise - I welcome Mr. Tom Cronin and Dr. Mary Lodato, former members of the board of Caranua.</p><p>I will invite each of the witnesses to make a brief opening statement, which could be a maximum of three minutes but as there are only two witnesses, there will be some latitude in the timing.  The question time is probably going to be more useful.  The opening statements will be followed by the question-and-answer engagement with committee members.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the joint committee.  If, however, they are directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Opening statements to the committee will be published on the committee website after the meeting.

We understand we are here to discuss our concern regarding Caranua.  We will address some of these concerns but we are mindful that Caranua has announced that it is to close.  In its place the Minister for Education and Skills has put forward proposals.  We must look to the future and the committee will appreciate that our focus today must therefore be on the measures announced by the Minister.  Caranua was meant to help some of the most vulnerable people in our society but it failed to do so.  As a former member of the board of the organisation, I can state this with the utmost truth and confidence.  It failed to listen to or even meet survivors.  How could it help people if it refused to communicate with them, find out what their needs and worries were and help to alleviate them?</p> <p>  What happened to us as children was a shame on the nation but what has been done to us since is a greater shame.  As a survivor, I have experienced the anger, hurt, despair and frustration of engaging with the redress commission and other State-established resources.  As a survivor advocate for more than 20 years and a former board member of Caranua, I have personally witnessed many survivors experiencing the same.  These schemes and the State&rsquo;s response to our past have failed on an ongoing fashion for one reason, namely, they never listened to survivor needs.  We did not have a voice in the decisions that affected our lives in such a difficult manner.  The committee today has a wonderful opportunity to put right the wrongs; it has a duty to do everything possible to get this mess fixed.  Let this opportunity indicate that members have listened to survivors and have their interests at heart.</p></speech>

In driving forward the redress and rehabilitation processes, it is essential that the voices and concerns of all survivors are heard so that a positive and lasting outcome is possible for all stakeholders.  We support the detailed proposal on the establishment of an independent survivor consultation forum.  For once, let us ensure survivors can exercise their individual human rights by having a say in their own well-being.  The consultation process can then be grounded in the grassroots framework, whereby survivors are provided with the tools to direct and inform the agenda.</p> <p>  The forum, comprising survivors, family members, professionals, politicians and others should be developed immediately.  This forum should be formed through collaboration with and agreement of all the stakeholders.  It should comprise at least 15 individuals to represent survivor diversity, including those living in the UK.  Right now too many survivors have been left out and every effort must be made to reach out and engage with the most vulnerable and isolated survivors and to end their distress from marginalisation and exclusion.  Many are devastated by the decision not to extend eligibility to apply to Caranua.  Survivors nationally and internationally have been dismayed by the approach of Caranua and its poor track record in delivering on the promise of redress for the effects of past harm.  Previous work done on behalf of survivors has not been sufficiently informed by survivors and for this reason has fallen short of the promises and assurances made to survivors.  It is important to emphasise that the resources for reparations and rehabilitations, as recognised by the UN Committee against Torture, are still necessary to meet the real needs of survivors.  These are needs that are yet to be identified and addressed by the State.  Let us not lose sight of the way in which the experiences of institutional abuse have created enduring negative outcomes throughout survivors' lives.</p> <p>  Almost 20 years post apology there is still much to be done in terms of assessing and addressing the needs of the survivor community, as well as the schemes and the resources put in place to facilitate improved well-being.  Although we cannot change the past, all of us in this room can work together to reduce the levels of adversity and hardship experienced by survivors now and in the future, improving their quality of life and well-being.  This is members' opportunity to do what nobody has done before, to offer survivors the true justice, fairness and dignity they deserve.  Members can do this by including survivors in the decisions that directly affect their lives and well-being, providing them with the platform to inform policy and initiate positive changes in survivor services and supports.  We implore the committee to give the document serious consideration and listen to our voices and our shared concerns and issues.  We ask that it support our recommendations to the Minister to ensure all survivors' voices are valued and properly heard and acted upon as a matter of urgency.  Let us do this right and collectively establish and inform redress and recovery.</p></speech>

When I read the documentation I understood the need to look forward but we should also acknowledge the treatment of survivors throughout the process.  I am keen to get a bit more understanding of the witnesses' experience of being survivors on the Caranua board.  It is first-hand experience and not just part of a process.  Will they elaborate on what that experience was like?  I acknowledge that the consultation must be survivor-led and survivors' voices must be heard.  My questions will be very much on how this is done.</p> <p>  When I read the report of the witnesses I contacted the Department to ask how it envisaged the consultation process would proceed.  I have been back and forth with the Department in the past six months about the consultation process.  Another group suggested having consultation processes but the issue went back and forth.  When I contacted the Department this week to ask how it would ensure that survivors could be part of developing the agenda of the consultation process, it indicated it would set up an online element and a free telephone service.  Perhaps the officials present will correct me if I took that up wrong.</p><p>That element is intended to set the agenda for how the face-to-face consultation process will take place.   I can provide the witnesses with the Department's full response if necessary.  Apart from feeding into the consultation process and the free-phone and online channels to be provided in that process, what else do survivors need to become part of the process of setting the agenda for consultation talks, or consultation and review?  Why will the involvement of survivors at an early stage be so important to getting the next phase of redress right?  What must be put in place to get survivors to re-engage with the process?  They trusted the process when they engaged first.  To be oppressed and ignored all over again is hard and people become tired of fighting their way through a process that has not been easy to access.  What do we need to do to re-engage them at this point?  How can we acknowledge the value of what survivors bring to this process?  How can we best reclaim and preserve the survivors' narrative throughout this process and in the future?</p><p> I will follow up with the Department on another issue that struck me while reading through the documents.  It relates to who will be appointed to the interdepartmental committee.  The witnesses can correct me if I am wrong but I understand their document refers to concerns that Caranua could be part of that process.  The Department confirmed to me that Caranua will not be involved and that the interdepartmental committee will comprise officials from the Departments of Education and Skills, Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Health and Justice and Equality.  As such, it will be an in-house exercise involving Departments rather than Caranua.  I will ask the Department to confirm that Caranua will not inform the process, given the view that the organisation failed miserably and should not be part of the process.</p><p> The other concern I have relates to the extension of eligibility criteria and the decision not to take new applications from 1 August onwards.  When the consultation has concluded and the interdepartmental committee completes its work, will a new body be established to consider eligibility criteria and do things right from that point onwards?  Is it acceptable that to have such conditions in place considering that the process is so flawed?  Must we first fix the process and then readjust the eligibility criteria and reopen applications?  There is no point in establishing a consultation process and an interdepartmental committee if a new redress scheme and new supports and advocacy are not provided for the survivors who have engaged with Caranua.  </p></speech>

Personal contact with people is needed.  It is a shame that the officials thought survivors could feed into the consultation process through a telephone line.  We are people with needs, and those needs have to be recognised.  To have the barrier represented by a telephone is disrespectful when we consider the complex trauma survivors are dealing with.  The consultation needs to be on the ground with people to identify what are the views of the survivors and what they want and need.  That will be a big exercise.  Trust has been broken and survivors are being betrayed again.  The process must get people to come forward.  Their needs are so great that they do not know where to start.  Sometimes we need somebody on the ground to support them.  There is no support available in the United Kingdom from any of the organisations that understand survivors.  That is where the big lack of provision is and it will be an uphill task to try to get survivors to re-engage.  For me, this is about having people who understand the survivor community and genuinely reaching out it. </p></speech>

We must obviously go back before we can go forward.  We are discussing Caranua, which has failed miserably since it was established.  It has used one excuse after another not to meet survivors.  That should have flagged to the Department or anybody else that there is something wrong.  Caranua is supposed to represent survivors, yet it is failing to meet them.  Why?  There was a problem immediately and we did not know the extent of it until we were appointed to the board.  We very quickly became aware of the problem.  The gap in mindset between Caranua and survivors was millions of miles wide.  It could not be measured because Caranua was coming from a different planet.  That is the starting point.</p> <p>  The involvement of the Departments of Education and Skills and Health in this matter has been a total failure.  To push it back to the Departments again is a serious mistake.  It is a futile exercise and a waste of time, energy and money.  It is a non-starter.  I am not saying this as a reflection on the officials in the Departments.  They do not know how to handle the issue and have zero empathy, knowledge or experience.  My experience of dealing with the various Departments has been that when I found someone who was sympathetic, lo and behold, within six months or 12 months, that person was moved sideways, backwards or somewhere else and the whole process had to start again.  </p> <p>  The initial point must be face-to-face contact with the survivors to find out what their needs are.  They are being disenfranchised and ignored in the current system under Caranua.  In my view, Caranua cannot get rid of the funds it has fast enough in order that it can close down the whole operation down and say, "Thank you very much and goodbye".  That will not happen because as long as there are survivors alive, this issue will come back to haunt them.  Atrocities of this magnitude cannot be dealt with in the manner that Caranua continues to deal with them.  That is my answer to the Senator's question.  </p></speech>

They also indicated the Department fully supported that approach.  The witnesses are the experts in this field but I know it is not their job to figure out how face-to-face consultation should take place.  In light of their experience, how should it take place?  According to the Department, face-to-face consultation will take place and the phone line service will feed into the consultation.  How will the consultation look in terms of driving it forward?</p> <p>  The Department says an independent expert will run the consultation.  Should this be done through the survivor groups?  The face-to-face consultations will have to take place in the UK as well.  Do the witnesses have an idea of how the Department should organise these in order that the committee, in its report, can outline how the consultation should take place?  We can ask for face-to-face consultation but should we propose holding a number of meetings here and in the UK?  Should the Department go ahead and try to organise them, or should it do so on the basis of individual survivor groups given that one group will not cover all survivors?  How do we cater to all the survivors?  How do the witnesses envisage those meetings being carried out?</p></speech>

In the project in which I am involved, I got the survivors around the table and basically asked them what they needed and wanted to improve their lives.  The responses were short and to the point.  The survivors just wanted to have better quality of life, to be respected and to tell their story.  They referred to simple things, such as their desire to return to Ireland to make peace with this land after the atrocities that they had experienced.  They have the facility but the Government needs to put a model in place, although not like the one put in place through the Irish centres throughout Britain whereby the pots of money made available to facilitate and support survivors were never ring-fenced, meaning the money went everywhere except to the people who needed it.  I propose a similar model to that in the UK but the money should be ring-fenced.  Survivors should be spoken to and asked what they want.  We should then try to feed into the committee or forum.</p></speech>

First and foremost, getting funding became the main objective of those that were recognised and funded by the various Departments, and they forgot about their purpose.  Second, there were groups that did not receive funding so, owing to one thing or another, including a lack of support and finances, they faded away.  As far as I am concerned, the survivor groups are failed entities.</p></speech>

That is a good start.  The media could be used and there would be an open forum for every survivor of institutional abuse, irrespective of whether they are in a supporter group.

They could come along to the meetings and hear what the survivors are saying for themselves.  They could then act and help those survivors.</p></speech>

At the board meetings, it is stated amazing thank-you cards were received but one never hears about the criticism and problems.  The meetings are shut down.  If one tries, as I have, to raise issues about people in the UK, one is told one cannot bring issues to the board to do with people in the UK.  I do not know what the figure is about.</p></speech>

I do not believe it is accurate or true.  Most of the survivors I speak to &ndash; we will go back to a rating of 90% - are totally dissatisfied, first and foremost, with the contact they made initially with Caranua, the reception they got, the offhand manner in which they were treated and the bad manners.  If they were shown a little respect and allowed a little dignity, many of the problems could have been sorted.  Perhaps there was a PR problem initially.  The mindset of these people, whom I met and at whose board meetings I have attended, is millions of miles from what a survivor needs or wants.  It is a different world.  If one does not understand something, one does not understand it, even with the best will in the world.  One could be educated and study the subject for ten years but not get it.  These people just do not get it.  They are just light years away.  I would be so happy if survivors said there was a great job done and that it worked and was fantastic.  The opposite is the truth.</p></speech>

I am relatively new to the committee so I am getting up to speed.  I thank my colleague, Senator Ruane in particular, not just for the work she has done on this topic but for her assistance in bringing me up to speed.  I should not be shocked but I still am.  I was struck by the statement: "What happened to us as children was a shame on the nation, but what has been done to us since is a greater shame."  I cannot help but think about how the State used all its machinery &mdash; everything at its disposal &mdash; when the banks were in trouble.  Nothing was too much.  No cost was too much.  The State acted to do everything it could to rescue those in financial power at the same time as it left victims of the most horrendous torture in the State bereft of any support.  What does that say about us as a country and state?  What does it say about successive Governments who failed so many people?</p> <p>  The witnesses will appreciate from my accent that I have a particular interest in the United Kingdom.  Why do they think Caranua did not want to meet survivors?  It is quite a stunning revelation.</p></speech>

I do not know what goes through people's minds but I believe the organisation was afraid of the backlash or response after initially dealing with the survivors over the telephone and the conversations it had.  I believe the turnover of staff in Caranua is enormous.  People are leaving it by the new time; that is a different matter.  I believe Caranua staff were afraid to meet the survivors due to the tongue-lashing they would probably have received if they met them face-to-face.  That is still not a good enough reason not to meet somebody.</p></speech>

There is probably something uncomfortable about us as a group and as a community.  We are seen as "them over there".  There is a view that there is something about the survivors, such as that they are unpredictable or that they might become angry or aggressive or express their pain and suffering.  That is uncomfortable to confront, especially if someone is getting a nice salary for being in that position.  There is also a power dynamic.  Unfortunately, that is the reality.  They did not feel comfortable with us.</p></speech>

Another factor is that these people were not trained.  They just did not have the training or background.  That is not reflection on them, but they were not the right people to deal with survivors.</p></speech>

I will, therefore, ask just a couple of questions.  What are the most important issues right now for survivors based in the UK?</p></speech>

There is no office and there are no people to speak to.  They have been completely abandoned.  They have such major issues in their lives but there is nowhere to go and nobody to contact to find help and support.  They have housing needs, and issues arise over white goods.  I hear of people who need a cooker, for instance.  One woman told me she still has &euro;7,000 in credit in Caranua.  She has a telephone she can answer but she cannot make an outgoing call.</p><p>A phone would change that woman's life.  She has &euro;7,000 in credit yet they would not allow her to buy a phone, which would probably cost &euro;50.</p></speech>

The needs of survivors must be genuinely assessed, not as a group but as individuals.  We are talking about the most vulnerable people who are difficult to reach.  We have to work at just connecting with them and building a relationship of trust and then try to help them.  It is difficult for them.  People worked with me, volunteered and gave their time and they were trusted by the women, but when they left, the women were back to square one.  They were back to isolation and loneliness.  It is so sad what has happened.  It has been said that the women can go into the Irish centres but they cannot.  They have been in them previously and they did not get the support they needed.</p></speech>

I am stunned following the contributions of the two Senators.  There are no words to describe the lack of appropriate communication.  That shows a lack of empathy.  As has been said, the State has failed but, worse still and to our shame, as a State, we continue to fail.  I commend the witnesses who are so brave in their advocacy for the women.</p><p>The Minister published the Caranua eligibility review on 29 May.  The statement said the Department would like to get the views of survivors on how that consultation process should proceed and that to give their views a short survey form could be accessed at .  Was anyone consulted on the proposal to put the survey up on the Department's website?  There is something gravely insulting about the next steps of an issue of that magnitude being reduced to a survey on the Department's website.  Was there any consultation or was it news to the witnesses on the day?</p><p>Regarding the eligibility review, how can Caranua properly assist the interdepartmental committee process considering its imminent closure?  Based on everything the witnesses have told us, Caranua does not have the information because it has not engaged with survivors.  How can it assist?  I just do not understand that because does not make sense to me.</p><p>It states on page 22 of the eligibility review:</p><blockquote>One of the options for the next steps is for Caranua to continue with its current approach in managing the fund within the &euro;15,000 cap, having regard to survivors' needs.  Caranua already seeks to manage the fund as fairly as possible and to respond to the needs of survivors.</blockquote> <p>How does a &euro;15,000 cap have regard to survivors' needs because surely the needs are vary on a person-by-person basis?  Is there not a conflict within that option?  Surely the assistance must be tailored.  There are so many contradictions that it is appalling.</p></speech>

They can neither read nor write and they have not been targeted by Caranua.  They have not been sussed out or informed.  I know people personally in this country.  I have flagged them to Caranua many times and asked officials to visit them or get them to sign up the forms but to this day they have not had one ounce of help from Caranua.  That is how successful that groups is.</p></speech>

It is not easy for the witnesses to highlight these issues.  The common thread from the responses is that there is a lack of appropriate expertise in the engagement.  Is that fair?  In addition there is a difficulty with how Caranua has reached out to people in the UK and further afield.  Is it fair to say there has been communication to say that supports are available but there is a lack of expertise when contact is made?  Is it correct that in terms of the one-to-one engagement over the phone there has not been proper expertise in dealing with the individual cases?  Is it the case that people have not had the right training?</p></speech>

It was probably a good idea to set up Caranua initially.  More than 250 people representing survivor groups met at the Department of Education and Skills.  The majority of them were not in favour of Caranua.  Most of them were in favour of either giving the survivors a lump sum or if it was felt that was too dangerous and that they would not know how to handle such an amount, it was advocated that it should be paid in a pension and perhaps twice a year to the survivors.  I thought that was a very good idea.  That would probably have a much better option at that time.</p> <p>  However, the Department at the time decided that Caranua would be the vehicle to help those people.  Perhaps nobody was looking at Caranua.  It became self-governing.  It structured the group for its own benefit and not for the benefit of survivors.  The problems started to pile up early on and they were compounded as time went on.  They worsened until we arrived at the situation we have today where survivors are scraping around for the crumbs of &euro;15,000.  That was never part of the policy initially when the documents were signed off in the D&aacute;il.  The policy was open ended.  It was said to me many times that some people might be more greedy and that they would be looking for more money and others would look for less.  That was a problem that should have been sorted out by the people in Caranua and the Department.  That was never done.</p> <p>  When Caranua decided the fund was being depleted quickly, a ceiling of &euro;15,000 was put on payments, with the result that people who had looked for white goods, necessary stuff, as Dr. Lodato alluded to, they were told they had exceeded the &euro;15,000 limit and they were not entitled to them.  The same happened with people who were looking for burial funds.  At an early stage, it was flagged up that many of the survivors did not have insurance, they had no people belonging to them and when they died, they would have nowhere to go.  They did not have any burial insurance.  The Minister indicated that he would facilitate such payments.  However, those who had exceeded the &euro;15,000 limit were excluded from the payment.  There is no inclusion.  The mistakes were compounded.  It was one mistake after the other and then Caranua tried to cover up its mistakes or bad management.</p><p>It was not survivor-friendly from day one.  The mistakes were compounded and hidden away.  The situation became intolerable.  Now there is the position where there are survivors scratching around for &euro;15,000.  It was said at one of the meetings that I attended that it might be reduced down to &euro;10,000 or even &euro;5,000.</p></speech>

When they come back to Ireland, having lived abroad, they want to be respected, heard and valued.  That would say to me that expertise would be needed to deal with them on a one-to-one, face-to-face level.  That is another part.  I am not taking from what Mr. Cronin has said but it is multi-faceted.</p></speech>

We have also met others who have been in them, and reconnected to this land, even with this pain.  People did not leave through choice; they had to get out of here because they had such a brutal experience this country.  There is a longing in their old age to come home, even for a brief visit, but there is nowhere for them to come to.  People here get a free bus pass when they reach 66 years of age and they can travel all over the country.  Could that not be facilitated to help them in some way to return here, even if it is for one visit?  Will they have somewhere to stay?  That is the other issue.  They have no connections.  Families are completely broken.</p> <p>  They want to tell their stories as well.  They feel very upset by the indemnity clause in the redress scheme and that their records have been hidden away for 75 years.  That is a real bone of contention with many survivors.  They want to be able to tell their story.  How do we do that?  We cannot keep hiding this.  We have to confront the pain, the suffering and the atrocities that happened.  Until we do that, we will never move forward.</p></speech>

I find the entire presentation very depressing and heartbreaking.  For what it is worth, I offer my deepest sympathy to the witnesses and all survivors.  Some of my colleagues have touched on some of the subject matter that I was going to talk about.  As I listened to the contributions, I was reminded in many ways of our leaders in these Houses, and how the media give great praise when our politicians and leaders stand up and apologise, and rightly so, for past wrongs.  The media cover that and give it a great platform, which is only right.  Sometimes, however, the words are not backed up by actions, and this is another example of that.  We are very quick to clap ourselves on the back when it comes to social changes and we have had a welcome number of them in recent times in our country.  We can stand up in these Houses and tell the world how we are the leading lights when it comes to these issues.</p> <p>  On the other hand, there is evidence to the contrary, which we listened to this morning and which was laid out in great detail.  The witnesses are at a crossroads.  Mr. Cronin said that he has been on this road for more than 20 years.  It has come to a point where the State is either serious about tackling and addressing this issue, and undoing this wrong, or it is not.  The evidence to date, unfortunately, would indicate that so far, and I hope this changes, the intent has not been there, or to my eyes anyway.  If we are serious about getting to the bottom of it and addressing it, somebody needs to lead on this.  The most important people we have to listen to are the survivors.  Unless we are serious about that, we may park this process and stop fooling people that we are serious about trying to address it.  That is the first thing. Somebody needs to lead this process and somebody needs to have the intent to address the issue once and for all, and put whatever measures are practical and reasonable and which satisfy the survivors in that process.</p> <p>  The first thing that must be done is to lance this boil, to get that hurt out.  As far as I am concerned, the survivors are the stakeholders in this process.  Unless it addresses what they are hoping to achieve, this train will never leave the station.  We have been parked at the station for a long time now.</p> <p>  Do we have any idea how many survivors we are talking about here?  Do we have any idea where they are all located, in different parts of the world?  Deputy Catherine Martin made the point earlier that for those who were unfortunate enough to go abroad and live their lives as best they could, despite all the hurt that was caused to them in their country of birth, I am sure there is part of them that would like to come back and put that to rest before the man above calls them off the field of play.  We need to reach out to those people.  I want to know roughly how many people we are talking about.  For this process to be done properly, what kind of timeframe would we need to allocate in order to do this properly?  If the Minister for Education and Skills or the Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, was sitting in this room this morning, what would the witnesses say to him?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-21a.503" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Cronin" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018062100002#G00500"><p>The number of survivors who went through the redress board would have been in the region of 15,000 worldwide, give or take a few hundred.  In the intervening years, approximately 50% or maybe more have died.  The figures we get from Caranua are that between 5,000 and 6,000 survivors have applied for help.  One could think this is the number of survivors who are now left.  In my estimation, there are certainly fewer than 10,000 survivors worldwide, and that is being quite conservative.</p></speech>

It is an ever-diminishing group of people.  Believe me, there are a lot of people who could not face the redress process.  It was far too traumatic.  The damage of going through that process was enormous.  That was an abusive system all over again.  The timeframe we are talking about here is probably ten years, because most of us are in our 60s or 70s.  There are probably a few in their 50s, but there are not many.  The majority are in their 60s and 70s.  There are probably a few in their 80s.  I would say ten years.</p> <p>  If the Taoiseach was in this room today, I would say Ireland needs to face up to its past.  It needs to treat these people with the respect and dignity which they deserve, because there is a horrendous past connected to this country.  It will never move on until we face it.</p></speech>

Obviously it is to be as soon as possible.  Time is going on.  As Dr. Lodato has said, the life expectancy of most of the survivors is ten years.  Sometimes, when I am becoming very negative, I think that this might be the agenda here and that they will all be dead, forgotten about; goodnight, goodbye and all the rest.  If that is the case we should know about it.  If that is the mindset then let us know about it and have it on the table.  Say "This is what we would prefer to happen".  At least we could then go away and have the truth and we would have something.  At this point in time we have a situation of being given a little bit here and another bit being taken away.  We are told "You can do this but you cannot do that."  The survivors are all over 60 years of age and they are being treated like children.   They are told what is best for them and when to have or not have something.  I spoke earlier about fridges and so on.  They are being denied basic stuff.  This is wrong.  In any society it is definitely wrong.  Reference was made to An Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar and if he was here at this meeting today I would ask him to just come on and get some real work done here.  We are not speaking about the past, we are talking about the present.  More important, we are speaking about the future and about children who are not yet born in the State.  If we do not deal with the past we certainly will not deal with the future.</p></speech>

It is also about their families, their children and their grandchildren.  There is a whole line connected with the issue.   It needs to be acknowledged and recorded so it never happens again.  It should be put into schools.  Ireland has to face up to this.</p></speech>

There are no figures collated for survivors who are in the UK.  I may have been informed of this already because the figures are in an official report somewhere, but can the witnesses confirm if those numbers are based on the institutions that were in those provinces? I may be landing this question onto the witnesses, but perhaps someone knows where the numbers came from with regard to Caranua survivors.</p></speech>

A lot of what the Senator has said is correct; 48% or 45% were in the UK but it is very hard to put figures on it.  As I have said, the age group is a big factor here because most of the survivors are well into their 60s and quite a number of those who were around last year are not around this year.  This will continue and hasten as they age.</p></speech>

One was the idea of giving a payment in the form of a pension.  It is a simple idea that would ensure benefits actually reached the people concerned.  The second idea would be to look at a free travel pass for those survivors in the UK who come back to Ireland.  It strikes me that these suggestions are eminently sensible and probably completely out of bounds.  The one thing I see running through the Department's response in all of this is to ensure there remains a culture of dependency.  God forbid that we would ever empower these people.  Deputy Catherine Martin made a good point about the most recent suggestions, which tells us that they are still not listening.  I have no doubt that I and everyone around this table will do our best through our report to make it clear that they have to listen.  Perhaps the witnesses could explain why they think the State, including the people who run the Government and the people who run the Department of Education and Skills, are so determined to make sure they will not empower the victims of the State.</p></speech>

Lo and behold if one becomes empowered one has a voice and then can challenge these people.  While people are kept in a state of dependency and living in this State then they cannot challenge because they do not have power.  It is a power dynamic.</p></speech>

There has been a change with the US President's executive order last night, but we should still communicate with the embassy outlining our concern that this happened and for the children who are still in detention.  With approval of the committee, we will contact the charg&eacute; d'affaires today outlining our concern about what happened and expressing our concern about what is proposed regarding the children who are still being held in detention and the fact that the holding of these children in detention is totally unacceptable to us and should be to any civilised society.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>We referred earlier to the request from Crossscare for a meeting with the committee and asking the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, to meet us with regard to the Indecon report and returning emigrants.  One issue of concern to all of us - it is an issue on which we receive representations from constituents - is the position of the undocumented Irish in the United States.  At a time like this, when immigration is in the media and getting a lot of attention, quite understandably, we still have worries about the position of our own undocumented Irish.  The Government, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the officials in the embassy and the consulates throughout the United States are working to try to achieve progress in respect of immigration reform.</p><p>I seek the approval of the committee to write to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade urging him again to ensure that every effort continues to be made to assist the undocumented Irish and asking for a report on the up-to-date position on negotiations with the US Administration outlining whether immigration reform is likely to occur in the near future.

I have submitted an opening statement which is on the detailed side.  As such, there would not be great value for the members if I went over it again.  I propose, therefore, to read a more simplified version.</p> <p>  Our report set out to determine whether the Government was justified in claiming that Irish tax policy does not and cannot undermine the tax take of developing countries.  The spillover analysis of 2014 concluded that the size of economic and financial linkages between Ireland and developing countries was so small as to make any fiscal impact of the Irish tax regime insignificant.  This conclusion was reached in substance on the basis of a sample study of years and countries of trade, portfolio investments and foreign direct investment flows from Ireland to developing countries.  Our research shows that the years and countries chosen by the researchers were unrepresentative of investment from Ireland into developing countries in the period 2009 to 2015.  The researchers took the years 2009 and 2012 as their sample years.  While these did, indeed, show low levels of foreign direct investment from Ireland to developing countries, our research shows that 2009 and 2012 were anomalous and that 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2014 showed higher levels of foreign direct investment to developing countries.  In addition, the countries chosen for the analysis also proved to be untypical of the flows of foreign direct investment to developing countries.  In other words, other countries were more significant recipients of foreign direct or portfolio investment than those focused on by the researchers.</p> <p>  The research also ignored the fact that even small amounts of foreign direct investment into developing countries might represent a relatively large amount for developing countries, especially compared to GDP or the overall tax take of an individual country.  The Irish spillover analysis failed to make specific estimates of investment returns to Ireland from individual developing countries or the tax treatment of those returns.  In other words, in contrast to the spillover analysis conducted by countries like the Netherlands, the Government's analysis made no attempt to estimate the size of potential tax impacts at all.  We have tried to show some simple methods by which such estimates could be made.</p> <p>  Overall, our research estimates that between &euro;500 million and &euro;1.6 billion is being returned to Ireland from developing countries.  This is the return on foreign direct and portfolio investments into developing countries.  While the sums are not huge in the global scheme of things, the tax treatment of that money cannot be dismissed as insignificant.  It is approximately two to four times the size of Irish overseas aid.  According to these simple estimates, South Africa may have lost out on withholding tax over three times the amount of Irish aid it received.  In Zambia in the three years before the revision of the tax treaty between that country and Ireland, withholding tax foregone and interest on dividends may have been the equivalent of between 20% and 40% of Irish development aid to Zambia.</p> <p>  Our numbers in this regard are undeniably ballpark figures as they are based on a simple ratio analysis.  That is to say we know how much foreign direct or portfolio investment goes to developing countries from Ireland and we know what percentage that represents of Ireland's overall outgoing foreign direct and portfolio investment.  The Government publishes consolidated global figures only rather than figures broken down by region, never mind country, of the rate of returns from that foreign direct or portfolio investment to Ireland.  We can make an estimate by applying the same ratio of Irish foreign direct investment as a percentage of global FDI to the overall global figure being returned.  Assuming developing countries retain approximately 15% of those returns as withholding taxes, we can estimate roughly how much comes back to Ireland post tax.  For individual developing countries, we can be more specific on tax rates and the size of investments.  It is not exact but it provides initial figures for analysts to work with.  It is a contribution as an alternative methodology which the researchers might have adopted and might want to revisit.  It is also the case that the Government is likely to have unpublished data on returns from overseas investments from different regions or countries and on other financial flows which would provide a more accurate picture still.</p> <p>  There is a second set of problems with the Government's spillover analysis.  It claims that certain aspects of Irish tax law, in particular after reforms in 2013 and 2014, make various tax avoidance structures impossible.  However, our research shows that two years after that reform such structures are not only possible, they are already in operation by some multinationals, including those with significant revenues from developing countries.  For example, a scheme dismissed by the Government's researchers as impossible is a structure which allowed the double Irish tax avoidance scheme to exist.  Our research shows that as early as 2014 tax advisors were already offering alternative structures to the double Irish which were very similar in nature.  Instead of Cayman or Bermuda, they used Malta, which provided exactly the same outcome with negative impacts on the revenue take of developing countries.</p> <p>  Why does any of this matter?  We consider these things important for the reasons set out in the written presentation I submitted to the committee beforehand but it is worth going over them here.  Clearly, there is an ethical dimension to all of this.  We cannot in good conscience, however inadvertently, undermine the tax take of some of the poorest countries in the world.  Irish corporation tax policy has served Irish people well, but that cannot be at the expense of others.  The Government is committed to ensuring there is policy coherence across Government in support of development.  This commitment is reflected in various policy positions of the Department of Finance and Irish Aid.  Indeed, policy coherence for development is codified in the Lisbon treaty.  As such, we have a legal and moral obligation to ensure the policies of one Department do not undermine Irish Aid's objectives.  Irish citizens and taxpayers have a legitimate expectation that their contribution to Irish Aid is put to the best and most effective use and not undermined by the policies of another Department.</p> <p>  The sustainable development goals negotiated so effectively under Ireland's joint stewardship require unprecedented levels of policy coherence in order to be achieved.  Having played such an important role in bringing the goals into existence, Ireland's performance in achieving them will be keenly observed.</p><p>Moreover, achieving greater coherence across often competing objectives - not limited to taxation, but also climate concerns and peace-building - will be an important indicator of Ireland&rsquo;s progress to achieving the strategic development goals, SDGs. </p><p> Ireland has established itself as a leader in the area of spillover work.  The Department of Finance was under no obligation to conduct this research and deserves credit for taking it on.  The Netherlands is the only other country in the world to have carried out a spillover analysis and its particular history of colonialism and ties to its former colonies made its spillover analysis qualitatively different to that carried out by the researchers for the Department of Finance.  Ireland therefore has established itself as something of a world leader in this area, which is why it is so important that we get it right.  Other countries are already looking to Ireland as an example.  </p><p> Reputational damage is also an issue.  We are all aware that a month rarely goes by in which our corporation tax policy is not subject to international criticism.  Whatever the merits of these criticisms, they are unquestionably damaging to our reputation.  Conducting a spillover analysis and, more importantly, addressing the gaps we identify in our report to make it the best in class is a really important way of showing that Ireland is not a maverick operator in matters of tax, as characterised by some, and takes its international commitments very seriously. </p><p> Ireland must have an overarching vision of what it wishes to do with its tax system.  It should be based on human rights and should recognise the obligations Ireland has, not just to itself, its people, the constituents of Members of these Houses and their jobs, but also to the lives of people around the world who are dependent on the natural resources of their own countries.</p></speech>

Irish Aid has a very strong and positive reputation because it is poverty focused and is untied.  The report published by this committee reviewing Irish Aid recognised that.  Within that report there was a strong recommendation on the area of policy coherence.  I totally accept what Mr. McCaughey has said on that matter.  It was said that the Department of Finance did not have to do this.  How did it get it so wrong?  How were the selected countries chosen?</p> <p>  We know about the changes that have occurred in Zambia.  What brought about those changes?  Where did the impetus for that come from?  Are the witnesses seeing similar examples emerging from other African countries?  At the conference I attended it was great to hear of the work going on within African countries - led by Kenya - in terms of assessing tax issues within the continent and the need to help one another.  There is a need to build capacity for budget and finance committees in African countries in order that they can lead on the tax income revenue on which they are missing out.  Is Christian Aid involved in anything like that?</p> <p>  On foreign direct investment, I have been pushing for sight of the human rights in business report.  It has finally been released and I note Ms Jennifer Higgins was at the conference in Galway.  While it was good, I was slightly disappointed that it did not go far enough and that we were not seeing any impetus to implement the recommendations it contained.  Ireland is looking for new trading partners because of Brexit and so on.  We have a great reputation when it comes to aid and foreign countries, particularly African countries, want to trade with us because they believe we will be ethical.  However, I believe that we need to generate much greater awareness among businesses of that report in order that they will take on the recommendations it contains.  </p> <p>  It is amazing that tax did not feature more prominently within the SDGs.  The taxes, if we get them, will pay for those goals.  </p></speech>

How did the Department react to the expert analysis offered by the witnesses and what dialogue has it had with the witnesses since?  What did the Department have to say about the main criticisms in the report produced by the witnesses?  Is their report gaining any traction?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-21a.543" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Sheila Killian" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2018062100002#C00600"><p>I agree that Irish Aid has a terrifically strong reputation, based on policy coherence, and it is very important.  On the question about how the Department of Finance got it so wrong and how it has responded to criticisms, it must be said that this was a pioneering piece of work at the time, and we can look back at it and see methodological flaws.  Like any other piece of analysis, academic or otherwise, we can see that it was done in one way but that it might have been much better if it was done differently.  The methodology in spillover analysis generally, for countries and corporations, has moved on since this spillover analysis was done.</p> <p>  Perhaps rather than asking how the Department got it so wrong it would be better to point out the obvious things that could have been done to improve the methodology used. For example, as Mr. McCaughey said, it should not rely solely on publically available information when other information is available.  It should not just rely on direct flows because many such flows go indirectly through other countries.  It should pay as much attention to gaps as it does to flows.  If one looked at the spillover of Ireland's policy on the rest of Europe, it could be said that we compete aggressively for foreign direct investment, which probably has a dampening effect on investment in France and Germany.  That is a policy decision on the part of the Government and it is made consciously.  It leads to slight negative spillover to European neighbours but that is a decision we have made.  If we do a spillover analysis that does not capture that element, we risk having spillovers that are not decided upon but which are inadvertent and which are causing incoherence with Irish Aid.  This is why work on spillover analysis coming from City, University of London, now looks at the political economy element, as well as the flows.  As an accounting and finance professor I am allowed to criticise things that only focus on the accounting and finance and I believe it is important that something like this includes political economy and a social element.  </p> <p>  Capacity building was mentioned.  It is worth noting that the Revenue has done quite a bit of good work in that area.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-21a.544" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sorley McCaughey" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2018062100002#C00700"><p>On the capacity issue, Ireland and Irish Aid are commendably very focused on building capacity but could be criticised slightly for the kind of capacity building being done.  It is capacity building within a particular paradigm that has perhaps developed without much input from developing countries.  The capacity is being developed in order to implement solutions that are not particular to their needs.  We would like to see greater policy space for developing countries to develop individual policy responses to the unique set of challenges each country faces in keeping revenue within that country.  That kind of capacity building is at least as valuable, if not more valuable, to developing countries than building the capacity to implement the base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process, which those countries played very little part in developing.</p> <p>  In fairness to the revenue authority, the issue concerning Zambia was highlighted in response to a report published by Action Aid, which showed that a subsidiary company in the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC, was being used by a large multinational based in Zambia to shift profit out of Zambia into Ireland and on to further countries - tax havens - at a cost of approximately &euro;8 million a year to the Zambian authority.  The company based in the IFSC had no employees; it was a total swizz.  Revenue here had not been aware of it but when it found out, it moved to renegotiate it with the Zambian authority.</p><p>This is an example of very effective advocacy on the part of a poorly resourced NGO.  There is a question as to how Revenue did not know about that if a poorly resourced NGO could identify and bring it to light.  That is not a great scenario.  Similarly with our report, we highlighted the existence of the single malt structure, which got some profile.  I am not sure if it is an entirely great situation whereby four days of poorly-paid researcher's time manages to identify that and we, as a State, are not identifying.  There are some concerns in that regard.  Dr. Killian will refer to the sustainable development goals, SDGs, and tax.</p></speech>

Domestic revenue mobilisation is much more sustainable than aid.  It has just been diverted into goal 17, which concerns partnerships for the goals, and the goal relating to sustainable cities.  It is a pity that given there was a global tide for it that there was not more of a trend for it at the time.</p></speech>

Christian Aid has been working as part of Coalition 2030 and, as a result, we have been inputting into the shadow report for that and we have been trying to put a strong focus on tax specifically in goals 16 and 17.</p></speech>

The only real reference, apart from domestic resource mobilisation as being important as an element to finance development, and the only other element we are really focusing on is the definition around what constitutes an illicit financial flow.  At present, it really only applies to clearly illegal practice like money laundering and tax evasion.  It ignores the very large grey area, but the potentially very damaging area of tax avoidance, which is a very murky area where it is only legal until it is proven that it is illegal.  That is an area where we would like to see the definition expanded so that it can include some of these tax avoidance schemes which have such a negative impact on developing countries.  That is an ongoing battle and it is one on which Christian Aid is very much to the fore to expand that definition.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy Niall Collins, the relationship between Christian Aid and the Department of Finance is very good, and it has been since 2007.  This report was always meant as a constructive policy input into its work in the area.  The Department was under no obligation to do it.  It responded to civil society and it also responded to a changing international tax environment whereby Ireland was in the spotlight a lot.  It probably saw, sensibly, that this was something it could do.</p> <p>  It would be good to get the Department in here to respond because I do not feel well placed to speak on its behalf.  Its position is largely that this was our attempt at doing something that had barely been done before.  We acknowledge that methodologically there could well be gaps, so it might have been done differently.  The Department states that this was the methodology of the International Bureau of Fiscal Documentation, IBFD, which is a very well respected international body in the Netherlands.  There is an issue in terms of the ownership of this research.  For us, the Department of Finance owns it.  The Department managed the process and signed off on the methodology but sometimes when speaking to the Department, I am told the IBFD did this, it carried it out and that I should ask address my questions to it.  We have asked the IBFD about the gaps we identified but we have not really got responses.</p></speech>

That is the first base of defence when the country comes under attack for being a tax haven.  The Government or the Department of Finance will always point to the BEPS project.</p></speech>

BEPS is developed by the OECD and the G20, which involve a relatively small subset of the countries in the world.  It gave developing countries and the UN observer status.  It is very common for there to be criticisms on why it is not particularly democratic in its involvement and then perhaps not fit for the variable geometry that is needed for developing countries.  It is quite rigid.</p> <p>  On the second comment that was made, namely, that this is where Ireland finds a defence against accusations or allegations made about our tax system.  That is a very important point because we have leaned on BEPS and our participation in it in order to say that we are best in class.  By doing an updated and better spillover analysis, there is an opportunity to really be best in class.  There are opportunities here.  This presents a massive opportunity for the Government - spanning the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Finance - to produce a really solid spillover analysis that takes in all of those elements, including political economy, and that allows an economic, social and human rights analysis of the impact of double tax treaties that we sign.  There is a chance to do that and it would strengthen our case under the SDGs.  It would also mean that we would be less vulnerable to the accusation of simply hiding behind BEPS.  Reputationally, this is quite a critical juncture for Ireland because the US, in its relations with the world in general, is perhaps less predictable than it has been in past.  We are very heavily dependent on US foreign direct investment so it is a very good time for us to be putting a second string to our bow and underpinning our position as best in class.</p></speech>

The spillover analysis was never meant to be a once-off.  That was never how it was conceived or expected to play out.  When the spillover first came on the scene, it was always supposed to be a question of having a baseline spillover and then follow-up spillovers for when there were any significant changes to the country's tax system.  Ireland has done a really solid job of putting a spillover analysis in place but it will not really be of the value that it could be without a follow-up and without saying we have done a solid job.  Let us bring it to the next level in the way Dr. Killian outlined.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-21a.553" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1309" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2018062100002#D00900"><p>The witnesses are all very welcome.  I thank them for their campaigning work on tax justice and for all the research they have done in this area.  They are playing a hugely significant role.  We all collectively use their figures and a lot of their research.</p> <p>  In the past week, academics at the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Copenhagen released a report entitled The Missing Profits of Nations.  It estimates that foreign multinationals shifted &euro;90 billion corporate profits to Ireland in 2015.  I do not know if the witnesses are aware of the research.  It suggests that the amount involved was more than that for all the islands of the Caribbean combined and well ahead of Singapore, Switzerland and the Netherlands.  The report measures the extent of profit shifting to avoid paying tax by multinationals around the world and finds that for every $1 spent on wages in this State, $8 of profit is declared here, which is approximately 16 times the average of other jurisdictions where profits are not routinely shifted.  That gives a sense of what was going on in 2015.  Did the witnesses see the research and what is their opinion of it?</p> <p>  It is also interesting that in 2015 - the year on which the research focused - the Fine Gael-Labour Government introduced a capital allowance deduction of up to 100% on intellectual property, which was clearly designed as a mechanism to replace the criticism of what was going on in relation to the double Irish scheme which was being used by the tech giants to pay obscenely low rates of tax.  We have heard about the fallout from that and the impact it has had on reputation.</p> <p>  The Government recently launched its Global Ireland 2025 campaign, which, again, is supposedly designed to improve our global footprint.  Do the witnesses agree that we can never be seen as a global leader on issues of world importance, or even as responsible global citizens, until we bring about real change in this area that would bring our so-called tax dodging schemes to an end?</p><p> When the committee was preparing its report for Irish Aid, I spoke on policy coherence for development.  I see it as a contradiction that one arm of the State is doing positive work internationally while the other arm is undermining that work.  That is happening.  I presume the witnesses would agree there is a growing realisation of Ireland's tax system and that some companies are using Ireland as a tax haven, which is undermining our status.</p><p> Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan touched on the issue of capacity building, budgets and the supports we give developing countries and other countries in that regard.  A difficulty I have as a spokesperson on foreign affairs is that Irish Aid come in here every year and we get a breakdown of where it spends money and so on but it is basically a graph.  We do not get any detail on that.  We give developing countries, particularly the opposition parties, support in terms of capacity building so that they can scrutinise budgets and so on, but we do not do that here.  I do not believe this committee has that capacity to scrutinise.  The Department said it will look at that.  I realise it is one of those questions that is a bit skewed but I believe it is central to what we are trying to do.  If we expect other countries to try to follow a particular model, we should be doing the same here if we are serious about scrutinising every euro spent in terms of Irish Aid.  We are all great supporters of the work being carried on, so it would add to the work of the committee and to the transparency of the work Irish Aid is doing if we had that because there are concerns about where some of the money is being spent, not necessarily the bilateral funding but the multilateral and basket funding, and whether it goes to the right areas.  I would be interested to hear the witnesses' comments on that.</p></speech>

It is especially instructive to hear the interaction between non-governmental organisations, NGOs, that are represented by the witnesses and Action Aid and the Department and Revenue in terms of unearthing particular practices.  As Mr. McCaughey said, it is alarming that NGOs uncovered these anomalies, particularly the issue with Zambia.  However, it is good to hear Revenue took action on them once they were unearthed.</p> <p>  My question relates to some of the witnesses' conclusions in terms of the idea of a follow-up spillover analysis and that this should not have been intended as a one-off.  When I look at the response from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which it must be said we got very late this morning, and it was a Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade response rather than a Department of Finance response, it strikes me that some of its comments on the witnesses' critique relate to time lag and that, effectively, whatever criticisms they made of the spillover analysis have been rectified because, for example, Zambia and Pakistan treaties have been renegotiated and there have been changes.  In the time since both the report and the witnesses' critique of the report, the Government has signed the Addis Tax Initiative and Seamus Coffey's review of the corporate tax code has been published.</p> <p>  How can we address the problem that it is very difficult to find out exactly the issues with the spillover analysis when inevitably there will be a time lag in terms of the policies investigated, the publication of the report and then the critique?  For example, should we have a rolling spillover analysis?  Should there be a unit within the Department of Finance, presumably with links to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Revenue, to ensure there is an ongoing review of our tax policies?  We all acknowledge those are changing all the time and that significant attempts have been made to address the very serious critiques of the likes of the double Irish and so on, but it very difficult for us as legislators to see the state of play currently.  What are the criticisms that are currently valid and what changes can be made to address those critiques?  I am sorry for the somewhat rambling question but it is about how we can best ensure that critiques will have an effect, that we can ensure changes that will have an impact and that we are not coming to this very late after changes have been made that have addressed the critiques the witnesses have made.</p> <p>  Did NGOs have an input into the Coffey review of the corporate tax code?  Are they happy with some of the recommendations that were made?  Do they believe the Addis initiative sign-up in 2017 will change anything?  Should that see improvements in our structures?  What do the witnesses think of the idea of some facility for ongoing spillover analysis to be carried out on that cross-institutional basis so that it is not just a matter for the Department of Finance, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Revenue?</p></speech>

Related to the Senator's idea of having an ongoing spillover analysis is having an impact assessment of all our new tax treaties and our annual budgets that would not simply be an economic impact but an economic, social and human rights impact.  If all our tax rules that came in were subject to such legislation, that would have a very strong effect on an ongoing basis and would be very good reputationally for Ireland.  It would be nice to move beyond being constantly defensive every time a new report comes out from Copenhagen, California or wherever and to be able to say that we have genuinely made changes here in the way we are approaching this system and we are genuinely and actively trying to discourage aggressive practices and encourage real investment in the country that will create jobs and prosperity.</p> <p>  It requires very strong signalling as well as strong regulatory measures.  The Copenhagen report focused on an innovative aspect, namely, the ratio of wages to profit.  It was an interesting measure and it highlighted things that look odd.  All of these reports set out to measure the invisible.  They are trying to measure the amount of tax that is not being declared.  If I put in place a piece of academic research to measure the invisible and I say it is &euro;90 billion, it is not difficult to say it is not &euro;90 billion and that it is more like &euro;20 billion because what we are measuring is invisible.</p> <p>  We need to get to a point where we do not have to be defensive about those reports rather than having constantly to critique their methodology.  That was an innovative idea.  It will not provide a very accurate measure but it does highlight disparities.  To do that we need to get away from filling in all the little holes and turning off these illicit flows into Ireland.  That demands both regular spillover analysis and updating the methodology because the methodology used previously is now outdated.  If it is to be done again, it should be done with a new methodology.  It also demands having true impact assessments for all our fiscal measures that are introduced.  This is something that will be required.  It may not be required for five or ten years but we can future-proof our policies and get a certain amount of reputational first mover advantage by doing it now rather than waiting until we are told to do it and then saying we are being obedient to the base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process.  As Mr. McCaughey said, we can establish a reputation here and that would change the signalling and reduce the kind of harmful investment that comes through Ireland.  That would have a positive effect on the developing world.</p></speech>

These are things that existed before the spillover analysis and that exist now.  For example, the manner in which we treat royalty payments that flow out of Ireland has not changed at all, before or after the analysis.  We barely apply withholding tax to royalty payments that leave this country.  There are very few instances in which we apply withholding tax to them.  It makes Ireland very attractive as a conduit country in that case.  We know this is an integral part of the ongoing double Irish and single malt structures.  That is one example.  Another example is that the treaties Ireland has signed since the spillover analysis was published are still classified as regressive from the point of view of developing countries.  It seems slightly strange to claim that the issues we have identified have been addressed when they are classed as being regressive from the perspective of developing countries.</p><p> They are just two issues from the top of my head, but there are many others.  The fundamentals of Irish corporation tax policy have not altered, before or after the spillover analysis.  Perhaps some of the recommendations of the Coffey report will be implemented.  That would address some of the things we raise, particularly regarding our transfer pricing regulation legislation.  That was identified in the Coffey report as weak and not up BEPS standard.  It allows for some pretty creative shifting of money between multinationals.  If that was brought up to OECD BEPS standard, we would have a better chance of getting a more accurate evaluation of intellectual property as it is being transferred.</p><p> Dr. Killian has spoken about a rolling spillover analysis.  That is a fantastic idea.  It is important.  That is how the spillover analysis was always envisaged as working.  There is another thing I would say which is not in any way a criticism but an argument for carrying out a subsequent spillover analysis.  Since the last year that the researchers looked at, which was 2012, there has been a significant spike in trade between Ireland and some developing countries, in particular Ghana, with which we signed a double tax agreement, Cabo Verde and Nepal.  There are significant levels of trade between Ireland and those countries.  That was not known to the researchers at the time.  Now it is, so one would like to think that this would prompt them to go back and review those trade flows to see if they come up with anything interesting.</p><p> Deputy Crowe raised the Global Ireland initiative and reputation.  He is correct.  That is something we spoke to in our presentation.  I am not privy to the inner workings or thinking of the Department of Finance or the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, but I suspect it is very much on their minds reputationally at a time when Ireland needs friends in Europe and internationally in a way it has rarely done previously.  The constant and ongoing criticism of Irish tax policy, merited or not, is damaging to the country as it moves to develop strategic alliances with other countries.  I would not like to think that it will come back to bite us, but any measure we can adopt to mitigate the negative reputational damage that our tax code is creating would be a very sensible idea.  It goes beyond the spillover analysis to a key and obvious thing we could do to demonstrate our credentials internationally.  There are also issues around transparency that the Department of Finance resists.  The public accessibility of country-by-country reports of companies is something we have advocated for almost ten years.  These country-by-country reports should be publicly available so the media, civil society and researchers can know what companies are doing in each of the jurisdictions in which they operate.  The Department of Finance does not wish to make that publicly available.  That runs contrary to any kind of good sense.  This is an opportunity to say that we want to be the gold standard of transparency when it comes to the disclosure of tax operations by companies.</p><p> There are other issues around transparency that we have advocated and lobbied on for years and that the Department of Finance has been slow to adopt.  Again, it would be sensible to adopt them when it is constantly in the firing line for its tax policy.</p></speech>

What is the level of engagement with Irish Aid on this issue?  Returning to business and human rights, is there no scope in that report for the tax issue or is that just going to be more wallpaper?</p></speech>

The business and human rights national action plan was released last year after a very long process.  There was much critique by civil society and others regarding the policy objectives set out in it, to the effect that it was not ambitious enough or highlighting some of the more pertinent issues around business and human rights emerging globally.  It is definitely not strong enough on specific policy and actions.  We are not seeing a link between tax and human rights.  We are working towards developing a tax and human rights policy position ourselves that it is hoped will bring together these two specific areas.  Unfortunately, they have not been merged much and we have not seen them in the business and human rights model.  In addition, there is a type of confusion between corporate social responsibility and business and human rights.  As the Deputy said, we must highlight the business and human rights model more with businesses, but sometimes we see a confusion with corporate social responsibility as being enough.</p> <p>  It is important to highlight that action plan.  When submissions were requested for the drafting of the business and human rights action plan, we made a submission and we would have highlighted tax as part of that.  Obviously, we were disappointed not to have seen it.  The drafting was housed in the same Department as Irish Aid, and Irish Aid has recognised the importance of tax for developing countries gaining enough revenue to develop their own services for the fulfilment of human rights.  It is unfortunate we have not seen that reflected in other plans within the same Department.  It goes back to policy coherence, as we mentioned.  There will be a further drawing out of human rights and tax in the future.  The Center for Economic and Social Rights, CESR, under the Switzerland review under the Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, criticised Switzerland because its tax policies do not allow developing countries to provide full services for women.  It found that its tax practices contravened its obligations under the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, CEDAW.  This is something we hope to draw out further in the future, to look at how our human rights obligations interact with our tax practices.</p></speech>

Our tax policy is essentially a foreign affairs issue so it should not be regarded as something that is only for the Department of Finance.  As our tax policy has such an impact internationally and because it is based so much on international flows, it should rightly be part of this committee's remit as much as it is that of the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  That is even separate from the incoherence with Irish Aid.  There should be more joint input.</p></speech>

He was very clear on the relationship between tax and human rights.</p><p>He was very critical of Ireland and referenced our obligations under various international human rights conventions to which we are a signatory and under which we are failing.  There are additional territorial obligations on Ireland to ensure that we do not compromise the revenue of other countries but we are not honouring those obligations at the moment.  </p></speech>

The politics of the situation are that the Department of Finance calls the shots on this issue.  The committee should use its not inconsiderable weight to advocate for a follow-up spillover analysis, Dr. Killian, Ms Higgins and I have called for.  We need a broader spillover analysis that has a methodology that goes beyond the rather limited scope of the original analysis.  The committee should ask the Department of Finance to come before it and speak to the findings of this report in a constructive manner.  That would be a useful part of a process that will, ultimately, lead to a follow-up spillover analysis, hopefully.</p></speech>

It is a pleasure for me to be here.  I am head of the Cuban Institute of Friendship with the Peoples.  I was also recently elected as a member of the Cuban Parliament, which began its ninth legislative term in April, selecting a new Council of State and new ministers.  The Council of State is led for the first time by a member who was not traditionally part of the Cuban revolution and military.  We know there was a lot of speculation outside of Cuba about this fact, but for us it was a natural process.  Our colleague, Miguel D&iacute;az-Canel, has made his career in the party and in government and has the trust of the party and of the Cuban people.  There was a generation that traditionally led the Cuban revolution.  Our colleague, Miguel D&iacute;az-Canel, is the progression of this.  Women comprise 53% of the Parliament.  The Council of State, apart from the president and first vice president, has five other vice presidents, three of whom are women.  Of these three women, two are black women.  It is a Parliament that represents all areas of Cuban society and is constituted of parliamentary groups of solidarity.  We hope we can establish links between this committee, other Irish parliamentary committees and European committees to strengthen relations between our countries and to understand the experiences of both countries.</p> <p>  Our Parliament is also involved in the process of reformation of the constitution, particularly in respect of the realities of the current Cuban economy.  Our country has been involved in a modernisation of its economic model in recent years, with new forms of economic activities, including private companies and co-operatives.  This requires fundamental change to the Cuban constitution, which will be a complex process.  We must also pass this on to the people because all changes in Cuba must be voted on by the people.</p><p>The constitutional process that emerges from this process will be put to a popular vote.</p><p> There is an accord between Cuba and the European Union.  It still needs to be ratified by the Irish Parliament.  We hope the Irish Parliament will ratify the agreement between the European Union and Cuba.</p><p> That is the end of my introduction and I welcome any questions.</p></speech>

The ambassador has told me it is 300.  It is not a considerable number considering the number of Cubans who reside in other European states.  For example, in Spain there are a large number of Cuban residents.  They are possibly in other European countries but Spain is the country where they mostly reside.</p> <p>  In terms of trade, there could be more links.  In the context of technology, biotechnology and pharmaceuticals, there are a lot of links we could establish with the Irish State and a lot of trade links that could be promoted and established further with the Irish State.</p></speech>

The magnitude of the trade is small; it is concentrated in replacement pieces for construction and some dairy products.  Ireland has a lot of spheres in which trade could be beneficial to both countries.  We should look for ways to promote that trade without letting the US embargo affect it.</p></speech>

Mr. Gonz&aacute;lez Llort is very welcome.  I also welcome the newly appointed ambassador, Mr. Hugo Ren&eacute; Ramos Milan&eacute;s.  I acknowledge the role of the previous ambassador, Mr. Hermes Herrera Hern&aacute;ndez, his relationship with the committee and the work he did in building relations between Ireland and Cuba.</p> <p>  Ireland and Cuba have a great deal in common.  Ireland was colonised but it took us longer - 800 years - to get rid of our colonial power.  Cuba was quicker in that regard.  We are still both in the shadow of our big neighbours.  Cuba has the United State and we have Britain.  Brexit is coming.  I have just returned from Cuba and I met Mr. Gonz&aacute;lez Llort in Havana.  I acknowledge the work ICAP does when people visit.  Anybody who has been there has to acknowledge the health system and the education system.  One thing in education that is so impressive is the literacy campaign that took place just after the revolution.  Today, Ireland, as a developed country, still has literacy issues.  Cuba has done much on that issue.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions.  The blockade is the biggest challenge at the moment.  I feel the EU could play a stronger role.  What does Mr. Gonz&aacute;lez Llort think about the agreement that has been signed?  We know the fines that certain banks faced in the United States if there was engagement with Cuba.  That is the first question.</p> <p>  The second question relates to the fact that when one is in Cuba, one can see the benefits of private enterprise.  Will that be a challenge for those who work in the public sector, such as the great doctors and teachers Cuba has?  How can that dilemma be addressed?  One cannot talk about that without talking about Guantanamo Bay, which is one of the biggest human rights abuses in the world.  That the United State has been allowed to continue its presence in Guantanamo Bay is amazing, to put it mildly.</p> <p>  My final question is on food.  The briefing note we got referred to the extent of the importation of food and yet Cuba is a very fertile country.  There are parts of Cuba that are greener than Ireland.  How is that issue being addressed?</p></speech>

However, the blockade can only be removed by Congress; it is a legislative decision, not an Executive one.  There is not sufficient will in Congress for this change.  It is not just a question of changing one law but involves a combination of laws.  In the initial six months after Donald Trump assumed the Presidency, his Administration began a process of revision of Cuban-American policy.  That revision culminated in a public declaration on the part of the President of the United States on the reinforcement of the embargo against Cuba, which was to be expected and would take place, the pursuit of every financial or commercial transaction with Cuba, discouraging travel by north Americans to our country and searching for a pretext to reduce the operations of their embassy in Havana and ours in Washington.  This policy shift is having an effect on the functioning of our economy.</p><p> In terms of the private sector playing a bigger part in the economy, this is something that has been deeply debated in the Cuban Parliament.  The promotion of small enterprises and small entrepreneurs does not go against socialist principles.  Private enterprises are already a reality within the Cuban economy.  What really creates imbalances and problems is the double currency that exists in Cuba.  At the moment, we are involved in the very complex process of trying to unify the two currencies.  We are looking for the exchange rate that will have the least impact on the economy when the two currencies are merged.  It is a very complex issue that in another place could perhaps have been sorted from one day to another.  The unification will have an effect on those who earn the least in Cuban society so when these changes are brought about, the emphasis is to be on having the least effect on those who are at the bottom and suffering the most.  It is established already that the unification of the currencies has to happen as soon as possible.  The imbalance which the Deputy observed is something that the Cuban Government is examining.</p><p> There was a reference to another imbalance in our economy, namely, that relating to the production of food.  For us, it is contradictory that although we have land to cultivate, we have to import the equivalent of &euro;2 billion each year in produce.  Part of the policy of remodelling the Cuban economy has to do with maximising internal food production.  There will always be a number of products that we will have to import because they cannot be produced in our climate.  However, we need to be prepared to produce the largest amount of food possible.  That is what our people expect and that is what we are working on.  It has not been easy but we are working in that direction.</p><p> On Guantanamo Bay, it is a scar on our dignity.  It is a territory on our island that the United States occupied in an illegal manner and that it maintains against the will of our people and our Government.  There are American military bases in many countries.  In some countries, they exist against the will of the population but are accepted by the national government.  This is not the case with Guantanamo Bay.</p><p>The latter is the only military base which operates against the will of the people and the Government.  It was obtained by the United States in an illegal manner at a critical moment in Cuban history.  This is an important question because the debate is often made around should the base be opened or closed.  There is no debate, however as to why that base is there or its legality or illegality.  It is important that this issue becomes part of the debate's agenda.  For Cubans, this is a key issue and there is no possibility of fully normalising relationships with the United States as long as it continues to occupy that territory.  We can have increased dialogue with the United States Government but the complete normalisation of relations cannot happen while a territory in our state is being occupied.</p></speech>

I attended a wedding in Cuba on this day 17 years ago.  I am wishing I was back there now rather than sitting here.</p> <p>  Anyone who visits Cuba is impressed by its healthcare and education systems, the arts and the country's climate, as well as the friendliness of the people.  There is a relationship and warmth between the Irish and the Cuban peoples.  There is a realisation that we have something in common.  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan spoke about our difficult relationship with our largest neighbour.  We have much in common with humour and other traits too.</p> <p>  When I visited Cuba, I saw people queuing up for food but I did not see any homeless individuals like one would see in Ireland.  People's living conditions were basic.  There was great hope after the former US President, Barack Obama, shook hands with the Cuban President, Raul Castro, that things would open up.  Unfortunately, it has not happened.</p> <p>  The Irish President, Michael D. Higgins, visited Cuba last year and spoke about building a mutual relationship between Ireland and Cuba.  What concrete steps can the Irish Government and people take to improve Irish-Cuban relations?  While we are all concerned by the sanctions, not many people understand their impact and how it affects simple things such as banking.  For example, if a company trading with Cuba uses a bank which has a subsidiary in the US, the bank is open to fines.  There is a concern that there may be a trade war between Europe and the US.  Some of the sanctions which impact on Cuba may happen in Europe too.  I wish Mr. Gonz&aacute;lez Llort well with building relations with Ireland and Europe.</p> <p>  We have a Cuban solidarity group in the Parliament.  It is one of the more active ones.  I am sure Mr. Gonz&aacute;lez Llort will encourage Irish people to travel to Cuba.  Meeting people at first hand is the best way of building friendships.</p> <p>  When I was in Cuba, there was much coverage about the arrest of Mr. Gonz&aacute;lez Llort and his four colleagues in the US.  The American Government claimed they were spying and were a threat to America.  I understand Mr. Gonz&aacute;lez Llort's group was trying to infiltrate groups involved in no-warning bombing campaigns, blowing up aeroplanes and killing innocent people, and not just in Cuba.  He wanted to get information to prevent such attacks.  The Cuban Government at the time sent back information to the US authorities about what was happening.  Many of us would see what he was doing was positive but the American Government had a different view.  Will he elaborate on his experience in the American jail system?  I am glad he is now home with his family and I congratulate him on his election to the Cuban Parliament.  I hope there are concrete steps our Government and this committee can take to build on the friendship between the two countries.</p></speech>

We were arrested in 1998 and we left prison in 2014.  Our presence in the US was due to a history of ongoing violence coming from groups based in the United States, even though US laws state that one cannot organise in a manner to bring about violence in a foreign country.  It is a law which is never mentioned, the Neutrality Act.  At the beginning of the triumph of the Cuban revolution, many Cubans went to southern Florida and began to organise and conspire against the revolution from there.</p><p>These groups obtain finance, weapons and logistical support in the United States of America, from where they attack Cuba and Cuban interests all across the area.</p><p> As a result of these attacks, 2,000 Cubans have been killed, while 3,000 have been mutilated.  This has been ongoing for decades, since the triumph of the Cuban revolution.  The US authorities that are supposed to act on these actions have never done anything to the individuals involved.  Cuba has no other option but to send individuals to south Florida to identify them and discover where they are getting their armaments and logistical support.  That is what we were doing in south Florida.  We never set out to get any information on the US Government; that was not our objective.  However, the US authorities arrested us and prosecuted us on espionage charges.  I believe it was part of the historical hostility of the US Government towards our country.</p><p> An international campaign was organised, in which a lot of our colleagues in Ireland were involved.  A number of Irish parliamentarians signed the petition to have us freed and express solidarity and support, for which we were deeply thankful.  Little by little the truth began to emerge as to why we were in prison.  Thanks to this solidarity, the factual and real information on our case began to get through and in the end we won the battle and were freed.  I believe the truth imposed itself.  Once again I take the opportunity to thank all of the parliamentarians and people involved in the campaign in order that I could be here today speaking to the committee.  There is an inter-parliamentary solidarity committee in Cuba and the Irish Parliament also has a Cuban solidarity group.  I believe every mechanism that promotes dialogue and co-operation between our two countries is important.</p><p> On international policy, I believe there are a lot of areas where we have common points.  The ratification by the Irish Parliament of the EU-Cuba co-operation agreement was a very important step.  The visit to Cuba by the President of Ireland was also a very significant act of solidarity.  Any time a head of state visits a foreign country it is a great show of solidarity.  It also shows a will to advance economic and social co-operation.  It creates interest within the Irish business sector to trade with Cuba.  Cuba also has a lot to offer in trade.  We have a highly educated population.  Sectors of the Cuban economy rely very much on the important contribution made by the knowledge economy.  There is development of the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors in Cuba from which Ireland could benefit hugely.  Cuba could also benefit from Ireland's experience in these sectors.</p><p> In my modest opinion, Ireland and Cuba should go down those roads.  I hope this Parliament will support those objectives in order that they can be made more concrete.</p></speech>

With Colombia having a new president, how confident is Mr. Gonzalez Llort that the peace process can be maintained?  The larger picture is the manner in which lawfully elected governments in Latin America are being undermined by forces within which are being orchestrated by outside forces.</p></speech>

All Cubans are very proud of the role Cuba has played in the negotiations between FARC and the Colombian Government.  Its role has also been recognised by the guerillas and the Colombian Government.  It has been acknowledged that when the negotiations were going through a very difficult time, Cuba, among other countries, helped to maintain the process in as smooth a manner as possible.  In his public statements the new President of Colombia has given the impression that he will not support the peace process to the same extent as his predecessor.  He has stated that although he supports the peace process, he wishes to reform and modify the document on which it is based.  However, what someone says when they are a candidate may be different from what they say when they are the president of a nation.  We wish for the peace process to be strengthened for the good of Colombia and the wider world.</p> <p>  That is connected to the Deputy's second question and relates to the efforts made by the United States to undermine all progressive governments in the region.  Those efforts are evidenced by the shameful manner in which the United States removed Dilma Rousseff from the presidency of Brazil and the imprisonment of Luiz Lula da Silva, the most popular candidate for the presidency.  These actions were taken to prevent them from winning the election.  </p> <p>  The hand of the United States is evident in the irrational violence in Nicaragua.  The Nicaraguan Government is trying to mend differences through dialogue, but the violence is continuing.  </p> <p>  The interference of the United States can be seen in the war being waged against Venezuela and its legitimately elected government.  The Venezuelan Government that has won 23 elections in 18 years is constantly attacked and undermined internationally.  It is part of a strategy to weaken and remove any progressive government in the region and instead establish neoliberal policies which would lead to big benefits for multinationals.</p></speech>

We hope that administrative matter can be progressed.</p> <p>  Deputies Maureen O'Sullivan and Se&aacute;n Crowe and Senator Mark Daly have visited Cuba.  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan who is Vice Chairman of the committee has, for many years, been a powerful advocate for improving relations between our two countries which she continues to promote at every opportunity at the committee and during parliamentary debates.

The committee's letter of invitation refers to tracker mortgages and other issues and we will endeavour to cover as many aspects of our business as possible.  Alongside me today are members of my executive team, Mr. Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe and Mr. Tom Kinsella.</p> <p>  This year marks a decade on from the global financial crash and it is difficult to capture the scale of change wrought across the banking sector by those events.  As a completely restructured bank, we now operate in a dramatically different regulatory environment with the Central Bank of Ireland and the European Central Bank focusing in great detail on all aspects of our activity through a customer, conduct, prudential and policy lens.  Within that tight regulatory framework and very detailed supervision we must maintain a well capitalised, strong and profitable institution, providing professional and efficient service to our 2.2 million customers in the fastest growing economy in Europe. </p> <p>  Positively, we are well capitalised and our banking activities are generating the returns required to keep the business sustainable and capable of supporting the growing Irish economy while rewarding those who provide the risk capital, both equity and debt, that are required to deliver a robust and resilient bank.  This is as it should be, but the changes in the regulatory and supervisory regimes that govern how we operate have brought many changes, some with impact outside of the pure banking sector.  First, at an institutional level, we and others in the industry are still working through the impact of the evolving regulatory requirements.  While the level of new regulation being introduced is tapering off, the implementation phase will run for some time and will permanently require significant resources from regulators and the institutions.  Second, there is a clear harmonisation of approach being adapted by supervisors across Europe.  With over 120 banking groups to monitor across the EU this is understandable.  The increase in capital levels generally and the standardisation of approach regarding how much capital individual activities such as mortgages and SMEs require is still developing and, on average, also increasing. </p> <p>  The ECB has set measures in stone to ensure the Irish taxpayer is not exposed to bank losses again should there be a further crisis.  To avoid taxpayers meeting the cost of potential future bank failures, the new rules under the bank recovery and resolution directive mean banks meet a minimum requirement of own funds and eligible liabilities for "bail in".  It means sparing the taxpayer future bailouts.  Again this is beneficial and desirable but comes at a cost.</p><p> Risk management and controls underpin all our banking activities as we aim to provide competitive funding to homes, businesses, farms and communities across the country.  The balance we must strike is to manage the bank well and efficiently, deal with the legacy issues, safeguard our customers' financial interests and support the economy.  Securing a turnaround in AIB's financial performance has been achieved.  Following the Government sale of 29% of its shareholding, the bank has returned &euro;10.5 billion to the State in capital, fees, dividends, coupons and levies.  The remaining shareholding of 71% of the largest bank in the country, with an estimated market cap of &euro;13.46 billion, positions the Government to recoup its investment.  While our finances are now robust and Ireland&rsquo;s financial system is much safer, we should bear in mind that serious issues and challenges remain.  Regulatory requirements, including conservative capital buffers, carry cost implications for banks and, ultimately, customers.  It is also legally and culturally difficult for a bank in Ireland to realise its security over loans, a fact that leaves investors wary and regulators concerned about the capital required to support such activities.  Other external issues such as high degrees of market turbulence in Europe, changing international tax arrangements, increased protectionism in traditional trading and, of course, a possible hard Brexit, all carry further inherent risks to the economy and, by implication, to the banking industry.</p><p> Remaining technologically advanced is critical to our position as a market-leading bank.  We must be digitally enabled and provide services that meet the ways in which our customers seek to interact with us on a daily basis.  In this rapidly advancing environment, we now see circa 1.5 million daily customer interactions, of which more than 1.1 million are via digital channels.  We continue to innovate in this space, based on customer feedback and advances in the wider banking network in Ireland with over 270 branches between AIB and EBS, 20 business centres and a partnership with An Post which sees banking facilities available at some 1,100 An Post locations.</p><p> Stable income and well-controlled costs are now embedded features of our business model and we are continuing to resolve legacy issues.  To the fore has been the tracker mortgage issue about which we have spoken at length to this committee.  We are well progressed and are in the final stages of the CBI tracker mortgage examination but ultimately the CBI is the arbiter in deciding when the matter is complete.  From AIB's perspective, all impacted customers across more than 30 individual groupings have been identified, contacted and restored to their correct interest rates and paid redress and compensation.  The final group of outstanding cases, who are EBS customers identified as impacted in quarter 2 2018, will have their rates rectified by the end of this month and be compensated by the end of September.  We will also remain ready to address any other cases should they emerge.</p><p> On the tracker issue, we regret that AIB customers endured financial loss and emotional distress where the bank failed its contractual obligations or its requirement to provide proper levels of transparency and information.  When the problem came to light, AIB acted swiftly and in good faith to launch a major programme of work involving approximately 500 people deployed to implement fair settlements as quickly as possible.  The complexity and scale involved in the examination and rectification meant it took more time than I would have liked and involved difficult judgement calls on the way to finalisation.  Some of these were finely balanced.  We will continue to commit the resources necessary to conclude this in line with the CBI's framework.  How the tracker product was designed, administered and ultimately withdrawn may well continue to be the subject of discussion and investigation.  My responsibility is to make sure that we had in place a programme to identify all the affected customers and deliver fair and proper treatment and to express a sincere apology on behalf of the bank to those impacted.</p><p> I mentioned earlier the requirement to ensure that Irish taxpayers are protected in the event of a future economic downturn.  This brings me to another legacy issue of critical importance to the bank's strength and viability, namely, non-performing exposures.  Dealing with non-performing exposures is, I realise, a contentious matter.  On occasion it has been simplistically and incorrectly described as AIB selling off its customers' debts with little care for the consequences. It is very important that we set the logic behind the sale of non-performing loans.  AIB has consistently pursued a strategy of working with customers to achieve positive outcomes to their financial difficulties on a case-by-case basis.  Using a suite of different solutions, we have achieved over 90,000 customer solutions including 40,000 private dwelling houses.  AIB continues to provide solutions for an average of 1,000 loans per month.  Recognising that many customers simply cannot repay all their loans or have inadequate security, the bank has also written off very significant amounts of bad debt to right-size loans to a sustainable level.  As a result of these actions, the bank&rsquo;s non-performing exposures fell from approximately &euro;31 billion in 2013 to approximately &euro;9.2 billion at the end of quarter 1 of this year, with continued momentum since then.  We are still faced with a portion of impaired loans that remain high.  For example, the portfolio that was sold by AIB last month was characterised by levels of deep long term arrears.  Approximately 90% of accounts were more than two years in arrears and about 70% were over five years in arrears, reflecting a lack of any meaningful engagement and, or, debt sustainability.</p><p> Like every bank across the eurozone, AIB is required to create and hold provisions against bad or doubtful debt; the deeper the arrears, the higher the bank buffers required.  Our regulators in Europe are very concerned at the persistent level of non-performing exposures in Irish banks.  The end of 2019 is a very important target date for Irish banks to reduce NPL levels to European norms of approximately 5%.  AIB's NPL level is currently running at 14%.  In reality, all customers who meet their loan repayments are adversely impacted upon by those who do not repay.  The Central Bank of Ireland has observed that a functioning secured lending market has to give meaning to security.  If that security is undermined, the costs to all other borrowers are impacted.  Defaulting customers, and indeed the history of defaults, mean that we as a bank must hold additional capital but this inevitable additional cost is borne across all our customer base for many years.  We are determined to push on with the case-by-case resolution process and continue to have 1,500 people working with customers in difficulty across the country.  Our clear preference has always been to provide solutions on this individual basis to right-size customer debt to sustainable levels.  We must be realistic, however.  While we have made great strides, we still have much to do.</p><p> The progress that has been made to date in achieving a normalised banking system has been at times overshadowed by these issues but normalisation is happening, particularly against the backdrop of the improving Irish economy.  Growth in new lending is continuing and last year alone AIB approved &euro;14.4 billion in loans, with actual customer drawdowns at &euro;9.4 billion, up from &euro;8.4 billion on the previous year.  Mortgage lending rose by 17%, business lending rose by 15% and personal lending was up 16%.  Leading indicators of activity remain strong, which points to continued good economic growth here.  The favourable external environment is supporting exports, with domestic spending underpinned by continuing low interest rates, unemployment falling below 6% and rising household incomes, as well as the ongoing rebound in construction activity.  This should result in a further rise in new lending activity this year.</p><p> While GDP growth is forecast at 4.5% overall in 2018 and unemployment is predicted to drop below 6%, we remain alert to the challenges and risks that lie ahead.  The uncertainty regarding Brexit, the slowdown in UK economic activity and the strength of the euro against sterling obviously present potential headwinds.  While many of our customers have been diversifying their export base quite significantly in recent years, the impact of a downturn in the UK would almost certainly impact their performance.  We have 21 Brexit advisers across the bank who specifically help customers to work out alternative plans to mitigate exposure to Brexit-related risks.  However, given the openness of our economy, a deterioration of global economic conditions and adverse geopolitical developments, particularly in Europe and the US, would have a negative impact here.  Some emerging markets have come under pressure this year while there is concern at recent moves towards more protectionist trade policies.</p><p> The lack of housing supply in the major urban areas is clearly one of the main infrastructural difficulties facing the country from a social and economic viewpoint.  In helping to play our part in alleviating the current crisis, we have ramped up activity in the bank's development lending sector and we are the primary bank to many of the country's largest development groups.  We have expanded our lending teams significantly over the last two years and established a group to support mid-sized development companies.  Our focus is not just providing real estate finance, although this is critical, it is also on increasingly on facilitating social and affordable housing.  We have already supported a very successful affordable housing scheme in Ballymun, with a view to funding more such projects.  We also provide long-term funding to a number of approved housing bodies, with the launch of a &euro;100 million social housing development fund.  AIB also launched an enhanced mortgage-to-rent scheme in conjunction with iCare Housing and the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation and has offered a significant number of vacant residential properties to the Housing Agency for consideration.</p><p> As I mentioned at the start, banking today operates to a different model to that which predated the financial crisis.  The consequences of banks' financial strategies must now be matched by responsibility for the social impact of their actions.  Regulation has been brought to a new level involving intense supervision and resulted in a strengthening of our financial foundations.  From my perspective, however, the really crucial element of a sustainable AIB is continuing to evolve our culture while rebuilding and maintaining high levels of trust and confidence among members of the public.  I know there is still much to do in this regard.  Ultimately, the quality of AIB's service to its customers and communities will determine its long term sustainability.  Our responsibilities extend to those customers, to Government, to our regulators, to shareholders and to the economy generally and we will continue to work to ensure our stewardship remains solid and deserving of that confidence.  I thank the committee and look forward to any questions.</p></speech>

Let us move on with it.  We were very familiar with the issues associated with that particular cohort.  We have even discussed our position and thoughts on this grouping in this room.  It was not some completely new set of facts that emerged in respect of this particular issue.  We felt the situation in respect of this grouping was reasonably conclusive based on the contractual position and what the individual customers had signed, which, effectively, was a waiver form which acknowledged that in the event of them swapping off tracker rates, they would have no entitlement to trackers.  We were in discussions with the Central Bank which felt that we should give more weight to issues around marketing materials and other correspondence and to some ambiguities associated with language.  These ambiguities were in other materials, not in the contracts.  We gave that a lot of consideration and ultimately determined that we would include that group.  It was not, therefore, a new consideration or issue from that point of view.  We were aware of the grouping.  This is one of the issues which we refer to as finely balanced.  Some of these issues are finely balanced in terms of how it is decided to go in any particular direction.</p></speech>

The Central Bank ultimately determined the final matter.  It was not just a matter of AIB working through all this and making decisions.  If it was not for those determined families and advocates such as Padraic Kissane, this would never have come to the fore.  It would be honest of Mr. Byrne to accept the role that the families and these people have played in bringing this issue to light and in bringing AIB reluctantly to the point at which the 500 cases are being considered.</p></speech>

We completed our work and KPMG completed its work.  Ernst &amp;amp; Young carried out a review and discussions took place with the Central Bank.  That is the basis on which decisions are made.  It is not on the basis of extraneous issues or the extent to which those issues are brought to bear by others.  Perhaps they are of relevance but our process is based on the Central Bank review.

That was a period in which there was very significant turbulence in the financial markets generally and there was dislocation in terms of the funding cost.  That was the reason the tracker product was withdrawn.  Based on what we could see, it was withdrawn from the marketplace.</p></speech>

The Senator is of the view that there was an individual or a set of people who consciously chose to do this.  Our perspective is very different.  We believe this issue arose as a result of the withdrawal of a product.  People did not consider the implications.  No person was taken off a tracker.  Some 104,000 customers remained on trackers at that point in time.  There was not a set of people taken off trackers.  The issue related to what would happen in the future with regard to further reversionary issues.  That is why it has taken the path it has taken.</p></speech>

That is of concern to every Irish citizen.  It will continue to be a concern.  The bank implements a 20% stress on foreign earnings when an applicant seeks a mortgage.  I understand the rationale for that but, given the nature of our island economy, using the maximum available stress rate is a step too far.  I should note that other banks do not even entertain applications in sterling so it is welcome that AIB does, but many cross-Border workers are affected.  They effectively find that they need an extra 20% of income to access a mortgage that their neighbours do not.  Will Mr. Byrne look at this issue which affects Irish citizens living in the South?</p></speech>

Unfortunately, this is a practical reality if one looks at what has happened to exchange rates over the past 18 months.  The movement in exchange rates demonstrates that it is reasonable to apply a stress of 20%.</p></speech>

However, it is a requirement for us to consider the stress associated with such applications.  We apply a stress of 20%, as the Senator said.  We have disclosed that.  We do not think that is unreasonable at this point on the basis of where things stand.  However, we keep it under review.</p></speech>

That would be one way to facilitate people and not to mitigate against people who work on the other side of the Border, which should not be there.  Why did AIB not answer the question of when 100% of the deferred tax assets will be used up?  We did not ask when 89% would be used up.  I ask Mr. Byrne again, when will 100% be used up?  He must have considered this.</p></speech>

What we gave was a set of estimates based on a prediction of future profitability.  That gives an estimate.  If one applies a similar number, the projection ends up being somewhere around 17 to 18 years, but it is a projection based on a set of assumptions that will ultimately vary depending on the actual financial performance of the bank.</p></speech>

When one looks at the issue of deferred tax, as part of the initial bailout credit for &euro;3 billion of deferred tax assets was given to the State.  The bailout was reduced by that amount.  It was part of that original consideration.  The value of the bank's total assets already include a deferred tax assets.  That is realised as the State sells down its share holding.

I find it very difficult to make sense of the fact that AIB has such a write-down for a bunch of funds that will then flip the portfolio over in the short term, will make huge profits but will pay no tax on it, when a restructuring could possibly be done.

Some 70% of this portfolio is more than five years in arrears, while 90% is more than two years in arrears.  The ideal scenario is that we can engage and restructure.  We agree on that.

There are some cases where that is an agreed position and there are others where it is not.  It could be part of a wider connection where there are other difficulties.  However, to add to the point on the discounts that are taken when this happens, those discounts are made available to customers every day by the 1,500 people we have deployed to this.  During the same period we were working on the portfolio sale, we highlighted as part of our communications that we restructured over &euro;400 million in additional loans.  Had those loans not been restructured, they would have formed part of that sale.  As we went through that process those loans also received write-downs and write-offs.  Those write-downs, write-offs and discounts are provided on a daily basis to customers with whom we are working.</p></speech>

However, where there were going concerns in the portfolio, that is one of the key restructuring pieces that we do as part of our normal restructuring.  We work to deal with the investment assets through a sales process.  We typically arrange a bridge to sale to sell those down in order that we can protect the underlying trading business if there is one.  The portfolio was predominantly driven by an investment assets.</p></speech>

The first is that while we were working through this, we continued to work with customers to restructure.  At this point, we have a team that has been set up to work with customers if there are any proposals etc. that we can work out with them to share with the purchaser.  The purchaser will consider proposals even at this point.</p></speech>

Related to that, AIB wrote to customers who have an overdraft to notify them that it would be removed from 27 July because their loans are being transferred completely.  AIB informed them in writing that the letter they received constituted formal demand for repayment of the debit balance, if any, and that any outstanding debt on the account is due for immediate payment on this date.  AIB has called in the overdrafts of those businesses that are part of this portfolio and have overdrafts with the bank.  How will that work in practice for these businesses?  AIB's entire relationship with them is being transferred over to Everyday Finance DAC.  If these businesses lose their overdrafts on that date and they are not provided with a corresponding one by the new loan owner, it could be the end of those businesses.</p></speech>

I must give the context here all the time.  These are very long-dated arrears where businesses with heavily connected investment debt have failed to engage with us to help us help them to protect the business over that period.  What we did do, because we recognised that issue, is identify where people were using their overdraft and wrote to them.  The letter was very clear.  We dealt with the cashflow issue.  We said to customers that at the end of July, their overdraft would complete and the balance would transfer at that point in time.  That gives them the opportunity, if they require the cashflow that is in that limit, to draw it down and use it on a normal credit current account basis.  To be fair, that was the best solution we could consider to solve the cashflow problem in a different way before the loan transfers.  In fact, we also identified the customers who we felt needed to be contacted and we tried to make contact with them.  Unfortunately, due to the nature of the portfolio, again the engagement was difficult.</p></speech>

However, how that new loan owner regards that overdraft is entirely its own affair.  Is that what he is saying?</p></speech>

Just to be clear, this deals with a cashflow issue but the debt is still created.  That is important.  We are engaging with people and explaining the process to them, when we can talk to them, and we are very happy to do that during the process.</p></speech>

It becomes a loan.</p></speech>

However, a &euro;50,000 overdraft carried over to Everyday Finance DAC, which the latter regards as a loan and calls in, creates a completely different dynamic.  That is fine, I just wanted that clarity.</p> <p>  I refer now to the tracker mortgage issue.  The prevailing rate cohort constitutes about 5,800 customer accounts at this point.

We have discussed here before that the main offering from a mortgage customer point of view that we have in the AIB group is in AIB, which dominates in terms of our market share.  We use EBS as a challenger brand, and the proposition from EBS is consistent with how others are positioned in the market.  The offer from EBS is effectively a competitive offering relative to other players in the market that have cash-back type offers as their predominant feature.  AIB offers a standard variable rate mortgage predominantly while that from EBS is effectively a cash-back offer with a standard variable rate.  The incremental cost, as we have touched on before, reflects the change and difference between the propositions by EBS and AIB.</p></speech>

Mr. Byrne has said that he recognises that the bank failed in its responsibility to provide proper levels of transparency and information and that now it has implemented fair settlements for everybody affected.  Would he accept that, in its assessment of the problem and implementation of fair settlements, the bank has taken the narrowest possible view of who those affected are?</p></speech>

Collective thinking changes on this over time.  Views and positions change.  At the beginning, as we have said before, we accept that we were being quite legalistic and bank-centric in interpretation.  Some of the original issues that may have emerged back in 2013 and 2014, the issues that would have gone to the ombudsman etc., those findings which were supportive of the bank's position were correct but based on a strict interpretation of the position.  What we are saying is that it has evolved and now there is a broader perspective taken in respect of looking at all of the issues associated with it to see on balance where that gets to and I think the position has to balance on the other side.  The fiduciary responsibilities to the operation of the bank, the shareholders and the State are associated with getting the balance right between all customers and all the stakeholders.  I do not think it is a single issue on which we can ever be absolutely definitive but definitely the approach is much more focused on the overall position as opposed to a strict interpretation.</p></speech>

Mr. Byrne might be able to tell me how many people this is in terms of AIB and EBS - those who were on a fixed rate, came off it at a time at which tracker mortgages were available, but were not offered a tracker mortgage at that stage.  Mr. Byrne is saying those people are not entitled to compensation.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

I suspect and presume there are thousands of people in this cohort.  I have emailed the witnesses in respect of this example.  The facts, I understand, are not in dispute between the bank and the customer.  He took a mortgage out with EBS in 2003 when a tracker mortgage was not available.  He went onto a one-year fixed rate in 2004 and came off that on 30 June 2005 but was not offered a tracker interest rate.  The final response from EBS, which says he is not entitled to compensation, says there was no contractual obligation on EBS to specifically offer him a tracker interest rate.  Reference is made to the fact that there were ads and so on at the time and it is suggested that he should have known himself and should have asked for it.</p></speech>

We are very happy to look at any individual case.  We need to understand the interpretation and the issues associated with it.  We will have made a determination decision around those cases.

I even signed the form to get responsibility to act on his behalf.  To be clear, EBS is saying that he had the right to get it.  If he knew about it, he could have said he wanted a tracker and EBS is saying it certainly would have given him a tracker.  The point is that it did not say it to him.  It was not included in the offer letter.  I was told the bank could not produce a copy of this letter as it only retains copies of these letters from 2008.  However, the bank could confirm that a tracker interest rate was not mentioned in that letter or when he went into the bank.  He was not offered the information about a tracker being available to him.  I presume there are thousands of people in this position in terms of AIB and EBS.</p></speech>

That is the case EBS is making.  The code of practice was not in operation at that time but one would hope that the bank would generally operate in the spirit of the code of practice.  The code states that before providing a product or service to a consumer, a regulated entity must gather and record sufficient information from the consumer to enable it to provide a recommendation or product or service appropriate to that consumer.</p><p>The letter to the guy says that the bank confirms that it was standard practice to inform customers of all interest rate options at the time of application and on request.  The tracker is an interest rate option and he was not informed about it at the time he came off the fixed rate.  It also says that EBS staff do not provide advice on which interest rate option to choose, that it is the customer's decision and the obligation rests with him or her to advise the bank accordingly.  Is that not in conflict with the spirit of the code of practice, which is to provide recommendations and so on that are appropriate to the customer?</p></speech>

Mr. Byrne thinks that it is fair to expect a customer with no knowledge of relatively complex financial products to initiate a conversation himself or herself after seeing an advertisement for a tracker mortgage, wondering what it is and wanting to get one.  Mr. Byrne does not think the bank had an obligation to say there is a range of options for the customer is coming off a fixed rate, one of which is a tracker rate, another is a variable rate, etc.</p></speech>

It was not known.  It is sometimes difficult to apply logic to a position that we now know to be true versus the history of the issue.  That is evidenced by the draw-down statistics that took place over that period on how people drew down products, whatever level of information they had.  The tracker rate was not any different from a standard variable rate product or people's position and thoughts on fixed rates.  A number of people moved to fixed rates because it was cheaper at the time.  It is hard to apply that logic backwards and say a bank should have said this because it should have known.  I do not think anyone realistically could have known.</p></speech>

That has been a long-standing position for all the banks.  I am conscious of the intent of trying to address the question but we need to be careful since we do not have the specifics in front of us.  The customer would have taken out a loan in 2003, as the Deputy has outlined.  At that point, the customer would have been made aware of all the rates.  That would be part of the process.  Then there would have been a set of terms and conditions and the running conditions of that product, which would set out what would happen over the intervening period.  Tracker rates came in later in that period.  When the bank introduced rates, it did not advise customers on rates because they could go either way.  We all forget that tracker rates went the other way for a considerable period so that would have been incorrect advice to the customer.  The key point is that the tracker was freely available to customers, had they chosen it in that period, but it was not attached to the original product that they would have taken out.</p></speech>

There is a serious information imbalance between the customer and bank.  A bank has an obligation to assist the customer in overcoming that information imbalance by giving the information.  How is the customer meant to ask for a tracker if he or she does not know that the tracker is available?</p></speech>

Otherwise, we will get into speculation related to the customer.  What we have outlined about the customer taking out the product with specific terms and later having the option to avail of the tracker rate is probably at the crux of this.</p></speech>

The first question I have relates to the 500 EBS customers.  It is a number of years after the bank's formal investigation started.  We appreciate AIB was probably one of the first out of the tracks to get to grips with this, although getting fully to grips with it took quite a long time.  Why are we now just learning about the 500 EBS customers?</p></speech>

I will give a summary again.  We accept that this group is coming later in the process.  There is no debate about that.  We have talked about this group here before.  This has been our position on the contractual issue associated with this and the waiver form that was signed by the individuals when they drew down the tracker rate.  Not having had a tracker entitlement in the beginning, when drawing down the tracker they effectively signed a one page waiver that said if they ever moved off the tracker, they had no entitlement to go back.  That was the position which we held and we felt it was supported by the position of not including them in the overall programme.  As part of the Central Bank investigation, which was a later process, and an investigation with EY, having a discussion about consistency with us and across the industry, they have engaged with us and all the cohorts extensively.  They pushed us on this one to think more about ancillary and other materials associated with this, rather than the contractual position and what the customer signed.  When we did that and took into account their perspective on ambiguous language and other materials that were more available, we went back to the view that we would include this group.  I mentioned "finely balanced" in my statement.  These things are finely balanced with regard to how one determines which way to go in fairness to everyone.  We know that everyone wants a tracker.  That is not the point.  The question is how we get to the point of deciding whether somebody has a sufficient entitlement and it is fair across every perspective.  Based on that interaction with the Central Bank, we decided to include this group.  That is why it is late.</p></speech>

On the pure legal side, it is a much more difficult argument.  With the overall position and our perspective of being focused on the customer, taking the weight of evidence related to it, we have included it.</p></speech>

We heard from bankers that came before this committee, though I am not sure if it was Mr. Byrne or another CEO, who said that as part of their apology to their customers for the wrongs visited upon them by the bank, they approached this in an overly legalistic manner as opposed to a customer-focused approach.  When that apology was being made, they were talking about a couple of years ago and said that they were now customer-focused.  Can we not read from what Mr. Byrne has explained to the committee that AIB was, until a couple of weeks before the Central Bank pushed it, taking an overly legalistic approach as opposed to a customer-focused approach?</p></speech>

There is a legal position which we looked at and examined.  We made a decision which was that we felt this group was not included.  I have explained that the Central Bank engaged us significantly in a conversation on it.  In particular, it brought a perspective relating to ambiguous language in other materials separate from that.  We gave way to that since it is a competent authority that looks at these things.  Whether people like it or not, some of these decisions are finely balanced as to which way one goes and that is why we have ended up in the position we have decided on.</p></speech>

We heard another clip from the Anglo Irish Bank tapes.  As we know, David Drumm wakes up this morning in a prison cell, starting a five and a half year sentence.  We heard the behind the scenes voices of the bankers and the attitude they had at that time.  Much has been said about the culture.  I appreciate that the management team in AIB is not the management team that existed at the time of the crash.</p><p>Does Mr. Byrne believe there is still an issue in the bank relating to culture?  I am not suggesting it is as severe as evidenced in the tapes but I am asking whether there is an issue nevertheless.  </p></speech>

Culture is important and we recognise the culture that existed in banking needed to change.  We are still on a journey of change but we have made a lot of progress.  The business has focused a lot on being clear as to our purpose and how we implement that, culturally, with accountability, collective responsibility and customer focus.  We have a continuous series of engagements between staff and customers to develop that.  We have more to do because one does not change culture overnight.  I believe, however, that we are in a positive position in terms of intent.  We are continually improving and our approach to complaints is moving in the right direction.  The Central Bank is carrying out a culture review in conjunction with the Dutch central bank and we are comfortable with that engagement.</p></speech>

It is not a crime here but it is a crime across the water.  The Central Bank has been arguing for this for a number of years but the Government has refused to make it a crime.  In a submission to the Law Reform Commission, the Central Bank argues that senior bankers should be held accountable for actions under their remit, rather than just where their fingerprints are found on an action.  The Bank proposes that each senior banker would have to provide a map of his or her areas of responsibility so that they could be held accountable for any wrongdoing that happened within their area.  Does Mr. Byrne agree with those proposals?</p></speech>

My opening statement mentioned factoring balance into all these decisions.  There is a consequence of every action.  One has to determine what one wants.  The more prescriptive something is, the more people will do it but a heavily regulated system cannot compete with a non-heavily regulated system so one needs to decide these things in the context of looking for an organisation to be nimble, agile, flexible and to compete against fintech, for example.  That is not for us to decide but there is no action without consequence.</p></speech>

I do not know the circumstances of each case so I cannot guarantee I will abrogate responsibility for them.  This is for the reason referred to in the Deputy's previous comment, namely, that I may well have responsibility in some other way that may impinge on the issue.  Our objective will be to be fair to everyone.  The case to be determined and considered by the ombudsman may be reasonably clear in terms of findings.  We have worked closely with the ombudsman on all the issues and we have only one finding against us generally - that is, outside the tracker issue.  We are working to solve all issues as quickly and expeditiously as possible.</p></speech>

Yesterday, the Central Bank announced a programme of changes relating to switcher mortgages, in which tens of thousands of customers can benefit by about &euro;1,000 in the first 12 months if they switch.  It believes one in five should switch, both between banks and within a bank.  By 1 January, banks will have to put in a suite of measures to inform their customers of better options.  What is AIB's intention in this regard?  Will it come in on 1 January or does it intend to introduce it at an earlier stage?  Can the bank indicate whether it has done any analysis of the potential for its customers to switch internally?  How many would benefit from a lower rate within AIB?  How will the bank approach the recommendation from the Central Bank that individuals be informed of better options in a bank, including in the area of loan-to-value ratios?  Can the bank write to a customer, who has a loan of &euro;180,000 which has been brought down to &euro;90,000, and suggest they get a valuation with a view to getting a lower interest rate?</p></speech>

We have not thought through a position on the recommendations; we did not know in advance what they were going to be.  We believe the offerings we have, in terms of the standard variable rate and our front and back book pricing, put us in a different position from many in the market.  Our front rate pricing, which is the most attractive offering we have for new customers, is the exact same price as the back book price for the majority of our customers.  We have had this position for quite a while.  We also have an obligation, with which we comply, to inform customers on an annual basis about rates across the institution.  If we can do it earlier and it is the right thing to do we will do that but I have not seen the detail or worked through how it would play out.</p></speech>

He spoke about security and stated:</p><blockquote>If that security is undermined, the costs to all other borrowers are impacted.  Defaulting customers, and indeed the history of defaults, mean that we as a bank must hold additional capital</blockquote> <p>I do not want the witnesses to forget they caused this, though this is not mentioned in the opening statement.</p><p>If the reckless trading in the banks at that time had not happened - I know the witnesses were not in their current roles at that stage - we and many others in the country would not be in our current position.  The bank, legislators and society in general must be continuously reminded that we all fell asleep and during that time the country was wrecked.  It should be included as an indicator that the banks carry a burden of responsibility in this regard.</p></speech>

All I was trying to do with the opening statement was bring to life the reality.  If everybody changed tomorrow, the European Central Bank would still have a set of views on how we need to model for pricing, including pricing for mortgages and small and medium enterprises.  It is based on experience over the past seven or ten years.  It is not some theoretical view that the European Central Bank holds of what happens going forward.  Regardless of its cause or whether we wish it away, we are subject to a pan-European environment that is slightly less concerned with history and more concerned with how capital is allocated across banking systems.  My comment was not meant to be annoying or resolving and I apologise if it was taken as such.</p></speech>

Many are lay litigants.  That is part and parcel of what we must deal with and what was created by the bailout and the behaviour of banks.</p> <p>  In the court case that was decided yesterday Allied Irish Banks suggested that a previous decision might be misinterpreted and relied upon in future litigation and would result in a degree of litigation chaos and uncertainty in law.  That was part of the argument put forward by the bank.  The bank wanted the judge to amplify the reasoning behind that legal decision.  In the course of the submissions, the counsel for Allied Irish Banks informed the court that &euro;7.8 billion of bank loans had been transferred.  This relates to AIB mortgages.  The end result was that the judge refused to accede to the request of the bank that the court should revisit the judgment.  The bank is left with the dilemma, as set out by its own counsel, that there could be chaos and &euro;7.8 billion of transferred funds are now in question.  I know the decision was only made yesterday and the bank must consider it but how will it affect the sale to Everyday Finance?  Are there in the sale cases that now may go to court?  Will the bank examine each of the 800 customer connections in the sale to ensure none of them could be affected by yesterday's decision?</p></speech>

The Chairman referred to the request for an amplification of the judgment.  The judge indicated that the decision made was not in dispute with respect to the final determination of the matter.  A reference had been made to the Asset Covered Securities Act 2001.  The judge stated she did not need to revisit her judgment because, effectively, that was not central to the matter and she had not given due consideration to it and would not give consideration to it as there were other cases that somebody else could choose to take if parties wished to have that matter determined.  She indicated that what she had considered in respect of the matter should not be seen as a considered opinion on the topic.  Therefore, she was not revisiting the decision.  This is only a preliminary view but the decision yesterday does not increase or change the issues associated with it.  We need to consider the position.  The determination made yesterday does not undermine any of the positions we have.</p></speech>

From time to time those agents change or, in our opinion, they may not comply with the terms or something commercial happens that ends the relationship.  There are some former agents who have taken actions against EBS on the basis that the contractual break or whatever happened was not correct.  It is a litigation matter between agents and EBS.

I mentioned Ms Yvonne Walsh and her case but I will not ask the witnesses about it.  Members of her family are here today watching proceedings.</p><p>Much of what is happening in the courts could be avoided by people engaging with the banks or <i>vice versa</i>.  I am not referring to the pros and cons of the case itself.  I am just making the point that it seems extreme that a mother can be jailed so quickly, almost on a criminal basis, without the matter being resolved until later today when it takes years to do anything else.  There is a human cost in the sale of properties to vulture funds and other entities.  Regardless of what the witnesses might think about litigation and people testing cases in court, be they lay litigants representing themselves or legal professionals acting on their behalf, it is staggering that something like this could happen in Ireland today.  As legislators, we need to focus on the reasons for it.  Ms Walsh's two daughters are present.  They are 15 years of age.  I find it upsetting, but I cannot imagine how it has affected them and their lives.  Banks have to consider everything in the context of rights, family homes and how people are affected by the decisions that are being made.</p></speech>

It was mentioned that the 2013 figure of &euro;31 billion in non-performing loans had been reduced to &euro;9.2 billion by the first quarter of this year.  Some of that was due to repayments and write-downs.  Is there a breakdown of how the bank got from one to the other?</p></speech>

Depending on cases, between 30% and 50% could have been written down.  There may be an easier way to consider this.  We had &euro;17 billion in provisions against the &euro;31 billion.  We now have &euro;9.2 billion.  Impaired loans - the really challenging pieces - probably amounted to &euro;6.3 billion, for which we had a 44% provision, or &euro;3.4 billion.  We have used &euro;14 billion of our provisions to restructure that debt, very small amounts of which have been released back into the profit and loss account.  The majority was used to effect restructures for customers who engaged.</p></speech>

When we discuss cash recovered, we sometimes set it aside from the restructuring, but it all forms part of the one piece.  During that period, customers would have been given the opportunity to sell down properties and so on, after which cash would have flowed.  We would also have put customers on normal terms and conditions in their restructured loans, which would form part of the cash recovered category.  The reduction is either down to restructuring and the associated performance of that restructuring or debt write-off.  There are probably two large blocks to the reduction.</p></speech>

There are two parts to this.  We have been active in - we initiated it, really - our work with the Housing Agency.  Or, rather, once the agency approached us, we were one of the first out of the blocks.  We have worked successfully with the Housing Agency since the beginning of last year.  We offered 500 properties initially, of which the agency contracted approximately 180, amounting to &euro;27 million.  Following a series of phases since then, each involving approximately 250 properties, we have shared more than 1,000 properties in total with the agency.  Of our current stock, we have offered 380 properties and received acceptance for approximately 270.  We have some of those that we had offered previously but were not suitable for the agency.  We are working through the vacant property stock, primarily with the Housing Agency.</p></speech>

They were the bank's customers, but the record is fairly dismal.  The average balance is &euro;1.4 million, with 800 connections and 3,700 assets, which is approximately 4.5 assets per connection.  Will the delegation give us some idea of what was happening?  All of these people were loaned money, there were many connections and the average value is high.  I appreciate that an average is an average and there are customers with &euro;5 million, &euro;6 million or more and others with &euro;500,000 or less.</p></speech>

These are the types of cases we have been working on restructuring.  The significant drop that was required to reach our current position involved their restructuring in smaller or larger scales.  That has been successful.  The remaining cases have primarily not engaged or reached the point of a restructure.  In many instances, it has been a question of investment.  Deputy Michael McGrath referred to the concerns around trading businesses where individuals or businesses reached out and started investing in other asset classes but the core cashflow from the assets was unable to sustain the wider position.  For a long time, our solution has been to examine each case, try to dispose of the investment properties, realise where the business is in the value cycle and then try to protect the core business.</p></speech>

That activity will not stop but it will downsize significantly as we normalise.

It depends on the nature of the contractual work.  If a contractor works full-time and has been with us for a year then he or she will be included in the staff figure.  However, if a contractor moves in and out of the workplace to work on various projects then they will not be included.  Long-term the headcount is reducing.  A headcount reduction will take place in the financial solutions group.  A reduction will also take place in respect of the tracker programme but some of those positions are contractual positions.  I mean contractors are engaged to do specific work at specific points in time.  There are countervailing pieces on the other side, which is increased complexity in operations and what we do on the regulatory side.  It is not all one-way traffic in terms of headcount issues.  The Senator has referred to two situations that are true but there are other issues that act as a counterbalance.</p></speech>

Many topics are talked about openly.  On the one hand, I have described this as a good thing because we talk about everything.  On the other hand, what happens in legislative terms is practical.  That is the way I describe the situation in Ireland but investors, on average, look across big universes and they say, "That is very noisy" and they hear things.  I end up responding a lot to their general question about what is going on here by describing Ireland as a very noisy environment to calm people down.</p></speech>

I also thank the Chairman for the invitation to attend this meeting.  I am delighted to address our friends from the Allied Irish Banks, Mr. Kinsella, Mr. Byrne and Mr. O&rsquo;Keeffe.</p> <p>  I have a question for Mr. Kinsella and I want to discuss the noise comment too.  In terms of the banking sector, I agree that there is a lot of noise but the bank built up a lot of that noise with loose lending.  Let us remember that the noise relates to human stories.  A couple of girls have just left the Gallery and the Chairman raised their sad case earlier.  Unfortunately, there are many sad cases.  I wish to criticise Allied Irish Banks for its lack of engagement.  The bank has told politicians, the people and committees that it is engaging but that does not happen.  It is nigh impossible for genuine people who want to work their way out of their financial difficulties, for their sake and all of our sakes, to get a face-to-face meeting with bank officials.  These genuine people have been put through enormous stress and trauma, and ended up with ill-health.  God knows, there have been many suicides and many other devastating issues as a result.  We are all in this together and trying to work our way out of this.  I am accompanied by a couple today and I hope that Mr. O'Keeffe would give them-----</p></speech>

I ask Mr. O'Keeffe to shake hands with the couple, greet them and arrange to engage with them because they have been dangled on a string.  The situation is not all their fault because the bank has also made errors.  I call for sensitivity and engagement.  Every time a meeting has taken place they have met someone different, which is hurtful.  These people live in their homes, they are trying to keep their businesses afloat, trying to raise their children and grandchildren and look forward to retirement, in many cases, and need to be dealt with respectfully.  Describing Ireland as having a noisy environment is another issue.  The people to which I have referred need to be engaged with in a meaningful way and that is all I ask the bank to do.  I thank the Chairman for the invitation as I am not a member of this committee.</p></speech>

We do not say that every time we position ourselves that we get it right all of the time.  We have a significant number of people involved, on a permanent basis, in trying to resolve these issues and we have a lot of issues to get through.  It is our intention to engage as proactively as we can.  Sometimes we do not get it right and we are always open to examining these matters again.  Does Mr. O'Keeffe wish to comment?</p></speech>

I must be fair to the 1,500 people who work on these issues day in and day out, and many of them are watching these proceedings.  They do a great job in their engagement with customers.  We do not get the process right all the time.  Sometimes we must ensure that we use the right language and share the right information, etc. so that we can consider a matter and move it on.  Of course I will meet the people after the meeting.</p></speech>

The norm for us is 1,000 a month.  We cannot guarantee that number because it depends on a series of factors but that continues to be the run rate.  We have committed to keep all of the resources in place to make sure that we do that.  We have also said to the committee that in order to hit that target we do not envisage the disposal of a private dwelling home portfolio.  That is not part of our strategy to get to the number.  There may well be other issues, including portfolio sales of other types of assets, that we need to get to.  Fundamentally, the more engagement and restructuring, the more likely it is but I have outlined the primary choice and how to get there.</p></speech>

If we can restructure it all, then fantastic.  However, we have to work through them all on the basis of getting them ready for sale.  I cannot definitively say that to the Deputy.

The Central Banks rules are in place, which have acted as a slight brake on property price growth.  How does the bank view the market?  Is it concerned about the market?  Where does it see the market going?  I reiterate that there is a growing affordability issue for people now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-21a.841" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard Byrne" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018062100002#L03600"><p>This is one of the key topics going forward.  There are many statistics on the number of new builds floating around but let me use general numbers to demonstrate momentum.  I am sure most people would agree that 30,000 units per annum is required to have a clearing level of stock.  There will probably be about 20,000 units this year.  Again, we can argue about the numbers but we are well short.</p> <p>  The number of units are being built is growing annually.  We will get to between 23,000 and 25,000 units next year and beyond.  That will still cause a huge pent-up demand to exist because we have had a supply imbalance for a long period.  I do not know the exact number but more than 50,000 units would be a reasonable estimate of pent-up demand.</p><p>Most people agree that the pricing issues that are evidenced in the market are far more driven by the supply-demand imbalance than by any other issue at this point in time and will not be resolved by any mechanism other than supply ultimately getting ahead of demand.  We are probably two to three years away from that.  That is a guess.  Then it will have to overshoot annual demand  to meet the pent-up position.</p><p> The macroprudential rules, which we understand, are acting as a brake at this point in time.  That is appropriate because way too many properties are being sought versus the supply, so the only thing that happens is the price goes up, which is not helpful to anyone.  To the extent that the macroprudential rules are there and act as a dampener on this at this point in time, that is an understandable and good thing.  It creates capacity later on if supply tips over and exceeds demand, and pricing should come down.  Ultimately, there is still a stock of affordability that can be brought on but the measure should not be price changing all the time for it so we are supportive of the macroprudential rules being a useful mechanism to effectively prevent too much demand coming in - there is still excess demand - but even more demand coming in.</p></speech>
