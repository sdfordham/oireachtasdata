I appreciate the opportunity to make a presentation from the Department's perspective on aspects of the funding of water services.  I am accompanied by Mr. Colm Lavery and Mr. Patrick O'Sullivan, principal officers in the water division of the Department.  </p> <p>  My understanding is that at the last meeting the committee had specific questions about the overall funding position prior to the establishment of Irish Water.  I will seek to address them, as well as providing some perspectives on the overall funding of the sector to assist the committee in its consideration of the expert commission's report.  As we have provided a detailed note with historical information on capital and operational costs, as well as forecasts to 2021, which I think all members of the committee have received, I will focus in this presentation on some of the key trends and relevant issues.</p> <p>  Prior to 2014, the Department managed two capital investment programmes - the multi-annual water services investment programme, WSIP, and the rural water programme, RWP.</p><p>Over the eight-year period 2006-13, just under &euro;3.5 billion in Exchequer resources was invested in water under these programmes.  The WSIP was focused on public water services capital projects valued over &euro;1 million, while the RWP covered investment in small public water and sewerage schemes valued at under &euro;1 million, as well as the recoupment to local authorities of grants paid to the non-public water sector, mainly the group water schemes.  The Exchequer grants for public water services projects generally covered about 75% of the overall costs.  The balance was funded by local authorities from revenue from commercial water charges, capital contributions from major users, the water component of development levies and borrowings.</p><p> Under these arrangements, the overall strategic direction of the WSIP and the projects outlined therein were selected by the Department following prioritisation by local authorities.  The advancement of projects through key stages required departmental approval and grant approval was provided on a project-by-project basis, with approvals setting the split between the Exchequer and local authority funding.  The capital expenditure on public water services in 2013, including the estimated local authority contribution, was approximately &euro;319 million.  At the end of 2013 local authorities had an outstanding debt in regard to borrowing for water and wastewater projects of approximately &euro;600 million.</p><p> Prior to 2014 local authorities were wholly responsible for operational expenditure decisions and operational costs were met from non-domestic charges and local authority own resources.  The most important of these own resources was the general purpose grant provided from the local government fund, LGF.  While the general purpose grant had reflected the commitment by the State to provide funding to local authorities in respect of domestic water services following the abolition of water charges in 1997, local authorities had discretion as to how they applied the general purpose grant across expenditure lines.  Based on local authorities' annual financial statements, and adjusting for services not transferred to Irish Water, the expenditure by local authorities on the operation of public water and wastewater services was about &euro;720 million in 2013 and would have risen to &euro;732 million in 2014, allowing for network growth and adjusting for the increases in commercial rates charges, which happened in 2014.</p><p> The capital funding for Irish Water in 2014, which was provided as a capital contribution from the Minister for Finance, was set at &euro;239 million, which would have been the same as under the previous Exchequer funding arrangements of the WSIP and RWP had they remained in place.  Irish Water utilised this funding and borrowings to finance a capital programme of &euro;740 million, including metering and establishment costs in 2014.  Overall, Irish Water operational costs in 2014, including financing costs, were &euro;778 million.  This covered functions transferred from local authorities, as well as new Irish Water activities.  This expenditure was financed from non-domestic revenue, borrowings and operational subvention.  The funding from the local government fund to Irish Water was based on an estimate of the net funding which would have been provided to local authorities towards water services from general purpose grants had the function remained with them, that is, operational costs less revenue from non-domestic charges with some adjustment for expected operational savings and the cost of financing the local authority outstanding debt as this did not transfer to Irish Water.  On this basis, the subvention to Irish Water in 2014 was &euro;439 million, approximately &euro;47 million was recouped to local authorities for their water financing costs and the general purpose grant to local authorities was reduced accordingly.</p><p> Funding arrangements from 2015 onwards have reflected the commencement of economic regulation and domestic water charges.  Capital funding is provided by a capital contribution from the Minister for Finance with the balance of capital expenditure facilitated through borrowing and customer revenue.  A total of &euro;406 million in capital funding was provided in 2015 and 2016.  An amount of &euro;270 million is scheduled for 2017 and similar amounts would be expected each year to 2020 under the Irish Water business plan.  The business plan did not envisage the requirement for a contribution in 2021 on the basis that capital expenditure in that year would be met wholly by borrowing and customer revenue.</p><p> Turning to the operational side, operational subvention to Irish Water is designed to cover the costs of providing the free allowance for children, capping water charges at &euro;160 or &euro;260 per annum depending on household size and capping the unit charge at &euro;3.70 for each 1,000 litres of water supplied and wastewater removed.  Funding is also provided for working capital, which reflects the time lag between charging and receipt of revenue.  On this basis, the Irish Water business plan generally reflects an average annual subvention of &euro;467 million and average working capital of &euro;32 million between 2017 and 2021.  In 2017, &euro;475 million is to be provided in line with the business plan and this is being increased by &euro;125 million to cover the suspension of water charges provided for in the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2016.  If water charging were to remain suspended in 2017 for domestic users, a further &euro;114 million would be required, bringing the total additional funding requirement in 2017 above the business plan projection to &euro;239 million.</p><p> I want to turn to comparisons between the operational expenditure under both models.  The Irish Water business plan forecasts efficiencies in operational expenditure of &euro;1.1 billion over the period to 2021, and these will be subject to scrutiny and challenge by the CER.  As a consequence, the operational costs, excluding financing costs, will reduce from &euro;769 million in 2014 to &euro;614 million in 2021 at 2015 prices.  By comparison, if the functions had been retained by local authorities, and allowing for the upward pressure in costs from new facilities and similarly excluding financing and commercial rates costs, it is estimated that the equivalent local authority figure in 2021 would have been of the order of &euro;695 million.</p><p> A couple of points need to be borne in mind when comparing operational costs under both models.  First, the PwC independent assessment in 2011, based on engagement with local authorities, recognised that operational expenditure by local authorities was artificially constrained for budgetary reasons.  This is supported by EPA analysis which indicates that while 34% of incidents associated with licensed wastewater discharges in 2012 were for capacity issues, including the need for infrastructural improvements, 38% of incidents were due to operation and maintenance issues.  PwC estimated that approximately &euro;60 million was required to address this operational expenditure, OPEX, backlog.  Second, there are costs reflected in the Irish Water model which would not have arisen for local authorities.  These include some costs related to the set-up, such as developing new systems and so on, which are treated as operational expenditure under accounting rules but are treated as capital expenditure by the CER.  It also includes a range of activities relating to new functions, for example, customer billing and running new asset management systems, as well as new programmes such as the first-fix programme.  Many of these costs would be characterised as &ldquo;spend to save&rdquo; programmes, that is, expenditure now to deliver future efficiencies.  Third, a much higher level of performance is expected from Irish Water operations across a range of metrics, including leakage, customer service, environmental compliance and reduction in boil water notices, as Irish Water avails of economies of scale and deploys new asset management systems and standard operational approaches.  A performance assessment framework is being put in place by the CER in this regard.</p><p> Considerable capital investment was made by local authorities over the period from 2000 to 2013, particularly to build new wastewater treatment capacity.  Exchequer capital spending on public water services peaked at &euro;432 million in 2009 but declined to &euro;319 million by 2013.  By comparison, the average core capital spending under the Irish Water business plan is &euro;590 million.</p><p>However, it is not only a question of the amount of funding required, it is also a matter of ensuring that the funding model supports the most efficient delivery of services, the right investment decisions and the appropriate balance between capital investment and ongoing maintenance.  Aside from the limitations on strategic planning and economies of scale presented by a dispersed model based on 34 authorities rather than a single regulated utility, the previous funding model faced particular challenges from: the absence of a national asset management system to inform prioritisation of capital maintenance and investment; funding lines which tended to incentivise capital investment over capital maintenance; a lack of certainty on overall Exchequer funding at a programme and project level over an extended period in light of the annual Exchequer budgetary process; and delays in project implementation due to misalignment in the availability of funding from the two main sources, namely, the Exchequer and local authorities.<br/><br/>From this experience, conclusions can be drawn on the key features of an efficient funding model for the future, particularly if such a model is to support the correct investment decisions and the most efficient operations in respect of water services.  These would include: that the model should ideally provide a level of certainty of funding over a multi-annual period to ensure appropriate strategic planning and timely delivery; decisions on operations and capital investment should be integrated and made by a single authority, and the sources of funding available should not skew this decision-making process; costs and outputs should be benchmarked against best practice internationally; and the funding model is likely to require an element of cost recovery and promotion of conservation to ensure compliance with the water framework directive.  On the latter point, the Minister has recently received further correspondence from the European Commission which, <i>inter alia</i>, points to the need for the recovery of costs to ensure that the serious maintenance and investment needs of the public water and wastewater system can be met.  I am aware that the question of compliance with the water framework directive will be dealt with at a future meeting of this committee, so I will focus on the other features of the funding model today.<br/><br/>From an organisational perspective, the single public water utility, with the new asset management approaches developed by Irish Water, can address the key issues relating to appropriate project selection, achieving economies of scale and securing greater efficiency in operations.  As described by the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, and Irish Water, the regulated approach ensures that the appropriate funding requirement over a reasonable time cycle is determined in an open and transparent manner, delivering efficiencies alongside service improvements.  Generally, for a regulated water utility, when the funding requirement is settled, the revenue can be raised through charges and borrowing, with some State support.  This gives the utility the greater certainty regarding its investment plans and operational decisions.  If, however, the model is reliant mainly on State support to cover this revenue requirement rather than charges, other options need to be examined to provide a level of assurance that the business plan of Irish Water can, following regulatory review, be delivered.<br/><br/>It has to be acknowledged that funding what the expert commission termed the &quot;regulatory settlement&quot; through general taxation inevitably introduces risks of funding shortfalls or funding uncertainty because water services funding would have to be considered as part of the normal budgetary process.  Ring-fenced funding would provide greater certainty and underpin delivery of the business plan but does present challenges for the normal management of the public finances.  There are examples, such as the local property tax or the plastic bag levy, where revenues raised are directed to particular areas.  It is fair to say that the greater the link between the revenue stream and its purpose, the more certainty can be provided on the funding environment for the utility and the greater the support for long-term planning, generation of efficiencies and service improvements.<br/><br/>There are also international examples of regulated utilities where the Government provides some guidance to the utility and the regulator as to the likely funding parameters over a multi-annual process.  The recent decision on the 2017-2018 revenue control period by the CER had some component of this approach.  The business plan for Irish Water to 2021, considered by Government, set out a perspective on the likely subvention and capital requirements over the period.  As such, the Department, in its engagement with Irish Water and the CER on the 2017-18 revenue control, indicated that the business plan projections represented the outer limits of State support.  In the first revenue control period, a ministerial policy direction was issued under section 42 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 and this set some conditions for State funding.<br/><br/>The overall funding model also needs to support policy to address deficiencies in the non-public water sector.  In particular, significant capital funding is provided by the Department to the group water sector under the rural water multi-annual programme.  To ensure parity of treatment between the public water system and the group water sector, a system of operational subsidies was introduced for the group water sector from 1997.  These subsidies are paid to the schemes by local authorities, which are reimbursed in full for this expenditure from the local government fund.  The subsidies have been adjusted, following consultation with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, in light of the suspension of domestic water charges.  Approximately &euro;50 million is required on an annual basis to fund the non-public water services.<br/><br/>In summary, a stable multi-annual funding approach would underpin improvements in service and compliance by Irish Water.  In line with the Irish Water business plan, which is prepared on the basis of achieving such outcomes, an annual amount of approximately &euro;1.4 billion would be required by 2021 in order to fund the capital expenditure and operational expenditure cost of water and wastewater services not met by the non-domestic sector.  Ideally, the manner in which this is funded needs to ensure that best value for money is achieved from the existing asset base and that the correct operational and investment decisions are made to deliver the best outcomes for customers.  More detailed financial information is set out in the note we have provided for the committee and I am, of course, happy to answer any questions members may wish to pose.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-18a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McCarthy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FFJ2017011800002#G00300"><p>Mr. Hegarty is from the economic side of the Department and Mr. Culhane is with our statistical unit.  I circulated a very short presentation to members.  The first slide sets out the background, outlining the rationale for trying to classify Irish Water as off-balance sheet.  As members are familiar with this, I do not need to go into it in any great detail.  The next slide shows that in July 2015 EUROSTAT took the decision that, for various reasons - the market test, the capping of fees and so forth - Irish Water should be classified within the general Government sector.</p> <p>  It is fair to say that it is unlikely, at least in the short term, that there would be any change to that classification.  In this sense, the role of the Department of Finance is twofold: we are responsible for fiscal planning over the short and medium terms - and, to an extent, the long term also - and for taxation policy.  From a fiscal planning perspective, the revenue and receipts from Irish Water are included in our latest medium term fiscal projections which were published alongside budget 2017.  What would be the fiscal impact should a decision be made to abolish domestic water charges?  I have set out our projections on slide 5 for the general Government balance over the period 2017-2021.  The actual general Government balance includes approximately 0.1% of gross domestic product, GDP, per annum in the form of additional revenue from domestic tariffs.  Members can see what the general Government balance would be if these domestic charges were abolished.  The deficit in 2017 and 2018 would be zero percentage points worse and the surplus from 2020 and 2021 would be approximately zero percentage points of GDP lower than we have assumed.</p><p>I refer to what this means in respect of the fiscal rules, which members are aware are legally binding.  We had a referendum on this in 2012 and we have our European requirements also.  We corrected the excessive deficit and it was brought below 3% of gross domestic product, GDP, in 2015.  We moved out of the so-called corrective arm of the Stability and Growth Pact and are now in the so-called preventive arm, which operates on the principle that prevention is better than cure.</p><p> The preventive arm sets targets for both the general government deficit and for general government debt.  What does this require?  It is government policy that we eliminate the structural deficit by 2018.  That is the deficit that would apply if one removed cyclical factors on both the revenue and expenditure sides.  On the basis of the projections in the budget, we will just about achieve that by 2018.  We are also required to reduce the general government debt to GDP ratio at a sufficient pace, namely to reduce the difference between the actual debt and 60% by five percentage points per annum.</p><p> The Irish Water business plan was agreed in October 2015 by the Government and it sets out its expenditure over the period.  It, of course, requires a revenue stream to fund this.  If water charges were to be abolished, a key question from the Department's perspective is whether taxation would be the appropriate mechanism to actually fund a public utility.  We do not fund electricity or gas through taxation, even though they are public utilities.  There is also the issue of the user pays principle.  From an economic perspective - I must stress I am not going into policy which is a matter for the Government - there would be reservations about this.</p><p> What does economics tell us about the taxation impact?  If water was to be funded from general taxation, we can look at Adam Smith's kinds of taxation.  There will be a pool of taxation which might have to be increased to fund this particular revenue stream.  Which particular tax head would be targeted?  We all know taxes are distortionary and have an impact on economic activity.  The insights of the OECD, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, are relevant in this perspective.  The OECD sets out various scenarios on which taxes are the most damaging to an economy in terms of labour market impact, competitiveness and so forth.  Equity would be another consideration that would need to be borne in mind.  The incidence of the tax also needs to be considered.  Who actually pays would be crucial.  The final canon is that the overall administrative cost of tax should be low relative to the yield.  It does not make sense to introduce a tax in which administrative costs are high if the yield is relatively low.</p><p> On the ring-fencing of tax revenue for particular expenditure, what is involved is tax revenue that amounts to 0.1% of GDP.  There are questions as to whether it would be appropriate to put in place a new and potentially expensive tax infrastructure when the yield is potentially relatively low.  I use the word "relatively" importantly here.  With respect to hypothecation, in the past there has been a long-standing principle that expenditure is funded from the general tax pool.  Hypothecation would essentially mean that the hands of government are tied.  In some respect, it would not be able to remove or reallocate revenue from a particular area as new priorities develop.</p></speech>

I was not aware there has been further correspondence to the Minister from the European Commission on the water framework directive and the issue of cost recovery.  Mr. John McCarthy also referred to the issue of the user pays principle.  These were the two issues raised in the letter from the European Commission to the chair of the expert commission.  It stated that when we signed up to the wastewater directive in 2010, effectively we were covered by the directive and did not have any kind of exemption.</p> <p>  I accept we will meet the Commission and I do not want to stray into that area.  However, as it has been raised, the committee should be given whatever information there is on this correspondence to the Minister.  Is there information on whether the decisions the committee will make will have cost implications in terms of possible EU fines?  Can this information be given to the committee so we can consider it?  When we have our meeting with the European Commission, it will be less than a month away from the date on which we have to make our final decisions.  Any information that could be given to us in this regard is information we require to make our recommendations.</p> <p>  I am not an expert on fiscal matters but Mr. John McCarthy said if funding is ring-fenced, one is imposing an extra cost through collection.  Will he elaborate on that?</p></speech>

As the Chairman said, it will be made available to members.  It is a short letter which follows on from the noting that the European Commission made in its submission to the expert commission.  It pointed out some issues around the directive being a flexible instrument allowing member states a margin of appreciation but it also referred to cost recovery and the polluter pays principle.  It stated that it is therefore important that the ongoing decision-making process leads to sound and lasting results which must bring Ireland back into compliance with the directive.  It gave some views from the Commission in terms of how a fair balance might be struck.  I highlighted one of them in the presentation, which was the recovery of costs and how we must ensure that Irish Water meets the infrastructure needs.  The letter also talked about how consumption of water might be set at a normal use, a reasonable level and charging for excess use.  It went into the components of the expert commission recommendation in that regard.  That is what will be addressed at the future meeting.</p> <p>  The issue around investment in wastewater infrastructure is relevant.  The Commission, in terms of compliance with the water framework directive and charging, has a number of open infringements with us with urban wastewater compliance.  Much of the &euro;5.5 billion in the Irish Water business plan is to address that infringement and bring us into compliance in that respect.</p><p>Similarly, regarding drinking water, we have a pilot infringement which requires investment in drinking water by both Irish Water and the rural water sector.  When we talk about compliance with the directive, I take this to mean a holistic compliance.  I understand that the letter will be circulated by the committee.</p></speech>

If the Commission feels we are not in compliance, it could go to the European Court of Justice and then fines could be imposed.  Fines under this system involve both an upfront fine and daily fines.  The letter only refers to compliance, but the consequence of non-compliance with the directive is settled by the European Court of Justice.</p></speech>

The point I was trying to make is that flexibility is needed from time to time as different priorities emerge.  The Government would need to be able to reallocate resources to different priority areas, as is done at present.  Health is an example.  We must increase spending in that area at the moment, but this capacity would be reduced or curtailed if particular revenues were curtailed into a particular area.  A more general principle is the question why we do not introduce ring-fencing for many different areas in which there would then be absolutely no flexibility whatsoever for Government to reprioritise as different priorities emerge.</p></speech>

It is important for the committee to be clear that there are two separate funding issues in this discussion.  The first is water charges as a contribution to the operational costs of the utility and the impact the abolition of water charges would have on the Government's deficit and on meeting the fiscal targets.  A separate issue is water charges as part of a business model designed to take the utility off balance sheet to facilitate it to borrow in its own right and not to negatively impact the Government's debt-to-GDP ratio.  These are two separate matters that often get confused in the public debate.</p><p>My first questions are to the Department of housing.  Ms Graham mentioned the figure of &euro;239 million as being the overall cost of the abolition of water charges, but that is obviously the gross figure.  Could she confirm to the committee the net figure when the conservation grant, the cost of the billing regime, etc., are taken out?  That is the really important figure from the point of view of the deficit and fiscal targets.  She referred to the figure of &euro;50 million annually for non-public domestic water services.  Will she clarify whether that is the current cost to the State of its subvention?  If domestic water charges in the public system are to be abolished and there is to be equity, namely, if people not on the public domestic water system were not to pay anything, are there calculations of what the additional cost of that would be?  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, cited a figure of &euro;14 million in a <i>Sunday Times</i>interview at the start of the year as the estimated cost of an excess water charge, as recommended by the expert group.  Is this a calculation from Ms Graham's Department or from Irish Water, or does it come from somewhere else?</p><p>I know this is not the meeting to discuss fines and compliance, but just so people are clear, can Ms Graham outline a timeline in the case of, for example, the infringement proceedings in the urban wastewater directive?  This is an infringement proceeding that has been going on since 2012.  Some people think fines arrive immediately.  I ask the question so that people might have a sense of this.</p><p>Regarding fiscal impact, can the Department of Finance confirm the exact financial impact on the 2018 structural deficit target deadline if water charges were abolished?  Could it also confirm to the committee that this could be offset by, for example, fewer tax cuts - for example, an amendment to legislation effecting the abolition or the phasing out of the USC?  Could this cost be offset at the discretionary tax level?</p><p>Mr. McCarthy said it is unlikely Irish Water will be classified as off balance sheet in the medium term.  What does he mean by this?  The reason I ask is that in Irish Water's capital programme, its capital investment significantly increases from 2019 onwards from &euro;500 million currently to &euro;777 million and then up to about &euro;900 million.  Would this need to be off balance sheet to meet those borrowing targets, or would it allow the Government's debt reduction targets under the fiscal rules to be on balance sheet with that level of expenditure?</p><p>I have one final question about this.  Clearly, if the bulk of Irish Water's capital investment programme is borrowed - this is so under the current plan - there is an extra financing cost for that.  I have asked this a couple of times during Question Time.  I would like to know the additional cost to Irish Water or to the taxpayer from the borrowing over the eight years of the plan of the &euro;5.5 billion.  Can we have the prediction for this?</p><p>I appreciate the economic impact of the abolition of water charges, and I know this is sometimes difficult for economists but there is also a social impact of funding something through usage charges rather than general taxation.  Will the Department of Finance factor not just the straight economic impact but also the social impact into its assessments as to which is the best taxation model?</p></speech>

The year we paid the water conservation grant, we had &euro;100 million for it and then we had funding going to Irish Water.  Within Irish Water, operational expenditure reflects billing costs.  Again, I understand there would be a saving of about &euro;25 million in this regard.  Those are the figures.</p></speech>

We would include about &euro;1 million or so extra which we would use to continue to subsidise the sector.  Regarding the rural water subsidies, in the rural water sector we give operational subsidies, but each group water scheme sets its own charging regime.  We try in negotiations with the federation to get a fair subsidy that essentially reflects the circumstances at the time when there were no water charges and what would cover most of the water charges.  The group water sector either gets water from the public system and then puts it through its networks or it has its own private sources.  The subsidy in each case reflects the system used.  Private users get the higher subsidies.  The subsidies are &euro;140 per household using a private system and &euro;70 for the public system.  We reduced the subsidies when domestic water charges were introduced to &euro;95 and &euro;40, respectively.  The aim of this calculation was to bring people into parity.  We brought the subsidies back up to their previous levels of &euro;140 and &euro;70 more recently because of the suspension of charges.  These are the subsidy levels that broadly equate to those at the time when there were no domestic charges and the support the group water sector was getting.</p></speech>

This capital funding peaked at about &euro;100 million per annum.  It is now down to about &euro;18 million.  This is because we had a huge programme of works to improve the quality of the sector.  However, the group water sector also has businesses, farms and so on, which we do not pay for.  We must make an estimate working with the information we get from the federation of what would legitimately cover domestic use.</p></speech>

While I refer to an average figure per household, there are households that either use a lot of water or have a farm or use land for agriculture.

We are looking at a structural deficit of minus 0.5% in 2018.  That is on the button as to where we need to be.</p> <p>  In terms of the general government debt, all of the financing costs and so forth are included in the current projections for general government debt.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether, if water charges were eliminated, they could be compensated by another form of revenue and I think he mentioned the universal social charge.  If water charges were eliminated, under the fiscal rules that would be classified as a discretionary revenue-reducing measure in 2017 and would need to be compensated for in 2018 by some other form of discretionary revenue-raising measure.  Mr. Culhane will take the Deputy's second last question.  I just looked at the economic rather than the social impact.</p></speech>

EUROSTAT will classify a new entity at the outset based on business plans but after that it likes to see at least three years' evidence of characteristics of off or on-balance sheet activity.

We can do that in principle through using the SWITCH model, which as he probably knows allows us to look at the effects of tax and welfare changes.  It has been used by the ESRI in its analysis of budgetary packages and it has taken account of the effect of decisions on the level of water charges etc.</p></speech>

Some of my questions might cross over others asked already.  Ms Graham mentioned that the water debt from the local authorities did not transfer over to Irish Water.  Could she outline the amount involved, who picks up the tab for that or where is that taken care of as and from now?</p> <p>  I refer to the comparison in terms of the operational expenditure.  Is it fair to say that by 2021, the establishment of Irish Water will have brought about savings of approximately &euro;400 million, if we look at the figures of &euro;1.1 billion and &euro;695 million in those first few years?</p> <p>  The regulator was before the committee last week.  When we consider the level of pressure and scrutiny it is putting on Irish Water to bring about further savings and efficiencies in the coming years, is it fair to say that a comparable level of pressure was not put on the local authority system to be as efficient during that time or was there always pressure on the local authorities to try to do the best they could in that regard?  How do they compare?</p> <p>  In terms of the figures, to be clear, the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is saying that if there are no water charges in 2017, &euro;114 million of Exchequer resources will be required.  Does the Department of Finance agree with that figure?  Is there clarity on that?</p> <p> How was Irish Water funded in 2016?  In particular, I would like to see the comparison between the first six months, when charges were in place, and the second six months.  In terms of the Exchequer, where did the money come from for that?  Ms Graham referenced &euro;50 million to fund non-public water services.  Is that &euro;50 million part of the &euro;114 million or is it in addition to it?</p> <p>  This question is specifically for the Department of Finance.  If we move away from a charging mechanism, ring fencing will be a key area for us as a committee.  One of the main advantages of having a charging mechanism was that we had a dedicated pot of money for investing to ensure we all had treated water to drink, that we put an end to raw sewage flowing into our rivers and that we were able to fix the many wastewater problems.  Without some type of ring fencing of a pot of money for water and wastewater services, my fear is that we will go back to the mistakes of the past where Government decided that the hospital and the school would always win over pipes in the ground that are not visible to the public.  I am concerned that we may go back to a process of not investing enough in our system.  Would Mr. McCarthy accept that the mistake made in the past was that when that pressure came on in difficult financial circumstances, decisions were made to not invest as much as should have been invested in water and wastewater services?  As a committee, that will be key to us in terms of any recommendations we make to the Oireachtas because we must ensure those mistakes are not made again.  If we move away from charges that would have brought in a pot of money that could have been used to invest directly in those services and without ring fencing of some type, we will have a difficulty in getting an assurance that the work Irish Water needs to do in the coming years from a conservation and quality water perspective can be done because the resources may not be made available by future Governments.</p></speech>

The decision was made that rather than transfer that to Irish Water, we would continue to finance it through the local government fund.  About &euro;450 million of that was with the Housing Finance Agency and &euro;150 million with commercial lenders.  The funding from the Housing Finance Agency was raised by the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, so it was wound back into the NTMA, which is looking after that.  We are continuing to give resources on an annual basis to local authorities on the commercial debt still outstanding as that is wound down.  It comes out of the local government fund.</p> <p>  In terms of the operational savings, the business plan for Irish Water is &euro;1.1 billion over the period of the plan to 2021.  That is what it has said it can achieve, and it is held to account for that by the regulator, who may look for further savings beyond that.</p> <p>  The key feature in comparing the local authority system and the Irish Water system is that the regulator is looking over a multi-annual period whereas local authorities have operational budgets set by whatever financing they have on a year-by-year basis.  The regulator is benchmarking, by international standards, to determine where operational costs should go over a period of time.  It is a different perspective and a different way of going about it whereas a local authority, and some members of the committee may have been members of authorities, is dealing with a budget and what it has to do on a year-by-year basis.  That is one of the key features.</p> <p>  In the note we gave members they will see that the operational spending in the years immediately prior to moving to Irish Water remained fairly steady even though there would have been pressure from new facilities coming on-stream.  That reflects the fact that money was not going into capital maintenance.  That is what the PricewaterhouseCoopers report I mentioned was referring to.</p> <p>  In terms of the rural water programme, the &euro;114 million I mentioned is purely Irish Water.  It is the extra funding we would have to give in this year.  With regard to the &euro;50 million I referred to, the subsidies to the rural water sector are approximately &euro;24 million in 2017 and the rural water programme is of the order of &euro;18 million.  I was saying that in rough terms, between capital and current spending, we are talking about &euro;50 million, but that is separate from the Irish Water funding.</p> <p>  In terms of how Irish Water was funded in 2016, we set out in our note at page 4 a table on the current funding.  There is a subvention of &euro;479 million.  It got extra funding of &euro;123 million to cover the suspension of domestic charges and it had working capital of &euro;51 million but in the case of 2016, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin pointed out, funding would have been allocated originally for the water conservation grant, which did not have to be used in that year.  That was how the funding was provided.  The capital contribution in 2016 was &euro;184 million.</p></speech>

They are broadly similar but they will never be exactly the same for statistical reasons, which is the way EUROSTAT and ourselves can calculate the figures.  I accept the point on the need for prioritisation of water infrastructure.  However, as I said earlier to Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, ring fencing reduces the degrees of freedom for the Government.  Priorities will obviously change over time and I would argue that the Government needs to retain that flexibility as priorities change, which they inevitably will.</p><p> I want to come back to a point raised by Deputy &Oacute; Broin, when I talked about a discretionary revenue reduction in 2017 and a discretionary revenue increase in 2018.  I wanted to stress the point that it is purely from a fiscal rules perspective.</p></speech>

A lot of the presentation I have heard seems to be a justification for the existence of Irish Water, which we are not discussing at all.</p> <p>  The expert committee appeared to recommend that there should be absolute equity between people who are getting their water supply through group water schemes and those who get it from the public mains.  Has Mr. McCarthy calculated how much of a subsidy would be necessary for the group water supply schemes to bring that about?  </p> <p>  In reply to Deputy &Oacute; Broin, I think Mr. McCarthy said the loss of &euro;125 million to the Exchequer from abolishing water charges included the abolition of the water conservation grant.  What rate of compliance is that based on?  Is it 90%, 95% or the 50% to 55% rate of compliance we have had?  In arriving at that figure, is Mr. McCarthy counting in the cost of repaying the borrowings that Irish Water incurs, which I understand is very high?  </p> <p>  On page 6 of Mr. McCarthy's presentation he seems to suggest that ring fencing would be more necessary if the model was entirely reliant on State support than if it was reliant on charges plus some State support.  What is the logic of that?  Is Mr. McCarthy suggesting that if it was not totally reliant on State support and if there were charges, then it would be more certain because the charges could be increased to meet the requirements in any particular year?  If Mr. McCarthy is talking about this in the context of capped charges, it does not make any sense to me.</p> <p>  What is Irish Water's capacity to borrow now?  Can it borrow and, if so, at what sort of rates?  We are told that Ervia has prepared a report on future funding models.  I am fascinated by the prospect of seeing what will be in that report.  Is it completed and available?  If so, can we have a copy of it?</p> <p>  Mr. McCarthy indicated that he did not agree that direct taxation was the correct way to fund a model such as Irish Water.  He cited electricity and gas companies but with all due respect, that is a matter of policy.  He said that policy was not his remit.  When governments are looking at various things they must take into account matters other than the purely economic implications.</p> <p>  I would like Mr. McCarthy to elaborate on one point he made.  He mentioned that one of the principles of taxation was that if it cost too much to raise, it was not a particularly efficient form of taxation.  Is what has been happening here not a textbook example of that?  There are billing systems, interest payments on borrowings and water conservation grants but they are hardly worth the candle.  We are still not absolutely clear what the net cost to the Exchequer would be if we were to abolish water charges.</p></speech>

As regards parity with the rural water sector, the subsidies would be of the order of &euro;24 million or &euro;25 million per annum.  That relates back to our past experience when water charges were not in place.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Dea referred to the comments set out in page 6.  To be clear, what I intended from the comments pertained to the delivery of the Irish Water business plan.  If the objective is to deliver the investment and operational efficiencies in the plan, the question is how is it funded.  If there are charges like other utilities, that gives the greatest range of certainty to the utility itself.  It was not a commentary on a policy.  It was simply saying that from a utility perspective, if most of its money is coming from its customers, it is doing the projections on customer revenue and applying it to its operations.</p></speech>

The secondary point was that if there were no charges, then the choice appears to be general taxation or ring fencing.  Mr. McCarthy has teased out some of the issues with both those approaches.  In other words, ring fencing means that some form of taxation is particularly earmarked for that water investment.  It would give greater certainty to the utility but my colleague has set out some of the issues from a broader public finance perspective.  It is simply saying that there seem to be different ways of approaching it and is asking, if one wants to fund the same money, from where does the money come.</p> <p>  As regards borrowing by Irish Water, to date, ministerial consent has been given for an amount of &euro;810 million with various commercial banks.  We understand that the weighted average margin on these facilities is of the order of 1.5%.  Last year, NewERA did a report for the relevant Ministers looking at - in the context in which we now find ourselves - the most sensible way for borrowing by Irish Water to arise.  Should it continue to be through commercial banks?  The original plan would have been to start with short-term facilities, because they were working off-balance sheet and then to move to cheaper long-term facilities.  </p> <p>  As my colleague said, in the short term, even under some element of water charging, the decision of EUROSTAT was on-balance-sheet and is unlikely to be reviewed in the near term.  What is the best way, therefore, of funding that borrowing?  NewERA has completed that report, which contains considerable commercial information.  We are redacting that out with a view to having the report available to the committee by the end of the week.  We will send that on.  In teasing out the options, the question is: what is the cost of borrowing through a commercial lender and what would be the cost if the State took on that borrowing?  The conclusion was that we would move to State funding.  </p> <p>  By the end of the business plan, one is talking of debt in the order of &euro;3 billion, in terms of where it is coming from.  Ultimately, however, all of the Irish Water capital expenditure, CAPEX, and operational expenditure, OPEX, as well as the debt, is reflected in Government debt and on the Government balance sheet.</p></speech>

The points I made about compliance costs were in respect of taxation, not charges, particularly water charges.  On compliance - I would need to check this with the Central Statistics Office - on the basis of EUROSTAT's requirements, we were required to set a compliance rate in the range of 50% from 2016.  I do not know when it will get to 100%, but that is an issue the committee might raise with the Central Statistics Office.</p></speech>

Obviously in our forecasts for 2017 which we produced on a general Government debt basis we adjusted the figure for Irish Water for accruals downwards to take account of the compliance rate.  We estimated the figure as we did not know what the compliance rate would be in the years 2017 to 2020.  We made an adjustment to our numbers in our budget calculations for the rate of non-compliance.</p></speech>

I will address my questions to Ms Graham.  In her comments on proving compliance with a directive she said the burden of proof was on the member state concerned.  That seems to be completely inaccurate.  In the European Court of Justice <i>v</i>. Greece, C 600/12, the court reiterated that, according to case law on the burden of proof in infringement proceedings under Article 258 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, it was for the European Commission to establish an alleged breach.  Will Ms Graham correct her remarks and tell us from where she obtained the information that the reverse was the case, as according to the European Court of Justice, it is the court that decides, not the Commission, on whether there has been a breach.</p><p>My second question relates to the financing costs.  According to the document, they will balloon over time, with the result that by 2021, &euro;73 million will have been spent, including interest on loans.  According to Ervia, as indicated last week, it is charged a higher rate of interest than would be the case if the State had borrowed directly.  By 2021, &euro;1 in every &euro;10 spent by Irish Water will be spent in meeting financing costs.  If we were to return to the water billing model, over &euro;1 in every &euro;4 raised by Irish Water in water charges would be spent in meeting financing costs.  When one considers that the off balance sheet model is no more, at least in the medium term, why borrow at rates higher than those at which the State can borrow directly?  There seems to be no benefit, only additional costs.  Linked with this, the loans are probably secured on the assets of Irish Water.  I presume if the loans were not repaid, the security could be called in.  That was the model of privatisation which led to disaster in Detroit where there was an attempt to provide for off balance sheet funding of services, with the result that $1 in every $2 raised by Detroit Water went directly to pay the bondholders.</p><p>My third question relates to group water schemes.  It is correct to say that in February 2015 the group water scheme subsidy was cut from the maximum figure of &euro;140 to &euro;95 per house and that it was restored following the suspension of water charges.  Therefore, instead of there being a division between Irish Water and group water schemes, it is fair to say that with the forced suspension of water charges those involved in group water schemes also benefited and there is no division between the two groups.</p><p>I have a question on EUROSTAT for Mr. McCarthy.  I have the report from EUROSTAT and also a description of the European system of accounts.  One of the elements is that sellers act to maximise their profits in the long term to qualify for off balance sheet accounting.  A particular criticism was made about the lack of economically significant prices.  Is it fair to say that according to EUROSTAT, in order to qualify for off balance sheet accounting, in reality it means an increase in water charges?</p></speech>

What I meant by the reference was that if infringement proceedings were to be initiated against Ireland, we would have to demonstrate how we were in compliance.  Let us take the case with which we are most familiar - the infringement proceedings against Ireland under the urban wastewater treatment directive.  We must demonstrate to the European Commission how we will come back into compliance with the directive by indicating investment on a project by project basis for each of the agglomerations.  We are reporting on the progress we are making a six-monthly basis, or if we were to fail to make sufficient progress, it would mean being referred to the European Court of Justice which would make a judgment.  Obviously, before the case would go to court, the Commission would make its views known as guardian of the treaties and we would defend the State's position, but the court would decide.</p></speech>

I am simply outlining my practical experience in dealing with an infringement case.  When a case is taken against Ireland, we have to demonstrate compliance with a directive.  I accept that in a legal sense when we go to court, we are defending the case.  While that is the position, in practical terms - this is borne out by our experience, in the case of septic tanks, of having fines applied under the urban wastewater directive when we defended a case involving infringements of the directive in respect of drinking water, the State spends a great deal of time in presenting lots of data to the European Commission to demonstrate how we are in compliance.</p></speech>

In the findings, the issue was that the massive investment in Irish Water did not seem to relate to the price charged for the products.  It did not appear commercial from Irish Water's perspective.  As a result of the cap, there was no incentive for users to turn off the tap so it did not seem to influence their behaviour either.  Those were the findings.</p></speech>

I am always intrigued when outrage and indignation are expressed when newspapers, etc., print headlines indicating that our motor tax will fund Irish Water and, by extension, the provision of water.  May I take it from the presentation that the moneys collected for motor tax in this country have always gone towards the supply of treated water to and collection of wastewater from households in Ireland?</p></speech>

I thank the witness for clarifying the position.</p> <p>  Mr. McCarthy introduced a wonderful word, "hypothecation", that I have never come across before.  I will again stick with the motor tax issue.  I understand the point made that if we introduce hypothecation into the finance system, we would ring-fence for water first before ring-fencing for health, education and so on.  Eventually, there would be no wriggle room for decision makers such as ourselves to move on.  Would the witness be against hypothecation on motor tax, for example, being ring-fenced for the upkeep and repair of roads?  There is a reason for asking this as it is related to the topic I wish discuss.</p></speech>

One of the expert commission recommendations is that we should fund personal and normal domestic use from general taxation.  I have specific questions.  The new word "hypothecation" will become very relevant and I thank the Department of Finance for outlining what it means.  We must be sensitive about the policy areas relating to Government but it is definitely the elephant in the room.  We have two choices.  We need a dedicated revenue stream if we are to provide a sustainable supply of water to meet what the expert commission is recommending to us.  That is an adequate allowance for personal domestic users.  How do we provide that dedicated revenue stream?  Do we provide it through the charging system that was in existence or by ring-fencing funding.  The committee would set a precedent by recommending that as it would automatically recommend that policy decisions would be decided by committee rather than the Government.  Am I correct in assuming that as a result of what the Department has outlined?  If that is the case, why are there no similar joint Oireachtas committees for health, education and various other sectors, including housing, that see critical demand but are not achieving the same focus or attention from officials and policymakers like ourselves?</p> <p>  Acceptable level of usage will be critical to our deliberations.  It is recommended by the expert commission that there would be a free allowance to an acceptable level of usage.  Figures have been provided by the housing Department but in Ms Graham's view, what is an acceptable level of usage and is adequate funding provided in the business plan as outlined?  That would include funding to deal with quality of water, compliance obligations and asset management systems to ensure sustainability of supply.  I presume this is allowed for in the business plan.  How does that equate to the acceptable level of usage model now proposed by the expert commission?  This must be determined by recommendation by the Commission for Energy Regulation and the public water forum but I am interested to hear the Department's view because of its experience in the area.  What is the effect in terms of cost and being able to sustain that type of system?</p> <p>  My next question is important and some members have already raised the issue.  It relates to equity and fairness.</p><p>Group water schemes have already been mentioned.  The costs in providing equality of access to quality water for people on a public system and those on a group water system have not been properly analysed.  The figures being quoted so far at this committee are essentially going back to what the subsidy being provided prior to water charges was.  Even with that subsidy, people on group water schemes were paying substantial fees to maintain their systems.  If I am right in understanding what the expert commission is recommending, a normal acceptable allowance would be free to public consumers.  By comparison and for the sake of equity, that normal acceptable allowance should also apply to those people on group water schemes.  Has that analysis been done?  There is a critical difference.  If a free allowance is applied to a public user, that same allowance should be applied to a person on a group water scheme.  That then obviously brings greater costs in terms of subsidy to ensure quality and sustainability of supply to people on group water schemes.</p><p> I hope I have made that clear.  We have two systems of supply in this country: people who supply themselves either through group water schemes or private wells and people who are on the public system.  A greater subsidy will be required to ensure that people providing water for themselves or through group water schemes have equal treatment to those who are not going to be charged under the public system if what was proposed by the expert commission goes ahead.  I hope I am clear on that.  If we are going to call a spade a spade, as Deputy Cowen said earlier on, this is going to come down to a revenue stream of funding either by charging or by ring-fencing, which would be a precedent, in my opinion, for the way in which budgetary allocations are made by a Government.  If the committee is going to decide that the funding will be ring-fenced, why would that not apply across the board in other critical sectors?</p></speech>

That is reflected in the business plan.  Obviously, the funding reflects the total use of water and the question then arises as to what an acceptable level of usage would be.  The Department has not prepared anything at this stage on what our view would be on that.  The Senator mentioned CER and the public water forum having a role, as the expert commission suggested.  In looking at other utilities in which there have been water charges for some time, there are people who are low, medium and high users.  A normal usage is something that reflects a good and proper conservative usage of water.  What the margins might be above the average usage that would reflect a normal level is something that will need to be tested.  I know that Irish Water has provided consumption figures.  From a Department perspective, as the committee's work evolves, if it has scenarios that it wants the Department to cost with Irish Water, we would be very happy to do that.</p></speech>

I expected that reply, because we have not determined what an acceptable level of usage is.  It will be critical to our committee's work.  As a result of that, the CER or the public forum will help us to find it.  Therefore, the cost that the Department is providing to the committee today could in fact be greater, depending on what the definition of this acceptable level of usage is.  It could be greater than what the Department allowed for in its previous business plan.  Am I right in saying that?</p></speech>

In gross terms, the business plan delivers the gross cost.  How that is funded is a separate issue.  It covers all usage, including waste usage.  The business plan and the figures within it are correct.  The figures I have provided on the costs of water services are the outer limits in the sense that they do not have an estimate of what a revenue coming from excessive usage might be.  However, as I said, we can run two scenarios if the committee wishes.</p> <p>  As mentioned earlier, there are people who are paying for water in the rural water sector.  Some of that is because of agricultural use.  When we reduced the subsidy when domestic water charges came in, we were trying to ensure there was fair treatment.  We were trying to see what the impact was.  We did some work with the federation to get some ideas on what was the average cost being borne by people in order that the average cost to the group water sector was similar to the average cost borne by the Irish Water customer.  When we were talking to the federation, one of the approaches was to set out the principles by which we would try to get a subsidy system that was amenable to it, given that there is a range of group water schemes that are not under Irish Water and are not big systems.  We were trying to bring in a subsidy that reflected the fact that there were capped charges, free allowances for children and a product subsidy.  I can pass these on to the committee.  The principles underpinning the subsidy were to ensure there was fair treatment between drinking water consumers in the public and group sectors, taking into account the inherent differences in the structure, funding and organisation between the sectors, including the ability of individual schemes to set the price of water based on their local circumstances.  There had to be a recognition of their particular cost structures, particularly as some of them have had expensive design, build and operate schemes put in for which we would have to continue to recoup local authorities on subsidy claims.  Subsidy had to be tied to things like customer charters, compliance, optimal management and operational practice and the receipt of capital grants.  The arrangements had to be as straightforward as possible to reflect the scale of the sector.  It was important for the federation that, whatever the arrangements made, they were not too much of an administrative burden.</p></speech>

I would ask that not only those on group water schemes but also those with private wells and private water treatment systems are included in that analysis.  It is part of the recommended report provided to the committee by the expert commission that we have been tasked with analysing.  I accept the Chair's ruling.  I believe there is a body of work to be done on analysing equity and fairness in terms of the private wells and the group water schemes, what they cost and how they should be subsidised to ensure that everybody is treated equally.</p></speech>

It had a budget of &euro;614 million, including VAT.  There is going to be an underspend of around &euro;148 million on that because the full level of water metering cannot be undertaken due to a number of reasons.  The re-profiling of this underspend was confirmed by the Minister in July of last year.  Has the Department considered the reprofiling of this &euro;148 million capital underspend on water metering and diverting that towards the capital investment on the network?</p></speech>

The full cost of the metering programme was reflected in the &euro;5.5 billion.  Irish Water indicated to us that there was going to be a saving on that.  One of the suggestions for the use of that saving was for capital investment to support housing and water services that are required for housing, given the current priorities in the housing sector.  The actual re-prioritisation of that is a matter for the regulator and for Irish Water.  It has been reprofiled by Irish Water back into its capital programme and will be reflected, as I understand it, in the 2017 or 2018-----</p></speech>

I refer to the fuzzy area regarding the transfer of assets from local authorities to Irish Water.  I ask them to supply me with a detailed paper on the transfer of assets from local authorities to Irish Water that includes the timeline, ownership and value of assets.</p><p>I wish to refer the officials from the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government to their presentation and the heading of expenditure on water services and funding arrangements.  It reads:</p><blockquote>Prior to 2014 ...  The Exchequer grants for public water services projects generally covered about 75% of the overall costs.  The balance was funded by local authorities from revenue from commercial water charges, capital contributions from major users.</blockquote> <p>The capital contributions were made by major users.  They paid commercial water rates and also made a capital contribution to infrastructure.  Is that correct?  Please provide more detail about the matter.  Is the arrangement still in place with Irish Water whereby major infrastructural projects are paid for by major users?  The obvious ones that spring to mind are the drinks, IT and pharma industries.  Do those industries still contribute to the cost of capital projects?  </p><p>The water component was mentioned.  My question is in the context of the arrangements that existed prior to 2014 and the 25% that was not covered by Exchequer funds.  The presentation mentioned &quot;the water component of development levies.&quot;  What has changed as there is some anecdotal evidence?  I refer to new connections.  Under the old system, when the local authorities handled this service, was there a separate connection fee for water?  Was the fee incorporated in the development levy?  Is the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government happy with the situation?  Has the Department monitored and seen evidence of a significant increase in connection costs since Irish Water assumed this responsibility?  </p><p>Both sets of departmental officials can respond to my questions on the environment.  Will the cessation of water metering damage the borrowing capacity of Irish Water?  If the State becomes the sole customer of domestic water tariffs then is it feasible for Irish Water or its parent company, Ervia, to borrow on the markets?</p></speech>

CER has initiated a project that will examine how connection charges and commercial charges should be developed under Irish Water.  That work will continue over the next year and a half via public consultation.  From 1 January 2014 whatever a local authority charged for commercial usage became the same for Irish Water.</p> <p>  Some authorities had separate connection charges but the bulk of development levies reflected the capital spending by the local authorities on a range of infrastructure, including water.  The water piece was extracted.  For example, if the development charge per house was &euro;10,000 then maybe &euro;2,000 was taken out of the total sum for water and paid to Irish Water and the remaining &euro;8,000 was deemed the development charge.  The situation has remained exactly the same.  That means capital contributions could be made by major users.  This mainly happens in the industries outlined by the Deputy where, perhaps, a trunk main needs to be installed in order for a factory to connect with a public system.  Such work would have been charged to the user.  The user may also have a reduced operational charge.  There was a combination of charges.     </p></speech>

The user may receive a lower rate than other users in terms of the commercial rate.  There have been instances around the country where a major user has funded essential infrastructure that was provided by the local authority.</p> <p>  I have outlined the current system.  Under the normal utility model used by Irish Water that would move to a connection charge and a system of non-domestic charges.  As I understand it from CER, the process will take time.</p> <p>  There is no connection between the cessation of metering and borrowing capacity.  Borrowing is unsecured lending.  It is based on the amount of borrowing that Irish Water wishes to raise and the fact that it will have an income, from whatever source, to fund same.  That is not an issue.    </p></speech>

It has been suggested that we must meet these fiscal rules.</p><p>I know that this is a policy matter, but it is a possibility that these rules could be breached by the Government, because they have been breached by other countries, and they are being breached by some other countries as we speak.  On the other side of that, in his Budget Statement, the Minister suggested that not only was he going to meet the fiscal rules target of the 60% debt-GDP ratio, but that he was going to go to 45% of that.  If the Minister was to forgo doing that, there would surely be considerable leeway for the State to fund water and wastewater services.  If he was to go to a 45% debt-GDP ratio it would take something like &euro;38 billion out of the economy.  </p><p> Non-domestic or commercial charges were raised in both contributions.  What is the current rate of collection of commercial water charges?  Mr. McCarthy spoke about the relatively low yield and the question of administrative costs and billing systems in that regard.  We were told last week that the billing system costs Irish Water &euro;25 million.  We were also told in that presentation that the excessive charge would not provide significant revenue.  Would Mr. McCarthy have any views or thoughts on that kind of a situation?  It seems to me that it does not make sense. </p></speech>

I only have one sentence on the four or five questions.  I believe my colleagues in the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government can help with the last one.  On the fiscal rules, fines are automatic if they are breached, we have put that in legislation.  No country has yet been fined, I will grant the Deputy that, but we do have automatic correction mechanisms whereby the Commission and the Council of the European Union can instruct a state to take corrective action if it deviates from the adjustment path.  We have put that in our own Constitution via the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012.</p> <p>  I mentioned the relatively low yield.  I stress the word "relatively", obviously &euro;250 million odd is a lot of money, but the total tax take this year will be approximately &euro;50 billion. That is the sort of "relative" I wanted to put on that.  The 45% ratio the Deputy raised is policy so I will not comment, but I will say it is not a legal obligation.  The Minister in his budget speech simply said that given the volatility of our GDP, and we had the 26% in 2015 and the Irish economy is so volatile, that it made sense to build up significant fiscal buffers to be able to address the next shock.  We all know shocks will happen, it is just a matter of where they emanate from and the magnitude of the shock.  In terms of compliance and connections my colleague, Ms Graham, will respond.</p></speech>

Regarding borrowing, we will give a paper to the committee by the end of the week, the NewERA report, which will set out the issues around State versus commercial borrowing.  To clarify, I mentioned earlier that there was &euro;800 million in borrowing, that was from commercial banks.  I had not added in funding from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund which is &euro;450 million.  I just want to be clear on the level of funding at the moment.  That will answer that question.  We will get that to the committee as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  I do not have with me the non-domestic compliance rates.  I will get that for the committee but it would be much higher than what was reached in domestic sector compliance.  It would have been expected to increase over the period of time.

I will focus particularly on one thing, namely, the funding of water.  I presume it is the documentation, but can Ms Graham give me the figure?  If the State becomes the sole customer of Irish Water, what will the State's bill for becoming the sole customer be?  That to me is the key figure.  There can be all types of arguments about what is net this, net that, taking out grants and taking out this, that and the other, but if the State becomes the sole customer, the State will have a bill.   At the end of the day, unless I am misinterpreting somewhere along the line, if we pay that bill as a water charge, that means the State does not have that money to spend on other services, teachers, doctors, hospitals or whatever.  We make a choice.  If the State becomes the sole customer, can Ms Graham tell me what its bill would be per year?</p></speech>

There is an appendix at the back of the note which we gave to members, which we were asked to prepare by the committee, which sets out costs on a year-by-year basis.  If we look from 2017 onwards the total cost of water services rises from &euro;1.4 billion to &euro;1.665 billion.  That includes the non-domestic sector.  If one takes something between &euro;250 million and &euro;300 million off that as non-domestic sector, then that is the total for the domestic sector.  That does not take into account what the views of this committee will be and how it might move in terms of revenue from excessive usage, which would reduce that further.  Effectively, that is increasing because the investment programme for Irish Water is increasing, but in 2017 those baseline costs are in the Government expenditure.</p></speech>

Where the funding would come through to voted expenditure and capital contributions, is something different.  The revenue that would have been scheduled for the domestic sector, which is the replacement revenue that we are looking at, is somewhere around &euro;270 million.  It is important to understand that is not just going against operational expenditure.  In the model as set out in the business plan, that &euro;270 million in revenue was being used to pay for the financing costs of some of the investment programmes.  It was not just going against operational costs.</p></speech>

It is proposed that the officials from the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government be invited to attend a meeting with the committee to brief members on the detail of the proposal and in particular, to address any concerns the Department may have.  It is also proposed that this proposal and the decision taken today by the committee be sent to the Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment for its information.  Is that agreed?

They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her or it identifiable.  The opening statements submitted to the committee will be published on its website after the meeting.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I wish all the members a happy new year and welcome back to our first meeting of the year.  I also welcome the Department here today.  I invite Mr. McCarthy to make his presentation.</p></speech>

At the outset, as it is our first engagement in 2017, I join the Chair in her new year's wishes to everybody on the committee from myself and the team.</p> <p>  I might start by introducing the team here with me today.  I am accompanied by Mr. David Walsh, who is the assistant secretary in charge of planning housing market policy and land management, along with his colleague, Mr. Barry Quinlan, who co-ordinates our overall implementation of Rebuilding Ireland.</p><p>Mary Hurley is the assistant secretary who leads on the Department's housing programme delivery division and Bairbre Nic Aongusa is the assistant secretary who leads on our social housing policy, including homelessness and rental policy, division.  </p><p> I think it is welcome that progress under Rebuilding Ireland is being discussed here at this committee.  The session today is one in a series of interactions between the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, the Department and the committee.  These meetings provide an important opportunity to update and inform the committee of key developments and progress and for us in the Department to receive feedback from committee members.</p><p> The focus of today's meeting is the first quarterly progress report under Rebuilding Ireland, published on 1 November 2016.  That report charted the progress made on relevant actions since the Rebuilding Ireland plan was published on 19 July.  It is the first in what will be a series of reports that will be published on a quarterly basis and we are currently working on the second quarterly report covering the fourth quarter of 2016.  The intention is to finalise and present the fourth quarter progress report to the Cabinet committee on housing at the end of this month with a view to publication thereafter.  </p><p> Initially, as members are aware, Rebuilding Ireland contained 84 actions across five key pillars of activity for implementation not just by our Department but also by a range of other Departments and agencies, and of course local authorities.  One key action for delivery in quarter four last year was the publication of a new strategy for the rental sector and that was indeed finalised and published last month.  As members will be aware, the necessary associated legislation was considered by the Oireachtas before the Christmas recess.  Progress on implementing the 29 actions contained in the rental strategy in future will be incorporated into the quarterly reporting under Rebuilding Ireland generally and all the progress reports and up-to-date information will continue to be made available on the dedicated Rebuilding Ireland website.  </p><p> Since the publication of Rebuilding Ireland, our attention has been firmly focused on delivery.  Implementation of Rebuilding Ireland is being advanced across a number of Departments, as I have said, and is being taken forward under the oversight of the Cabinet committee on housing, chaired by An Taoiseach.  Within our own Department, an implementation board of senior officials, chaired by myself and including my colleagues here today and other key senior officials, monitors progress on a fortnightly basis.  In addition, an oversight group and a project board with a broader representation of delivery agents and stakeholders have been established.  Working group structures under each of the action plan's five pillars have also been put in place.  It is also planned to continue to hold regular, broadly based stakeholder forums on housing and homelessness, such as those events that were arranged to date in devising Rebuilding Ireland, and the strategy for the rental sector.  These will provide a valuable means of feedback on the practical experience of implementation and will help to inform future policy formulation.  </p><p> Subject to the agreement of the committee, I now plan to briefly cover the key issues and progress made under each pillar.  Generally I will cover the progress reported in the quarter three report, and where possible I will update the committee on progress made since then.  I will address the strategy for the rental sector under pillar 4.</p><p> Pillar one addresses homelessness.  It is the top priority under Rebuilding Ireland, to be achieved through the delivery of the 21 cross-cutting actions outlined in pillar 1, and the priority associated with this is demonstrated by the extent to which the actions are front-loaded.  Homelessness, as we all know, is a complex area of social policy that requires close co-operation across a number of Departments and agencies and this is reflected in the pillar one actions.  While the key objective of pillar 1 is to move individuals and families out of emergency temporary accommodation, there are also important actions to keep people in their homes.  While all efforts are being made to address homelessness, we must recognise the reality of the situation as outlined in the monthly statistics, which have shown increases since June in overall terms.  Based on details collected from housing authorities in November 2016, a total of 4,436 adults used State-funded emergency accommodation nationally during the survey week.  However, while there have been recent increases in homeless presentations, it is important to note that much is being done to address homelessness and to secure sustainable tenancies for homeless households.  For example, during the first nine months of 2016, housing authorities assisted over 2,000 sustainable exits from homelessness, that is, into independent social housing or supported private rented tenancies.  It is expected that a total of 2,700 sustainable exits will have been achieved during 2016 as a whole.  This is a record level of exits from homelessness in this timeframe and it demonstrates the significant efforts of local authorities to help find more sustainable accommodation solutions.  </p><p> Despite this record level of activity, the fact that there has continued to be a net increase in homelessness highlights the imperative of achieving timely and full implementation of the range of actions provided for across the pillars of Rebuilding Ireland in order to achieve the necessary increase in supply of housing in general and social housing in particular.  </p><p> The following key achievements will have a significant impact.  Strong progress has been made on the housing assistance payment, HAP, homeless pilot in Dublin.  The final figure for 2016 will be published in the quarter four report.  However, it is clear at this stage that the target to provide 550 stable and supported housing tenancies for long-term homeless households was significantly exceeded.  The HAP scheme for homeless households represents an important new tool to assist in breaking the cycle of homelessness for individuals and families, reducing long-term reliance on emergency accommodation.</p><p> Abhaile, the new national mortgage arrears resolution service, and the associated scheme of aid and advice for borrowers in mortgage arrears, was launched by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Social Protection.  There also has been a focus on the provision of further family and child welfare supports for homeless families such as home-school community liaison services, through education welfare officers and Tusla's work on school completion programmes and so on.  The Housing Agency's &euro;70 million rolling fund to purchase vacant properties from banks and investment companies has been established with a target of 1,600 units to be acquired.  One of the key targets under pillar one is to end the use of commercial hotels as emergency accommodation for homeless families by the middle of 2017 except in limited exceptional circumstances.  In addition to the homeless HAP scheme, which I mentioned earlier, the key element of achieving this target will be the provision of 1,500 rapid delivery homes by the end of 2018.  The Office of Government Procurement's rapid delivery framework is now in place and this will be an important tool that will allow local authorities to accelerate delivery in the months ahead.  </p><p> Under pillar 2, the target is clear, involving the delivery of an additional 47,000 social housing homes over the period to 2021.  An overall budget of &euro;5.35 billion has been earmarked for this purpose.  These homes are being delivered by local authorities and approved housing bodies through a number of different mechanisms including construction, repair and renewal of existing housing, both public and private, regeneration of certain areas and acquisitions, as well as various leasing arrangements.  While the final detailed figures for social housing output will be collated and published over the coming weeks, provisional figures for 2016 indicate that in excess of 18,300 households have had their social housing needs met under the range of social housing schemes, ahead of the target of just over 17,000 that had been set for the year.  In terms of social housing construction, the pipeline is very positive.  From a situation of very limited new social housing units constructed in 2015, where the reliance was primarily in acquisitions and other delivery mechanisms, it is expected that the projects involving some 2,800 social housing units will commence on site under the main local authority and approved housing body construction programmes this year.  </p><p> Pillar three is focused on securing significant increases in the delivery of housing in the wider housing market.  We are currently finalising the housing output figures for 2016, for publication with the next quarterly progress report, but it is clear from the data to the end of November that they will show an increase on the 12,666 units produced in 2015.  While the 2016 increase is very welcome, it is of course just a step along the pathway to increasing housing output to approximately 25,000 units per annum over the course of the Rebuilding Ireland plan.  There are 12 actions under pillar three, dealing with funding and financing of infrastructure provision, active land management, planning reforms, construction design innovation and the construction sector's skills and capacity to deliver.  The skills issue in particular is a very important area, given the estimated requirements for additional skilled construction workers, and our colleagues in the Department of Education and Skills and SOLAS are working to ramp up the delivery of skills training across a range of key areas.  On the infrastructure front, 21 local authorities have applied for funding under the &euro;200 million local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, seeking to open up more of the approximately 17,500 ha of land for development that the planning process has identified nationally for housing, 2,654 ha of which are in Dublin.  There will be a further update on the assessment of these applications in the context of the quarter four quarterly progress report.  </p><p> On the land supply side, relevant Departments, State bodies and local authorities have been contacted regarding lands in their ownership or control or both that may be suitable and available for housing development in connection with the development of a national web-based database of State lands.  To make progress quickly, the survey of State development lands is focusing on Dublin and the main cities and urban areas with a view to having the details mapped later in this quarter, after which the approach will be extended to other regions.</p><p>Some 23 major urban development sites with the capacity to deliver 30,000 new homes in the medium term in the greater Dublin area, Cork, Limerick and Galway have been identified.  Progress on these sites is being proactively monitored by the Department's housing delivery office, with a view to ensuring that the sites become exemplars for the co-ordination and delivery of plan-led housing development and active land management.<br/><br/>The Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016, which was enacted on 23 December last, enables large-scale housing development proposals to be submitted directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, while also enabling other important streamlining of planning processes and new tenant protection measures.<br/><br/>Finally under this pillar, a help to buy scheme was introduced by the Minister for Finance as part of the budget for 2017.  Under the scheme, first-time buyers who purchase or self-build their own homes can avail of a refund of income tax and DIRT paid in the previous four years up to a maximum amount of &euro;20,000.  This refund can be used to satisfy mortgage deposit requirements, making home purchase more achievable for an increasing number of prospective home owners and, in turn, providing confidence to home builders to supply more homes.<br/><br/>Under pillar 4, the key action was the publication of a rental strategy.  The strategy for the rental sector was published on 13 December 2016.  Importantly, the strategy introduced the concept of rent pressure zones, RPZs, to provide rent predictability in areas of unsustainable rental inflation.  RPZs have now been given a statutory basis via the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016.  In these zones, rent increases will be capped at 4% per annum.  The measure was introduced with immediate effect in the four Dublin local authority areas and Cork city.  The Residential Tenancies Board has been asked to accelerate the work to develop more detailed area-based rental data in the Dublin and Cork commuter counties and in the other main cities so that additional areas can be designated where the criteria are met.  RPZs will be designated for a maximum of three years, by which time it is anticipated that new supply will have come on stream and eased the pressures on the rental market in the most pressured areas.<br/><br/>The Planning and Development (Housing) Residential Tenancies Act 2016 gives effect to other actions in the rental strategy relating to security.  It prevents the termination of ten or more tenancies at the same time in a single development in order to facilitate vacant possession sale of the property.  Sales in such cases will be conditional on the existing tenants remaining <i>in situ</i>.  In addition, the landlord's right during the first six months of a further Part 4 tenancy to end that tenancy has been abolished and the duration of tenancies has been extended from four to six years.<br/><br/>The strategy also puts forward a number of measures that will broaden and strengthen the role and powers of the Residential Tenancies Board to more effectively provide key services to tenants and landlords.  In addition, the working group on taxation of rental providers for which provision was made in the strategy has already been established by the Department of Finance.<br/><br/>Under pillar 5, while Rebuilding Ireland places a strong emphasis on the provision of increased new housing supply in respect of both private and social housing to meet demand, a further key objective of the action plan is to ensure that the existing housing stock is used to the maximum degree.<br/><br/>A particular focus in this regard is to bring vacant residential units back into productive use for social and private housing purposes.  Through a range of initiatives and targeted policy reforms, harnessing the potential of these houses can contribute to the overall objective of increasing housing supply quickly to meet demand while simultaneously helping to breathe new life and vitality into the streets, estates and rural areas in which they are located.  New initiatives, such as the repair and leasing scheme, are designed to realise this potential.<br/><br/>The Central Statistics Office has indicated that more detailed information and categorisation of vacant properties will be available in the housing specific report from Census 2016, which is being prioritised for finalisation by April 2017.  This will be a critically important input into the new vacant housing reuse strategy which is to be developed under pillar 5.<br/><br/>In terms of use of social housing stock, choice-based letting, CBL, can play an important part in the more efficient allocation of social housing by local authorities, helping to minimise delays that can arise through offers of accommodation being refused.  By using CBL, South Dublin County Council had the lowest reported refusal rate for social housing, at 5%, while in some local authority areas refusals were running at significantly higher levels.  To ensure the further roll-out of CBL nationally, new regulations were made on 30 September 2016, requiring every housing authority to provide for a choice-based letting procedure in their housing allocation schemes by the end of the year at the latest.<br/><br/>I have provided a summary of the progress made in implementing Rebuilding Ireland in the months immediately following its publication.  While I have concentrated on the quarter 3 progress report, where possible I have provided the committee with more recent updates on significant actions.  A further and more comprehensive update will be available in the next progress report, which will be finalised and published in the coming weeks.<br/><br/>As the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, has indicated, Rebuilding Ireland is a top priority for the Government and the Department is fully committed to its effective delivery.  I and my colleagues will be happy to respond to any issues or queries that members may wish to raise.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-18a.211" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017011800002#E00500"><p>I thank the Chairman and Deputy Cowen.  I suggest that we ask our questions on a pillar-by-pillar basis.  I have questions under each pillar and doing as I suggest might make it easier procedurally, if that is okay.</p> <p>  On pillar 1, I do not want to start on a sour note but we already know most of the information in the presentation.  It is information of which we are aware because we have been working through this matter.  For future quarterly reports, it would be better to get into the nitty-gritty detail that is not in the public domain straight away because that would save time.</p> <p>  I will address four specific things on homelessness.  First, the homeless statistics released every month are not correct.  I have raised this matter by means of parliamentary questions on a number of occasions.  The statistics in question do not include adults and children in Tusla-funded domestic violence refuge accommodation or step-down accommodation; they do not include foreign nationals in transitional or emergency accommodation funded by the Department of Social Protection's new communities unit; and they do not include the approximately 400 families that are currently trapped in direct provision or those in transitional accommodation funded by the Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, who have their stamp 4 visas.  This means that the figures that are being released every month do not reflect the total number of people - adults and children - in emergency accommodation or transitional accommodation.  It cannot be very complicated for the relevant Departments to feed all this information in so that when the statistics are released, they will reflect it.  I urge the Department to take a lead role to ensure that we have accurate figures on that.</p> <p>  Tusla cannot tell me how many people it has in emergency accommodation when I table parliamentary questions on the matter.  The Department of Social Protection will not give me any accurate figures.  The Department of Justice and Equality has provided the figures for direct provision.  If we are releasing a report saying that this is the number of homeless individuals and families and children, it should - irrespective of who they are funded by - include information on all of them.</p> <p>  I am concerned at the way in which those figures have been released two months in a row.  I raised concerns when the October report was published because it was put up on the Department's website at 6 p.m. on a Friday, with no accompanying statement.  The statement went up early the following week and it appears as if there was an attempt to bury bad news.  The figures for November were released on 30 December when  everybody was away on holidays.  We had been chasing these figures for two or three weeks and we had thought that they would come out at the end of the second week or the beginning of the third week in December.  Regardless of whether it is the case - and I am aware that the Department is extremely busy - it seems that those figures, which have been bade news for two months in a row, have not been given the same kind of media attention that the Minister is providing in respect of a lot of other positive news.  He is very proactive in the media and many stories emerged over the Christmas period.  The Minister published opinion pieces, press releases, etc., which is great.  However, I am of the view that the figures should be released in a different way and I wanted to raise that.</p> <p>  On rapid-build housing units, there is no point in telling us how many of these are in the pipeline.  We want to know how many are on-site and under construction at present.  Another issue arises in the context of the use of such units.  Some of us are currently working Part 8 planning applications in our local authorities.  It is still not clear whether the Department is going to require the local authorities to tenant all of those rapid-build units with families coming directly from emergency accommodation.  We do not know whether they be in there for  a period of six months while they are being moved on to other permanent accommodation, whether these units will be their permanent homes or whether local authorities will be given a certain amount of flexibility, through the use of transfers, to ensure a much more integrated allocations policy.  I would be interested to hear responses in respect of that matter.</p> <p>  "Exits" is a wonderful word because it does not exactly tell us what we are looking for.  It is a somewhat similar to what happens when the phrase "social housing solutions" is used.  What we would like to know is how many of these exits relate to households as opposed to individuals.  Both figures in this regard would be useful.  What do the people exit into?  Can our guests confirm that they are all permanent long-term tenancies and that none of them are short-term supported tenancies of any kind?</p> <p>  The other really important thing that must be considered in the context of the figures - both in terms of the homeless figures monthly and the exits - is the average length of time that households are spending in emergency accommodation.  The latter is a really important metric for us.  I know it is difficult to produce.  I imagine, however, that it would be possible - even by region - to say that the households currently in emergency accommodation have been there, on average, for a certain period and also to indicate the length of time for which those who have been the subject exits have been in such accommodation.</p><p> Lastly, there has been some controversy between Apollo House, Home Sweet Home and the Minister over the two new facilities in Dublin.  I welcome that funding is being made available for those two facilities.  I am merely interested because Dublin City Council councillors from all parties knew nothing about this until it was in the media.  They first heard about it from the press.  Obviously, there were conversations between the Minister and the housing managers in advance of his meeting with Home Sweet Home but I would be interested to know the timeline because none of us knew about these either.  Did Dublin City Council approach the Department or the Department approach the council?  When did that take place and when was funding agreed?  I understand there are sensitivities about new homeless facilities because unfortunately, some politicians - none in this room but in local authorities - often play politics with it.  Is it proper procedure that councillors and Deputies learn of these significant developments from the press rather than through the institutional meetings of committees, here or in the local authority?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-18a.213" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1217" speakername="Barry Cowen" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017011800002#F00200"><p>I agree with the previous speaker that we should deal with each pillar as it arises and take questions on that.</p> <p>  On homelessness, I have something similar.  The figure mentioned 4,436 adults in emergency accommodation nationally during the survey week.  Can that be broken down into the number of housing units?  Do we know how many children are involved?  On the actions mentioned to alleviate this, I am conscious that the Minister and Minister of State with responsibility in this area have almost staked their reputation on this issue through the commitment they have given both to members and to the public that they will rid us of this horrible statistic by June of this year.  Last year, the Department states more than 2,000 were taken out of homelessness and that was a record year.  Now the Department states 4,436 will be taken out of homelessness and out of emergency accommodation by June of this year.  The Department states that one tool that will be used to eradicate that figure to zero by June is the 1,500 rapid units to be built by the end of 2018.  Unfortunately, the Department cannot square that circle.  More to the point, we were given a commitment on the delivery of 350 or 500 modular units last year and we got 22 units.  Somebody needs to tell the committee what exactly was or is the problem, whether it has been identified and will it be rectified.  When Mr. McCarthy and others give commitments to the committee on a regular basis, in this instance that 1,500 units will be delivered by the end of 2018, have the lessons and the failures associated with previous commitments been learned, been owned up to and been rectified?</p> <p>  As I stated to the Minister previously, if it is such that there are legislative issues or logjams, let us know and we will do what we can to rectify the situation.  This is an emergency and if emergency legislation is required, members will sit all night to pass it.  It appears as though commitments are being made, left, right and centre, as well as launches, strategies and what not, but yet on the ground an obvious lack of urgency can be seen when that cannot be rectified.  All of us here are more than willing to help, support and see that the commitments the Department makes are realised but Mr. McCarthy must elaborate on the 4,436 figure and break it down.  He needs to elaborate, as the previous speaker stated, on the commitments regarding the 1,500 modular units.  Where is the surplus over 22 units that was committed to last year?  When can people expect to see results in this area?  As far back as two and half years ago, the former Minister, Deputy Kelly, made similar commitments.  I am sure the figures are similar to the commitment Deputy Kelly gave at that time and the same figures have been given repeatedly.  Rather than taking up much more time, Mr. McCarthy should break down the 4,436 into units, into the children involved and into households.  On the 1,500 modular units, what lessons have been learned from the failure last year and how can we be assured that these can be address this time round?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-18a.214" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1379" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017011800002#F00300"><p>I welcome the team from the Department, and particularly thank the Secretary General, Mr. McCarthy, for his presentation.  First, I want to put on the record it was disappointing that we did not have a presentation on the review of the action plan for housing and homelessness, which was originally scheduled for 7 December.  Mr. McCarthy will recall we had a piece of correspondence from his Department on the reasons.</p><p>There is a national housing crisis.  I read a piece by the Minister, to be fair to him, only two days ago in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  It is another one of the pieces to which Deputy &Oacute; Broin refers about the usual such as, for instance, the importance of joined-up responses, how in working together we can rebuild Ireland and the 47,000 units.  I accept all of that.</p><p>The Minister got what he wanted.  The Department got what it wanted.  Ultimately, through their Minister, they got Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, which is Government policy and which we all are working to and agreed to.  They got the necessary legislative support that was required to give effect to this plan and vision.  That is a fact as is all good.  As I stated at the first meeting I attended as a member of this committee, what the Minister did was a brave decision but there was only one way out.  If he could not explain what he was doing, he was failing.  He published at the back of the document specific dates and timelines.</p><p>Mr. McCarthy is talking about the first, second and third quarters in 2016.  We are now in 2017 and Mr. McCarthy is only reporting on one element.  This is so crucial the joint committee will need to have faster responses from the Department.  I might as well say what I feel but it was an affront for the Department not to come before this committee when it was scheduled to so do to give a report on the Government policy.  This is the Oireachtas joint committee and this is one of the key elements that will be considered throughout the work of this committee.  I am conscious that the Chairman wants to deal with the different issues under the pillars, but that is merely an opening remark.</p><p>Clearly, coming from the previous speakers is the issue of the format.  Why can we not have a standard format?  Reading a speech is all very fine, but Mr. McCarthy set out his excellent format at the back of this document in which there are timelines, etc.  We should have a format which is consistent through every report on this document, which sets out each of the items and objectives.  We know how many objectives and items are in the report.  There are 84 distinct actions under the five pillars.  It is all clear and well done and is well set out.  Arising from all of this and the ongoing discussion, I recommend that the format be established, that the Department have a proper working format which replicates the format of the Department in this document in order that members can constantly see how it is progressing.</p><p>We need to have greater details.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin talked about a metric.  Also, there is an inconsistency on the data every time one reads a paper.  The Department published the delightful Summary of Social Housing Assessments 2016 in December 2016, for which I thank the Department, as I rang up and was sent a copy the next day.  The previous one was dated up to 2013.  We had a housing crisis but we had no summary of the social assessment need until December 2016.  I circulated the summary to a number of local authorities and had feedback from a senior level within these local authorities to the effect that there were inconsistencies about the figures, and I am happy to discuss that with Mr. McCarthy later.  There are issues in this regard and these data need to be validated.  There are inconsistencies in local authority chief executives saying it is something else and the Department stating these are the facts, people are falling off lists but no one really needs to know.</p><p>I will finish at that point.  I will come back in at the various pillars, if I may.  I make the point that we have to speed it up.  What is Mr. McCarthy talking about?  Are we talking about the last quarter, which is October, November and December 2016 or what?  We need to be consistent with the quarter of when this was published because I would like to think that for every quarter in 2017, we will have a comprehensive report.  The key point is the format of it.  The format should be clearly set up against the format the Department established in its document.</p></speech>

That goes through each of the individual actions scheduled for delivery in quarter 3.  It mirrors the format in the document and is the format in which we will continue to publish on a quarterly basis.  The absence of a presentation earlier was on the understanding that the presentation, to a large measure, was contained in the published report so the purpose of my opening remarks was really just to try to give a summary of some of the key points.</p><p> On the issue before Christmas, I wrote to the committee and explained to the Chairman that the period before Christmas was an extraordinarily busy period for everybody concerned, including for committee members because the Houses were sitting for hours, day and night.  We were in the throes of trying to finalise a very difficult rental strategy and big legislation, including the legislative amendments associated with the rental strategy.  There is never any disrespect intended to the committee by the Department; we never have and, as long as I am Secretary General, we never will.  The choice we faced was coming before the committee without some of the key people because they had to service other aspects of the Oireachtas in terms of legislation and Government business.  It would not have been the most productive encounter for all of us.  That is just by way of background to explain the pressures at the time.  There was no intention to show disrespect towards the committee or its members.     </p><p> In terms of the social housing assessments data, we are very keen to hear any suggestions or comments the committee has received about inconsistency.  The appointed date for the social housing assessment 2016 was 21 September.  The couple of months between that date and the date it was published were heavily devoted to a data cleansing and validation exercise that was undertaken by the Housing Agency.  If there is a suggestion that there are data inconsistencies, it may be because some of the data shown has been cleansed from some of the initial data presented to us.  We are happy to engage with the committee.  If it has details on that, we will explore them.  There is a commitment in the social housing strategy that social housing assessments, which were done every three years up to 2016, will not be undertaken on an annual basis.  </p><p> In terms of homelessness and data, which Deputy Cowen raised, the figure I referred to of 4,436 was 4,436 adults.  There were 2,549 children, so in total we are talking about 6,985, comprising 1,200 families.  In terms of the target the Minister has set out clearly in Rebuilding Ireland, that target is to eliminate the use of commercial hotels for emergency accommodation by the middle of the year.  In the most recent data available to us, there were about 700 families in commercial hotels in the Dublin region.  The target we are working towards is getting that cohort of families living in unsustainable hotel accommodation out of that space by the middle of the year.  </p><p> The rapid build programme was first spoken about in a demonstration project of different types of modular housing about 15 months ago in September-October 2015.  We progressed quickly towards a pilot project in Ballymun.  At the time, there were delays with the project partly associated with protests on site.  In addition, we ran through some of the worst weather we had experienced over that December into January period.  There was also an important amount of learning involved.  One of the more significant pieces of learning was the extent to which time was being spent in the housing provider's manufacturing facility and the value associated with that.  It meant that any issues arising as part of the construction of the units were dealt with at the earliest possible stage so that when they got on site, some of the issues that can arise when it comes to the actual assembly on site had been taken out.  That is one of the significant learnings that came out of that pilot.  </p><p> The Office of Government Procurement has put a lot of time and effort into putting a general procurement framework in place for rapid build housing.  It is now thankfully in place and that will certainly assist local authorities in speeding up the procurement process as they move on with delivery over the course of this year.  Apart from the 22 units that have been delivered, there were 131 units in four projects that were under construction in Dublin city at the end of the year.  The remaining 200 were at various stages of procurement and will come on stream over the course of the year.</p><p> Deputy Cowen made an entirely valid point about my reference to the overall rapid build programme being completed by 2018 and how that gels with the mid-year target we have for hotels.  We see the rapid build programme contributing towards meeting the mid-year target but we also see it as an ongoing delivery tool.  The commitment to not use hotels other than in exceptional circumstances for emergency accommodation is one we are trying to meet by June but we need to continue to try to ensure we do not fall back into that space.  The continued development of rapid build housing will assist over the remainder of 2017 and on into 2018 to help us to keep out of that unsustainable space.  We will be organising a session with local authorities in the next ten days to two weeks.  We have already had some discussions with local authorities outside the Dublin area in relation to projects that they will bring forward for rapid build purposes so the purpose of the engagement at the end of the month is to, in effect, identify the remaining projects that will contribute to get us to the point of having 1,000 units delivered by the end of this year and the remaining 520 in 2018.  That covers the Deputy's points.  </p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Broin has made the point to the Minister about statistics and other areas of housing provision through Tusla and others.  I also hear from what the Deputy is saying that he has difficulty getting that information from other quarters.  All I can say is that we have put a lot of time over the past two years into getting the pathways to accommodation support system, PASS, in place to give us good statistics on homelessness so we have a very good handle on what we are dealing with as far as housing authorities are concerned.  That has been our focus and the Minister has been clear that that has been our focus.  I am not in any way arguing the point with the Deputy about the other areas of activity.</p><p> As part of the overall implementation of Rebuilding Ireland, we have a lot of engagement with the other bodies the Deputy has talked about, particularly Tusla, in terms of dealing with homelessness in the round.  Responsibility for domestic violence issues was, with the establishment of Tusla, consciously moved away from our Department in the past 18 months to two years.  We will continue to engage with it on what information and statistics it can bring to bear so that there is an overall picture of the accommodation being provided through different mechanisms.  Generally, one of the things flowing from Rebuilding Ireland is that we are putting a renewed emphasis on the timeliness and the comprehensiveness of our statistics across a range of fronts on homelessness, social housing and broader housing market delivery more generally.</p><p>Over recent months, we have established a new unit, headed by a senior statistician, as part of the process of bringing greater clarity.  A significant amount must be delivered under the Rebuilding Ireland programme.  It is critically important everybody has a clear picture on where the state of delivery is at any time.  That is a focus of particular attention for us.</p><p> We are certainly not in the business of choosing a particular time to put homelessness statistics out because we feel that, in some way, it will get buried by other news.  That is not the business we are in.  As I mentioned earlier about December, there were a significant number of other matters going on and the release of the statistics can get delayed from time to time.  Again, as part of our statistical work and its presentation on our website, we are interested in transparency and getting the information out there.</p><p> The main contributors to exits from homelessness would be the homeless housing assistance payment pilot, which was successful last year in Dublin, and, obviously, mainstream housing allocations.  To clarify, I may have given the wrong figure earlier for homelessness exits.  I think I gave the figure 2,000 for last year which is actually the figure for the first three quarters of last year.  The expectation is that for the year as a whole it will be 2,700.</p><p> On the two new emergency accommodation facilities, we engage in an ongoing dialogue with the four Dublin local authorities, in particular Dublin City Council, for which the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, acts.  We often meet weekly and fortnightly to discuss a range of issues.  In all of those meetings, particularly in the early part of the autumn last year, the clear basis of our engagement with the local authorities was that, whatever needed to be put in place for additional emergency accommodation, we would support and fund the first three facilities which were put in place and launched in the second week of December.  It brought us to a particular point and gave us sufficient comfort that there would be sufficient emergency accommodation for anybody who needed it.  We always saw this as an ongoing process.  The two new facilities - I do not know the date - arose in the context of that ongoing dialogue with the DRHE as part of the process of trying to be ahead of the issue rather than finding ourselves in a position of playing catch-up in providing accommodation for people in vulnerable circumstances.</p><p> On the length of time in emergency accommodation, as part of our improvement of our statistical work, we will talk to the DRHE to see if there is a way the PASS system can capture those sorts of data.  On the allocations of rapid builds, we would certainly aim to be flexible with local authorities.  Many competing factors go into the decision as to whether all the rapid build units should or should not be used for families in emergency accommodation.  There may be local factors where a more blended approach is required.  There are broader issues for each local authority in how they manage the prioritisation and the response to the priorities on their housing lists.  If a local authority wants to talk to the Department about a measure of flexibility which it felt was necessary for good local reasons, we would certainly discuss that with it.  We would not be in an absolute black and white space on this.</p></speech>

Is there any report on this to date?  Action No. 1.21 stated "We will examine how the Mortgage to Rent scheme can be improved to facilitate more households".  Is there a report on this?

We will certainly be reporting on that as part of the quarterly progress report.  As well as reporting on progress in the quarter just completed, we try to give a look ahead to some of the key deliverables in the quarter coming up.  On action No. 1.2, we are compiling the quarter 4 progress report and getting inputs from the Department of Finance and the Central Bank.  That will be published in the next two to three weeks and there will be an update on that at that stage.</p> <p>  We have pretty much completed the review on the mortgage-to-rent scheme but I have not yet had an opportunity to speak to the Minister about it.  I hope the Deputy will forgive me for not going into too much detail on it but it is virtually complete.  We have looked at all the suggested factors which have inhibited the take-up of the scheme.  We are trying to see if there are ways we can put the householder more in the driving seat in getting access to the scheme.  Again, I expect this will be finalised and we will be able to give more information in the quarter 4 progress report.</p></speech>

We all recognise the significant challenge in this regard and we acknowledge the efforts being made across the various pillars.</p> <p>  My main interest is where progress has not been made, targets not met and to understand why that is the case.  For example, the Secretary General outlined various construction programmes and how 21 local authorities have applied for funding under the &euro;200 million local infrastructure fund to open up development plans.  Do we have specific details as to which local authorities have applied and what development lands are under application?  Why have local authorities which would have potential not submitted applications?</p> <p>  The construction of more than 2,800 housing units will be commenced by either local authorities or by approved housing bodies.  Can we identify what local authorities or approved housing bodies have applied?  Can we identify where there is further capacity?  For the committee to be more beneficial to the whole Rebuilding Ireland project, it is important it engages with those local authorities or approved housing bodies to identify any barriers and assist them in making a more efficient application process and, in turn, completion process to deliver more units.</p> <p>  I also want to raise the issue of performance indicators, not only in local authorities but in the Department, regarding monitoring from application to approval to completion.</p><p>What progress has been made to make that whole process more efficient?  As we all know, irrespective of who we represent, what party we are in or whether we are Independent, that there has been much criticism of the Department in terms of the approval system when applications are made, and in turn there has been criticism of local authorities that they are not efficient in driving their individual housing programmes.  As a committee we can be more beneficial to the whole programme by scrutinising those processes, identifying where the problems are and seeing where we can assist in them.  Any information the witnesses can give us in that respect will be helpful and I would appreciate it.</p></speech>

Deputy &Oacute; Broin may want to ask his questions pillar by pillar, but he can come in as many times as he wants, and it is up to him to decide which pillar he wants to ask about or whether it is all five.  There will be no curtailment of time on this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-18a.224" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1357" speakername="Pat Casey" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017011800002#J00300"><p>I want to come back in on some of the issues that were raised, specifically in relation to pillar 1.  A statistic was referred to that it is hoped to have 700 families out of commercial hotels by June this year.  I would have some reservations as to how that will be achieved.  One of the issues I would like to focus on is the Airbnb situation, specifically in Dublin.  What processes have been put in place or directions given to local authorities to try to address the Airbnb situation, based on An Bord Plean&aacute;la's decision that anyone using a property for Airbnb on a long-term basis should have a change of use for the purposes of planning regulations?  It has been identified that more than 1,500 properties are available in Dublin on Airbnb over a 50 week period in any year.  These are homes that people could be living in.  Equally, the federation has identified that 10% of the hotel stock is being taken up for local authority use within the Dublin area.  It is a reversal of what should be happening.  Tourists or business travellers should be staying in the hotel environment and families should be living in homes.  I think that greater emphasis should be put on this now to try to address the situation.</p> <p>  I am slightly confused about the rapid build modular houses and whether they are specifically for homeless people.  It was my understanding that we were looking at rapid build modular technology as the way forward in delivering social housing, and I think it was meant for anybody, not just for homeless people.  If we restrict it to homeless people, we are actually saying that this is an inferior product.  If we believe in modular building technology, in fairness to the people who are involved in the industry, the whole modular building concept is a way of moving this industry forward.  Even from the employee's point of view, who has a regular place of work to go to on a daily basis to carry out their work, from child care and everything else, it is a lot easier manage their lifestyle balance.</p> <p>  To clarify, my questions concern the issue of families staying in commercial hotels, Airbnb and the rapid builds.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-18a.225" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1395" speakername="Jennifer Murnane O'Connor" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017011800002#J00400"><p>I think many of the questions I was going to ask have already been mentioned.  I would like more clarification on the pillars themselves.  As I understand it, the figures and statistics are not available.  That is crucial.  I spent my whole Christmas trying to get people I represent into hotels and trying to get funding in my own area, and it was a massive issue for me.  I will address that another time.</p> <p>  With regard to the &euro;70 million allocated for purchasing house, how many have been purchased?  What are the different areas?  I understand that there is a crisis in Dublin and Galway and the bigger cities.</p> <p>  I read over the programme over Christmas, because I had a lot of dealings with many people over that period in this regard, and an issue that is not addressed is the staffing issue.  The biggest issue in local authorities is the staffing issue.  For example, people who want to go on the local authority housing list can be waiting from ten to 12 weeks.  That is unacceptable.  I believe that the Department should put in place a rule that nobody should be waiting longer than four weeks for a housing interview.  That is leading to the most vulnerable people in our society not getting rent allowance or the housing assistance payment, HAP.  That is a major issue.</p> <p>  We are talking about homelessness, and I think there are different types of homelessness.  Over Christmas I had six families who were taken off the local authority housing list.  I raised this issue with the Department six months ago.  In my own local authority housing list area, there is a limit of 26,250.  I could write the book on it at this stage.  I have people who are being taken off the list.  I had three families in particular who were eight years on the housing list, and because they were over the bracket, as it were, they were taken off.  In neighbouring counties, the very same as in Carlow, they are allowed a limit of 30,000 or 32,000.  That is not acceptable.  The officials are not doing their homework.  I can give them the names of six families today who were taken off the local authority housing list.  They lost the rent allowance and they are now homeless.  We are getting to a stage where unless the most vulnerable are addressed, people are starting to be taken off the housing list.</p> <p>  The other issue is the HAP, and I have to say that overall the HAP is a good scheme.  I would be agree with it in that people can declare exactly how much they are paying to the landlord, whereas for years that was a disaster.  Many landlords, however, do not seem to want to accept the HAP, and I believe it is because there is a mismatch in the information they are receiving.  They feel that it is different to the rent allowance, which it is.  It is better, but they do not understand that.  Another area where the Department officials are falling down, as it were, is that people are refusing to accept the HAP.  The local authorities will say that landlords are not accepting the HAP.  One of the reasons is that in this new HAP scheme, and this comes back again to staffing levels, there are supposed to be call outs to make sure the homes are up to a proper standard.  While that is good and we need a proper standard, there is no one to implement it.  There are not enough staff and no one is able to do it.</p> <p>  I read through the action plan over the Christmas when I had so many people going into bed and breakfast accommodation and hotels.  It just does not make sense to me that there is a programme in place, and while I know the Department officials are doing their best, the most vulnerable people are not being catered for.  These are not the homeless, but they are next to the homeless.  What I am finding is that these people are starting to become homeless.</p> <p>  While the new help to buy scheme is a good scheme, there are no new houses in most rural areas for first-time buyers.  We have brought in a help to buy scheme for people who must be a first-time buyer or engaging in a first-time build.  We have no houses for them.  I promoted this scheme in our local newspapers and I was on the radio about it.  I was delighted to praise this scheme.  People came back to me to say they did not know where there was a first-time house to buy.  They could not buy because there were no first-time builds.  I told them to look for a mortgage from the local authority.  Local authority mortgages are an issue that must be addressed.  There is a lack of information about them and they have not been promoted well enough.  The Department should promote these mortgages through every local authority.  There needs to be a system in place for the people who are refused a loan or mortgage from a bank or building society because of the rules that are there and they do not qualify, which that is fair enough, but who also do not qualify for the local authority housing list.  The help to buy scheme is fine in bigger areas like Dublin, Cork and Limerick where they are building, but there are no new builds in rural counties.  There are no new houses.  This means people will not qualify for it while the local authorities are not promoting mortgages.  These are simple things, but if the Department addresses these in its plan it will make a big difference to the most vulnerable families in society.  That is where the plan is failing.</p><p>The issues I raise are not major but the one I really want an answer on is the need to change the income limit for local authority housing from &euro;26,500 to &euro;32,000.  As I said, I will give the witnesses the six names because those people are now homeless.</p></speech>

The reason some local authorities decided not to was because we were trying to prioritise and identify large-scale developments that would need to be released early, we set a threshold of 500 units in Dublin and 200 around the country.  Being realistic, the other timeline meant that they would deliver houses in three to four years.</p> <p>  Most of the local authorities came to our information sessions in the Custom House where we discussed this with them but some of them felt that even if they put a lot of work into it, they probably would not be able to deliver at the pace required.  That said, the total value of the 74 projects we received in the middle of October was almost &euro;800 million and we have a &euro;200 million fund, so there has been a good deal of analysis and further engagement with local authorities asking them to prioritise and get behind some of the figures, understanding the phasing elements.  That analysis is continuing.  Any project over &euro;5 million requires a fuller financial analysis, whether a multi-criteria analysis, MCA, or, in some cases, a full cost benefit analysis.  That engagement and information flow is still happening but we believe we will find substantial and significant projects that can be funded this year, and we will kick-start major developments in some key sites.</p></speech>

The deadline for providing those was this month because it requires, in some cases, further detailed analysis.  In terms of projects below &euro;5 million, we are looking at the holistic amount and asking if we can make decisions on some of the smaller-scale projects in advance of approval.  There are pros and cons to that in terms of assigning money before all the projects in the mix have been assessed.  A portion was not set aside for smaller projects.  When we get the full analysis in we will determine how quickly we can turn around the information.  We have been engaging with and inviting in local authorities to update them and explain what they can do from their perspective, but 21 out of 31 is a good turnaround for what is a first call.</p></speech>

He will know from previous experience that there is much said about that and a lot of bouncing of the ball around between the local authority and the Department.  All of us in the Department are fully alive to the reality of the very difficult housing situation we face and we are making every effort possible to move things forward more quickly, and we will continue to do that.  However, we have to remember that in many cases we are talking about very large amounts of public funds for which, as Accounting Officer, I am ultimately accountable.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has frameworks in place with which we have to comply.  Previously, there would have been a process that, technically, might have required eight or nine stages.  That has been sweated down to four stages.</p> <p>  With regard to smaller-scale projects up to &euro;2 million or 15 units, a one stage approval process has been introduced.  It has not got a huge take-up from local authorities.  In Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, we committed to reviewing the four stage approval process to see if there was anything further we could do in terms of making it operate more smoothly.  That report is almost finished.  The report will deal with a number of issues including clarity on what is required.  It is an issue that what is required to move a project on is not fully understood in some cases, and that can be a cause of delay.</p> <p>  Are there standard approaches that can be taken?  For example, standard approaches to internal layouts in housing can form layout templates that can be used as a straightforward part of projects. </p> <p>  With regard to turnaround timeframes between the four stages, I would like us to be in a situation where we can agree with local authorities on target timeframes but, inevitably, that requires a clear understanding of what is required because if we do not get what is required, we will not be in a position to be able to deliver on those timeframes.  We will also look to see whether there is scope to streamline the first two stages of the process and move things on.</p> <p>  There are a large number of projects within the four stage approval process and we will be finalising an update on those for publication with the Q1 report, many of which have completed all four stages and are either on site or at tender.  A significant number of other projects are in the pre-tender stage.</p> <p>  Projects are moving through the pipeline but we are committed to exploring every possible way to ensure that between ourselves and the local authorities, the system works as efficiently as possible.  To help that, a more focused, multi-diciplinary team from the Department will engage with each individual local authority to talk about projects even before they become projects, if that does not sound stupid, to ensure there is a good understanding of where the local authority is coming from and what will be the likely issues in order to expedite delivery.</p> <p>  Deputy Casey raised the Airbnb issue.  We addressed that in the rental strategy published before Christmas.  There were two elements to that, one of which was the immediate implications of the An Bord Plean&aacute;la ruling.  That was on a specific case where, in effect, an apartment was being used exclusively for Airbnb purposes.  The An Bord Plean&aacute;la ruling was that that use requires planning permission.  We issued guidance to all local authorities before Christmas bringing that ruling to their attention.  In the event that there are other properties operating in a similar manner, they require planning permission and need to be followed up.</p> <p>  On the Airbnb issue more generally, while a significant number of Airbnb properties may be advertised in any location at a particular time, what is not as clear is the extent to which some of those are being offered by people who are making their property available for a week or two when they are on holidays themselves.  There is a big gulf between the numbers of units available in Airbnb and the numbers of units available for housing generally because they are and continue to be people's primary residences.  We have recognised in the rental strategy that there are a range of issues flowing from the An Bord Plean&aacute;la case and Airbnb generally, including issues to do with tenancy regulation, tax liability and the tourism dimension.  There is a commitment in the rental strategy to establish a working group to prepare a report on that by the second quarter of this year.  We will be moving forward with that very shortly.</p> <p>  I could not agree more with the Deputy's point about rapid build.  Rapid build housing has been brought forward because of its capacity to deliver projects faster in order to be able to assist in dealing with the immediate issues of homelessness but, fundamentally, we are talking about new and different types of building technologies.  There is considerable scope for those technologies to be able to deliver us a good quality product in faster timelines at competitive prices.  The engagement we are having with local authorities is with a view to building up the portfolio to deliver us the 1,500 units we have referred to in the programme but if a local authority wants to take forward any social housing project employing any one of these new technologies, we will certainly look at it.</p><p>Obviously, there are building standards that these new technologies have to meet.  We are not in the business of delivering a less than proper product.  However, as a principle, I agree fully with the Deputy.</p><p> On the issues Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor raised, there are always staffing issues in every organisation.  We have staffing issues and have to prioritise and use our staffing resources in the best possible way.  As part of the process of assisting local authorities, we have provided for certain staff costs associated with our capital programmes to be covered in order that they do not have to find the resources to meet them.  Fundamentally, there is a requirement on every organisation to prioritise, our own included, and we have had to do this in delivering Rebuilding Ireland, the rental strategy and getting on with the important business of implementation.  We have to prioritise and try to use our resources in different ways.</p><p> On income limits, different bands are set for different areas and there is an entire process behind it.  The ultimate impact of the income bands is that they operate to target the most vulnerable.  There can be much debate on whether it should be at this, that or the other level, but at whatever level they are set, by targeting the households with an income below them, by definition the most vulnerable households are being targeted.</p><p> We have rolled out the HAP scheme to all local authorities, bar those in Fingal, D&uacute;n Laoghaire and Dublin city, where it will be rolled out on 1 March.  The scheme has been working for the purpose of dealing with homelessness in Dublin generally.  We had a target of 12,000 tenancies last year which was achieved.  The feedback from local authorities is generally quite positive, as the Senator acknowledged.  We do receive feedback from local authorities that there are some tenants who believe the scheme is not the solution for them and it is for an individual household to form its own view.  However, we are working towards ensuring the scheme delivers quality accommodation.  All such accommodation, if it has not been inspected within the previous 12 months, has to be inspected within eight months and the issue of the standard of private rental accommodation is the focus of particular attention in the rental strategy.  There are issues with some landlords in understanding the HAP scheme, but, overall, it has reached the take-up by landlords and tenants envisaged in the targets set for last year.  As part of the further roll-out of the scheme to the remaining Dublin local authorities, we will be engaging with at least some local authorities on a further promotional campaign for both tenants and landlords to ensure there is the level of understanding needed.</p><p> I will be brief on the help to buy scheme because it is not in our space but in that of the Department of Finance.  The Senator made an interesting point about the fact that while there was help to buy, there was very little house building in her area.  The rationale for the help to buy scheme is that it has been introduced in response to a suggestion that there is a lack of confidence in the home building sector about the extent to which there is a mortgage-ready pool of purchasers available, if I can put it that way, and that this been holding back supply.  One can look at it as a case of the chicken and the egg, but, certainly, the help to buy scheme has been advanced on the basis that it will have a positive impact on supply.  I take the Senator's point that there may be a timelag, but it has been designed to be a supply enhancing mechanism.</p><p> The level of activity on local authority mortgages has been low in recent times.  Again, going back to the Senator's point, perhaps that is not surprising if there is a lack of supply, which, of course, there is.  That is the fundamental underlying problem with which we are trying to deal in Rebuilding Ireland.  Nonetheless, the local authority mortgage system has to be operated in a very careful and prudent way.  We do not want local authorities to get into the space of what might previously have been called sub-prime lending, giving rise to mortgage arrears issues down the road.  For somebody to be able to avail of a local authority mortgage, there is a requirement that he or she be able to show he or she has been refused a mortgage by two other financial institutions.  After that, there is a credit policy in place which has to be satisfied.  When one looks at the profile of the local authority mortgage book versus the private mortgage book, the incidence of arrears in the local authority mortgage book is significantly higher than it is for private institutions.  Therefore, potentially there is a lesson to be learned about whether the rules and criteria in advancing mortgages were what they should have been in the past.  There has certainly been a new credit policy in place for the past few years and it will have to continue to apply.</p></speech>

A lot of people have come to tell me that they are going to the banks but that they are not getting the money from them.  Because the new scheme has been brought forward recently after years without it, the Department needs to put a system in place because the local authority tenant who has been offered a house needs help to buy it.  As he or she is in a position to pay for it, it is the scheme that is wrong.  Will the Department look at these issues because they will come up more in the next year?  I believe it will start this year, but it will be a bigger issue next year.</p></speech>

There is a public consultation process and the review is to be finished by the end of the first quarter.</p></speech>

Mr. McCarthy gave the impression that these units were of high standard.  I am sure we have all been approached - I have - by people who provide these modular homes and they look perfectly good to me.  I do not know why there has been such a huge delay.  This irritates me, given that we are all talking about the crisis, yet, when we there is a rapid build solution, it does not happen.  There is something wrong in the system, given that it delivered houses for decades.  There seems to be a huge inability to get started or have anything delivered.  Many of us were very critical about this during the debate on the evictions Bill last night.  We have had various announcements of funding by several Ministers in this and the last two Governments, yet the local authorities state they have no money.  I am delighted that Mr. McCarthy said the process had been reduced from eight or nine stages to four, but four is still too many.  I acknowledge that he said it was down to one or two stages for smaller projects, but there are still too many stages.  He also said the Department wanted to consider having a common internal layout.  We have screaming for this for years.  Every time my council in County Tipperary wanted to build four houses in any village, it had to tender for architects to engage in design and procurement.  Surely we can have designs for one-bedroom, two-bedroom, three-bedroom, four-bedroom and even five-bedroom units and then adapt them.  Of course, there will be site and infrastructural issues, but, other than this, there should be a standard design.</p><p>There is a whole industry developing around architects and design for which there is no need and which must be cut out.  It is jobs for the boys in the industry, as far as I am concerned.  It is slowing down the entire process.  These are standard houses.  Once they are up to standard, they should be supported.</p><p> We ask about the voluntary sector.  Mr. Walsh said 21 out of 31 authorities have applied for this special fund.  I ask that members - me in any event - be provided with a list of them so that we know which ones did not apply.  I would also like to see similar figures for the voluntary sector.  I was very involved in the voluntary sector and I still am to a certain extent.  We were able to build a 14-bed scheme in a small rural community in 1996.  We had people in the houses within three years of our first meeting.  We were a group of laypersons.  There was not one professional in the group.  We had to hire in professional expertise and we did so.  At the time to which I refer, the county council was building a scheme for the elderly in the same field.  It ended up having 17 steps and parts to it.  We did not have one step in our project.  The county council's scheme took six years to build, with four different builders - all supervised by the council - involved.  The thing is rotten.  It is not working.  The Secretary General must sit up and take note.  I am glad to see he is present.  It is just not happening.  The county council tells us that it does not have the staff, which is true, but those involved will have to do a bit more as well, to be fair.  There is lethargy and ineptitude.  It is not acceptable to have to wait for so long in a crisis.</p><p> Mr. McCarthy mentioned the commercial hotels and said the Department wants to see their use as emergency accommodation stopped and 700 families removed from them.  On the day on which the announcement in this regard was made in the D&aacute;il, I was contacted by a developer in Dublin who told me the Department had bought a hotel that was for sale for that very reason.  One arm does not seem to know what the other is doing.  It appears to be absolute bedlam and chaos.  It is not functioning - full stop.  I am sorry to be so critical but that is my position.  I agree 100% with what Senator Murnane O'Connor said about families being removed from housing lists.  I know families that spent seven or eight years on housing waiting lists and then, because they went over the limit by a little, they were removed.  This was despite all the effort they make to be included on the main list and on the four-month waiting list and all the trauma they underwent.  More than 3,000 people are approved in Tipperary, a rural county.</p><p> Then there are individuals who want to build houses and have a few bob and couples who want to settle down and have their money and site secured.  They cannot get planning permission because local authorities are too rigid.  It is a real dog-in-the-manger job.  The county council, supervised by the Department, will not let them build and the Department will not build.  We will have to cut out all these stages.  The voluntary sector, at the time I was talking about, had one unit in the Department with which it could deal.  Before that, there were three or four.  Then it was cut down to one.  Do the witnesses know exactly how many different sections of the Department the voluntary groups have to deal with?  It is frustrating.  There are voluntary groups that have the capacity, enthusiasm and energy to build and they will and can do it.  They get local buy-in from people and get sites at better prices than local authorities.  The latter see every problem as the glass being half empty, whereas the glass is well over half full for private individuals who can do it because they are left to do it.</p><p> There is an awful lot of unshackling to be done.  There are too many jobs, too many conferences and too much HSE jargon.  I heard one of the witnesses talk about some kind of special group the Department set up to talk to local authorities.  I made a note of it.  It is definitely HSE jargon, and this contagion has spread throughout all the Departments.  It is a matter of pushing paper backward and forward and sweet Fanny Adams happening.  That is my honest position.  I am involved in construction and I know a bit about this matter.  I know that modular units can be built on site and that this can be done by private people, but we cannot do it.  We have all the strategies in the world but they are little good to people.</p><p> Then there are the evictions - the banks and the competitive aspect on the other side - whereby people are being dispossessed.  We saw yesterday that hundreds of farmers will face repossession because of another vulture fund.  More people are facing the housing crisis.  We were playing catch-up in any event but we will now be at a standstill or near standstill.  I could count on my fingers the number of houses built in Tipperary in the past three or four years.  I asked the Minister before Christmas, during the debate about rent control, to call in the county managers, make them accountable and say, "Come on lads, for God's sake.  We're at this for a number of years.  What the hell is going on?"  They are not held accountable.  It is not happening.  I am not being personally critical of any of the witnesses, but the system has become badly contaminated and is not working.  There is no efficiency.  As I said, voluntary groups are being starved.</p><p> The tenant purchase scheme was a disaster.  I think three were approved in my county in the last scheme.  That is not happening either.  How come every scheme that is introduced just does not happen?  Then there is NAMA, which recently told us it offered 1,600 units to councils.  I went about checking this out and I am confused at this stage.  We had letters back from NAMA, from my local authority - which was in a panic - and from the Housing Agency.  It is just a paper trail that we are all justifying.  Figures have been bandied about and people and families are being completely neglected.  We are part of it because we are responsible for holding the system accountable, but it is not accountable.  In fact, it has not been accountable for a long time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-18a.239" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1217" speakername="Barry Cowen" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017011800002#M00200"><p>I have one specific question.  The witnesses may have touched on it already in so far as they have elaborated on the commitments made in the document last year about the establishment of new teams within the Department to work closely with local authorities in order to try to fast-track house-building.  I tabled a parliamentary question some weeks ago to seek details of what might have been approved last year alone, whether in the first half of the year under Deputy Alan Kelly's previous magnificent plan or the new Rebuilding Ireland document produced in July.  I did so with a view to seeing how this acceleration was working or whether there was evidence on the ground identifying the urgency that we know, feel and see by virtue, as previous speakers, particularly my colleague in Carlow, have alluded to in our clinics when we meet and converse with constituents around our constituencies.  They are at their wits' end in an effort to see this urgency before their eyes, which, unfortunately, they do not see.  The Minister, in response, said to refer to the Department's website, which identifies the figures.  Looking at the figures I have since got from the website, from January 2015 to date, there have been 591 new schemes for approved housing bodies and 2,775 for local authorities.  I did not get a specific breakdown for 2016.  Mr. McCarthy then says that up to about 2,700 will move towards construction this year.  I know that he must qualify his remarks and use terms such as "move towards", but with the help of God these houses will proceed to construction.  This frightens me because it would seem to indicate - Mr. McCarthy can correct me if I am wrong and can prove that to be the case also- that there do not seem to have been any new approvals in 2016.</p> <p>  I am conscious that we are informed that the eight stages of the approval process have been reduced to four.  Much of what is contained in the figures I have acquired relates to schemes that might even predate 2015.  In my county, for example, two schemes for 60 houses were approved over two years ago and no ground has been broken yet.  People are watching these proceedings or they will read the record of the debate afterward.  We are merely trying to tease out where the problems and issues lie so that we can seek to have them resolved.  Our duty and responsibility is to act properly and effectively with the massive amount of funds that have been put before us, which I acknowledge and do not dispute.  I want this to succeed and I want Rebuilding Ireland to succeed.  We all want to see progress and to be in a position whereby in 12 months' time we can collectively acknowledge that progress has been made with the Minister with responsibility at the helm.  I have no problem with that.  We can play politics some other day.  We fight elections whenever we have to on the issues of the day.  However, this is the greatest emergency facing the country and we must deal with it urgently by means of an evidence-based approach.  I do not see evidence-based figures and statistics before me that I can relay to those constituents whom I meet weekly and for whom I cannot outline any progress.  It is hugely frustrating and annoying and deeply disturbing that these people are attending my clinics - I am sure the position is the same for other members - and I cannot show the urgency I think is necessary and I would hope to see in the context of replies to parliamentary questions I have tabled.  Could the witnesses clarify the new projects, proposals or developments that were approved last year and that are proceeding?  If they cannot, I ask them to make the information available to me as soon as possible.</p><p>If there are only 2,700 this year, and the plan refers to 1,000 to 3,000 up to 2018 and increasing to 5,000 in the years thereafter to 2021, there should be many more in these responses on the website, if it were to reflect the urgency and the effort that is being made.  As Deputy Mattie McGrath said, let us analyse who is and is not performing and let us start holding people to account to ensure the progress that is sought is made.</p></speech>

Before that, in my earlier remarks I referred to the meeting of 7 December last.  I accept the Secretary General's response.  I have no problem with it and I am glad he explained it.</p> <p>  Mr. McCarthy stated with regard to pillar 2: "While the final detailed figures for social housing output will be collated and published over the coming weeks, provisional figures for 2016 indicate that in excess of 18,300 households have had their social housing needs met under the range of social housing schemes, ahead of the target...".  There are 31 local authorities in the country.  It would be helpful for us to have the figures for 2016 when they are finally collated.  These are the hard facts we must deal with and the figures are evidence based.  Perhaps Mr. McCarthy would do that.</p> <p>  Mr. McCarthy also mentioned, and Senator Coffey raised this issue, that "On the infrastructure front, 21 local authorities have applied for funding under the &euro;200 million local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, ..." and he went on to outline the information on that.  We also heard from Mr. Walsh that 74 projects were involved.  Senator Coffey's question was not answered.  What 21 of the 31 local authorities are involved?  Can we have details on that?  This is the type of detail that local councillors will contact us about when they are seeking to find out the position, because they hear various things.  We must make more facts available.  There are 31 councils in the country and 21 were involved, so perhaps we could have those facts.</p> <p>  Mr. Walsh made a good and important point about the cost-benefit analysis of this.  I have no problem with, or ideological hang ups about, private developers but we are talking about private developers seeking this money.  They talk about it publicly and we know private developers in our constituencies who are seeking this money.  However, we must be careful about using public funds to assist and support private development over and above local authority or co-operative development.  It is an important issue.  There is a major strategic development zone, SDZ, in south County Dublin that may or may not seek some of this money.  We must be careful.  It would be wholly appropriate that a full cost-benefit analysis be carried out in this regard because this is public money and we have a public housing list and social obligations.  Perhaps the Secretary General would provide us with the list of 21 local authorities involved.</p> <p>  Regarding the Secretary General's progress report that accompanied the papers we received today, pillar 3 refers to building more homes.  One of the actions behind schedule is No. 3.8: "We will develop and publish an implementation plan to prioritise implementation of key recommendations within the An Bord Plean&aacute;la review".  The An Bord Plean&aacute;la review has been completed.  Can the Secretary General explain the delay?  If something is behind schedule, there should be another column to explain how it will be brought back on schedule.  Will this be dealt with fully in the next quarter?</p> <p>  Finally, with regard to pillar 4, there is another action, No. 4.6, behind schedule.  It states: "We will introduce a new affordable rental scheme to enhance the capacity of the private rented sector to provide quality and affordable accommodation for households currently paying a disproportionate amount of disposable income on rent."  That is one of the key issues debated in the legislation, but again it is behind schedule.  Will the Secretary General give the reasons for it being behind schedule and, more importantly, explain how he will get it back on schedule?  If this committee is to be successful in terms of scrutiny, we must work together.  This is not a case of any of us being against each other.  I echo the point Deputy Cowen made in that I, too, would be delighted if this could be delivered.  This is the Government's policy.  It is being funded and supported by the Oireachtas, so there is great consensus on it being delivered.  We wish to be helpful on these matters, so perhaps the Secretary General will elaborate on the questions I raised.</p></speech>

In response to Senator Boyhan, where any actions in a quarterly progress report are delayed, the intention is that we would give an update on those in the following progress report.  There were five or six actions in the third quarter reports that were delayed and we will give an update on all of those in the next quarterly report in the next few weeks.  I believe they are almost all done.  The Senator mentioned the An Bord Plean&aacute;la action, in particular.  That implementation plan has been published and is on the Department's website.  There is no problem with providing the Senator with the list of the 21 local authorities that have applied for funding under the LIHAF.</p> <p>  Regarding Deputy Cowen's points about ramping up progress, in an earlier response I referred to all of the projects that are in the system at present.  When something gets approved at stage 1 it must go through the design and procurement process to get it to construction and to get boots on the ground.  Over the course of 2016 projects would have moved through that approval process very extensively.  We will publish a list of all the projects - we are currently updating it - and their position in the various stages.  We will publish that on our website and send a copy to the committee at the same time.  To give the Deputy a sense of the activity ramping up, in 2016 just over 50 construction projects with approximately 700 units would have started construction on site.  On site starts, on the basis of the progress of projects to date and the work that local authorities will carry out, we estimate there will be approximately 200 projects with 2,800 units starting on site this year.</p><p>With the progressive ramping up from last year to this year, it demonstrates a significant uptick.</p></speech>

For us to fully recognise the improvements he states are taking place, we must see on a quarterly basis figures such as those, with details of stages.  We had eight stages and that is down to four.

There has been much work over the course of 2016 and the framework has been in place since just before Christmas.  I am sure some of the people mentioned by the Deputy may very well have participated in that process.</p> <p>  The Deputy indicated that when he spoke with local authorities they reported they have no funding.  The funding for housing has increased very significantly.  Last year it increased to &euro;940 million across the country for housing and this year it is going up to &euro;1.3 billion.  We have given a very clear message to local authorities that we are in the business of progressing projects as expeditiously as we can.  There is an overall commitment of &euro;5.5 billion under the Rebuilding Ireland plan up to 2021, so there is forward visibility for local authorities that commitment to funding exists to get projects delivered.  That is the business we are in and it is the business we want all local authorities to be in.</p></speech>

Equally, I have had a number of cases presented to me about issues stuck in the Department.  In one case it was said something was stuck in the Department for six years but when I explored the issue I found an initial application came in six years beforehand but there was no money for it and the local authority was told that.  There were other examples of contact and there were responses to local authorities within days about issues.  I am not saying the system is perfect, as it is far from it, and we will continue to work to make it better.  The local authorities will be required to work with us as part of that.</p></speech>

On the Airbnb issue, yesterday there were 1,500 properties available to rent in Dublin on the market and 6,500 properties on the Airbnb website.  I know a large number are for short letting but a very large number are for long-term letting.  My worry is that if the working group only reports back in the second quarter, we are really only looking at regulations for September, October or November.  Is there any way the working group can be brought forward or the gap between the report and regulations could be sped up?  It is an urgent issue in terms of supply.</p> <p>  I am sure Ms Mary Hurley is pulling out her hair with regard to the approval process.  I will make a comparison.  We rushed through very substantial and controversial legislation to fast-track the private sector planning process because of an 84-week delay.  The very first Part 8 provisions I voted on at South Dublin County Council in 2013 were for 11 houses and they have still not been built.  It is 160 weeks since we voted on that planning permission.  I know that is an extreme case but I do not get the sense, whether it is from the Minister or officials, of the same urgency in tackling the considerable delay in the four-stage process as we got we got with the private sector 100-unit plus proposal.  I share everybody's frustration.  I do not care who is responsible and this is not really about blaming the officials or local authorities.  This needs an urgent solution, as waiting 160 weeks for 11 houses is just insane.  I am sure Ms Hurley would be the first to say that privately.  We need some movement on that.</p> <p>  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, confirmed in a reply to a parliamentary question from Deputy Pearse Doherty before Christmas that AIB and Permanent TSB were making available two blocks of properties totalling 1,000 vacant units to the Housing Agency, clearly in response to the agency's &euro;70 million fund.  The Minister confirmed that money for 200 of those units has been approved.  I have asked the Minister responsible for housing, Deputy Coveney, twice in parliamentary questions why funding has been made available for only 200 and he has evaded the answer twice.  If we are looking at rapid build and emptying 700 families from hotels, if there are 1,000 vacant units not on the private market - so they are not competing with first-time buyers - why are we not buying them?  Perhaps some are not suitable or they are too expensive.  Maybe some are in the wrong place.  The committee should get a list or some information on this so we have a clear explanation on the issue.</p> <p>  I would like an update, whether in writing after the meeting or here, on the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, funding for social housing under the plan and the ongoing debacle of the Irish League of Credit Unions.  I know it is not primarily stuck in the Department but any information would be useful.  On the housing needs assessment, we have had a 30% drop from the figures that local authorities were giving to a number of us through freedom of information requests in May last year to the September deadline.  In my local authority there was a 40% drop on the number of people on the list.  It cannot be the case that 40% of the 9,000 households under South Dublin County Council had housing needs met between May and September.  Some have gone to the housing assistance payment and some have fallen foul of the stricter application of the financial threshold, which was wrongly applied much more strictly this time around.  Dublin City Council has given until 31 March for people to contact the council to try to rectify any unfair removal from the list.  Is that a Dublin City Council issue or could a note be sent to all local authorities to say they should apply that measure?  This has been the single largest drop in the housing list seen in any recent housing needs assessment and I am very worried about it.</p> <p>  I have other questions but I will submit them as parliamentary questions.  We need a separate and dedicated meeting on the 29 actions in private rental strategy as we have not had a substantive debate about it.  If it gets mushed into the next quarterly review, we will not deal with it.  I hope we can facilitate a dedicated discussion on that before the end of February.</p></speech>

I hope I will not repeat what others have said and will try to focus on the social housing pillar.  Homelessness is an international problem and is evident in every country.  A baby died on the streets in Portland, Oregon, which is in the richest country on the planet, and homelessness is at a phenomenal level there.  The root of the problem is the aversion to public home building compared with the 1970s, 1980s and previously.</p><p>From looking at the figures the poverty of ambition is incredible if one considers that we have a housing emergency.  The best-case scenario is 2,800 public houses, according to Mr. Walsh's presentation.  I also cannot get over why it is not targeted.  We know where the homeless crisis is worse and I am getting tired of saying this.  If one looks at the figures for the area breakdown for the first nine months of 2016 - figures which went very quietly up onto the website yesterday by the way - 42 social housing units were completed in the Dublin City Council area.  We know the homeless crisis is everywhere but as it is actually focused in particular parts of Dublin, why is the Department not targeting the key black spots with a huge amount of social housing and other measures?  There have been 36 units completed in Fingal.  I was a member of the local authority in Fingal for 11 years.  There are 200 families in emergency accommodation in that area at present and another 98 families - as far as I know - who are homeless but not in emergency accommodation.  Approximately 300 of the 760 families who are homeless are in Fingal and yet a paltry amount of houses are targeted to be built there and not one in the greater Blanchardstown area, where I guarantee most of the 300 families are from.  Can someone from the Department explain that please? Fingal County Council has two sites left in the Blanchardstown area where a lot of the housing crisis is.  Some 40% of the homeless in Dublin are from Dublin West.  I and other Deputies get a lot of visits from them.  There are two sites and they have not even been developed.  I would like a written case study, by a Department representative here, as to why not.  The 20 modular houses in Wellview were talked about 13 months ago.  The area is the most deprived area of the constituency and now modular houses are being lumped in.  I am not going to oppose them as anything is better than nothing - but where are they?  Let us stop calling them rapid build because that is a bit a joke at this stage.  They are not so rapid houses.  It was 13 months ago and where are they?  Of the two sites, a plan for Church Road was brought before the council, again I believe it was more than one year ago, and there is still no sign of any houses.  There is one site left beside Wellview, which is called lands north of Wellview.  Could the witnesses investigate why Fingal County Council has not bothered its barney developing that site when it has a homeless epidemic all around it?<br/><br/>I do not like blaming the council or officials.  Political decisions are made but the councils are telling us that the Department is telling them there is no shortage of money.  We know the tender process is a big problem - not the planning process <i>per se </i>but the fact that it must be put out to tender and this delays some of the process.  I believe that people should have an answer as to why, in the homeless black spot in Dublin, there has not been a house built by the council in years - since I was on the council actually.  Why have those two sites not been fast-tracked and moved?  I would have thought that if the Department wanted its figures to go up, it would target where the need is greatest.  Cork city has had one council house provided in the whole of the first nine months on 2016.  There have been 20 units built in South Dublin County Council and 16 in Limerick.  I feel for the departmental representatives as I would hate to be coming before this committee because that is an embarrassment, given the scale of the problem.  Last night the Minister said it takes time to build houses and yet, my point is, that the available sites are not even being developed by the council. <br/><br/>The other key problem we have is that NAMA, which is State run, is selling off so much land at the moment to vulture funds.  This is land that would definitely be needed.  If one considers the greater Blanchardstown area, which is the fastest growing area of the last ten or 15 years, the council sites are minuscule at this point.  It is, therefore, only with NAMA that we could build enough houses in the area.  NAMA is building lovely mansions up in Castleknock that are unaffordable to the vast majority.  In one deal in December 2015, a US vulture fund called Lone Star Funds bought 20% of the residential development land in Dublin.  That is absolutely incredible given that Ireland has a housing emergency.  The sites were &euro;19,000 and now they are being sold for &euro;100,000.  Nothing is being done by the Government to stop the vulture funds buying up all the valuable land that we could have used for social and affordable housing.<br/><br/>With regard to the homelessness figures two different accounts were given on the &quot;Tonight with Vincent Browne&quot; programme in on 4 January.  The Minister for State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, Deputy Damien English said &quot;... by June next year there will be nobody living in emergency accommodation ... we will fix this.&quot;  He also said that he, the Minister, Deputy Coveney and the Department are confident they will have tackled that end of it by June.  Which June are we talking about? Are we talking about getting people out of emergency accommodation?</p></speech>

I wish to clarify that yes, the commitment in Rebuilding Ireland is to be using commercial hotels for emergency homeless accommodation only in exceptional circumstances by the middle of this year.  That is the commitment.  With regard to prioritising a number of different strands of activity are being deployed to be able to respond to priority areas and priority issues, particularly in homelessness.  For example, that is why there is a HAP scheme for people who are homeless operating in Dublin with greater flexibilities.  It is not operating anywhere else.  The scheme significantly achieved its target last year.  It applies across the four Dublin local authority areas.  There is a significant programme of projects at various stages across the Dublin local authorities, including at construction stage.  The rapid build programme will continue to add to that.  The question of why local authorities decide to bring forward some sites and not others, we would say to the local authority that it is for the local authority to decide and prioritise itself.  They are the local authorities for their own areas.  We ask the local authority to come forward with proposals.  On many occasions I get to hear public representatives - quite legitimately - challenging the Department for being too prescriptive and providing one-size solutions across the State.  There is a balance to be struck and in doing so we rely on local authorities as the housing authority for their area to decide where within their area they should prioritise.  Quite legitimately I would have no answer if councillors in a local authority were to ask the Department why the Department had chosen an area or that the local authority should prioritise one area over another.  It is for the local authority to decide which of its projects it wants to bring forward, and in what sequence, as part of its overall strategy for responding to housing need in its area.  This will be in the update when it is published.</p> <p>  There is a range of projects across the four Dublin local authorities.  To clarify for Deputy &Oacute; Broin, I can assure him that whatever frustration he senses my colleague might be facing in this regard, it is shared - with 50% more - on my part because like the Deputy, I am interested in where the problem is for the purposes of resolving it.  There is no point in different people going around the place saying "It is stuck here and it is stuck there"; we need to be clear on how we can actually move and what it requires.</p><p>Deputy McGrath was offended by the language I used but I am talking about integrated engagement with the local authorities, one on one, so that we are in a position collectively, from their side and ours, to address the issues in a streamlined and efficient way.</p></speech>

Everyone here is asking the same question, namely, why is there a gap between the councils and the money that the Department says is available.  How much has the Department given them?  We want to go back and tell them the Department says they have X million euro and ask why they are not developing those sites.</p></speech>

Now that the 2016 social housing needs assessment has been completed we had indicated we would revisit those targets for all local authorities prioritising where the needs were greatest as between the different local authorities.  We have equally said to local authorities that if they have proposals which they felt they could not accommodate within the budgetary allocation provided to them they should come and talk to us.  We have said this ever since the targets were first set in 2015 because things move at different paces.  Things that we might expect to move at a particular pace in one local authority for one reason or another might not do so.  The last thing we want is to be in a situation where collectively we are not using all the valuable resources that have been made available to us for meeting housing needs.</p> <p>  Last year, through that agile management of projects that were moving slowly and being able to move in with other delivery mechanisms, we spent our entire housing budget.  We have a significant increase in that housing budget this year and aim again to spend wisely every single euro that is available to us.  It will require ongoing agile management.  I am not sure whether Deputy Coppinger was here earlier but in respect of recognising the priority and pressures in Dublin we engage on an incredibly regular basis with the four Dublin local authorities at chief executive and director of housing level in order to ensure we are doing everything we possibly can to be able to work with them to deliver on their housing programmes.  That is the business we are in and will continue to be in.</p></speech>

We received apologies from Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile.  I do not know if there are any other apologies that members would like to offer.</p> <p>  Before introducing our guest, I take this opportunity to welcome the members back to the committee post the Christmas recess and to extend very best wishes to each of them for 2017.  Hopefully, as a committee, we have a busy and successful year.</p> <p>  The purpose of this part of the meeting is to have an engagement with Mr. Philip O'Leary, chairperson designate of the Legal Aid Board.  On behalf of the committee, I thank Mr. O'Leary for attending and I extend a warm welcome to him.  The format of the meeting is that Mr. O'Leary will be invited to make a brief opening statement and this will be followed by a question-and-answer session with members.</p> <p>  Before I begin, I must draw the attention of the witness to the position on privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded that, under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I invite Mr. O'Leary to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

Is m&oacute;r an on&oacute;ir dom a bheith os comhair an choiste.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeidh an coiste s&aacute;sta liom mar chathaoirleach ar an An Bord Um Ch&uacute;namh Dl&iacute;thi&uacute;il agus go mbeidh me &aacute;balta aon cheist ata acu a fhreagairt.  I am humbled and honoured to have been nominated by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality as chairperson of the Legal Aid Board for a five-year term and to be here before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality.  My appointment as a member of the Legal Aid Board, together with that of the other members, took effect from 8 November 2016.  I am grateful for the responsible role given to me and I look forward to the challenges that will arise.</p> <p>  I served a full five-year term as an ordinary member of the previous board.  That board's term of office expired on 10 October 2016 and I am the sole member to have been reappointed.  I served on a number of the board's committees and I chaired its audit and risk committee.  My experience as a member of the previous board has given me a very good understanding of both the organisation and the challenges it faces and I believe it also ensures both corporate memory and good governance practice.</p> <p>  I am a solicitor with over 30 years' experience in private practice.  My professional involvement continues with the firm of FitzGerald Solicitors in Cork, of which I have been the managing partner for over ten years.  I currently practise law, particularly in the area of commercial and private client.  For the benefit of the committee, I set out my involvement in areas of legal practice, community and sport.</p> <p>  Working in a busy legal practice, with 13 solicitors and 19 support staff, means that I am experienced in overseeing a range of areas, including commercial, child care, family law and private client.  I practise law with the benefit of up-to-date technology and case management.  Part of my work involves taking a multidisciplinary approach and directing efficient resources for timely and successful outcomes.</p> <p>  I come from a modest background and I understand that poverty is not just about a lack of money, it is also about a lack of access to opportunities, education and justice.  I continue to have a deep empathy and understanding of the clients of the Legal Aid Board who are persons with modest incomes and I understand the importance of access to justice for all, which is an important part of any functioning democracy.</p> <p>  I was involved with the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, in Cork for over 15 years.  I chaired the Cork organisation when I was a student in UCC many years ago.  I was a founding member and director of the Farranree Sheltered Housing Association, FSHA, a not-for-profit body providing accommodation to the elderly in the community.  The FSHA developed and built 39 new units locally and continues to provide sheltered accommodation.</p> <p>  I understand the importance of voluntary work in the community and, like most Cork people, I am passionate about hurling.  I am a member of Inniscarra GAA club and I am actively involved in coaching its under-age teams.  Mol an &oacute;ige agus tiocfaidh s&iacute;.</p> <p>  As I said, I have been a member of the Legal Aid Board since December 2011.  The Legal Aid Board commenced in 1979.  Its principal function has been to provide civil legal aid services to persons of modest means.  The board was established as a statutory body on foot of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995.  It provides legal services using a mixed model of delivery &ndash; it employs solicitors and support staff in law centres and it refers cases to private solicitors on a fee-per-case basis.  There are 30 law centres located throughout the country along with three specialist offices.</p> <p>  The board's head office is located in Cahirciveen, County Kerry, with some functions being provided from an office in Dublin.  The move to Cahirciveen was one of the early decentralisations and the permanent office opened there in 2002.  The board has a full-time equivalent staff of 425, of whom just over 300 work in law centres - 120 of these occupy solicitor positions - approximately 40 in the family mediation offices, 21 of whom are mediators, and over 80 in head office support functions.</p><p>The board's grant for 2017 is just under &euro;39 million.  The grant constitutes approximately 93% of the board&rsquo;s income.<br/><br/>Over 17,000 clients applied for civil legal aid in 2016.  The gateway to civil legal aid services is the law centre, where the vast majority of persons make their applications.  There is a merits test and there are financial eligibility criteria.  Most persons who receive legal services are required to pay a contribution.  Most areas of civil law come within the ambit of the Civil Legal Aid Act and the approach that the legislation takes is that a matter comes within the Act unless it is specifically excluded.  In practice, the majority of persons seeking civil legal aid services from the board, do so in respect of family problems.<br/><br/>My work with the Legal Aid Board included membership of the appeals committee, which deals with appeals on the refusal of legal aid certificates by the executive, and I have adjudicated on over 500 appeals to date.  I also chaired the audit and risk management committee.  This entailed supervising the overall risk management strategy for the board's operations.  My private practice experience has been instrumental in shaping the risk management strategies of the board in the practice of law over wide ranging areas.  I have also advised on the important liaison with the Comptroller and Auditor General's office on the annual audit of the board's activities.<br/><br/>The board's law centres have waiting lists, which is a continuing challenge.  In some ways the recession was the perfect storm for the organisation as demand for services increased very significantly at a time of constrained resources.  On 1 January 2014, there were over 5,000 applicants waiting for legal services.  The figure is now under 2,000, which is a welcome improvement.  Urgent cases are prioritised.  Nevertheless, the fact that there are persons waiting is not ideal.  I wish to work with the board and to support the staff in continuing to reduce the waiting list to a manageable number.<br/><br/>I have mentioned the financial eligibility criteria, which have not been significantly revised in over ten years.  I wish to examine the criteria to ensure that those who genuinely cannot afford to pay for legal services are not disqualified for financial reasons, particularly in cases where working people of modest incomes are provided with additional State support, for example, the family income supplement, thus potentially creating a poverty trap.<br/><br/>Change in the legal arena is ongoing and some of it impacts on the board&rsquo;s business.  The board is a key player in the recently launched Abhaile scheme which aims to support, with financial and legal advice, those at risk of having their homes repossessed.  There is a statutory provision, yet to be commenced, to transfer responsibility for the Mental Health Commission&rsquo;s legal aid scheme to the board.  There are also significant legal aid provisions in the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015 that have yet to be commenced.  I see the board as having an important role in ensuring that these and other similar changes are given effect in a manner that best serves the client.<br/><br/>In November 2011, a legislative amendment transferred responsibility for the State-funded family mediation services to the board.  The rationale for this was that there was considerable scope for synergising the delivery of civil legal aid services in family cases with the provision of a family mediation service.  The board&rsquo;s family mediation services are provided out of nine full-time and eight part-time offices.  Mediation services are provided without reference to a person&rsquo;s means and are free of charge.  The board opened its first co-located family mediation office and law centre in Jervis Street last year.  There are plans to co-locate further offices.  The board also has mediators situated full-time in the District Family Court in Dublin.  We can do more to divert those experiencing difficult family problems from the adversarial court process to the process of mediation and I wish to work with the board, the staff and other stakeholders to ensure that real options are available to those experiencing relationship breakdown and that the court process is not simply seen as the automatic default.<br/><br/>In November 2010, the Government transferred the responsibility for the administration of criminal legal aid from the Department of Justice and Equality to the board.  To date, responsibility for three <i>ad hoc</i>schemes, namely, the Criminal Assets Bureau legal aid scheme, the legal aid &ndash; custody issues scheme and the Garda station advice scheme, have been transferred.  The transfer of responsibility for the main criminal legal aid scheme requires a statutory amendment.  I understand that a criminal legal aid Bill incorporating the amendment is likely to be published shortly.  I want the board to work with the Department on the forthcoming criminal legal aid legislation.  This legislation will transfer responsibility for the administration of criminal legal aid in addition to putting in place reforms to the system.  The expenditure on criminal legal aid in any year is approximately &euro;50 million and a priority, when the board has responsibility, will be to ensure good governance.<br/><br/>A longer term objective I have for the new board is to have a more holistic look at the broader access to justice landscape and to examine if the board is playing its role as effectively as it could or if there should be a refocus in terms of the work it does and does not do.  I am aware of significant changes in the legal aid landscape that have either occurred or are being planned in neighbouring jurisdictions.  I am not suggesting that we should follow some of the actions that they have taken but to quote Francis Bacon, &quot;Things alter for the worse spontaneously, if they not be altered for the better designedly&quot;.  I am keen to ensure that there is coherence and logic to the legal aid regime we have and that it continues to contribute meaningfully to access to justice.  Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il libh bheith ag &eacute;isteacht liom inni&uacute; agus ta me s&aacute;sta iarracht a dheanamh chun aon cheist a fhreagr&uacute;. </p></speech>

Three members have indicated that they wish to speak.  I call Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-18a.285" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1376" speakername="Lorraine Clifford Lee" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017011800002#B00300"><p>I thank Mr. O'Leary for attending and I wish him the best of luck during his tenure at the Legal Aid Board.  I have three questions.  First, Mr. O'Leary referred to the Abhaile scheme.  The Legal Aid Board is responsible for three component parts of the scheme.  How many practitioners have signed up for the scheme and what is the geographical spread of the practitioners?  My second question is about the minimum contribution, which currently stands at &euro;130.  Are there plans to reduce the minimum contribution, given that many people find it difficult to pay it?  Can Mr. O'Leary provide some statistics on the number of waivers of the minimum contribution that were granted in the past year?  My third question relates to the waiting times, a matter to which Mr. O'Leary also referred.  Are there plans to open the private practitioner panel further to alleviate the waiting times and, if not, what other plans does the board have in that regard?  Also, perhaps Mr. O'Leary could indicate the approximate average waiting time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-18a.286" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Philip O'Leary" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017011800002#B00400"><p>I thank the Senator for her good wishes, which are appreciated.  The Abhaile scheme was introduced in October 2016, so it is relatively new.  The scheme is being co-ordinated with the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS.  The involvement of the Legal Aid Board is that if MABS decides that a person is entitled to legal advice, a voucher is issued which entitles the person to get legal advice from a private practitioner.  I am not aware of the number of practitioners who have signed up to the scheme today, but that information will be furnished to the committee as necessary.  Approximately 1,000 vouchers for legal advice have issued since the scheme opened and about 450 of the vouchers have been redeemed to date.</p> <p>  The Abhaile scheme also deals with personal insolvency matters.  Under new legislation, there is now a facility to challenge a personal insolvency application if the lending institutions do not agree with the proposal.  The method of doing that is an appeal to the Circuit Court.  A number of legal aid certificates have been granted in respect of such appeals before the Circuit Court.  The most recent figures I saw show that between 16 and 20 of those legal aid certificates had been issued.</p><p>I am also aware of four certificates having been issued for an appeal from the Circuit Court to the High Court on points of law.  The third point on the Abhaile scheme is that a duty solicitor has now been put in place in the office of the repossession registrar and the courts in order that persons coming before the courts who are often unrepresented will be given the opportunity to receive some legal advice and directed towards the various schemes now available.  </p><p> The Senator also asked me about the minimum contribution.  Currently, it is &euro;130.  There are no plans to reduce it, but, as I said in my address, the question of eligibility for legal aid is being considered by the board.  It was put in place in November and we have had one board meeting so far.  There will be another tomorrow and on the agenda is the question of eligibility and putting proposals to the Minister in due course.  On the waiver of contributions, a waiver scheme operates and is often applied in domestic violence cases.  I have looked at the agenda for the meeting tomorrow and that issue will be before the board for consideration.  I do not want to pre-empt its decision, but the matter will be given a sympathetic hearing.  </p><p> The final question the Senator asked was about waiting times and the use of the private practitioner scheme.  The board operates a number of private practitioner schemes.  The one of particular interest is probably in respect of District Court matters, including domestic violence, custody and access.  The scheme is utilised as best as possible within the budget to alleviate waiting lists.  We are constrained in the use of the scheme, but in any given year approximately 5,000 cases are referred to private practitioners to try to alleviate waiting lists.</p></speech>

I was actually more interested in the use of the private practitioner scheme in dealing with Circuit Court matters, including divorce and judicial separation.  With regard to the waiver scheme, will Mr. O'Leary come back with some figures and percentages for the numbers of waivers issued?</p></speech>

In the case of the Circuit Court the scheme has had limited application.  It is more expensive from the point of view of the board's expenditure, but, where possible and necessary, it has been implemented to alleviate waiting lists, particularly in centres where they longer.</p></speech>

Second, to put it in layman's terms, he or she has to establish he or she has a reasonable chance of success in going to court and that a reasonable person with reasonable means would take on the case.</p></speech>

The limit is something that needs to be looked at.  It is currently a disposable income of &euro;18,000 per annum.  I mentioned in my opening address that sometimes the State gave with one hand and took with the other.  If one is working, on a very low income and in receipt of family income supplement, it can push him or her over the eligibility limit.  While we are trying to assist people on low incomes, they might lose out on other benefits, including legal aid.</p></speech>

It has now settled back to a figure in the range of 16,000 to 17,000 per annum.  In recent months, because of the introduction of the Abhaile scheme, there has been a huge increase in the number of applications.  It is a scheme that is very welcome and worthwhile.</p></speech>

In many repossession cases, in which houses were being repossessed by financial institutions, there was a low turn-up rate for borrowers because they could not afford to pay or were in denial and did not want to go through the process.  Because of the new scheme, there is more engagement.  The MABS and the personal insolvency service have a person for every county registrar list and cases in the Circuit Court and the level of engagement with distressed borrowers has increased substantially in the past few months, which is very good.</p></speech>

The budget for 2017 has been increased by &euro;1.7 million, which is a welcome addition.  The criminal legal aid system effectively involves private practitioners who apply to participate in the scheme.  The board's involvement is in the governance and administration of the scheme.  It is a big scheme which has a big budget which exceeds the current civil legal aid budget.  It involves considerable responsibility in terms of its governance and administration.</p></speech>

I am more interested in how long people have been waiting than in how many are on the list.  The number on the list is determined by demand, which can vary from centre to centre and depend on what is happening in society and the legal arena.  The real question is for how long people have been waiting to get a service.  The board's objective is to have a substantive service available to people within four months of being seen.  As we are not meeting that objective in every centre in the country, we are trying to reach that point.  In addition, during the term of the last board we introduced what was known as a triage system, whereby if a person did not receive a substantive service within four months, we would try to get to a position where he or she would see a solicitor within six weeks to receive advice.  It means that at least we are identifying the difficult cases and giving them attention early in the process in order that access to justice is real and meaningful.</p></speech>

I have never met or represented anybody who managed to receive civil legal aid.  That is the problem.  Let us be clear about this.  Most people cannot access civil legal aid.  That has been my experience.  That is not Mr. O'Leary's fault and I am not blaming him or personalising the matter; it is just an evaluation of the process.  There must be a complete overhaul of how the system is administered.  Is it not the case that the law centres are the only places that deal with civil legal aid applications and that for an ordinary practising solicitor to qualify or be vetted and approved, as appropriate, to provide free legal aid, he or she must undertake a huge volume of free work to such an uneconomical level that most do not do it?  I am not sure, but is that a correct characterisation of the process?</p> <p>  On the number on the waiting list, there are obviously financial and repossession cases, but there are also family law issues.  In many instances, my experience has been that women in a vulnerable position have not been able to receive free civil legal aid where timing is of the essence and there is a certain urgency.  In these circumstances having a waiting list is not acceptable.  What is the story in that regard?  It appears that there are very few people who can provide a civil legal aid service.  The other aspect is repossession cases.  The number turning up in such cases without representation is growing.  Is Mr. O'Leary saying there is now somebody in every court who will go to every person involved in a repossession case and say, "I am the local fellow here and if you want some legal advice before the case is heard, you can talk to me"?  If that is the case, I was not aware of it.</p> <p>  On criminal legal aid, I do not wish to be derogatory, but from visiting courthouses in many parts of the country it is something of a gravy train for solicitors who take on free criminal legal aid cases.  The same solicitor stands up in every case.  It is cursory representation.  One gets the impression that he or she does not know the person involved and does not care.  He or she makes the same points in every case.  It is like a treadmill and completely unacceptable.  What level of oversight is there in that regard?  A legal firm which is seeking to be approved by the Legal Aid Board must make an application in every jurisdiction.  Can that system be overhauled?  There should be just one application to cover all counties, rather than having a solicitor vetted in each county.  It is increasingly becoming a problem in the District Court around the country.  Because of a certain cosy atmosphere in these courts, a defendant might wish to be represented by someone from outside the jurisdiction, yet his or her legal firm in Dublin, for example, must be vetted in Clare, Kerry or another county.  From the point of view of simplifying the bureaucracy involved, surely one application should cover every county.  Would that not help to streamline the process and save an enormous amount of administrative resources?  It is a practical suggestion.</p> <p>  In addition, will Mr. O'Leary deal with the legal aid custody advice scheme?  I understand the fees being paid under the scheme are incredibly low.  They almost act as a deterrent in making it difficult for legal practitioners who might wish to take on prisoner cases.  If they wish to do so, there is a substantial cost involved because the fees are lower.  Is there a difference between the fees paid under the scheme and those paid under other schemes?  Will Mr. O'Leary outline the fees paid in such cases or how it works?</p></speech>

She raised a number of issues.  </p> <p>  On criminal legal aid, as the board has not yet taken over the substantive scheme, I do not have the details.  </p> <p>  A sum of &euro;1.4 million was spent last year under the custody scheme.  I cannot give the figures for the individual payments per attendance.  </p> <p>  The criminal legal aid scheme has served the country well for the more than 30 years it has been in existence.  Thankfully, tere are very few cases involving a miscarriage of justice in this country.  We have seen miscarriages of justice in other jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom and America.  Our system is robust.  A defendant has a constitutional right to select his or her own solicitor.  When the Deputy says that sometimes the same person stands up in the District Court, it is because the defendant has sought that particular individual who might be very well versed in the particular area of law.  I practised for approximately 15 years in the District Court, but that was some time ago.</p> <p>  On the numbers receiving civil legal aid and the Deputy's observation that people do not qualify, the number who qualified last year was just over 17,000.  The majority of those cases involved family law matters, including family disputes, domestic violence, custody, access or child care, and take up a considerable length of time.</p><p>The question of priority and waiting lists is important.  There is no doubt that cases requiring priority, such as domestic violence, are given urgent priority and effectively no waiting lists will apply to a person who is in need of advice on a domestic violence matter.  Where a child has been taken into care or where a statutory provision under the Statute of Limitations arises, the cases are carefully examined by the board and are prioritised - I can guarantee the committee of that.</p><p> Reference was made to free work by practitioners to get on the civil legal aid scheme.  First, the civil legal aid scheme is not free.  Contributions are paid.  My understanding of the civil legal aid scheme is that any practitioner can apply to go on the panel if he has certain expertise in the family area - that is where most of the referrals go.</p></speech>

I know of his voluntary work in the community, especially relating to the Farranree Sheltered Housing Association.  Mr. O'Leary is the founder and chairman.  It is still thriving in the area and is a most welcome development.</p> <p>  I wish to make an observation arising through my work in my clinics.  We refer people to the Legal Aid Board.  They might have a pending court case.  I echo the comments of Mr. O'Leary with regard to waiting times for certain types of cases, such as domestic violence or child custody access cases.  Our experience in the Cork office is that people will always get representation and advice and there is no waiting list.  If there is an ongoing case, it may be transferred to a different practitioner but the initial court case will always be dealt with efficiently.  That should be noted.</p> <p>  I know the board will be examining income thresholds.  There is a cliff-edge threshold and if a person is &euro;100 over the threshold, it is a problem.  I presume no discretion is available to the board to consider cases in the whole.  If not, could that change if the Minister so wished?  Could the Minister give some level of discretion to the board?</p> <p>  The other area I am keen to touch on is the family mediation service.  How successful has the service been in dealing with waiting lists?  In my experience of cases, especially family law cases, a person who approaches the board is diverted to the family mediation service.  It may be dealt with there without having to go to court proceedings.  Does the board have figures or statistics on how successful it is and whether it will be expanded?  I realise it involves a number of sectors.  Anyway, in the coming five years is this something the board is looking to expand?</p></speech>

It is nice to speak to a fellow northsider from Cork.  I agree with the Deputy on the point about income thresholds.  The cliff-edge effect is unsatisfactory.  I hope we will be able to alleviate it with a proposal to increase the thresholds and perhaps have an increased contribution at the higher level.  In that way, at least people would still qualify and we would not have the effect of all duck or no dinner.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Brien referred to the family mediation service.  That is an important part of the work of the board.  The board took over the family mediation services five years ago.  Considerable work has gone into integrating both services.  I referred to the Jervis Street co-located office that opened recently.  My view and the view of the board is that the more cases we can keep out of court and keep within mediation, the better.  This brings better outcomes for the parties involved and is less adversarial.  An agreement is more likely to stick in the long term than a court-enforced judgment, no matter how well intentioned.  I examined the statistics recently.  In cases where people attend mediation and both parties engage, we are getting up to a 50% success rate in terms of a mediated agreement.  That is a positive and impressive statistic and one we can maintain.  New schemes are being operated including in Cork, Athlone and Castlebar.  These are termed mandatory information schemes.  This means if a person wants to get a legal aid scheme to go to court, then he has to attend a mandatory information session first.  I am not suggesting we are forcing people to go the mediation route but we are giving them the opportunity and the information that is necessary for them to engage in that route.  From a holistic view of the court services and access to justice, mediation is an area where there could be significant improvement in the sense of the way we have managed society and access to justice.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-18a.339" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Philip O'Leary" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017011800002#E01000"><p>The rigid interpretation causes difficulties.  I will offer the Deputy an example relating to a social welfare payment such as the family income supplement.  That is taken into account.  If a payment is not a social welfare payment, then it is not taken into account.  I came across an example recently involving a housing assistance payment.  This payment is replacing rent supplement.  If an applicant is on rent supplement, the payment is taken into account in the income.  However, if the applicant is on the housing assistant payment, it is not because it is not a social welfare payment.  Instead, it is paid by the local authorities.  Such anomalies have to be sorted for everyone to be treated equally.  In an ideal world, some level of discretion should be allowed.  If we could remove some of the anomalies relating to the allowance and avoid the poverty trap to ensure those on modest incomes get access, it would be an improvement.  To be fair, everyone involved in the organisation &ndash; it is a large and fantastic organisation &ndash; is interested in access to justice and they understand the importance of it.  When people come to the Legal Aid Board, they are usually going through a vulnerable time in their lives.  Whether it is a family case or some other case, it can have life-changing effects on how things progress for them.  We take every application seriously and we do our best to ensure those who are able to qualify do qualify for the scheme.</p></speech>

Rent allowance is not included as part of the income but the HAP is included.  Is that the case?</p></speech>

I am rather alarmed at the anomalies Mr. O'Leary has outlined to Deputy O'Brien, especially the specific example.  I am always a great believer in a certain element of discretion.  We are in a systems-driven society.  Whether it is a third level grant application or a medical card, discretion is non-existent.  If there was some element of discretion, it would serve the citizens far better.  Is it possible for Mr. O'Leary to make available to us a list of the anomalies in order that we can talk to the Minister and see whether they can be rectified?  It is absolutely nonsensical that rent allowance would be a consideration whereas a housing assistance payment would not.  I imagine these issues should be dealt with simply and quickly.  I was not aware of that particular anomaly.  If there are other anomalies, then perhaps Mr. O'Leary could make the secretariat aware of it in order that we can highlight it with the Minister and her officials.</p></speech>

I agree that these anomalies should be outlined.</p><p>The HAP is a very recent anomaly because it is a recent payment that has arisen and these anomalies do arise in every system.  They should be dealt with as part of a proposal to the Minister, which I hope the board would consider shortly and put a proposal to the Minister for consideration of the overall eligibility and the type of allowances that are available.  Perhaps the question of discretion that was raised by Deputy O'Brien would be put to the Minister in a coherent and costed fashion.  I am conscious that we have a limited budget, like everything in the State, and be it the health services or education there is not an unlimited amount of money available.  Every time we increase the eligibility then there will be an effect in demand and we must ensure we can provide the service to those people who will qualify.  These are very important questions and I am grateful to the Senator for bringing the matter up.  If we are bringing a proposal we would be very happy to circulate it to the committee for its consideration also.</p></speech>

With no other members indicating I will make a very brief comment.  I strongly endorse the views of members with regard to the issue of greater discretion.  It is a reality that is needed in a variety of situations as Senator Conway has alluded to.  Mr. O'Leary has worked in or given service to the free legal aid sector and the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, previously.  As someone who was not exposed to the work of the Legal Aid Board previous to taking up my position, could he provide me with a simpleton's guide in the difference between the role of the Free Legal Aid Centres and the Legal Aid Board?  Perhaps Mr. O'Leary could share a crisp explanation of the critical differences.</p></speech>

It does fantastic work.  I was involved with it for a long time.  It continues to do fantastic work.  It is a free service and the centres provide a voluntary advice service throughout the State.  The centres are probably more involved in the advice side of things than actually providing services in courts.  They certainly have a very strong role as an NGO in challenging the Government and society as to where Ireland should be going.  It is an organisation I hold in high esteem.  The Legal Aid Board is not a free scheme, which is a big difference.   It is a means-tested scheme.  It is a statutory body that was set up under the Act.  It has a significant annual budget and a large and a very committed staff cohort.  I am almost overwhelmed when I travel around the State and meet the staff and see their level of commitment and their contribution to the work towards access to justice.</p></speech>

I thank all the members who have participated and for their attendance.  It was first class.  I thank Mr. O'Leary for his engagement with the committee on the matter of his appointment and I wish him every success in his new role.  The committee will notify the Minister that we have had this engagement with Mr. O'Leary.</p> <p>  Before I conclude it would be appropriate to mention Mr. O'Leary's predecessor, the former chairman of the Legal Aid Board, Ms Muriel Walls.  I commend her for her hard work and dedication to the role, and those board members who have given service previously.  As Mr. O'Leary has indicated, he is the one continuing.  I do not have all their names here but I acknowledge the contribution they have made.  I wish Mr. O'Leary and the new team every success in the time ahead.
