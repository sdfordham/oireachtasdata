She is very welcome on the morning of what will prove to be an historic day, of which we are all very conscious, and once again I thank her.  Apologies have been received from Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile.</p><p>I welcome Ms Maria McDonald of the Victims' Rights Alliance to discuss the issue of penal reform.  On behalf of the committee, I thank Ms McDonald for her attendance this morning.  I also acknowledge the presence of her colleague, Ms Fiona Murphy.  I wish to remind everyone that the joint committee agreed, as part of its work programme for 2017, to look at the area of prisons and penal policy.  We contracted the title of this element of our work programme to penal reform.  This is the second external engagement and the third focused address on this issue by the committee.  Ms McDonald will be invited to make an opening statement to the committee and this will be followed by a question and answer session with committee members.</p><p>Before I invite Ms McDonald to make her address, I must caution her in relation to privilege in the context of these and all Oireachtas committee proceedings.  I draw attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, she is protected by absolute privilege in respect of her evidence to this committee.  However, if she is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continues to so do, she is entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of her evidence.  She is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and she is asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, she should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>Without any further ado, I invite Ms McDonald to present her address.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-01a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria McDonald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017030100002#B00300"><p>I thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to speak today on behalf of the Victims' Rights Alliance, VRA.  The VRA is an alliance of victim support and human rights organisations in Ireland, namely Advocates for Victims of Homicide, the CARI Foundation, the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network, the Immigrant Council of Ireland, Inclusion Ireland, the Irish Criminal Justice and Disability Network, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, the Irish Road Victims' Association, the National Women's Council of Ireland, the Irish Tourist Assistance Service, One In Four, the Rape Crisis Network Ireland, Ruhama, Safe Ireland and Support After Homicide.  The alliance was formed with one key goal, that is, to ensure that the EU victims directive is implemented in Ireland within the proposed timeframe, with all victims of crime in Ireland in mind.</p> <p>  Our members have different views on penal reform, sentencing and prisons.  For that reason, this submission is limited to the rights afforded to victims under the victims directive and recognised rights provided to victims of crime in other common law jurisdictions.  Given the short time available, it has not been possible to get all our members to sign off on this submission.</p> <p>  Member states of the EU, including Ireland, were required to transpose the victims directive into law by 16 November 2015, but no legislation has been enacted to date to transpose the directive in Ireland.  The publication of the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill 2016 on 29 December 2016 was the first major step in putting victims at the heart of the criminal justice system.  As members know, that Bill is currently before the D&aacute;il.  The Bill is a comprehensive document which has had the benefit of significant consultation with key State and non-State agencies working with victims of crime, including victim support organisations.  It broadly mirrors the content of the victims directive, although there are some glaring omissions.</p> <p>  The necessity to implement dedicated victims legislation is illustrated by the contents of the Guerin report, the Garda Inspectorate report from 2014, the VRA report from 2014 and the O'Higgins report of 2016.  A survey by some VRA members indicated that 72% of victims surveyed said that they felt re-victimised by the criminal justice system.  This should be compared with the figure of 49% of victims who indicated that they felt re-victimised by the accused.  The risk of re-victimisation and intimidation should be reduced as much as possible and safeguards should be put in place to protect victims of crime during the sentencing and parole processes and on the release of the offender from prison.</p> <p>  The Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill, if implemented, will put victims of crime on a statutory footing in Irish law for the first time.  There is currently no legal definition of a victim of crime in Irish law.  Section 2 proposes to define a victim as a person who has suffered physical, mental or emotional harm or economic loss which has been directly caused by an offence.  This mirrors the definition in the victims directive.  Family members are deemed to be victims for the purposes of the Bill if the death of the victim was directly caused by a criminal offence.  A family member will not be entitled to the rights under the Bill if he or she has been charged with, or is under investigation for, the death of the victim.</p><p>One of the major omissions within the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill 2016 is the absence of restorative justice.  There has been growing recognition that restorative justice should be explored to address the need of victims of crime for redress.  It is a process that is being increasingly used by victims of crime in Ireland such as, for example, Le Ch&eacute;ile in Limerick.  Article 2(1)(d) of the victims' directive defines restorative justice as meaning &quot;any process whereby the victim and the offender are enabled, if they freely consent, to participate actively in the resolution of matters arising from the criminal offence through the help of an impartial third party&quot;.  Member states are not required to establish restorative justice services but where they exist, member states were required to have safeguards in place for their use. <br/><br/>Article 4(1)(j) of the victims' directive asserts that victims must be informed, on first contact with the Garda, of &quot;the available restorative justice services&quot;.  Article 12 of the directive outlines safeguards to protect &quot;the victim from secondary and repeat victimisation, from intimidation and from retaliation&quot;.  Restorative justice should only be used if it is in the interest of the victim to do so based on his or her free and informed consent.  A victim can withdraw his or her consent at any time.  Prior to agreeing to engage in restorative justice, a victim must be given complete and unbiased information.  This should include information on the outcomes and the supervision of the process.<br/><br/>Article 12 of the victims' directive also provides for the safeguard that an offender must acknowledge the basic facts of the case, which is incredibly important.  The agreement of the parties must be voluntary and it can be considered in criminal proceedings that follow, such as the sentence.  If restorative justice is conducted in private then it is confidential and cannot be discussed without the consent of the parties, save where there is a prevailing public interest to do so.  Victims that choose to engage in restorative justice should have the benefit of these measures in Irish legislation pursuant to the victims' directive.<br/><br/>Ireland has no statutory scheme for restorative justice.  Notwithstanding this, judges have recommended its use to victims of crime in the court process.  Sections 26 and 28 of the Children Act 2001 invite victims to be involved in a conference convened by a probation and welfare officer, which is a form of restorative justice.  Restorative justice was included in the scheme of the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill that was published in 2015.  It was, therefore, a surprise that restorative justice was not included in the recently published Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill 2016.  The failure to include restorative justice safeguards is an obvious omission of Ireland's obligations under the victims' directive.  Infringement proceedings may be instigated by the European Commission should the Bill not be amended to include such a provision.  The necessity of including restorative justice in legislation is illustrated by the fact that a court had suggested the use of restorative justice to a victim in circumstances that did not take account of the safeguards provided for in the victims' directive. <br/><br/>I am sure all members are familiar with the strategic review of penal policy of 2014.  The review acknowledged that the victims' directive &quot;promotes the appropriate use of restorative justice services which is in line with the existing delivery of such services in this State&quot;.  Furthermore, without being provided with information on the available restorative justice measures, victims will be unable to access their rights thereunder.  The victims' directive requires that victims be informed of the available restorative justice services.  The Garda victim information leaflet, which was drafted in order to comply with the State's obligations, only makes reference to restorative justice services being available where the offender is under 18 years of age.  There are other restorative justice services available to victims of crime who are adults.  The Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill 2016 does not require the Garda to provide information on restorative justice.  Again, this is a glaring omission in light of Ireland's obligations under Article 4 of the victims' directive.  Failure to adequately provide information on restorative justice significantly dilutes a victim's rights under the directive.  It illustrates the difference between providing rights on paper and accessing them in practice.<br/><br/>Victims have a right to information on an accused's remand and release from custody.  Article 6(5) of the victims' directive provides that victims must be &quot;offered the opportunity to be notified, without unnecessary delay, when the person remanded in custody, prosecuted or sentenced for criminal offences concerning them is released from or has escaped detention&quot;.Furthermore, victims should be informed of measures that have been implemented for their protection where an offender has been released or escaped from prison.  Section 7 of the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill provides that information should be provided to the victim on the offender's release or escape from custody.<br/><br/>Currently, upon request, victims can receive information from the Irish Prison Service about an offender's release from prison.  However, once a victim opts in, he or she is provided with all information that the Irish Prison Service would deem relevant in the circumstances.  Victims should be able to pick and choose what information they want to receive.  For example, some victims are re-victimised every time they receive an update on an offender while other victims would like to know as much information as is available.<br/><br/>In Canada, the Victims Bill of Rights Act permits victims, upon request, to receive information from Correctional Service Canada, which is like our Probation Service, about an offender's progress towards meeting the objectives of a correctional plan and information on the correctional plan.  Correctional Service Canada also gives victims access to a photograph of the offender prior to his or her release into the community.  Victims can request access from the Parole Board of Canada to listen to an audio recording of a parole hearing if unable to attend in person.  At present, victims of crime in Ireland are not entitled to a photograph of an offender nor are they able to attend or watch a parole hearing online.  The Victims Rights Alliance, VRA, is cognisant that the rights of the accused must be balanced with the rights of an offender.  However, at least where there is a risk of re-victimisation or intimidation, a victim should be offered the opportunity to have sight of a picture of an offender prior to his or her release from prison.  Furthermore, should a victim wish to attend a parole hearing he or she should be given the opportunity to do so or given the opportunity to hear a playback of the parole hearing or both.  In June 2016, Correctional Service of Canada and the Parole Board of Canada launched an online victims portal whereby victims of crime could receive and view appropriate information about the offender, view and manage preferences for receiving information and submit a victim statement to Correctional Service Canada and the Parole Board of Canada.  In addition, they could request to observe a parole hearing, request to present a victim statement at a parole hearing and request a copy of the parole decision.  It might be worth considering running a similar pilot programme in Ireland.<br/><br/>Like the Irish Penal Reform Trust, the VRA believes that the parole process is in need of reform.  The independence of the parole board is essential to ensure that justice is adhered to, not only for the victim of crime but also for the offender.  The author is aware of one instance where a parole board member referred to a victim who sought revenge on an offender.  This example is mentioned to illustrate the issue of bias and the importance of an objective parole board.  It is respectfully submitted that legislation relating to the make-up of a parole board should be cognisant of Article 1 of the victims' directive, such that &quot;Member States shall ensure that victims are recognised and treated in a respectful, sensitive, tailored, professional and non-discriminatory manner, in all contacts with victim support or restorative justice services or a competent authority, operating within the context of criminal proceedings.&quot;  The Irish Parole Board may be deemed to be a competent authority for the purpose of this legislation.<br/><br/>Article 25 of the victims' directive provides that &quot;officials likely to come into contact with victims&quot; should get both specialist and general training appropriate to their level of contact with the victims of crime so as to &quot;enable them to deal with victims in an impartial, respectful and professional manner&quot;.  Having due regard to the independence of the legal profession the victims' directive recommends that training be made available to &quot;increase the awareness of judges and prosecutors of the needs of victims&quot;.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties, in conjunction with The Bar Council of Ireland and the Law Society of Ireland with financial support from the Justice Programme of the European Union, are developing a training programme for lawyers on the victims' directive.<br/><br/>The VRA is cognisant of the independence of the Judiciary.  However, I draw the committee's attention to a Private Members' Bill in Canada, namely, an Act to amend the Judges Act and the Criminal Code (sexual assault), which was introduced in Canada last Thursday, 23 February.  The Bill appears to have general support in Canada.  In summary:</p><blockquote>This enactment amends the Judges Act to restrict eligibility for judicial appointment to individuals who have completed comprehensive sexual assault education.  It also requires the Canadian Judicial Council to report on continuing education seminars in matters related to sexual assault law.  Furthermore, it amends the Criminal Code to require a court to provide written reasons in sexual assault decisions.</blockquote><p>On Monday I spoke with Judge Hinkle and Anna Evans of the Massachusetts Trial Court, who developed and implemented training specific to domestic violence in the Massachusetts Trial Court.  The training has been effective and well received by employees across Massachusetts who work within the courts.  The Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Trial Court has made it compulsory for all judges to participate in the training programme, including court officers, facilitation offers and some lawyers, such as guardians <i>ad litem</i>.  Training is essential to ensure that victims of crime get access to their rights under the victims' directive.  Persons working with victims of crime within the sentence, restorative justice and parole process should receive appropriate training.<br/><br/>I thank the committee for giving the opportunity to speak here today.  I hope that my presentation was not too lengthy.  I hope that we will have an opportunity to speak more generally on the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill 2016.  I thank the members for their time. </p></speech>

Historically, victims were very much peripheral to if not ignored by our criminal justice system.  I think everyone here welcomes the fact that in recent years victims have become more central to the criminal justice process.  This will be more apparent this evening when the D&aacute;il debates the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill, which, in general, we support.  I commend Ms McDonald.  It is important that there are groups which take into account the interests of victims because interest groups have an impact in altering legislation.</p> <p>  One of the questions I wish to ask concerns the area of penal reform, which is an issue we are considering.  It is not fair that people sometimes put penal reform groups on one side and victims' groups on the other.  What are Ms McDonald's views on the effectiveness of prison and the extent to which it should be used as a punishment?  She spoke about restorative justice.  Can she give us examples of the type of restorative justice she thinks would be effective in meeting the demands of victims while, at the same time, rehabilitating the offender?  Rehabilitation of the offender is one of the functions any legislation in this area must have.  My third question concerns parole.  I do not know whether Ms McDonald is aware of the Parole Bill.  If she is, what are her general views on it?  I ask her to deal with these three issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-01a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria McDonald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017030100002#D00300"><p>Regarding the effectiveness of prisons, I am in a difficulty in that, as I mentioned at the start, all our members would have different views on the use of prisons.  For example, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties would have a very different view to Advocates for Victims of Homicide.  I will speak about the matter in the context of fines, which I think were discussed with the Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT.  Some members may be familiar with a Bill published by the former Minister, Mr. Alan Shatter, namely, the criminal justice (community sanctions) Bill.  The Bill concerned fines and the amending of the manner by which they are carried out.  Mr. Shatter indicated that he wished to set up a specific fund through which fines would be paid out to victim support services.  I see it in this context: if one is looking not to put somebody in prison and fining them instead, cognisance should be taken of the victims' issues.  If those moneys were then put into victim support services to facilitate counselling or support services for victims of crime, the Victims' Rights Alliance would see this as very beneficial.  In addition, it may be a means whereby it would be more appropriate that the individual not then be in prison; rather, that he or she is contributing back to the community through the money he or she is affording to those circumstances.<br/><br/>Regarding the demand for restorative justice, victims and the benefit they are seeing in this respect, as the committee already knows, the Probation Service runs a programme for offenders.  Victims have the option to benefit in that they are asked whether they want to participate in the programme.  It is up to the individual victim.  Much work and research is being carried out on victims of sexual abuse engaging within the restorative justice process.  Some of our members would have very different views on this.  For example, some of them think it would not be appropriate in particular circumstances, but it is very obvious that it is up to the individual victim whether to engage in the process.  Some research indicates that some victims of sexual abuse, particularly within family circumstances, have found the programme beneficial.  Again, it is up to the individual as to whether he or she engages with it.  I can give the committee an example of a case in which it would be inappropriate to request a victim to engage with the restorative justice process.  I refer to a case reported in 2014 in <i>The Irish Times</i>in which a judge requested that a victim at a sentencing hearing consider engaging in restorative justice after a very lengthy trial process during which the accused, who had sexually abused the victim as a child, had not accepted any of the facts of the case.  Furthermore, the accused still did not accept the facts even after having been found guilty.  The judge asked at the sentencing hearing whether the victim would like to engage in restorative justice.  This obviously puts a victim on the spot.  He or she will not be familiar with the information and it would not be appropriate in such circumstances for him or her to engage with the programme.  I am familiar with restorative justice processes that have occurred in the midlands regarding the Travelling community whereby, as some members would be aware, there can sometimes be feuding and other issues between families.  One day someone is a victim of crime and another day that person is an offender.  In that context, the programme was incredibly successful in the midlands community, and the cases which came before the courts significantly reduced as a result of that restorative justice programme.  However, funding for the programme was subsequently cut and the cases started to come back before the courts again.  Fewer victims were involved as a result of the restorative justice process, so it can be incredibly beneficial.<br/><br/>Regarding the parole process, I have had sight of the Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill and the Sentencing Council Bill 2017.  The one thing I would note from the Parole Bill 2016 is that victims are kind of absent from it.  I understand that a very objective board is needed but, at the same time, I note that the Sentencing Council Bill 2017 makes reference to individuals who have knowledge regarding the welfare of victims of crime.  The welfare of the victims of crime can be very different to somebody who is working with a victim support organisation because, in the latter context, somebody could be potentially objective.<br/><br/>Regarding training, it is very important the Judiciary is involved in any parole process, but I believe any laypersons- for want of a better word - involved should undertake appropriate training to understand the difficulties and trauma experienced by a sexual abuse victim, for example.  Based on the victims' directive, they are actually required to engage in such training anyway - for example, if writing written statements to the Parole Board.  The example I gave was a Parole Board member using the word &quot;revenge&quot;, I think because the individual did not understand the trauma these victims go through and the reasons they put certain information in victim statements.  If they have greater understanding of this trauma and are given training in victims' rights, needs and interests, a Parole Board member would be, as I said, much more able to deal with the matter as appropriate.</p></speech>

In fairness to Ms McDonald, she does not need to be an expert on the Parole Bill, but there is a provision in the Bill that allows victims and their interests to be considered by the Parole Board.  Obviously, victims do not have a veto but I would not like Ms McDonald to think that victims are absent from the Bill.  This is not the case.</p></speech>

I have a few questions.  She highlighted in her statement restorative justice and the fact that it has been excluded from many of the draft proposals from the Minister's office.  Does she feel the victims directive is not being transposed fully and properly in this draft Bill?  If not, why not?  Has she had engagements with the Department of Justice and Equality as to why it has not provided a more wholesome Bill?  She mentioned Canada.  Can she provide other comparative examples of countries that have done this properly and transposed it effectively?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-01a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria McDonald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017030100002#D01600"><p>The Bill is very good in dealing with a significant number of issues under the victims' directive, but there are some major omissions, which I mentioned.  For example, it is an obligation under the victims directive to facilitate the referral of victims to victim support services by the body that receives a complaint from the victim.  On our end, this would be the Garda.  The directive uses the word "shall": it states that the Garda shall facilitate the referral to victims of crime.  Currently, the Bill states that a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission may refer a victim where he or she consents.</p><p>The difficulty is that a victim could consent to being referred but, due to this discretion, a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would still not refer the victim.  There are obviously serious implications for the victim because it could cause re-victimisation in that context.  The victim is not being provided with that support and they do not understand why they are not getting that support.  There is a positive obligation for the Garda to facilitate referral for all victims of crime.  In that context, that section is incorrect and should be amended.  In my view, it does not comply with the directive.<br/><br/>From my understanding, the reason the restorative justice aspect is not included in the Bill is because there is no statutory scheme for restorative justice.  However, victims are involved informally in such processes, although they are offender-led.  If a victim is engaging in such a process, or, in the example I gave the committee earlier of a judge requiring or requesting that a victim engage in such a process, then in those circumstances the safeguards should be put in place in legislation to ensure that a victim is not re-victimised.  That is the reason for that process.<br/><br/>Another issue with the Bill is that all victims of crime must have an independent assessment by the Garda to ascertain whether they have special protection needs and, as such, this relates to the type, nature and circumstances of the crime.  For example, factors which would need to be considered in that individual assessment include whether it is a hate crime.  The personal circumstances of he individual involved, whether he or she has a disability, for example, must also be considered.  Currently, the manner by which the legislation is drafted limits the individual assessment to consider particular types of motives.  It should be open-ended rather than limited.  For example, I know, thankfully, matters will change today but Travellers were not included in the definition of ethnicity.  Accordingly, Travellers would not be entitled to the special protections under the Bill, if they were, for example, subject to a hate crime.  I know things are changing today - thank God - but that is an example where issues may arise in the future.  It needs to be open-ended to ensure all victims get those special protection needs.<br/><br/>It is all very well having legislation but unless one has a means to ensure victims&rsquo; rights are protected, it will fall by the wayside.  Victims, as we all know, have great difficulties with having an appropriate complaints process available to them.  From our research, we find that they are afraid to make a complaint to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na because it might affect their case.  When they do go to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, they also find it might affect or they believe it has affected their case.  The process by which GSOC goes through a complaint can take two years or more.  Victims feel they do not get what they need out of that process.  Under the directive, if one is getting information or support services, all one wants is that information to be given straight away.  We suggest a simple and clear complaints process for victims to ensure if they do not get information when they reach their trial date, they will get it as soon as possible.<br/><br/>For the past several years, we have been advocating for a federal ombudsman for victims of crime, which would be keeping in line with the Canadian approach and the recital to the directive, which would be a preamble, for example, to the directive.  It would suggest the establishment of one-stop shops for victims of crime.  If there is a complaint, an ombudsman&rsquo;s office would be able to deal with it in a swift way.  I have been in contact over the past several years with all the ombudsman offices, including GSOC and the Ombudsman for Children.  Within their current format, there is nothing preventing them from actually identifying a victims&rsquo; ombudsman within their offices without establishing a new office <i>per se</i>.  Obviously, there will be procedural issues around that but, from a monetary perspective, one would not be establishing a new office.<br/><br/>On the Deputy's second question on the parole process in other jurisdictions, Canada would be the one with which I would work most closely and would recommend its use.  For example, as I mentioned in my opening statement, being able to pick and choose what information one receives, to be able to view a parole hearing online might be basic, but at the same time, they reduce the re-victimisation of the victim while also providing them with appropriate information.  It is a similar approach in the United States where information is provided, one can either opt in or opt out and one can view parole hearings or attend them.<br/><br/>In Canada, there is a victim surcharge.  For example, if an offender commits a crime, then he or she would have to pay a victim surcharge as opposed to a fine.  Those moneys will go directly to pay for the ombudsman's office or victim support organisations, for example.  In 1984, America implemented the Victims of Crime Act which, similarly, has a victim fund where moneys are paid directly to victim support organisations.<br/><br/>The criminal justice (community sanctions) Bill 2014, envisaged by the former minister, Alan Shatter, indicated the moneys would go to the Department of Justice and Equality.  I am of the view that any victims&rsquo; moneys should go to an independent source.  The reason I say that is because currently the commission for victims of crime does not exist anymore.  If one looked at the Department website, it would lead one to believe there is an independent body currently assessing moneys that go to victims of crime.  However, all moneys are distributed by the Department of Justice and Equality&rsquo;s victims of crime office.  Transparency is incredibly important to ensure moneys are given to victim support organisations.  We all know of incidents and difficulties which have arisen with charities recently.  We all want to ensure that those moneys are given in a transparent way and that victims know how and when they are going get it.  I am not in any way criticising the Department of Justice and Equality&rsquo;s victims of crime office.  It does a great job.  However, victims believe that the commission for victims of crime still exists when it actually does not.  If there was to be a victim surcharge, I would recommend it would go to an independent source such as a commission or an ombudsman's office rather than going directly to the Department of Justice and Equality.  As we all know, sometimes means change in Departments.</p></speech>

In fairness to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, in recent years she has increased the funding for victim support organisations annually.  I do not remember the exact figures but one is looking at an increase of approximately &euro;5,000 for each organisation.  Although she has substantially increased it by 20%, in reality it is little money for the victim support organisations.</p> <p>  The victims directive under article 8 indicates victims are required, legally, to victim support services free of charge before, during and after the criminal justice process.  The difficulty arises with how we have a fragmented victim support system, unlike the UK which has one organisation, Victim Support UK.  Here it is not Government-led but NGO-led.  While that is a positive point, it also means that they are relying significantly on Government moneys to provide services.  When they are under-resourced, it means the victims cannot necessarily access them.</p></speech>

We are all going to be well-informed for the debate to take place over the next two days.  That is good because it is bringing in a new and fresher perspective on the legislation which will be important.  Then we can get it right when it comes back on Committee Stage.</p> <p>  We are in a little bit of an unusual situation in that the committee is discussing this Bill in the context of penal reform.  Rather than the supports necessary for individual victims, we are looking at what society does with offenders in order to reduce both recidivism and the number of victims by grappling with the issues of crime.  In that context, the point about the absence of restorative justice is important.  I know it is emotionally difficult and Ms McDonald made the point very well for it to be individually tailored to whatever situation, as well as it being voluntary.  If we can get into that process, its success rates are phenomenal in reducing levels of reoffending.</p><p>While I think it was mentioned, it should be really spelled out that there are services in Ireland for restorative justice and a legal obligation under the directive to inform people of them.  However, that is not being done.  It is certainly not being provided for in the legislation and it is not even being done going forward.  It is incredibly poor if it is the case, not just in terms of recidivism but because victims are empowered if they can confront the person who committed a crime against them.  They can deal with those issues and get some of their confidence back.  It is incredibly powerful and often has a dramatic effect on the person who committed the crime.  I am curious about that end of things.</p><p> The other thing we come across is people being re-victimised by the system, which was also mentioned.  When all of the Garda controversy started, we were inundated with cases from people all over the country who had been the victims of serious crimes like the murder of loved ones and other horrendous crimes.  At their weakest point, they turned to the State for assistance and were actually re-victimised because in some instances either garda&iacute; were involved in the original crime or the offender was in with garda&iacute;.  They then became the victims of a whole pile of unnecessary and unwarranted attention and harassment.  Those cases resulted in the unfortunate independent review mechanism and not much justice.  That links in with the current lack of State support.  How does one stop those who are in the system from reoffending the victim?  I am probably not explaining myself very well because I have the flu.</p></speech>

On the provision of information, she pointed out correctly that they are legally required to provide information on the available restorative justice services.  That is the actual wording used within the directive.  The Garda leaflet which is currently made available to victims of crime refers to the restorative justice services available under the Children Act.  They are the provisions I mentioned in my opening statement.  However, as the Deputy rightly pointed out, Le Ch&eacute;ile, the Probation Service and a significant number of other services are also available to victims of crime.  Therefore, the Garda is currently not compliant in not providing that information.  It does not necessarily have to be in the leaflet <i>per se</i>but it must be accessible somewhere - for example, online.  The difficulty that arises based on the fact that it has now been removed from the Bill is that the Garda may now amend its leaflet to not inform victims about any restorative justice services whatsoever.  As the Deputy indicated, that would prevent victims and offenders from benefitting from the significant progress which can be made as a result of restorative justice and the rehabilitation which can result.<br/><br/>I spoke with a victim of crime who had engaged in a restorative justice process where a family member had died and she indicated that the process was remarkable in the benefit she got from it.  She was able to understand what had happened to her child.  The family wanted to know how the child died.  She also became close to the offender who suddenly understood what the impact of that crime had been on the family.  They are in regular contact.  While that does not happen in all situations, if people feel they can engage in that process, rehabilitation may occur and hopefully that individual will not come back into the prison system again.  The difficulty that arises in relation to the right to information more generally is that even though there is a Garda leaflet, many victims do not even know it exists.  It is not very easy to find.  Garda&iacute; are not necessarily giving victims the leaflet.  They may have to go online to find it.  It would be even more difficult for them to find out about the available restorative justice services.<br/><br/>Re-victimisation within the criminal justice process is obviously a major issue and training is key, including within the parole and sentencing process.  Also, there must be appropriate supports in place, for example, if a victim comes in during the sentencing process.  It is often forgotten that a significant number of sentences are appealed.  The victim has to go through the trauma of an appeal against conviction or sentence not knowing what is going to happen.  The supports may not be there which were originally in place.  One must ensure that they are very well informed.  I have come across a significant number of cases where victims were informed at the last minute that a sentencing appeal was coming up, which can cause a massive level of trauma.  Adjournments should be made to facilitate the informing of victims.<br/><br/>In the context of re-victimisation and the offender, training within the prison system to give offenders the opportunity to understand their behaviour facilitates rehabilitation.  It is not always possible to involve a victim in that process, but if programmes could be established within the prison system to look at that, it would be very positive from a rehabilitation perspective and reduce in the long term the re-victimisation of victims of crime.  I hope that answers the questions.</p></speech>

The first relates to information and victims of crime being able to access it.  One of the issues there is not only relates not only to victims but also to garda&iacute;.  The latter have an obligation to provide the information.  I question whether many members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have that information to pass on.  Is there any central database or list of all restorative programmes in the State?  If a garda does not have the information, he or she cannot pass it on.  Does the Victims Rights Alliance know whether there is an aspect of Garda training that addresses this?  Is there any obligation on chief superintendents in charge of divisions to ensure that the officers under their command have this information?  Exactly what is the process to ensure that garda&iacute; have the information to be able to pass it on to victims?</p> <p>  The other issue is the sentencing process.  I have always been very critical of the way judges have no obligation to engage in continuing professional development.  As such, there is no ongoing training for judges.  One becomes a judge and one can remain in the position for however long one wants, with no obligation to engage in any training whatsoever.  The Canadian model was referred to by Ms McDonald.  Does it involve mandatory training?  Ms McDonald said a judge made it mandatory for people within his courthouse, but is it mandated by the state in Canada?  Are there models in which there is mandatory training for judges, in particular in relation to sex crimes, domestic violence, and homicide?  If that was an aspect of the Judiciary, how would it help victims of crime?</p> <p>  I acknowledge that there are various omissions in the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill.  Hopefully, we can address those on Committee Stage.  The one that has really stuck out for me is restorative justice.  It sticks out because the Department included it in the general scheme of the Bill and as such recognised that restorative justice was a critical part of transposing the victims' directive into Irish law.  Yet, it is missing from the published Bill.  Ms McDonald said it may be because there is no statutory scheme.  That may be the case, but has the IVRA received any information as to why that was pulled from the publication of the Bill having been included in the general scheme?  My understanding is that it is not just that there is no statutory scheme, but also that there is no legal definition in law of what a restorative justice programme is meant to look like.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-01a.36" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria McDonald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017030100002#G00100"><p>With regard to the provision of information, the Garda now has 28 divisional offices nationwide which focus on supporting victims of crime.  Those offices should have basic information available, for example, the support services that are available, the details in regard to restorative justice and how victims can get expenses, given some victims cannot even afford to go to court.  From my experience, it depends on the divisional area the person is dealing with.  Several cases have come to my attention recently where certain more serious crimes have been treated differently to other crimes which are deemed more minor.  For example, four cases have come to my attention in the last few weeks in regard to hit-and-run incidents - not fatal accidents, but where cars were run off the road.  None of those individuals received information in regard to appropriate support services or the information which is legally required to be provided under the victims' directive.</p> <p>  Obviously, resources are a major issue for the police, although I am not in any way criticising the police.  At the same time, the directive is very clear that once a person is a victim of crime, and it does not matter what type of crime it is, the person is entitled to receive that information and the Garda cannot pick and choose which victims get it and which do not.  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien has highlighted a very important issue.  There certainly needs to be streamlining to ensure it is clear to all garda&iacute; what information needs to be given.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned training.  Training in regard to victims' rights is provided to new recruits in Templemore.  As I understand it, empathy has now been included in that process, and if a trainee garda does not show empathy or is not engaging with the victim appropriately, that trainee will have to repeat the exams, which is a very positive development.  The difficulty which arises is for individuals who are already within the current process as to whether appropriate training has been given.  I have been told training programmes are available to current staff members but the issue is that I do not know at what level the training is provided or what the uptake is.  It is something that needs to be looked at.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether the Canadian model was mandatory.  The Bill which went before the Canadian Parliament last week would make it mandatory for all of the Judiciary to engage in that process, which would be very significant.  I would have to do further research to know whether it is mandatory in other jurisdictions.  Obviously, given the independence of the Judiciary, it is something which would usually be judicial-led.  For example, the example I gave of Judge Hinkle's incredible work in Massachusetts was judicial-led and we are working with all of the different groups and parties within that jurisdiction.</p> <p>  With regard to the benefit, Judge Hinkle provided evidence that highlighted the significant benefit that has been seen in Massachusetts through using scientific evidence in regard to trauma for victims of crime and the training of judges in that regard.  The example I was given was that judges there are now informed of the triggers which need to be watched for in domestic abuse and sexual abuse cases, for example, triggers that might indicate a potential suicide or that the victim is in danger.  These are not necessarily obvious and, as I understand it, this has made a massive difference in terms of the understanding of the process from a judicial perspective.</p> <p>  The committee will be aware that, very often, victims of crime and of domestic abuse may have a protection order but they then breach that protection order themselves.  As I understand it, the judges there had a better understanding of why that was happening.  It can be a very frustrating for a judge who is trying to give those orders when the victim is continually breaching them rather than the offender.  To understand why that is happening can be very beneficial for the understanding of the judge in that process.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked why restorative justice was being pulled, in effect.  I would point out it was not originally intended to be in the scheme.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality worked very closely with the Victims Rights Alliance and other organisations.  We had highlighted the need for it to be included and that is why it was subsequently included in the scheme of the Bill.  It will be noticed there are other things in the scheme that did not subsequently come into the Bill.  As I understand it, this may be with the Attorney General and she may be currently considering the matter.  Again, there is no restorative justice legal process in Ireland and there may be concerns in regard to whether it forms part of the criminal justice process, which I submit would fall within the definition of the victims' directive.  The Deputy mentioned there is no definition of restorative justice but the victims' directive does provide a definition of restorative justice and that has direct effect.  Legally, therefore, the definition of restorative justice in Ireland is the same as the victims' directive in the context that is currently used.  Ireland must have regard to that, regardless of whether it has legislation in place.</p></speech>

In any case, I was talking to somebody who is involved in training the Judiciary in England, where there is ongoing training.  One of the scenarios that was put to a number of judges was a domestic violence scenario, and it was amazing how different the judges' interpretation of the evidence put forward was to that in the victim impact statements.  There was no cohesion or unity in terms of the sentencing of the offender.  In some cases, the judges took into account the victim impact statements and in other cases, they were not taken into account as much.</p> <p>  That is where the training needs to come in.  It should not matter what courthouse one goes into.  If the same evidence is presented in Dublin, Cork or Limerick, the same process should be available for victims and the same information should be given.  I believe the members of the Judiciary are not aware and some of them are there way too long, to be honest.</p></speech>

One of the biggest issues is that there is no obligation on them to engage in any training whatsoever.  There is no way of removing them either, which is the big problem.  Members of the Judiciary cannot be forced to engage in training and - I know we are in public session - where there are judges who make absolutely mind-boggling decisions that no one understands, and they do that consistently, there is no way or removing them.  As long as we have a situation where judges like that remain in place, then victims will always be failed.  That is my honest belief.</p></speech>

I have spoken with some judges.  The victims' directive is on their agenda and they have been provided with training in regard to certain aspects.  I am aware of that, although there is only so much I can say.  I am very hopeful because, having been before the courts, I have seen how a significant number of judges are using the victims' directive and are cognisant of the victims' directive, notwithstanding the fact the legislation is not yet in place.  It is very difficult for them.  For example, the victims' directive requires that a victim would not be cross-examined about his or her private life not related to the criminal offence, where he or she has special protection needs.  That is massive; it is a mind change.  The only way a person can be cross-examined now is if it is due to the person's prior sexual history.  Judges have been aware of that and they have been managing it.</p> <p>  I understand the Deputy's position and the issues.  I understand the new judicial council Bill will facilitate some of those changes.  It might be appropriate to look at the Canadian Bill that is being put forward to see whether something could be written into the judicial council Bill in regard to the reporting of the sexual abuse training that is being provided or the training on certain other issues.  That does not require the members of the Judiciary to do it and still allows for their independence, but it does provide transparency and accountability as to what training has been done, and it makes the public aware it has been done in that context.</p><p>I thank the witness for her presentation.  There is so much involved in this whole area and it is so complex.  It is not going to be easy to make things better quickly.  It is probably going to require a cultural change in a lot of areas.  To pick up on the points made by Deputy Jonathan O'Brien regarding education, legislation is grand but it is pointless and meaningless unless it is implemented.  The Garda Inspectorate, for example, has completed three reports since 2013 but how many of its recommendations have been implemented?</p><p> In terms of the last report, which was on Garda reform, the garda charged with overseeing implementation of the reform programme in Phoenix Park is actually more a part of the problem than the solution.  Deputy O'Brien spoke about training for judges but there should also be more ongoing training for garda&iacute; and that training should be done by civilians rather than by in-house staff.  To the best of my knowledge, it takes about four times longer to qualify as a hairdresser than as a garda.  That has to be an issue.  Even in football, League of Ireland managers who have all of the qualification badges must go on refresher courses or they lose their licences.  We should apply that to other areas.</p><p> We have been talking about reducing recidivism which will, invariably, reduce the number of victims of crime.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be involved in a big way in that and even with the best will in the world, they will need more resources if we are to see a new approach.  They are underresourced and are hard pressed to do their job as it is.  Without resources, a lot of what we are talking about is pie in the sky, in terms of them getting involved in a whole lot of other areas that would be very positive.  The State will have to recognise that more resources will be needed; otherwise we are just talking to the sky.</p><p> At the start of her presentation Ms McDonald spoke about the validity of using prison for certain things.  I am strongly of the opinion that about 90% of the people in prison should not even be in there.  Avoiding prison by paying fines is all very well for those who can afford it but it amplifies the divisions in society in the sense that it is not a big problem for those who are not short of money, but it is a huge problem for those who are short.  Paying a fine rather than going to prison is a punishment for the less well-off but not for the well-off.</p><p> This committee has discussed the fact that fining people who are poor in order to keep them out of prison is definitely a punishment but those who are well-off should be made to do community service rather than being able to buy their way out of their problems.  In terms of stopping such people from re-offending, the fact that they can just write a cheque every time they get into trouble means that there is no incentive for them to change their ways.  If they are made to do community service, however, they will think twice because a lot of them would find that demeaning, despite the fact that it would be very educational for them and might bring them down to earth a bit.  Coming up with schemes to keep people out of prison has to be a good thing because putting people in prison is doing nothing to reduce recidivism and in that sense, is doing nothing for victims.  </p><p> The sentiment of so much of what Ms McDonald has said is very good.  Does she think that the State is prepared to put its money where its mouth is and provide the resources that are needed in order to make all of this happen?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-01a.45" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria McDonald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017030100002#H00300"><p>Yes, he is going to get me into trouble although I make trouble for myself sometimes too.  Deputy Wallace made three points, the first of which relates to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and training.  I completely concur with the Deputy.  Training must be provided for current staff members, not just for recruits coming out of Templemore, and appropriate resources must be made available to provide that training.  I would like to see more victim support organisations involved in providing trauma training to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na so that they can better understand why victims of crime are sometimes not in a position to give evidence, to produce a victim impact statement or why they may do things that seem inappropriate, for example.  Trauma training is very important in that context.</p> <p>  The second point related to fines.  As I said already, I have to be quite careful about what I say here, given that our member organisations have different views on the prison service.  That said, I personally have seen instances within the courts process where compensation has been required to be paid and the individual concerned was able to pay it but another individual would probably have gone to prison in those circumstances.  In that sense, an individual's resources can determine whether he or she goes to jail in certain circumstances.  If a fine is imposed, I would recommend that a victim surcharge or some form of compensation should be established in order to at least give money back to the community.  </p> <p>  The Deputy also raised the issue of community service which is very effective.  I have seen it work well.  From the perspective of a defence lawyer, I have seen the benefits of community service.  Certainly, it is a means of keeping people out of prison but it can also be of significant benefit to society as a whole, depending on the work undertaken.  It is very helpful in certain circumstances.</p> <p>  As to whether the State is prepared to provide funding for victim support, there has been an increase in such funding in recent years.  However, I am afraid that millions of euro need to be provided in this area and I do not say that lightly.  We are not just talking here about victim support organisations being adequately funded, but also An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The latter has seen a significant increase in resources in recent times, particularly for information and communications technology.  Victims now engage with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na via information and communications technology and I know that the website is being changed at the moment.  Money is all very well, but there must also be a willingness to change.  I have been indicating for some time that changes need to be made to the Garda website for victims of crime.  For example, if one clicks the information on support services tab, one sees a link to the Commission for Victims of Crime which does not exist anymore.  I know that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is updating its website and I welcome that but we cannot wait forever for the changes to be made.  The victim support information should be updated now.  We should not have to wait for those resources to be made available.  Victims should be able to access that information online.</p> <p>  I have also been advocating for a long time a system that has been rolled out in the UK and in various formats in other jurisdictions, namely, a track-my-crime facility.  Victims can log in securely and access details of their case.  They are provided with a response to their queries within 24 hours.  Information is also translated for those who do not speak English.  This also means that there is a written record because often victims will say that they telephoned five or six times but no-one called them back.  The e-mail format means that victims can receive the information they request.  A pilot scheme was run in the UK and while there were some initial teething problems, the system has now been rolled out nationwide.  In the long run, from a resource perspective, providing victims with information, support, protection and in some cases counselling, will reduce the costs to the State.  In terms of hospitalisation, inquiries, complaints to GSOC and what is required and so forth, if victims are given the information they need straight away and resources are made available, that will facilitate a much better process for victims of crime and reduce costs for the State in the long run. </p></speech>

The traffic was very bad.  I thank Ms McDonald for her presentation.  I have a few queries around the training of judges, garda&iacute; and the area of addiction.  We know that for a lot of those people in prison who are perpetrators of crime, addiction is very much involved.  I do not know what the statistics are on how many people are in prison because addiction has brought them there but I imagine it is quite a high figure.  Does Ms McDonald believe it to be a good idea for the police, judges and members of the Irish Prison Service to be trained in understanding the disorder of addiction?  When somebody who is in addiction presents at court having committed a crime, judges could look at the possibility of giving them the option of a referral to an addiction treatment centre.  Would that be one way forward?  Many people in such cases are in addiction, albeit not all of them obviously.  Instead of asking them to pay a fine or giving them community service, could this be an option? I agree with Deputy Wallace that it is a huge cultural change.  It is important to implement all of the reports that have already been produced.  Great work has been done on reports but there has been very little implementation.  My question is on the disorder of addiction and how it can be addressed when it comes to crime.</p></speech>

I will answer the second part of the question first about offering offenders rehabilitation in order to seek help.  That happens currently, in an indirect manner.  The victim always must consent to that process.  Offenders may decide they want to seek help, they may contact Cuan Mhuire, which may set up a place and the judge might give such offenders the opportunity to engage in that process.  Potentially, in those circumstances they may give a suspended sentence, depending on what comes out of it.  It is generally up to the offender to engage in that process themselves.  From a victim's perspective, rehabilitation is very important because addiction is a spiralling issue, where a person is going to come back before the courts again and again.  If the addiction can be resolved then the chances of re-offending are very likely to fall.  It would therefore be very positive from the victim's perspective.  How one actually strategically does that is a difficulty because as I have said, it is sometimes quite difficult to get in to those rehabilitation processes.  Unless there is a clear process available to the judge as to what they can and cannot do in those cases, and unless the offender is aware of them, then it can cause difficulties.</p> <p>  On the issue of training, I completely concur that training should be provided on addiction issues.  It would be of benefit to the offender and the victim of crime.  I was involved in a case involving gambling addiction and the judge understood that concept so the offender got help and support, whereas another judge may not have understood the concept of gambling addiction and a very different result may have happened for that offender as a result.  It is important that judges understand addiction.  Very often somebody comes before the courts again and again, so the judge would very often like to have an option to refer that individual to get support services if possible.</p></speech>

It is very hard for an offender when they are in that addiction process to know about the services or to consider their options.  They must be told about them.  Arguably, the judge could have a role to indicate this, to ask the offender if it is something they have considered and suggest they talk to their solicitor about it.  With training, solicitors and barristers would also need to be aware of the appropriate services and the local services, not just the Judiciary.</p></speech>

In Ms McDonald's opening remarks, she indicated that were the Bill not amended, the State could find itself facing infringement proceedings by the European Commission on foot of its failure to properly transpose the directive into Irish law.  The deadline for that is more than 12 months past.  Have any infringement proceedings been taken against any errant member state?  What is the current status?  We have looked at some of the international realities but let us take a little snapshot of the situation of the member states.  More than 12 months beyond the deadline, how out of kilter are we with other member states in this regard and do we know if the European Commission has applied any pressure across the member states who have not complied as required?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-01a.51" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria McDonald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017030100002#J00600"><p>The story there is that infringement proceedings have issued against Ireland and 11 other member states, as of December 2016, for a failure to communicate in respect of the victims' directive.  That is different to infringement proceedings for not implementing the directive.  It is because they have not informed the Commission whatsoever what they are doing.  I understand that while Ireland is still outstanding on this issue, a significant number of those member states have now provided communication.  Even if they did not communicate it, they actually have legislation in place within their own jurisdictions so they are complying.  Even though 11 states seems a lot, it is actually a lot lower, and Ireland is probably one of only a few countries that remain outstanding in not having in place some form of legislation.  Just because other member states have legislation in place does not mean the legislation is very good and it does not mean that victims are getting their rights in practice; it just means those countries have put it within the criminal justice system.  Once this Bill has passed, Ireland would then communicate on the law because it cannot communicate it until that happens.  From speaking with my contacts within the European Commission, restorative justice is a major issue and although I cannot speak for the Commission, based on the victims' directive, it would deem that the absence of the directive in Irish law is obvious and may result in infringement proceedings.</p> <p>  There is another issue around the definition of a victim of crime.  The victims' directive includes indirect victims of crime.  This would include a child who had witnessed domestic abuse.  This may be an oversimplification of it but it gives an example.  This is not currently covered within the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill 2016 and the Commission may also be concerned about this if the Bill is implemented in its current format.  Regardless of whether one reports a crime, a person is entitled to support services and information.  Indirect victims such as children are also entitled to that right to information and support services.  If they do not fall within that definition then it could cause difficulties at a later date.</p></speech>

I cannot fully answer the Chairman's question but a significant number of the countries have.  I know that with Brexit it may not be the best example but the UK has a victims' code in place.  The UK had this in place even in advance of the victims' directive coming into force.  The code does not, however, have legal force.</p><p>The issue which arises, while they have complied with the directive, is whether victims are going to be able to access those rights in reality if it does not have legal force.  In those circumstances, does it really comply with the victims' directive?</p></speech>

At this very delicate time of a potentially serious industrial relations dispute, I believe we are all required to exercise great care so that all opportunities are taken by the company and its employees to resolve the issues that have led to this threatened strike.  However, I am happy to dispel some of the often well-intentioned but incorrect claims that have been made by some committee members about the causes and origins of this dispute.  In particular, I want to rebut suggestions that I am not doing enough to enable a settlement to be reached by the parties.  I will also deal with the false claim that the dispute stems from policy failure by my Department.</p> <p>  Let me address the issues one by one.  First, Deputies have criticised the level of public service obligation, PSO, funding and called on me to increase the allocation.  That is exactly what I have done.  This year the total PSO has increased by 11%; last year it increased by 13% overall and Bus &Eacute;ireann itself actually benefited from a 21% increase in its subvention in 2016.  As committee members are repeatedly informed, however, subvention is provided for PSO services only; under law it cannot be provided for commercial services.</p><p>Deputies have raised the issue of the funding of the free travel scheme and have called on me to examine whether it requires modification.  Again, that is exactly what I have done.  Both the Minister for Social Protection and I have instructed our Departments to examine the funding levels of that scheme and report back to us very shortly.  That examination is a short and focused piece of work and is progressing well.  I expect that the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and I will resolve the issue satisfactorily.</p><p> Some Deputies have alleged this Government is attacking the public bus service in rural Ireland.  That is nonsense.  We are actually expanding the public bus service in rural Ireland through increasing the amount of PSO funding to Bus &Eacute;ireann, as I have already pointed out, and also through providing a 24% increase in funding to the rural transport programme.  Again, we need to stop confusing issues.  The vast majority of people in rural Ireland who use a bus travel on a PSO service or a commercial operator other than Expressway.  There are no threats to those services. In fact, they are expanding.  They are seeing increasing passenger numbers, and in the case of PSO services, increasing taxpayer funding.</p><p> In relation to rural Ireland, I have been consistently clear in assuring rural communities that the NTA will step in and assist in cases where connectivity is threatened.  That was confirmed to the committee by the NTA itself.  That is exactly what has happened.  In response to Bus &Eacute;ireann's announcement of a small number of route changes to some Expressway routes, the NTA has published its assessment of the impact and has taken action as it deemed appropriate.  This includes extending PSO services for Athlone and Westport and better timetabling for rural transport services in Clonmel.  The NTA has said it will keep the situation under review and would welcome feedback on its proposals.  However, let us be clear - those actions by me, actions which this very committee has called for, will not resolve the issue.</p><p> Expressway is a commercial business unit run by Bus &Eacute;ireann and it is losing money.  The committee has heard that the company estimates around &euro;9 million worth of losses in 2016 with no improvement forecast.  Expressway services account for 10% of all Bus &Eacute;ireann passenger journeys in a given year.  The vast majority, 90% in fact, of Bus &Eacute;ireann passenger journeys are made on a taxpayer funded service: either a PSO service provided by the company under contract with the NTA or else a school transport service provided by the company under an agreement with the Minister for Education and Skills.  There are no funding issues with either PSO or school transport services.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is fully compensated for those services it provides.</p><p> The core issue that must be resolved is how to tackle the unsustainable losses on Expressway commercial services, which of course cannot be subsidised by the taxpayer.  Contradictory assertions have been made about what should be done to deal with these losses in Expressway.  Some committee members seem to think that I should intervene directly in internal matters of the company.  To do so would mean cutting across the role of not just the company but also trade unions in terms of agreeing work practices and terms and conditions.  I believe that the employees and the company are best placed to agree those types of issues and that external interference is unnecessary and unhelpful.  Obviously, I recognise that any such agreement will of course require flexibility and realism on both sides.</p><p> Such calls for ministerial intervention overlook the established role and expertise of the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court in assisting employers and employees in settling often very contentious disputes.  These bodies are best placed to assist the company and trade unions in reaching an acceptable agreement.  I believe we should be willing to learn the lessons of the past and recognise the benefits of allowing the industrial relations bodies to act in accordance with their statutory mandate and best professional judgment.</p><p> My view should never be mistaken for a lack of concern about the very serious financial problems that have beset Bus &Eacute;ireann or an indifference to the genuine anxieties of employees about their future.  I want the company to return to a path of viability and I wish to see the company prosper in the interests of its employees and its customers.  This can only be done by the company reversing the losses in its Expressway business and targeting those elements of its business model that are not competitive.</p><p> Negotiating with its trade unions is crucial to ensuring the company can compete effectively and return to profit in its Expressway services.  I am as impatient as any member of the committee to see a return to stability in the company's industrial relations.  A willingness to engage constructively and a spirit of compromise on both sides is critical to achieving this.  I also reject any suggestion that I, as Minister, or my Government colleagues are seeking a very low-cost employment model for Bus &Eacute;ireann.  This is not the case nor is privatisation part of the agenda.</p><p> I welcome the company's statement on Monday that it is committed to protecting basic pay rates and enhancing these as circumstances permit.  In order to compete, I consider that Bus &Eacute;ireann must continually adapt, modernise and respond to customer demand.  Some Deputies seek to blame Bus &Eacute;ireann's current problems on the reforming Public Transport Regulation Act 2009, which was brought forward by my predecessor, Mr. Noel Dempsey.  I think that shows a lack of understanding of what that Act seeks to do, which is to promote public transport and put the passenger at the heart of public transport policy.  I believe that the growth in the commercial bus market that we have witnessed shows that the customer is responding positively to these changes and that, fundamentally, more people using public transport is a good thing.  That is not to say that I am unwilling to review the effectiveness of existing legislation.  I hope to have opportunities to engage with the committee and other stakeholders on how the legislation can be strengthened to promote further the interest of passengers. </p><p> I know, and hope that the committee knows also, that different stakeholders have different roles to play as we move forward with resolving this issue.  I have taken actions which are proper to my position as Minister and which I believe will assist with the overall resolution.  However, my actions cannot substitute for the actions of others.  Those others are the employer and employees.  Their brief now is to engage in serious discussions and reach an agreement that will restore Bus &Eacute;ireann to a sustainable future.</p></speech>

That is a situation that nobody wants to see.  What steps is the Minister, as the major shareholder, taking in order to bring both sides closer to an agreement?  As I have stated on numerous occasions, I urge the Minister to take a more proactive role in this dispute in order to halt any strike action that may take place.  The Minister has stated previously that he cannot and will not get involved in this dispute.  One of the reasons he gave was the involvement of the Workplace Relations Commission.  It is claimed that should we have a prolonged period of strike action, we will face a very real possibility of Bus &Eacute;ireann having to close completely.  I put it to the Minister that should this happen, it will be too late to take action.  What we need now is the Minister's intervention in this dispute.</p></speech>

As Deputy Fitzpatrick and everybody listening knows, there are institutions and State bodies that have the expertise, ability and enthusiasm to bring these two groups together.  It would be absolutely wrong, and would play no helpful role, for me to suborn them and take their job and role, which they are paid and set up to do.</p> <p>  Deputy Fitzpatrick asked what I have done to resolve the situation.</p><p>I have done several things which should be able to help.  I have increased the amount of PSO funding.  It increased last year and it is increasing this year.  I am looking for it to increase again in the coming years.  I have consistently addressed the problems in rural Ireland that have been raised by many members of this committee.  I have consistently said that any routes which are closed will be filled in a way that ensures no area of rural Ireland lacks connectivity.  This was confirmed by the NTA here last week.  I think it successfully sets a firm foundation for the two parties to meet.  As I said in my opening statement, the review of the free travel funding is a necessary adjustment that probably should have been done some time ago.  It will make the situation more acceptable and will make it easier to reach a settlement.</p></speech>

In my view, the letter created a situation that could only lead to strike action.  If Bus &Eacute;ireann is serious about resolving this dispute, the letter must be withdrawn.  Will the Minister confirm to the committee that he supports our call to Bus &Eacute;ireann to withdraw the letter?  This committee wrote to the Minister to ask him to make such a request to the company, but we have yet to get a reply.  Will the Minister ask Bus &Eacute;ireann to withdraw the letter?</p></speech>

I am afraid I will not be able to do what the Deputy is asking.  I do not feel it would be the right thing to do.  As the Deputy knows, the WRC talks have adjourned.  The company and the unions have both stated that they wish to return to the WRC.  I see no reason that opportunity to return to the WRC to re-engage should not be taken up at the earliest possible opportunity.  I think that should be done without any preconditions on either side.</p></speech>

There are some very strong feelings involved.  It would be wrong for me to say I am on one side or the other in this dispute.  Such a statement could be misread.

The calls for my intervention are very understandable.  The frustration felt by the Deputy is very understandable as well.  Those who are calling for me to intervene are not explaining what they think my intervention will do.  That is the difficulty I see here.  I think any such intervention would be a distraction and a signal that I am somehow going to come into this industrial relations battle with money to offer.  I do not have money to offer.

Sometimes there are obstacles in disputes.  The main obstacle in this dispute is the letter.  I do not mean to keep repeating myself.  As a former businessman, I think the letter is wrong and is not achieving anything.  The Minister is a good Minister who does not want to see Bus &Eacute;ireann closing.  The letter is not achieving anything and should be withdrawn as a gesture of goodwill.  The removal of this obstacle would get the talks going.</p></speech>

I do not want our questions to overlap.  I have an observation for the Minister.  He mentioned that PSO funding has been increased.  I previously helped local communities in disputes when Expressway services were bypassing particular villages.  A solution was found that was agreeable to all sides to establish connectivity to Expressway services.  I ask the Minister to leave aside the industrial dispute for a moment.  Is he saying he will increase the PSO subsidy sufficiently to solve all the problems around the country?  The issue for Bus &Eacute;ireann, particularly in rural Ireland, is that its Expressway services cannot compete because they have to call to every town and village.  I imagine that if all these issues are to be solved, the solution will involve a drastic increase in PSO services.  The Minister spoke about a passenger-centred approach in the context of the announcement that the Athlone-Westport service is to be discontinued.  Is he saying that the people along the route will not be disadvantaged by the closure of that service?  Will a PSO service be put in to replace this service?</p></speech>

I cannot guarantee anything but that is our objective.  It is on an upward trend and I am very hopeful that it will continue as such.</p><p>We are talking about three routes being closed down and two being revised with reduced numbers.  As the Deputy will know, when that happens the NTA has committed to making an immediate assessment of whether people will be disadvantaged, how bad it is and whether the NTA needs to move in and substitute or put in more buses.  What happened the other day when the Athlone to Westport route was closed down, as the Deputy mentioned, the NTA reacted fairly quickly.  Let me read out its statement.  The Deputy will be familiar with the numbers.  The review reads:</p><blockquote>Bus &Eacute;ireann have announced a withdrawal of route 21 which currently provides 28 services per week from Westport to Athlone.  The Authority has determined that there is a public service obligation to continue to provide services between Westport and Athlone.<br /><br />The Authority is considering amending the existing PSO service 440 to provide 4 services per day in each direction from Westport to Athlone supplemented by 2 services per day in each direction on route 440A from Westport to Ireland West Airport Knock.  This would result in a doubling of the existing services.<br /><br />A more detailed assessment report will be published later with details of the route and timetables.</blockquote> <p>That is a pretty proper response.  The proof of the pudding is in the eating.  We have seen in that case, and in all other cases, an immediate response by the NTA.  Maybe it was prepared for all of these routes but I do not know.  It did say yes and provided a pretty fast replacement fleet. </p></speech>

It is disappointing that he needed to come back here, only four weeks after his last visit.  On the last day he said that he would share with us the NTA's review into the licensing system.  Perhaps the review is full of commercially sensitive information that he might need to redact.  Four weeks ago he promised that we would receive the review and we received it late yesterday evening.  The delay shows that he did not prioritise this issue.  We now realise, despite what he said at the time, that the review has more to do with procedural and compliance issues than the commercial viability of the Expressway service.</p> <p>  I have confidence in the unions, that represent the workers, and the management working together under the auspices of the WRC.  I do not have confidence in the Minister due to the level of commitment that he has shown regarding this problem since he assumed office nine months ago.  I remind people that he has been aware of this issue since then and his Department officials have been aware of the issue in excess of 12 months yet we are where we are today.</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned the PSO increase.  Has the number of passengers availing of the PSO service increased over the past number of years?  On the last occasion the Minister was here he claimed that the number of passengers using public transport had increased and that the majority of them used PSO services.  Has the PSO increased?  Incidentally, the PSO figure is less than it was in 2008.  How is that an increase?</p></speech>

The number has increased by 4 million since 2010 or 9%.  Last year the total number of Bus &Eacute;ireann PSO passengers was 32 million.</p> <p>  I shall answer the Deputy's question on the report that was received last night.  I concede that members will not have had time to digest the report.  Members will have plenty of time to digest it soon.  The report could not be just produced for members.  It needed redaction, which I had warned and told members about.  It was not just a matter of producing the report.  The report had to be perused very carefully because it contained commercially sensitive information, which members accepted.    </p></speech>

I know that the Deputy is very concerned about this matter.  Therefore, I will ask that he is briefed by the people in my Department or the NTA who compiled the report.  They will give him a full idea of what has been redacted.  It would be a pity if commercially sensitive information got into the public arena.  I know I can rely on him not to put the information in the public arena when we have assisted him.  I offer the Deputy a briefing on the redactions at a time that is convenient to him so that he is fully aware of matters.  I ask him to be reasonably discreet with the information when he gets it because it has been taken out of the public arena specifically for commercially sensitive reasons.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the D&aacute;il motion.  It is not quite true that I ignored the motion.  I can see his point but he has made several calls for me to do certain things in that D&aacute;il motion that he introduced.</p></speech>

The Deputy is well aware that 2008 was the high point and of why it fell.  The economy and the country's finances were in absolute turmoil, something on which we will not comment now.  The Deputy is well aware that during the recovery the subvention has increased.  It has been increasing for the past two years and will increase during the next two.  The Deputy should acknowledge this.</p> <p>  In his motion the Deputy addresses the issue of free travel.  As I said, I have instructed my officials to undertake a short and focused piece of work, with their colleagues in the Department of Social Protection, to analyse the funding associated with the scheme and make recommendations to the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and me.  </p> <p>  The Deputy addressed the NTA's licensing system.  The NTA already considers issues such as rural isolation and sustainable competition when considering applications from operators.  These are all included in the Deputy's motion which I am addressing and to which I have responded.  He should not tell me that I did not respond to it.  I have not responded where he requires an intervention, about which the Deputy is correct.</p> <p>  The Deputy addressed the NTA's power to approve or reject route amendments.  He is aware that it has completed a review of the legislation and submitted a report for my consideration.  The report, a copy of which he has in his hands, focuses on the process and procedure of the licensing system.  I will consider what amendments are required.</p></speech>

The Minister has answered the one question I asked.  </p> <p>  The rate of subvention has not kept in line with the numbers using the route.  It is welcome that it appears that there is an extension to the PSO service to Athlone and Westport to compensate for the removal of the commercial route.  A number of months ago, when we suggested some of these routes would never be commercially viable, although they were socially viable and required, and that they might need to transfer from Expressway to PSO provision, we were told it might need to be put out to tender.  Has the Minister confirmed that the routes do not need to be put out to tender?  When will the changes take effect?</p></speech>

The unions and management cannot address the huge deficit.  We need matters of policy, legislation and the licensing regime to be addressed.  Only the Minister can do this by bringing together the NTA, his Department, the Department of Social Protection, management and the unions.  The deficit of &euro;30 million will not be addressed through the WRC.  Surely the Minister will acknowledge that he does not expect a deficit of &euro;30 million to be worked out at the WRC.</p></speech>

I am interested in an industrial dispute being sorted out by the two parties involved.  If all of the parties were to come together and discuss policy, it would be a completely different matter.  For now, it is imperative that the two parties get together to avoid a strike.  If I was to call together all interested parties in a large forum, it would make it almost impossible to solve the dispute in the time allotted.  I never said I was against speaking to various stakeholders or parties, as the Deputy knows.  I am perfectly happy to do so.  However, I will not get involved in an issue which is a matter between two parties.  The Deputy's suggestion is perfectly reasonable.  It is a perfectly reasonable request outside the heated atmosphere of an industrial dispute.  My place at a table with all of the parties involved would be inappropriate and improper as they would ask me to do things I could not do.</p></speech>

The Minister has a role to play.  He did not answer the one key point of the question as to whether he believes the &euro;30 million deficit which management states needs to be addressed can be addressed at the WRC?  If not, where does the Minister believe it can be addressed?  It must be addressed through increased PSO payments by the Department of Social Protection and how licences are issued.</p></speech>

He never was when he was a newspaper columnist.  I have scanned through the document which we received late yesterday evening.  I have not read it in detail.  One of the points made in the document on the regulatory framework, which is crucial, deals with how Bus &Eacute;ireann competes with the commercial provider.  Commercial providers have a role to play.  I am not against them.  It states:</p><blockquote>The definition of what comprises a public bus passenger service lies at the very heart of any regime to regulate same.  The experience of the authority to date has identified that the current definition has substantial shortcomings which undermined both the operation and enforcement of the regime.</blockquote> <p>When can we expect a process to be put in place whereby these shortcomings can be addressed?  Does the Minister have plans to bring forward legislation to address them in order that we can ensure competition on the routes and enforcement in a fair and equitable manner?</p></speech>

The first was the lack of subvention.  The subvention to our public transport network is the lowest in Europe.  The second was the deliberate saturation of routes.  The third was the gross underfunding of the free travel scheme whereby just 41% of the average journey fare is covered.  The fourth is the fact that Bus &Eacute;ireann's accounts show that &euro;41 million was pilfered, if one likes, from Expressway services and pumped into the PSO services because of State underfunding.  I ask the Minister to accept that this financial crisis was caused by bad policy and mismanagement.  I ask him to acknowledge the workers had no hand, act or part in creating this crisis.</p> <p>  Does the Minister accept the unions' contention that the motorway network was saturated to over-capacity?  The NTA has claimed there is enough service volume to cover reduction in frequency on the Dublin to Limerick and the Dublin to Galway routes.  If there is enough volume of service there, does it not prove that it can comfortably say that it can reduce and remove the public transport network.  That just proves the saturation policy.  Does the Minister want me to repeat what the NTA stated?</p></speech>

The NTA has repeatedly stated that it leaves no rural community behind.  However, it is talking about removing an existing service and replacing it with another that will also cost money - perhaps even more.  There is no logic to that.</p> <p>  The Minister had previously said that replacement services might not be as frequent or as comfortable as current services.  The Minister is saying to the people that they need to be prepared to accept a second-class service.  Does the Minister feel putting out such a statement is acceptable?  It is not something to be proud of to say the people need to accept a second-class service that will not be as frequent or comfortable.</p> <p>  Does the Minister accept that EU Regulation (EC) No. 1370/2007 provides enough scope for the State to provide support for Bus &Eacute;ireann if it could be established, through a review of all Bus &Eacute;ireann current commercial services, that some of its services could be deemed as socially necessary?  Since taking up office did the Minister ever call for such a review given that it could be a mechanism to save the service?</p> <p>  We are blue in the face from asking the Minister the same questions over and over again.  Is he still prepared to sit back and do nothing?  He has repeatedly refused the call for all stakeholders, including his Department, involved to sit around in negotiations to try to find a resolution.  I ask him not to give the spiel that he will not get involved in an industrial dispute.  It is not necessarily an industrial dispute.  It was forced into this situation.  The Minister was asked if representatives from his Department, the NTA, and Bus &Eacute;ireann management and unions as the main stakeholders would get involved and he repeatedly refused.</p> <p>  Today, in the jaws of an all-out strike across the public transport network on Monday, he is still refusing, knowing full well the disruption and chaos it will cause along with the worry for people living in rural communities that services will be cut.  While knowing fully that the unions had pleaded with him to get into negotiations and knowing what lies ahead on Monday, he still refuses point blank even to send officials from his Department at the 11th hour to try to prevent this disruption.</p> <p>  Given that I and others have repeatedly asked the Minister and have listened to him repeatedly refuse, if he still sits here today and says he will not call for all stakeholders to be involved, then he and the Government will be directly responsible for the chaos that will ensue across the public transport network on Monday.  The Minister has been given every opportunity to try to resolve this.  Bus &Eacute;ireann's management bulldozed ahead with its cuts on 16 January.  This week it then sent out a further inflammatory letter knowing it would fuel the situation and the Minister still sat back and did nothing.</p></speech>

It is somewhat rhetorical language that the Deputy is using, saying that I sat back and did nothing.  That is patently false.  I can see what she is saying but that is absolutely untrue.  I have been extraordinarily active in this area.  What I have not done is the one thing she has asked me to do.  That does not mean inaction - quite the opposite.  I do not believe at what she calls the 11th hour it would be helpful.  It may be the 11th hour-----</p></speech>

I do not believe it would be any more helpful at the 11th hour to do that.  I am very hopeful that the parties will get together again in the next few days and behave in a responsible manner.  That is the consistent position I have taken.  The Deputy holds a different point of view but it is not one the Government shares.  I reject that I am doing nothing or sitting back.  The evidence is there; I have been extraordinarily active in this particular area but not in intervening in an industrial dispute.</p></speech>

In Clonmel, to which the Deputy referred, the NTA determined that no action was needed at the minute except for changes to the rural transport timetable to facilitate connectivity to commercial services.  That service calls at more towns and villages than Expressway.  According to the NTA, a detailed assessment is carried out in a separate report of the Dublin-Clonmel situation because the conclusion of that report is that there are sufficient services offered by Kavanagh's route 717 which operates 98 services per week from Clonmel to Dublin via Kilkenny.  The NTA states that some amendments will be required for local links service 817 C serving Carrick-on-Suir to Grangemockler to maintain the public service obligations, PSO, and connect to JJ Kavanagh's 717 service.  One could not possibly say that Clonmel is in some way isolated as a result of those cuts.  It is not.</p></speech>

I am not waving at the Minister, I am holding up my hand.  There are five days to go before a national bus strike which may well be the prelude to a national public transport strike.  Last year, the Minister said being Minister for transport was a doddle.  The Minister came to the committee on 1 February, exactly one month ago, and I asked him what the cost to the taxpayer would be were Bus &Eacute;ireann to become insolvent.  I asked him the cost in terms of payroll taxes forgone from 2,600 workers, redundancy payments for 2,600 workers and social welfare payments for those workers.  The Minister replied that off hand he could not give me those figures but could probably get a figure worked out.  He said he would get back to me.  It is not a week or two that have passed, it is a month.  I am asking the Minister to get back to me now.  What would it cost to make Bus &Eacute;ireann insolvent which, as Mr. Hernan says, could be on the cards by May, which is in a matter of weeks?</p></speech>

Presumably, we will be able to come up with a figure.  To talk about insolvency at the moment, however, might not be the most responsible attitude to take.

The situation has been painted by the acting chief executive officer of Bus &Eacute;ireann, Mr. Hernan.  He has painted the situation and said we are looking at the possibility of the insolvency of Bus &Eacute;ireann by May.  We are now in March.  It is a matter of weeks.  I am asking a straight question.  What will it cost the taxpayer for that insolvency in terms of payroll taxes forgone, redundancy payments and social welfare costs?  The Minister has had a long time to work out the answer.  I ask him to give us the figure.</p></speech>

What we are trying to do is avoid exactly that situation which Deputy Barry is painting.  There are people working night and day to avoid that.  That is not a situation which we wish to see and it is not one we envisage happening.

That should be moved up the agenda as a matter of urgency as I said at the start.  After five days, where is the urgency?  Also, Bus &Eacute;ireann should be compensated for having to go off the motorways to service towns and villages while competing with private operators.  A way must be found to do that and where there is a will, there is a way.  However, there is a lack of will here, which is the real issue.  Rather than find &euro;9 million or &euro;10 million to avert the strike and the crisis, which is peanuts in the greater scheme of things, the Minister prefers to put at risk &euro;59 million in payroll taxes from 2,500 Bus &Eacute;ireann workers, hundreds of millions in redundancy payments and hundreds of millions in social welfare payments.  He does so in order to make Bus &Eacute;ireann a low-pay company and to facilitate his privatisation agenda.</p> <p>  The Minister will become the first sole shareholder in history to watch his company head towards insolvency and over a cliff, all the while proclaiming there is nothing he can do.  Since Bus &Eacute;ireann was established in 1987, we have had many Ministers for transport.  We have had Jim Mitchell, Ray MacSharry, John Wilson, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, Charlie McCreevy, Brian Cowen, Michael Lowry, John Burton, Alan Dukes, Mary O'Rourke, Martin Cullen, Noel Dempsey, Pat Carey, Leo Varadkar and Paschal Donohoe, with Seamus Brennan having served twice.</p><p>There are some proper tulips in that group, but none of them ever brought the national bus company to the brink of insolvency.  It is happening on the watch of the current Minister, Deputy Ross.  Where is the urgency?</p><p> I do not know if the Minister considers himself to be a gambler.  Tesco gambled that the public would not support the Tesco workers if they went on strike, and have learned something in recent weeks.  Business was down by 80% in the shops where pickets were placed.  Business was down by 30% in other shops with no pickets.  There is a mood among the public of sympathy for ordinary working people who have not had pay increases for years when they stand up for their rights.  Bus drivers have not had any for eight years.  These are men and women who drive ordinary people to work, into town, to the next village, and who live in their communities.  There is a real danger that the Minister is misjudging the public mood here.  Fine Gael put out the slogan coming up to the previous election, "Keep the recovery going".  It got it completely wrong and misjudged the mood.  If the Minister thinks the public will not be with the bus drivers and against him and his Government, I suspect that he is misjudging the public mood as well.</p></speech>

I have said that quite simply and give my word on that.  I would not be trying to increase the public service obligation, PSO, subvention annually if that was the case.

That is why we provide a PSO levy.  Not all people live at either end of an Expressway route.  They live in the towns and villages in between and the Expressway services offer transport provision to those people in a way that many other transport providers do not.  Will the Minister address that particular issue with regard to there not being a PSO levy?  That particular aspect is not wholly commercial.  In addition to that, just under 20% of the population carries a travel pass.  Some commercial operators do not operate with the travel pass, so Bus &Eacute;ireann and the Expressway services would provide in the absence of that.</p><p>Where is the Minister's responsibility in this as a shareholder?  It was defined by the National Transport Authority, NTA, at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts that he attended a couple of years ago that, &quot;The primary function of the Government, as a single shareholder, is to manage the company.&quot;  The NTA also stated that:</p><blockquote>We simply advise the Department on what might be the appropriate levels of subsidy for public transport if we want to grow public transport in the State. [...] However, the Department manages the finances of CIE, as companies, because it is the shareholder.</blockquote> <p>I ask the Minister, as the shareholder, if there is sufficient capacity within Bus &Eacute;ireann to find savings that can help to resolve this dispute.  It looks to me as if there are only three things he can do.  He can increase fares, cut services or find savings.  Is there sufficient capacity identified within the company to provide services or to plug the gap?  Otherwise, what is being negotiated is simply something that involves cuts in the incomes of those who on the front line.</p></speech>

I do not believe it is up to me to do that, as a shareholder.  I believe it is up to me to monitor what is going on, but not to identify the issues, because that would be getting involved in the nitty-gritty of the wage negotiations.  That is a matter which will have to be resolved.  I think it is acknowledged by both sides.  I heard the union say last night that there is room for efficiencies, and the management is looking for savings elsewhere.  My view is that the company has to be run on a commercial basis, but the cuts which can be made or extra revenue which might be raised is a matter for the company.  That is why we have it there.  I have not identified specifically what can be done, and I will not be doing that.</p></speech>

That shows a lack of understanding about what the Act seeks to do, which is to promote public transport and put passengers at its heart.  The Minister asks us to take in good faith what he is saying in the statement.  He seems to have changed his opinion on the NTA.  He has left a trail behind him, showing his attitude to CIE and public transport.  He said in 2013 that:</p><blockquote>The National Transport Authority is a captive, a quick learner of the quango culture.  It was set up in 2009 to supervise Ireland&rsquo;s public transport shambles.  It went native immediately.  It has been highly politicised from Day One.  Its board is picked by the Minister.</blockquote> <p>The article continues:</p><blockquote>It serves a real purpose. It shields the Government from the political charge that it was the villain that put up public transport fares.</blockquote><p>The fares went up because the subvention was cut, which is something the Minister lauded at the time.  He was supportive of the cuts because he thought it would force a change in the governance of CIE and would bring savings.  Those savings have not materialised.  Does he believe there are savings that can materialise to avert this strike?  If not, the only thing being negotiated is cuts in incomes.</p></speech>

The Deputy is trying to draw me into the same situation as others, which is to get involved in something where it would not be helpful.

I am not asking the Minister to become involved in the industrial relations.  However, the parties must have something to negotiate.  There must be the funds to negotiate.  Other than that, what the Minister said in his opening statement about low wages and so forth is nonsense.  If the only thing that is available to negotiate within the industrial relations framework is a sizeable cut in the income of some of those who are negotiating, is it really a negotiation?  I am asking the Minister if he has identified a tolerance within the company that there is a sufficient income, because it says it is almost insolvent.  Is there sufficient tolerance within that company to have a basis of negotiation that is different from cuts for the people who drive the buses?</p></speech>

I am glad Deputy Murphy, like everybody else, realises the gravity of the situation.  The company is also saying that, unfortunately, it will be painful.  Saving this company will be very difficult.  However, it is an absolute imperative that a commercial company behaves commercially.  Wherever the savings have to be made will be decided by the two parties, not by me.</p></speech>

The authority I wish to criticise is the NTA.  It has acted like a widow whose husband was only buried in the past week and who walks out the following day with a new man.  The NTA has stepped in and straight away proposed alternative replacements to the routes that Bus &Eacute;ireann proposed to abandon.  There is no doubt that the Minister's constituency would like to see the Luas extended but what would happen if the NTA told the Minister's constituents that it would give them a couple of horse-drawn trams to fill the void?  I am sure there would be uproar.  There is a proposal to abandon some major Expressway routes and there is the issue of private operators on the so-called same routes.  I ask the Minister to take two days out of his diary to travel the Expressway route on one day and travel with the private operator on the next day to the same destination, for example, on the Cork to Dublin route.  The Minister will see a big difference in the time and alterations in the route.  How can that be a like-with-like comparison?  We seem to be up against a stone wall on this issue.  That is the reason we are saying some finance should be made available.  It is not like with like in terms of routes and competition.  It is not the same.  The NTA is doing its best to defend its role, telling the Committee of Public Accounts as late as last week in response to Deputy Aylward that Bus &Eacute;ireann can alter its Expressway routes.</p></speech>

The Minister mentioned that he was not in a position to wave his cheque book.  That is fine, but at the same time he is talking to the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, to look for more money.  How can Bus &Eacute;ireann talk to the unions and talk to the NTA about routes when it does not know what Deputy Varadkar will give it down the road?  It has not approached Deputy Varadkar and said, "Perhaps if you gave us this amount of money we could compromise or deal with the workers and save some routes in the meantime".  It is a loaded comment, but I believe the Minister should get involved.</p></speech>

The question has been asked previously.  It is fine.  I will address the Deputy's questions as well as I can.</p><p>He is talking about how individual routes like the Cork-Dublin route are operated.  The like-for-like comparison of individual routes is a matter for the NTA and not for me.  I see the point the Deputy is making.  As I have said previously, if there are problems in a particular area, the NTA will move in to ensure there is connectivity in that area.  It has done this in the past.  It is perhaps a little unfair to criticise the NTA for what it has done.  It was very prompt in its response.  I do not normally congratulate semi-State bodies or State agencies too rapidly because I do not think it is a particularly necessary thing to do.  However, I should say that the NTA's response in each of these cases has been commendable.  When the closures or reductions were announced, the NTA moved in and said what it was going to do.  It should be noted that the private operator on the Clonmel-Dublin route calls to more towns and villages than the Expressway service does.</p><p> It has been suggested that Bus &Eacute;ireann is negotiating without knowing what the situation is in respect of free travel.  As this dispute is not directly linked to the free travel negotiations, it would be somewhat difficult to say how much the company is going to get.  The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, has made it fairly plain that he does not want the issue of free travel to be exclusively linked to an industrial relations problem.  We have been very active on this issue.  We will continue to regard it as a matter of urgency.  We can be optimistic that the talks between my officials and the Minister for Social Protection's officials are going ahead in a very satisfactory way.  I hope we will be able to resolve these issues reasonably soon.  I think everybody recognises that because the levels, charges, prices and fares were fixed and frozen in 2010, there is a need for reforms in this area.  We do not yet know whether those reforms will take place immediately or next year, but the talks are progressing well.  Regardless of our political differences, we all want the anomaly that needs to be remedied to be addressed.</p></speech>

I want to comment on what I have heard so far.  I am listening to this with my hat from outside of the D&aacute;il on me.  The public is listening to us as we prepare for the buses to be pulled from the road next week.  It is possible that this will have a contagion effect on other bus, DART and rail services.  I cannot imagine how angry people must feel as they listen to a highly-paid Deputy who has been appointed as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport saying that it is not his job to intervene, that he does not identify the actual positions of cuts here and there and that it would be inappropriate, unhelpful and improper for him to have anything to do with interfering in this dispute.  The Minister's comments do not make an iota of sense to individual members of society who will be standing in the lashing rain throughout the month of March as they wait for some kind of bus service, or to workers and their families who will be on the picket line and left without wages, security or certainty.  I ask the Minister to listen to what he is saying.  I know he is not lying to us, but I suggest he is failing to take responsibility for a national disaster.  He is not making an everyday decision about whether there should be a route here or an increase there.  If this strike takes place, it will be a national disaster.  The Minister needs to listen to what he is saying.  He should think about this issue from the point of view of Joe Public and indeed the workers.</p> <p>  I have given the report a cursory glance because we received it at a late stage.  I would like to ask a number of questions and make a few points.  There has been a 111% increase in capacity on the Dublin-Limerick route over recent years.  That capacity was awarded to private operators by licensing through the NTA, but the Bus &Eacute;ireann service on the route is being cut.  The NTA's comment on that cut is that a high volume of services already exists on the route.  Of course that is the case.</p></speech>

We do not have much time.  I have two questions for the Minister.  I would also like to make a few points.  Have the cuts to services that have already been announced been risk assessed in terms for access for people with disabilities, who are stakeholders in all of this?  As members of the public, they have a right to use a public service.  As we have heard, it is a public good.  I asked the Minister about this in the Seanad recently.  It would be useful if he were to set out what he intends to do to on a year-by-year basis to make public transport accessible for people with disabilities in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  My understanding is that the private operator which provides the route 717 service from Clonmel to Dublin Airport, which has been mentioned by the Minister and others, does not have accessible vehicles.  An accessible fleet is used on the X7 Expressway service from Clonmel to Dublin Airport, which is being taken offline.</p><p>Both those operators are licensed as public service operators and should be operating on an even keel and making sure disabled people can participate in that.</p><p> I understand that the automated voice system alerting passengers with hearing and visual issues is in place and is not being used.  These are some of the issues that are not going to get solved in the next week or two but they are issues about the accessibility of a public service for all members of the public, young and old.</p><p> Drivers are not being trained to use the wheelchair lifts.  In professional bus driver competency training there is a module on drivers being able to assist people with disabilities.  My understanding is that the module is not being provided to drivers and it is supposed to be under the EU regulations we have taken on.  I have also mentioned the issue that in Dublin Bus and other city fleets there is long-standing provision for people with disabilities and people in wheelchairs having accessible spaces.  They are often used by other people and at the moment there is no way of preventing other people from using those spaces when people in wheelchairs need them.</p></speech>

That is exactly the point.  The Minister gave &euro;60 million to 1.3 million people in Dublin.  That is the reality.  I am all in favour of what is done in Dublin - 150% in favour.</p> <p>  Will the Minister tell us if it is his policy to provide rural bus services after 6 p.m. outside of the major towns, for example, on regular routes out of the likes of Galway and the rural services?  Is it the Minister's policy to extend services after 6 p.m.?</p></speech>

Private operators do not take people with travel passes; Bus &Eacute;ireann is required to take them yet on that route, no PSO subsidy is provided.  On a fairness basis, are we seeing a situation where the losses are artificially inflated because no PSO subsidy is given but Bus &Eacute;ireann has to take people who have a free travel pass?

I am led to believe that in one depot, there are 19 people on over &euro;1,500 per week.  There are four people as managers on &euro;100,000 a year.  Rather than looking at the lowly paid bus driver, has anyone gone in to examine redundancies or the salaries that are being paid at senior management level?</p> <p>  Does the Minister agree that under the PSO situation around rural Ireland, fewer and fewer Bus &Eacute;ireann buses will be able to compete and are competing on runs?

I do not know whether it is a matter of contention but it is a fair thing to comment on.  It would not be that hard to find out but no member of my Department has done that.  It would not be up to them to do it.  That is why there is a board, to look at those things and to approve remuneration.</p> <p>  On being fully privatised, no, we are not moving towards privatisation of PSO services.

As I see it, we are heading towards an awful lot of private buses.  There will be private buses and they will be there but we are losing a lot of Bus &Eacute;ireann, or what we would call CIE buses down the country.  Do we not need to make sure that a certain threshold of buses are kept in all parts of the country to make sure there is always competition there?</p></speech>

I am in favour, and all recent Ministers have been in favour of competition.  That is fine but not to have competition where the route is making a loss.  That would not make sense and the private operators would not do it anyway.</p></speech>

This is the second in a series of meetings to discuss the issue of road safety.  Previously, we heard from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, and the Road Safety Authority.  We are joined today by representatives of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Road Victims' Association.  I am delighted to welcome Assistant Commissioner Michael Finn, who deals with roads policing, major events and emergency management in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; Chief Superintendent Aidan Reid, Garda national roads policing bureau; Superintendent Con O'Donohue, Garda national roads policing bureau; and Ms Donna Price, Mr. Leo Lieghio, Ms Gillian Treacy and Mr. John Wilson of the Irish Road Victims' Association.  The topic of discussion is very sensitive.  It is a tragic matter and I reiterate my comment at the start of the previous meeting that, as a committee, we express our sympathy to everybody in the room and everybody who might be watching the proceedings who has suffered a bereavement or other loss in respect of road safety on our roads.  It is a very sad topic and, unfortunately, it has probably knocked on every door in the country, as it were, at this stage.</p><p>Before we commence, in accordance with procedure I am required to give the following notice.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I invite the assistant commissioner, Mr. Michael Finn, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

My colleagues, Chief Superintendent Aidan Reid and Superintendent Con O'Donohue, are very experienced members of the Garda traffic bureau.  This is my first appearance here in my new role.  If I do not have all the answers to all the questions, I will revert to my two colleagues.</p> <p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a very important role to play in road safety, given that we are the primary enforcement agency.  Our goal is to save lives and reduce the number of families who suffer the trauma of losing a loved one.  We are committed to ensuring our roads are a safe place for all who use them regardless of where they live, the day or the time of year.  We are out there every day of the year, including Christmas Day.  Unfortunately, this is the nature of policing and road fatalities.  In our enforcement role, we are very committed to putting more people into traffic to enforce our road traffic legislation.  We are committed to making greater use of our analytics and technology in order that we can have smarter policing.  We are committed to ensuring all our activities are focused on achieving the outcomes we have set out in the Government road safety strategy to reduce the number of deaths and serious injuries on the roads.</p> <p>  As of last Friday, our collision data were on a par with 2016.  Today we are up on the same period last year by two fatalities.  On the way here this morning, we got news of another fatality.  There is some good news in that our serious injury accidents are down 30% on last year.  Last year, our fatalities increased by 16% or 18%.  It was very disappointing for us.  The previous year was a very good year for us and it was our lowest year on record.  It is disappointing to see an upward trend again.  The chart in my written submission shows there is a good news story in that we have reduced the number of fatalities and serious injuries.  We cannot be complacent.  The statistics for 2016 show the necessity for all of us to be more focused on and committed to reducing the number of fatalities on the roads.</p> <p>  Drivers and passengers of vehicles continue to be the category in which we see the greatest impact in fatalities.  Last year, 35 pedestrians died, which is 19%.  The bulk of the fatal accidents occurred in the 100 km/h and 80 km/h zones, which are our national primary routes and national regional routes.  Only approximately 4% of accidents take place on motorways.  This reinforces the significant role our road engineering plays in road safety.</p> <p>  The 16 to 35 age group are the cohort that account for most of the fatalities.  There were 79 fatalities in this age group last year.  The other cohort in which we see high numbers of fatalities are those aged 66 and over.  They accounted for 44 fatalities last year, which represents 23% of our accidents.  Pedestrians and cyclists make up a large part of that group.  As people get older, their chances of being able to survive a road accident are reduced.  It is a serious cause of concern.  We are still very much focused on our Government target of reducing fatalities to 124 and serious injuries to 330 by 2020.  It is a major challenge.  While we realise we cannot do it alone, we have a very significant role to play.  There have been very good news stories for Ireland and where we have come from.  We are joint fifth or sixth in the EU for the number of fatalities per million.  We still have a lot to do.</p> <p>  Despite the drop in our numbers, our level of enforcement has remained proportionally high over recent years.  Driving under the influence has an impact on approximately 29% to 30% of fatalities.  Of the cohort involved in those fatal accidents, approximately one third have no insurance and 15% are driving while disqualified.  This is a very serious concern when we link those three statistics together.  In 2016, we had a 9% increase in our drink-driving and our checkpoints were up 2%.</p> <p>  Our Christmas campaign was very successful in the impact it had.  We had a very positive, strong media campaign which captured the attention of the entire community, not just our own people within the organisation.  We also increased our enforcement activity for Christmas.  Early indications we had after a week or two that there was a spike in drink-driving reinforced our vigour for our Christmas campaign.  At the end of it, there had been a 34% increase in drink-driving.  While it is not a good news story, it shows the level of drink-driving.  We had improved our rate of compliance with drink-driving laws.  This evidence shows there is a serious issue which we need to tackle.  To date in 2017, the trend for driving under the influence seems to be continuing.  There has been a 14% increase this year so far.  We have not got the message out to everybody.  We will focus on the message.</p> <p>  We issue fixed charge notices, FCNs, for drink-driving and we have issued more than 5,700 since 2011.  Almost 50% of them are in the 50 to 80 mg per 100 ml blood alcohol category, followed by 31% in the over 80 mg per 100 ml category.  The 20 to 180 mg per 100 ml "specified driver" category accounts for 20%.  There is a 75% payment of these FCNs, which means our time in court is reduced significantly.  Any garda will say one of the most contentious cases is going to court to contest a drink-driving case.  To have 75% of the charges paid up front without having to go near court is a great saving for us.  It means we have more people out on the road longer rather than sitting in a court.  The FCN is a positive story for us.</p> <p>  In 2017, we will have roadside breath testing for cannabis, cocaine, opiates and benzodiazepines.  For the fist time, we will have an offence of exceeding a specified limit for the presence of cannabis, cocaine and heroin.  We will be able to take people to court.  In the past, we had to prove impairment as well as the presence of the drugs.  With technology, we can measure the amount of each of those drugs in the system.  We welcome it and look forward to being able to enforce the legislation.</p> <p>  Speed is very important to us, given that it is a factor in approximately one third of accidents.  It is very much in our focus.  Speed plays an even more significant role in fatalities among motorcyclists.  It is one of our top priorities.  I recently saw a survey that stated one in five people admitted exceeding the speed limit.  This statistic tells a story.  However, 80% of people are complying.  There is a high level of compliance.  Our GoSafe vans in the speed enforcement zones have proved very successful.  There is approximately 99% compliance with the vans.  Their presence is impacting on road safety and reducing speeds.</p><p>That is a very good news story and we will certainly be continuing that programme.  We signed a new contract with GoSafe and we will roll out and extend that programme.  The committee may not be aware that we extended the number of speed detection zones last year, going from approximately 770 to over 1,000.  That means there were 355 new speed detection zones around the country.  We still get inquiries from various communities around the country asking why they do not have such a zone.  They have proven to have a very positive impact in reducing fatalities within the zones.  When we started, 30% of fatalities occurred in those zones, but five or six years later that rate is down to 15%.  It certainly had an impact.  We will not be able to maintain that because we have extended the number of zones and it will take a while before we come to that level again as we increase our coverage across the country.  The speed detection zones and the GoSafe vans are a good news story for us on the speeding issue.<br/><br/>I was looking at some statistics on the detections for those GoSafe vans before I came here today.  If we compare the volume of traffic coming through on a daily basis with the increase in fines, there is an increase in the level of compliance with speed limits across the country.  That arises when we factor in the increased amount of traffic and the amount of detections.  It is certainly a good news story overall and we will pursue it.  There is a very high rate of compliance with regard to speed limits.  Our role is not all about detections and we are quite happy to have GoSafe vans out there and reducing the number of people caught speeding.  Our role is about getting compliance through enforcement.  We are not out to catch people, although sometimes we are accused of that.  To me, we are successful if we are catching fewer people.  It would be good news for all of us and the GoSafe vans have proved it.<br/><br/>With regard to general to general road traffic enforcement, there were fixed charge notices, FCNs, for all sorts of offences last year.  We issued over 326,000 fixed charge notices for offences relating to speed, safety belt usage, a lack of tax and so on.  Like the FCNs for drink-driving, there is a 74% payment rate for them.  When I was a young garda, every time we detected an offence relating to speed or anything else, we ended up going to court to prosecute.  The garda&iacute; spent a significant proportion of their time in court but now we have an almost 75% payment rate, our garda&iacute; will not have to spend that much time in court.  The FCN statistics are another good news story.<br/><br/>From June this year we will have a third payment option.  In the past, a person going to court could argue that a notice was not received but that excuse will no longer be valid; the day a person gets a summons for court, he or she also gets the option to pay the fine instead of going to court.  A person cannot then go to court and say he or she would have paid the fine if he or she got the opportunity.  We will now give people the opportunity to pay the fine, which will have an impact on the number of cases of people going to court and people getting off with speeding because of an argument that the fine was not received.  That loophole will also have a good impact on enforcement.  We will have online payment facilities for non-penalty point offences.  If there is a fine for not displaying tax, a person can go online and pay the fine, as people do for most utilities nowadays.  That will assist us and the motoring public.<br/><br/>Non-use of seat belts and mobile phone usage are in our category of &quot;killer offences&quot;.  Our enforcement strategy for 2017 will be very much focused on that.  Last year we had approximately 10,000 FCNs for not wearing a seat belt.  By and large, that has reduced significantly over the years.  I had a look and ten years ago the number was something like 22,000.  The level of compliance is there and even in modern cars, the alerts are there and people are more compliant.  There are people who are still out there committing these offences and, unfortunately, it has a very significant impact when somebody is involved in a collision and is not wearing their seat belt.  Our road safety campaigns have illustrated the issue only too well.  The other area I should flag as a cause of concern for us is mobile phone usage.  Despite technology and people having the facilities of hands-free kits in their car, there are still many people out there using mobile phones on a daily basis in cars.  They are probably a silent killer in road traffic accidents.  It is very hard to detect their usage after the incident but surveys carried out by the Road Safety Authority suggest the level of usage is still ongoing.  We will certainly target that in 2017.<br/><br/>Another area in which we have seen significant activity is taking a number of vehicles off the road that are either defective or where people are using them with no insurance etc.  Last year we saw an increase, with an additional 6,000 vehicles taken off the road.  We are talking about 30,000 cars seized from the public because of no insurance or something seriously defective in the car.  That level of activity will continue because those people are putting other road users at risk either with vehicles being defective or having no insurance to drive those cars.  We welcome any new legislation to help in that regard.<br/><br/>With regard to the policing plan for 2017, as I stated at the outset the killer offences of speeding, impaired driving caused by mobile phone usage and non-use of seat belts will certainly be targeted.  We are very determined to maximise our full potential in terms not just of using the traffic corps but the district personnel we have in every Garda station around the country.  We got massive buy-in at Christmas time with the extra contribution they made.  They did more checkpoints than we did in the traffic area.  That is something we need to leverage and our policing plan for 2017 is built very much around that type of engagement.  We have more people out there in every division and Garda station around the country because of the new recruitment campaign.  There are 800 new garda&iacute; on the streets and we want to engage with them, ensuring they are tuned into traffic and focused in terms of road traffic policing for 2017.  We certainly see them as having great potential and being a great asset to us.  They are young and energetic and we want to exploit that.<br/><br/>Roads policing is very much about depriving all the criminals on the road and we have had some good success.  The other day we had a checkpoint on the N7 and with the use of our automatic number plate recognition technology we were able to &quot;ping&quot; somebody passing by who we knew has an interest in drugs.  Lo and behold, we made a significant drugs seizure from that.  I suppose that is smart policing in terms of using all our resources to our benefit.  Our enforcement campaigns do not have to relate solely to drink-driving or traffic and they can be useful in a cross-section of elements.  Using technology can be of great advantage to us in that regard so it is up to us to leverage that and make more of it in future.  As I stated, we have shown with GoSafe and robot vans that we can detect more people initially, which results in more compliance.  Technology will help us and we can leverage it in that regard.  Chief Superintendent Reid will describe later his initiative with the port tunnel where we will put in cameras and use technology to detect people speeding through the tunnel.  We have the technology and capabilities so the investment in a modernisation programme for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will give us opportunities to leverage that and do more with less, which is what we are trying to achieve.<br/><br/>There are other initiatives we are involved with through the year.  We are involved in many of the European Union operations and we work with agencies such as the Road Safety Authority, the Health and Safety Authority and the Revenue Commissioners.  There are multi-agency checkpoints and it is not just about policing; there are other agencies with an interest and our working together has been very beneficial to us in the past.  Our public awareness campaign was very much about complementing the Road Safety Authority and media campaign for Christmas and it is very useful to us.  We have a big following on Twitter and Facebook and we get great feedback when we put up a car seized for driving with no insurance or tax, for example.  The public welcomes us doing that and we can use that as a message to get out there to the cohort who drive and use social media as their method of engagement.  They do not read <i>The Irish Times</i>or listen to RTE 1.  We must focus on them and consider how to engage with them through the likes of Twitter and Facebook.  That has been very beneficial for us so far.<br/><br/>We also go to schools with the Road Safety Authority's safety programme.  We have taken road shows out there.</p><p>It has had an impact on tomorrow's drivers.  If we engage with them today and get them into good practices we will reap the benefits.</p><p> I am sure the committee is interested in resources, which have been a challenge for us.  Over the past five years the numbers in the traffic corps have declined, as did the numbers in the organisation.  The numbers are in my presentation.  New graduates are coming out of Templemore however, and the Commissioner has agreed to a 10% increase in the traffic corps for 2017.  Only last week I brought a proposal to her that we would bring each of the 800 people now in training into the traffic corps for a ten-week cycle so that they get an appreciation of the importance of the role they have to play in road traffic.  We can give them the experience and tools so that when they are out doing their day-to-day work, they will be focused on traffic.  The impact of that this year will bring benefits for enforcement and getting the message out on road safety. </p><p> We are not too badly off for new cars and equipment.  Last year the investment came and we have new high-powered cars for the motorways.  That helps us to have a presence.  There are several initiatives in the pipeline for working with the driver licence and Superintendent O'Donohue will allude to that shortly.  We can do much more if we link with the agencies such as the Road Safety Authority, RSA, on the licences and the courts.  Utilising technology we can do much more, faster and better, which will increase our presence on the road. </p></speech>

We provide practical and emotional support to road victims and their bereaved families free of charge, seven days a week.  We advocate for the bereaved and injured victims, and work with all road safety stakeholders in our combined efforts to reduce road dangers.  As members of the Victims Rights Alliance, we also work to ensure the transposition and full implementation of the EU directive on victims of crime into Irish law.  IRVA is a member of the Global Alliance of NGOs for Road Safety and of the European Federation of Road Traffic Victims, both of which have UN consultative status and through them, we are also members of the United Nations Road Safety Collaboration.</p> <p>  We are regularly consulted by the World Health Organization, WHO, and we were asked to speak as a panellist at its Post Crash event, which focused on the post crash response and on justice for victims at the second high level conference on road safety in Brasilia in 2015.  Following on that, the WHO has now asked us to contribute to an e-learning module on legislative aspects of road safety and in particular to one module dedicated to the experiences and needs of those affected by road traffic injury, relative to legislation.</p> <p>  I founded IRVA with members of the Defence Forces who had lost colleagues on the roads, following the death of my son Darren who was killed in 2006 while travelling to college in Athlone, the same year that the Road Safety Authority, RSA, was launched.  It was a particularly horrific year on our roads, not just for my family but for the 365 families who had a loved one killed on the roads that year, not to mention the many more who were seriously injured, estimated at five times that number.  During that time, together with others, we were invited to address the transport committee when mandatory testing for alcohol following fatal and serious injury was included for the first time in our legislation.  Quite unbelievably, and to the horror of all of our families, we found that in nine out of ten fatal crashes, the surviving driver was not tested for alcohol or drugs.  Our families have had to live with the consequence of this failure, a grave injustice.</p> <p>  Since 2006, we have almost halved the deaths on our roads, and we commend the RSA, the Garda, the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, and all stakeholders on their efforts in helping to bring this about.  However, no life is dispensable and even one avoidable death is one too many, knowing as we do, the utter devastation caused to our families and communities.  Our lives have been destroyed forever.  There is still so much that we can and must do to save lives.</p> <p>  It is 11 years this very month since my son Darren was killed and 11 years also in September, since the RSA was established.  These were 11 years during which we have had too many more totally avoidable deaths and serious injuries, despite all of our efforts.  We are still fighting for more resources for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, for improved Garda investigations and for required changes in legislation.  We are still fighting for criminal charges, prosecutions and sentencing that reflect the seriousness of the crime committed of taking a life or affecting the quality of a life.  These are real crimes and not just misdemeanours and we feel there should be a vehicular manslaughter charge included in legislation to reflect how seriously society sees these deaths, a charge of careless driving in such circumstances being clearly inappropriate. </p> <p>  The Garda investigation forms the cornerstone for justice.  In the absence of a thorough investigation, in which there are mandatory checks of all of the known contributory causes of these fatal collisions, we will not see prosecutions which reflect the taking of our loved ones' lives.  We firmly believe that criminal court cases highlighted in the media in recent years are sending out the wrong message and that they are certainly not acting as a deterrent.  Too few of these deaths are resulting in prosecutions for the crime of taking a life or affecting the quality of a life.  Fewer than 15% result in a charge of "dangerous driving causing death", the only homicide offence.  Why?  We believe there is too much victim blaming and that there is still no routine and mandatory checking of all of the known contributory causes of these collisions.  This is vital work which must be done in all cases to determine what crimes have been committed before a file is forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, with the Garda recommendation regarding prosecution.  This must change now both in order that justice is seen to be served and to act as a deterrent.  Our road safety work and data collection must also be truly evidence-based.  Road deaths should be investigated and prosecuted like other homicides, with hearings taken out of the lower courts, and heard instead in the higher courts before a jury.  Road crime is real crime and road victims are entitled to the same information, support and protection that is afforded by our criminal justice system to other victims of crime.  Just because a death is caused by a car it is no less of a death.  These deaths and serious injuries are not accidents and terminology is vitally important.  Our legislation and road safety efforts should reflect this.</p> <p>  We are aware that there has been some discussion in recent weeks about the Minister's proposal to change the penalty for some drink-drivers.  We support these changes wholeheartedly.  The evidence is there that if the changes deter people from drink-driving, lives will be saved  Some Members of the Oireachtas may have concerns about the impact of that on rural areas but there is no proposal from the Minister to change the law as to when an offence has been committed.  I am sure no Member of the House wants to be seen to condone anyone in whatever pub in whatever part of Ireland drinking and driving and endangering others.  The same law applies to all of us.</p><p>I know the Minister's new proposal will come before this committee in the weeks ahead.  I hope that the committee will look at the proposal with an open mind and listen to the evidence to back it up instead of listening to the lobbying of vested interests.  This is something that the citizens of this State want.  I had a brief discussion with Deputy Troy at our vigil outside Leinster House.  I was encouraged to hear that his party has not yet taken a definitive decision to propose amendments to the legislation, despite media coverage to the contrary.  We appeal to the esteemed members of the committee to listen to the voices of the victims who have lived this nightmare and who have, unfortunately, experienced the injustice of our legal system which has failed to meet our needs.  Members have in their hands the power to enact legislation that will save lives.  We cannot excuse or condone drunk or otherwise impaired driving at any level, so I ask members to please think very carefully of the message they will be sending out.</p><p> I am joined by Leo Liegheo whose daughter Marsia was killed by a hit and run driver, and by Gillian Treacy whose son Ciar&aacute;n was killed by a drunk driver.  Gillian herself sustained horrific injuries in that crash.  We are joined by retired garda John Wilson.  Together we are happy to answer any questions the committee may have.</p></speech>

I thank its representatives for appearing before the committee today.  I was deeply moved to hear the families' stories.  To lose a family member as a result of a traffic accident must be traumatic, but to lose them as a result of drink-driving or dangerous driving must be heartbreaking.  I understand completely the families' frustration and I will, as they will, continue to fight for continued resources for the Garda.  I would like to show the families my complete support and I look forward to working with them in the future to ensure our roads are a safer place for all.  What measures would the families like to see implemented immediately that would make the roads a safer place?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-01a.381" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Donna Price" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017030100002#V00400"><p>Many measures must be taken.  We need to see more enforcement on the roads.  The Garda must be properly resourced for this to happen.  We were happy to hear from the assistant commissioner that the traffic corps levels are going to be increased by 10%, that 800 new garda&iacute; will be introduced and that they will take part in traffic enforcement for ten weeks once they qualify.  This is welcome news.</p> <p>  As I said in my opening statement, another measure would be to send out the right message that these are criminal offences, that they are crimes and not just misdemeanours.  Terminology is important and we cannot continue to refer to them as accidents.  They are not accidents because they are totally avoidable and preventable.  We would prefer that the terms crashes, collisions or road crimes were used.  We want to see an end to careless driving charges, especially in cases such as those seen recently in the media - and I am sure the members have heard of them - where repeat offenders with many previous convictions have killed people on the roads and they are getting away with charges of careless driving.  Clearly this is inappropriate.  Let us call them what they are.  It is vehicular manslaughter and the sentences in legislation should reflect the seriousness of the crime committed, which is the taking of a life and affecting the quality of a life.  More severe sentences are required, not because we are looking for vengeance or restitution but simply as a deterrent and for people to realise that if they are going to drink and drive, they are committing a crime and they are endangering our families on the roads.  Quite simply, we cannot condone this behaviour.</p> <p>  My opening statement also suggested that when the worst happens and a person is killed or injured, then we must ensure there is a prosecution in most cases.  We are not seeing that.  For instance, the homicide offence, which is the only one under the legislation, is for dangerous driving causing death.  We performed a quick analysis for the four year period 2009 to 2012 to find there were 99 such cases, yet in those same four years there were 799 road deaths.  What happened to the other 700 cases and why do we not read about those cases in the media?  They were not all as a result of victims' error on the road.  We are seeing many prosecutions for minor road traffic offences such as no insurance, no tax, bald tyres or perhaps exceeding the speed limit, but no mention of the fact that a death has occurred as a result of that offence.  We need to see more cases for vehicular manslaughter before the courts, not just the lesser and minor offences.</p> <p>  For that to happen we must have thorough Garda investigations.  I know the garda&iacute; carry out the investigation but they may be led down a certain route to the exclusion of all others.  We advocate for a garda investigation that will thoroughly and routinely check all the known causative factors of these crashes before the file is sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions with the Garda recommendation regarding a prosecution.  It would be a box-ticking exercise with somebody overlooking these files to ensure the tachograph chart, for instance, has been checked for the working hours for commercial drivers, that the mobile phone records have been checked, or that the tests for blood alcohol and drugs levels are checked.  These things should be done routinely.  Unfortunately, we found that until it was mandatory under legislation to test for alcohol, it had not been done with the surviving driver in 90% of cases.  We ask that these checks are part of the legislation.</p> <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na implements the law to the word.  If it is not in the legislation that these checks must be done and shall be done, then the likelihood is that they will not be done in all cases.  The result of that is our families having to live with the consequences.  Without the Garda evidence that a crime has been committed, our families are left with no prosecution and we cannot prove, for example, that the death of our loved one was as a result of a driver texting on a phone.  We cannot prove it unless that check is carried out and the evidence is submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  It is vital.  The Garda investigation forms the cornerstone for justice and this is why we want those things included in legislation.</p> <p>  We also want the legislation to be consolidated.  As we know, the Road Traffic Acts go back to the 1960s and they are a maze.  One cannot navigate a way through that legislation without legal expertise.  The Road Traffic Acts are the most challenged of legislation so it is imperative that the law is modernised and updated.  It must be clear on what crime has been committed and what will be the penalty or punishment.  These are a few of the changes we think need to be made.  I hope it answers Deputy Fitzpatrick's question.</p></speech>

I was alarmed at the number of pedestrian deaths recorded in the 50 km/h zones - the assistant commissioner stated 16 - while there were no pedestrian road deaths recorded in the 30 km/h zone.  This is very revealing and it suggests that we must look at the 50 km/h zone and, where possible, look to have those zones reduced to 30 km/h, particularly in built up areas.  I am interested to hear the assistant commissioner's views on this and perhaps he can give some insight into why there is such a large difference between the two zones.</p></speech>

More than 40 people killed in the 50 km/h zone, 16 of whom were pedestrians.  Three people were killed in the 30 km/h zone.  It is a scientific fact that the lower the speed at which a vehicle is travelling, the greater the likelihood of the person surviving an impact.  The rule of thumb is if we could lower the average speed by 1%, we would reduce the chances of injury by 2%, serious injury by 3% and death by 4%.  I will put this into context.  If we can reduce the speeds in built-up areas, the net effect is that a pedestrian, a cyclist or other vulnerable road user has a greater chance of surviving a collision.</p><p>It is a no-brainer for us.  A lower speed is good news for us.  We welcome the introduction of even lower speed limits in some of the areas.  We support lower speed limits.    </p></speech>

While I welcome this dramatic reduction in the number of road fatalities, I am concerned that the number has risen in the past couple of years.  What is the reason for the increase?  What immediate measures can be taken to ensure we halt a worrying upward trend?</p></speech>

A lot of work was done such as new legislation on drink-driving and the introduction of GoSafe vans.  All of this increased the public perception that one would be caught if one committed an offence.  The level of compliance has brought about a change, particularly in the behaviour of road users and, primarily, motorists.  The change in behaviour has been instrumental in reducing the number of fatalities.</p> <p>  Enforcement is a key aspect.  Our role is important and, hence, we have committed to increasing the size of the traffic corps to increase the level of enforcement and address the increases in the number of road deaths we saw last year and in the two preceding years.  Without doubt, enforcement has a role to play.  That is why it is important that we increase our numbers and, now that we have the resources, we have put extra resources into the traffic corps because new recruits have been deployed to the traffic unit.  We place importance on the traffic corps due to the undeniable positive impact it has on the number of fatalities. </p></speech>

Can the witnesses tell me why the figure is so high and rising?  How does the figure compare with other types of addictions?  What measures are needed to curb drink-driving in Ireland from the point of view of the Garda?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-01a.388" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Finn" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017030100002#W00500"><p>Enforcement is probably the most important item for us.  That is our primary role.  We are the enforcement agency so we must be visible.  We upped the ante with our  Christmas campaign and utilised all of the resources that were at our disposal to make an impact.  The 34% increase at Christmas time was because we were out there and so did more.  The media side of the Christmas campaign was powerful and even inspired our own people.  We could see from an early stage in our campaign how many people were prepared to drink and drive.  There must be a deterrent.  If people do not see a deterrent then they will continue to take a chance.  A combination of factors act as a deterrent and our presence is one of them.  To me, good strong legislation and a good penalty act as a deterrent.  All of this has an impact when people are deciding whether to chance driving home.  People weigh up certain factors when trying to make a decision such as the chance or likelihood of getting caught and the penalty if one is caught.  I support any measure that will convince people of the dangers of getting caught drink-driving.  I do not just mean the immediate impact drink-driving has on other road users.  I believe one reason that drink-driving legislation is contested so vigorously is because losing a driver licence has an impact.  I recollect from the time when I was a young garda on the street that drink-driving cases were vigorously contested in court.  People value their driver licence and the potential to lose one's licence makes people reflect.</p></speech>

Drink-driving is only classified as a road traffic offence.  It is time, in 2017, that drink-driving became a crime in this country.  It is a crime in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  Imposing a fine and a disqualification is not good enough.</p> <p>  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, has found it difficult to enforce tougher legislation that deals with drink-driving.  It is time that we considered introducing mandatory prison sentences for people convicted of drink-driving.  I suggest a period of three months to five years.  Has anyone here ever heard of an individual being sent to prison for drink-driving?  The maximum sentence that can be imposed for a drink-driving offence is six months imprisonment or a fine of &euro;5,000 or both.  It is very rare to hear of an individual being jailed for drink-driving in this country.  It is merely a road traffic offence.  If an individual shoplifts and steals chocolate or a pair of underwear from a shop on Grafton Street and is convicted in the District Court then that person has committed a criminal offence and is, therefore, a criminal.  The same individual can drink five times over the legal limit and if he or she is convicted in the District Court, it will be deemed a road traffic offence.  It is time we made drink-driving a crime.  Anyone who gets behind the steering wheel of a car while under the influence of alcohol or drugs is nothing more than a criminal. </p> <p>  In terms of the despicable sentence that was handed to the criminal who killed Gillian Treacy's son Ciar&aacute;n, the presiding judge, God bless him, handed down the strongest sentence possible.  Subsequently, the Court of Appeal overturned the sentence and reduced it by a couple of years down to six years all because of a legal precedent.  It is time that dangerous driving causing death was replaced with a charge of vehicular manslaughter that carries a 15 or 20-year sentence.  The measure would focus the minds of criminals like the man who destroyed the Treacy family forever.</p> <p>  In terms of the Deputy's original question, it is time that drink-driving was reclassified as a criminal offence and that harsher penalties were introduced.  I agree with the assistant commissioner when he claimed the solution is enforcement.  In many parts of this country the fear of getting caught is almost non-existent.  I respect Deputy Michael Healy-Rae in terms of other legislation that he has been involved in or commented on.  His reluctance to impose harsher penalties on drink-drivers is unfortunate.  I am very disappointed by his actions.  </p> <p>  As recently as last Sunday I spoke to an individual in Cavan.  He is a very decent and hardworking man yet, in 2017, he sees nothing wrong with going to the pub, drinking four or five pints and driving four or five miles home in his car.  The people in rural Ireland deserve the same protections as those who live in urban Ireland.  If we want to stamp out drink-driving we must make it a criminal offence and impose proper penalties, not just fines and disqualification.  We must ensure that anyone who is convicted of drink-driving is deemed a convicted criminal in the same way as a person who commits an armed robbery or serious assault. </p></speech>

Garda resources have been mentioned.  Has the assistant commissioner received a commitment that some of the 800 new recruits will be deployed to the traffic corps?  He has said that he is happy enough with the resources available, the data, new cars and everything else.  I have been lucky that none of my family has every been connected with a road death.  I have three children and the last thing I would want to get is a knock on my front door and being informed that something has happened to any one of my children.  Has a commitment been given to increase resources?</p> <p>  I agree with Mr. Wilson that we must seriously consider introducing a zero tolerance for drink-driving.  People already know that they are over the limit if they take one or two drinks.  That is why I maintain we must have zero tolerance.  I have three children and I have tried to convince them and other people that once a person has taken a drink that he or she cannot drive.  Zero tolerance would be worth it if the policy saved one life.  I would like to know the opinions of Mr. Wilson and that of the families present to zero tolerance for drink-driving.</p></speech>

We need to work on that cohort and the message that while 20 mg is not zero, bringing down the limits has helped to change the public's attitude towards drink-driving.  It was 100 mg when I was a young garda.  The penalties and enforcement, as Mr. Wilson has said, are the real deterrents to drink-driving and are going to impact most on it.</p> <p>  I was asked about resources.  We have committed to increasing our level of resources by 10% this year.  That is the start of it.  As more people come out of the Garda College, we will continue to build the traffic corps back up to the 1,000 we had in 2007, when our force was at its peak.  We have that cohort of young people who have joined An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na since 2014.  More than 800 have completed their training.  I have a commitment from our own senior management that I can take those young men and women into the traffic corps and give each of them that experience.  That will be valuable for changing their mindset about the people they engage with and to teach that drink-driving is something that we have to get out there and enforce no matter what part of the country we are in.  Deterrent is the biggest factor.</p></speech>

I drove a taxi for 20 years, and in that time I saw the disrespect there is for the law.  I was stopped about five times to be breathalysed.  There is an impression that one is not going to get caught.  I back everything Mr. Wilson and Ms Price have said.  I have campaigned for vehicular manslaughter to be brought in since Marsia died 12 years ago.  I would also like to see the confiscation of cars, especially from repeat offenders.  I find that this would have a huge impact on people, especially young people, if they thought their car would be taken off them for drink-driving or speeding.  If there are advertisements on a television that a person will have his or her car taken, I guarantee that it will cause a cut in road deaths.</p> <p>  If one uses Google to search for drink-driving, the first thing listed is a solicitor advertising an 80% success rate in getting people off charges.  Such things should not be allowed either.  The Members of this House have the power to do something to save lives in this country and to save other families from going through what we went through.  Justice for our families is long gone now.  We will never get justice.  We are not looking for revenge.  Do Members want to wait for that knock to come on their door or a phone call to tell them that a child or family member has been killed?  In this day and age, there is no excuse whatsoever for drink-driving or driving while impaired.  The warnings are all there.</p> <p>  I know zero tolerance for drink-driving is going to be difficult to achieve, but the proposal of the Minister, Deputy Ross, is not to reduce the limit, just toughen the penalty.  I beseech the Members of this House to act on this, support the measure completely, and toughen the sentences.  The consequences are drastic.</p></speech>

An opportunity to engage like this is very productive.  We are here because before Christmas, we as a committee wanted to bring forward hearings on the issue of road safety and the worrying trend last year where we saw an increase in fatalities on our roads for the first time in a number of years.  Collectively, all the political parties, though I can only speak for my own, want to bring forward legislation that will address the number of fatalities on our roads.  I am not as emotionally involved in this debate as the witnesses evidently are.  I sympathise with the families who have been bereaved over the years.</p> <p>  As one of the contributors said, we have to ensure penalties are proportionate.  We have to ensure that sentences reflect the seriousness of the crime and that there are deterrents.  What I am getting from the presentation is that the biggest deterrent is enforcement on the roads.  That has been backed up by facts.  In December 2016, there were 34% fewer fatalities on our roads because there was a greater presence of garda&iacute; on our roads and because there was an extensive media campaign about the consequences of drink-driving.  We seem to be focusing all our attention on drink-driving, which incidentally is not the biggest contributor to deaths on our roads.  If one compares it with to December 2014, there was a 24% difference when the Garda had a greater presence on our roads.</p> <p>  I welcome that Assistant Commissioner Finn has been appointed to his role.  It was left void for a long time and that in itself gave an indication of the commitment to road safety.  The most senior position in this area in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was left void, with nobody in a leadership role, and there was nobody at the management level that Mr. Finn speaks about to fight to secure the additional resources.  We want to welcome and acknowledge that.  The strength of the force is still 400.  Will Mr. Finn explain to me the difference between the traffic corps and roads policing?  He spoke about the number of people in the traffic corps and about roads policing.  For my benefit and perhaps that of others, will Mr. Finn explain the difference?</p></speech>

We are looking at calling the old traffic corps "roads policing".  We did not want the traffic corps to be out there for a sole purpose and not seeing other opportunities.  I mentioned the M7 recently with regard to drugs.  If we are there and we are policing, whether as a traffic corps member or whatever, if a car comes along and it pings garda&iacute; and they know it is a drug thing, they have to pull it over.  That is a bit of semantics on the names, but we are talking about the same thing.  Roads policing is about being on the road, enforcing traffic rules, and that applies to everybody.</p></speech>

That is positive because it will enable them to fill in voids or cover holiday leave in future.  When does Mr. Finn envisage that the traffic corps will be back at full strength?</p></speech>

At the moment, somewhere between 800 and 900 get into the organisation each year.  If we can continue or expand that, it would help us accelerate the numbers we bring into the traffic corps.  We are operating around that 10% figure.  It is what we have focused on with regard to resources that we are going to put into the traffic corps.  If we can get more people in or other factors come into play, we would certainly be open to it and I would welcome getting more people into the traffic corps.  I will be there at the management table looking for more.</p></speech>

It saves members of the traffic corps from going into court where the person who has been caught is fighting the case.  It gives Mr. Finn an opportunity to have more of his force out policing the roads.</p><p>I have a question about someone who is caught over the limit.  No one for a moment is condoning the behaviour of anyone caught over the limit.  What is the turnaround time from when they are caught?  What is the timescale for someone caught this evening?  It could not be me because I do not do it, but if I was caught this evening, how long would it take for me to lose my licence by going through the courts system?</p></speech>

Before I address that question, I wish to comment on the categories.  The rate is approximately 75% for the payment of fixed charge notices.  It is 82% for those with a blood alcohol concentration, BAC, of between 50 mg and 80 mg per 100 ml.  The figure is 75% for the people with a BAC of between 80 mg and 100 mg.  There is a greater level of payment among those in the category between 50 mg and 80 mg.  However, even at the higher BAC level, there is still a 75% payment rate for those who get disqualified &ndash; 75% still pay up.</p> <p>  Deputy Troy asked about the time for a case to get through the court.  It varies.  I would have to come back to the committee with an exact answer.</p></speech>

It depends on how busy the court is and whether the person is charged at the time.  Deputy Troy used the example of someone who was arrested today.  Let us suppose a driver is taken to a station and the evidential breath testing instrument is used.  Then, let us suppose we get back a reading straight away.  A garda can charge the driver and bring him before the court.  In that case it could be dealt with within a month or six weeks, given an adjournment and time for the defendant to get a defence in place.</p> <p>  Let us suppose the driver gave a blood or urine sample that has to go for analysis.  It would come back from the medical bureau in a couple of weeks.  Under that process, the driver is issued with a summons.  The court date depends on how busy the court is and the associated scheduling.  It could be six to nine months.  A small percentage could go outside that timeframe.  With a summons, it can take six to nine months and with a charge, the timeframe is probably within six to eight weeks.</p></speech>

Let us consider the same scenario except that the driver is issued with a fixed charge.  If the evidential breath testing results come back, the case of the driver will be checked to see whether the driver qualifies for a fixed charge.  The fixed charge will issue within approximately six weeks.  The driver will then have 28 days to pay.  In that case, we know the driver is amenable for the crime &ndash; it is a crime.  The driver is made amenable and gets a penalty probably within six to eight weeks, regardless of whether he or she falls into the penalty point category or the disqualification category.  That case would be dealt with completely under the fixed charge system.</p></speech>

It applies to anyone who gets a fixed charge.  The chances are that the check is completed within two weeks.  The driver is issued with a fixed charge and given 28 days to pay it.  It is essentially a period of a month.</p></speech>

Certainly, it has been a great aid to us and even to the entire criminal justice system in terms of getting penalties imposed quicker.  Let us suppose someone gets disqualified on the basis of the example described by Deputy Troy.  Disqualification could be in place within six weeks as opposed to six months.  It is a far better process from our perspective in terms of enforcing the law without having to go to court every time.</p></speech>

There is a major focus on the 38% figure from last year.  There was a level of alcohol in their systems.  Let us break down the number of pedestrians, passengers and people who were disqualified but who were driving when they should not have been.  Let us include the number of people with no insurance who clearly have no concept of law.  Then, let us compare the number of people who have a BAC between the 50 mg and 80 mg with those with a BAC over 80 mg.  Can the assistant commissioner quantify the figures?</p> <p>  The figures the Minister quoted last week on the "Drivetime" programme were based on the Road Safety Authority analysis from 2008 to 2012.  New legislation came in dealing with penalty points and the fixed charge notices only came in during 2012.  Since then, there has been a downward trajectory in the number of fatalities on our roads.  Does that match the particular focus at the moment in respect of fatalities with a given alcohol level in their system?</p></speech>

Deputy Troy referred to the Minister's figures.  The Minister was perhaps alluding to the pre-crash survey which we did with the RSA.  The data went back to 2008.  I will offer a snapshot of some figures that might help to answer the question.  Between 2012 and 2015 the number was 879 for the category of specified drivers who get a three-month disqualification and pay a &euro;200 fine.  For those with a BAC of between 50 mg and 80 mg we had 1,844-----</p></speech>

Alternatively, they might be novice drivers or young people.  They all fall in to that category.  A total of 879 fell into that category.  In the same period, the number for the next category, a BAC of between 50 mg and 80 mg, we had 2,245.  The number for the third category, which is a BAC of over 80 mg, is 1,380.  Of the three categories under which drivers do not get a disqualification, the 50 mg to 80 mg category had the largest number of the fixed charged notices.  These cases do not go to court.  These drivers are in the fixed charged notice category.</p></speech>

I raised this question with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality.  I asked about the number of prosecutions under the fixed charge notice system.  Our data table does not correspond with the table provided by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at all.  I want to clarify that we are referring to the same legislation.</p> <p>  With effect from 27 October 2011, certain offences contrary to sections 4 and 5 of the Road Traffic Act 2010, including driving or attempting to drive or being in charge of a vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant, may be dealt with by way of a fixed penalty notice in lieu of the commencement of criminal proceedings for persons deemed suitable by the regulations.  I have to hand a data table showing the number of fixed penalty notices issued to persons arrested having been recorded as having in excess of 50 mg but less than 80 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood for the period 2011 to date.  In 2011, when these laws were commenced, seven people were prosecuted.  In 2012, a total of 111 people were prosecuted.  In 2013, a total of 68 people were prosecuted.  In 2014, a total of 47 people were prosecuted.  In 2015, a total of 62 people were prosecuted.  In 2016, a total of 69 people were prosecuted.  In 2017, only one person had been prosecuted up to two weeks ago.  I asked the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality about it.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, indicated that people were not showing respect for this legislation.  I asked the T&aacute;naiste to set out the number of repeat offenders but she could not come back to me with an answer.</p><p>She said she would come back to me, but she has not.  That is the argument we had the last day at this committee.  Where are the figures being verified?</p></speech>

Around 75% of people are prepared to paid their fines when caught for drink-driving rather than appear in court.  Apart from the financial aspect, we have so many people prepared to take the chance to drive while impaired on our roads, endangering all of our families.  Very few of them are going to court.  They take the fine and continue to drink-drive.  What we have seen in the five-year period between 2012 and 2016 is that 40,000 have taken that risk and have been done for driving while intoxicated.  It is an appalling vista to have that level of disregard for the law and for our safety and that of our families.  That is why it is so important to get away from the fixed charge penalty notice and to send out the message that drink-driving is quite simply not acceptable, that one will lose one's licence and will have to engage with solicitors to go to court to be represented.  That is how serious this offence is.  It is an endangerment offence and that is why it needs to be taken out of the District Court and into the higher level courts because of the devastation that it is causing.</p> <p>  We simply cannot condone people drink-driving, drug-driving, texting and driving or any form of impaired driving on our roads.  It is simply unacceptable.  We have to tackle it at source.  While fixed charge penalty notices are well and good and bring revenue into the coffers, they are not stopping that endangerment on the roads.  That is where we rely on our legislators to amend the law to make it a crime.  People will then take notice because people do not want to have a criminal record, lose their licence or lose their jobs.  Quite simply, one can be a repeat offender for drink-driving and be in and out of the District Court with hundreds of offences, yet one will not lose one's job.  It is not seen in the same light as another criminal offence.</p></speech>

People are not just statistics.  It is the duty of this Government and any government to protect its citizens.  How in God's name can people with so many previous convictions, especially motoring convictions, still be allowed to walk the streets and go out and kill other people?  My daughter's killer knocked my daughter out of her runners to the height of the traffic lights and was only charged with careless driving.  The garda&iacute; told us that she showed great remorse.  Two weeks later she nearly killed another 18-year old girl in Belfast.  That was after showing remorse.  This remorse thing has been used so many times in court.  The judges and the justice system are just accepting it.  Repeat offenders should be taken off the roads.  Either their cars should be confiscated or preferably they should be locked up and not be walking the streets.  The Government at that time and at present is responsible for so many deaths.  It is the Government's duty to protect these people but it is not doing it.  It is protecting the criminal.  These offences should be taken out of the Road Traffic Acts and made into criminal offences.</p></speech>

There is no doubt about that.  Anybody would acknowledge that greater presence on the road leads to greater enforcement.  There is definitely a correlation between the two.

I now have two analysts working in our traffic department full time to make sure that what we do targets the right locations at the right times using the data we share with the Road Safety Authority and the data from our own figures.  That helps to make sure that when we are out there, we are doing the right thing in the right place.  In the past, we were not as scientific in terms of how we did our business but now we can be.  We have hotspots and mapping in order that when our resources go out every day to every district, we know where the hotspots are and what times and locations are the most likely to see drink-driving based on our evidence.  With a combination of better resources and better technology, I think we will have better outcomes.  That is what we are focusing on.</p></speech>

If a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is convicted in the District Court or any court for theft or fraud, he or she will be dismissed from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na having notched up a criminal conviction.  If a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is convicted of drink-driving, he or she will not be sacked from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na unless he or she is on probation.  Otherwise, I am aware of a couple of cases in which garda&iacute; were convicted and remained on as serving members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Drink-driving is not a crime, it is a road traffic offence.</p><p>It may be included in the canon of crimes or whatever but it is not seen or regarded as a criminal offence.  That is a fact.  If an individual is before the court for the first time or 101st time for drink-driving or driving while intoxicated, the maximum conviction is six months imprisonment and a &euro;5,000 fine.  That is a fact.  Drink-driving is not classified or regarded as a crime in this country.  To reiterate, if an individual is convicted of stealing a pair of underwear from a shop in Grafton Street, he or she would have a criminal conviction.  As Ms Price has correctly stated, all drink-driving cases are heard in the District Court.</p></speech>

We are having these hearings in order to interact and engage with one another.  As I stated at the outset, we have a duty and responsibility to ensure sentences should reflect the seriousness of the crime and penalties should be proportionate.  To be fair, there is a big difference in somebody who adheres to the law, has a few pints one night, takes a taxi home and gets up the next morning with a residual amount of alcohol in his or her system.  Someone like this should be dealt with differently from a person who leaves a public house having drunk a serious amount of alcohol before getting behind the wheel of a car.</p> <p>  I am conscious that we are focusing much of our effort on one particular issue when speed is still the largest contributing factor to deaths on our road.  We brought forward legislation in this committee that was supported across all the political parties relating to introduction of random drug testing on roads.  I would be interested to know when that will commence.  With regard to the use of mobile phones, I had to pull in the car on a small regional road as a driver of an articulated lorry was coming along with one hand on the wheel of the vehicle and the other with his phone to his ear.  I could not believe it.  There are laws in place to prevent that happening and people speeding but they continue to do both.</p> <p>  My colleague, Deputy Fitzmaurice, was right in saying it is about ensuring we have the greatest amount of enforcement on our roads.  For me it is about ensuring we do not clog our court system by giving people the opportunity to come in and fight legislation.  The witness correctly pointed out some of this exists since 1960 and perhaps there is a job of work to be done in consolidating the law, leaving it fit for purpose so lawyers cannot have a field day in trying to defend the indefensible.  People caught breaking the law severely should not be left on the road for six or nine months.  Perhaps the penalty for somebody disqualified from driving but who is caught driving a car is not sufficient.  A number of issues must addressed and fleshed out further.</p></speech>

Research indicates that people at 40 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood are twice as likely to be involved in a collision.  The legal limit for the majority of drivers is 50 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood.  At the 80 mg level, people are six times as likely to be involved in a collision.  In research from 2008 to 2012, based on culpable drivers and alcohol factors, between the zero level and 80 mg level, we estimate seven to eight people were being killed every year with those sorts of levels.

It is surprising that 4% of fatalities are on motorways.  One might think because a car is travelling at 120 km/h, there would be many more accidents.  Although 4% still equates to a large number of deaths, why are there comparatively few incidents on a motorway?  Is it because people feel there is a far better Garda presence on motorways to stop speeding?  Do people who consume alcohol know there is a far better chance of being caught on a motorway rather than in a rural village?  The people in rural villages have one or two extra glasses or wine or bottles of beer and may think there is a greater chance of them not being caught.</p> <p>  I keep going back to this and the Chairman knows it; if people drink, they should not drive.  The bottom line is we should go for zero tolerance.  There is the idea of going for a 20 mg level but people who drink can be stubborn.  I have done a bit of bar work in my time and trying to get keys from someone who has consumed alcohol can be very hard.  Not too many people would take on a person trying to get into a car with a set of keys.  I know Mr. Wilson stated it is not really a criminal offence but the punishment must suit the crime.  There are three people here who have lost loved ones and no matter what happens, nobody is going to replace them.  I remember years ago my daughter had meningitis and, touch wood, she survived.  As a parent, I am always in fear of the knock on the door.  I would not wish it on anyone.  The advertisement years ago had a garda coming to a house.</p> <p>  We talk about speeding and everything else but with alcohol, a person has the choice of drinking or not.  I am involved with sport and many people go out.  For example, there might be a designated driver in a group of four or five.  We should encourage that more.  The punishment must suit the crime.  Until we go with zero tolerance, we will have a serious problem on the roads.  There could be many knocks on doors.</p></speech>

I witnessed my son lying on a trolley dead and then to learn he was dead because of a drink-driver was completely unacceptable.  His death was not natural and it was not right.  It is simply not acceptable.  Deputy Troy's opinion of somebody getting a taxi home and being a good person but still getting caught the next morning is not acceptable either.  If that person hit a car and killed the person driving it, that death would not be any less than if that person was hit after hours.  There is no excuse, be it morning time or night-time.  My crash happened at 8.30 in the evening.  I did not in my wildest dreams expect to meet somebody who was out of their mind from drink and for that person to be injure me very badly and kill my son.  That mindset has to change.  It is completely unacceptable.</p></speech>

I want to reply to Deputy Troy's concern for those caught the next morning with residual alcohol in their system, and I want to allay his fears.  The proposal is not to change the blood alcohol level at which it is an offence to drive, which is 50 mg.  For any reading below 50 mg, it is not a crime or an offence to drive and people with a reading below that level will not be prosecuted.  The Deputy should also bear in mind that before a prosecution takes place and the level of alcohol present in one's system is decided, the reading on the machine is reduced by 17.5% in order to be sure to be sure that a person is over the limit before he or she is prosecuted.  Anybody driving with alcohol in their system up to or around 50 mg gets off with it.  We have cases where families have lost a loved one, where their only child has been killed by a person who was driving at the limit of 50 mg after that allowance of 17.5% was taken into account, and that is completely unacceptable.  Even if we are leaving the legislation as it stands,  families are losing their loved ones because somebody has chosen to drive and may still be on that limit.  We have to send out the right message from here.  I believe zero tolerance is right.  I agree with Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick.  We will get there eventually because this has to be the case, but all we are seeking to do now is to send out the right message - and to have in place a stronger deterrent - to people that if they do take a chance and drink drive, they will lose their licence.  That has to be the case because given that the level of enforcement is much lower there is little chance of being caught and people are taking chances.</p> <p>  I do not agree regarding the speed issue.  The assistant commissioner said earlier that the compliance level is better now.  I drove here today with my speedometer at 80 km/h and the other cars on the road were flying past me.  I was the only motorist driving at the speed limit in Lucan coming into town this morning, and that is not acceptable.</p></speech>

I want to ask a few questions and there will be time later for further questions.  All the members of this committee agreed that we would have sessions on road safety because, as was pointed out by Deputy Troy, we are extremely concerned about the increase in the number of road fatalities last year.  This relates to a cultural mindset.  In the 1970s, more than 600 people were dying on our roads each year and that was kind of accepted.  Even though we know the figure now is far too high, it is accepted that there will be some road fatalities.  A cultural change is needed to shift that mindset because every road death is one too many.  There are just over 20 people in the room and that is the number of people since 1 January alone who have lost their lives on our roads, not to mention the number of people who have been seriously injured.  This is a very worthwhile exercise but the outcome of it is what is  important.  It is probably very dangerous to focus on one particular area over another.  As a committee, we are trying to get an all-encompassing approach and to explore everything that can be done.  My view is that not enough is being done across the board on this matter.</p> <p>  I have a few questions for the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I note the number of members in the Garda traffic corps in the south region.  The figure represents just under 20% of the current total membership of the corps.  As I recall from a meeting at which representatives of the Road Safety Authority in attendance three or four weeks ago, the number of road fatalities in the Munster area is much higher than elsewhere.  I asked if there is a correlation between the number of road fatalities that occur and the number of Garda traffic corps members deployed in an area.  Does the southern region comprise the six counties of Munster or is any particular county excluded?</p></speech>

There are five Garda divisions in it.  Cork has three divisions and Kerry and Limerick make up the other two divisions.  The  number in the traffic corps would have been proportionately down to 10% or we started off with around a figure of 10%  in each region.  For example, when I was in Cork we had 60 people in the traffic corps and the total number of garda&iacute; was 600 or more.  That was our yardstick when we were increasing the number of staff in the traffic corps, namely, that it would be approximately 10% of the total number.</p></speech>

That is part of our 10% figure and when we deploy people during the year, that will be guided by the statistics in terms of accidents and where the loss of members from the traffic corps have been greatest.  That will influence where the numbers will go.</p></speech>

I have raised with the Department, the Minister and the RSA the use of technology to prevent the crime form happening in the first instance.  If we have an agreed blood alcohol limit in legislation, the use of an alcolock device will ensure that a vehicle cannot be activated by a person who is over that limit.  That would perform a service for the general public and for person who is not sure if he or she is over the limit or it would remove the possibility of he or she losing his or her licence if he or she cannot activate his or her vehicle.  An argument could be made that because speed contributes as much to road fatalities, if not more, than people who drive over the blood alcohol limit, that a person who drives at speed should also lose his or her licence.  Where do we draw the line in terms of what is and is not an appropriate response?</p> <p>  There is technology that can limit the speed at which a car can be driven.  Limiting the speed at which a vehicle can be driven to 120 km/h, which is the motorway speed limit, will not prevent a person from driving at an inappropriate speed in a 80 km/h zone or on a country road incorporating a 50 km/h zone or in a built up area, given that 25 out of 40 road deaths last year involved non-motorists in 50 km/h zones.  Global positioning system, GPS, technology could also be used to enforce the law in that if one drove over the speed limit in a 50 km/h zone, one could be caught by virtue of one's GPS information.  That would represent a massive leap forward.  It would change the game completely in terms of the figures we are dealing with, but I do not see any urgency about this in the Department.  Would the witnesses view the use of such technology in this respect as representing major progress and would they be in agreement with its use?  Ms Price spoke about adhering to the speed limit in a 80 km/h zone.  We have all had that experience.  When one sticks to the speed limit, one can be guaranteed that one will be overtaken and some people even have the audacity to toot their horns as they pass because they one are in a hurry and one is in their way.  It will lengthen journey times, but are people willing to make that little sacrifice?  I would be in interested to hearing the witnesses' views on that.</p></speech>

There are already limiters in place on buses and trucks and the drivers of those vehicles are prohibited from driving over a set speed limit.  What can we not do this in respect of motorways?  The maximum speed at which anyone should drive on a motorway is 120 km/h.  The technology exists to do as I am outlining.  Likewise, if one is not wearing one's seat belt, one will hear a beep noise in the car and that beep noise will continue until one puts it on.</p><p> We have other technology.  For example, my satnav system will recognise that I am in a 80 km/h zone.  Why can it not make the connection or keep pinging until my speed goes under 80 km/h?  This type of technology exists and we should be looking at it.  These things influence people's behaviour.  Likewise, it is possible to put limiters on the sides of motorcycle engines to limit speed capacity for young people or learners.  We would welcome that.  We have a technology group that includes a representative of the Road Safety Authority.  Superintendent O'Donohue is on the group.  The group is considering these technology developments.  Likewise, alco-meters can go into cars to stop us from making ill-informed decisions.  If people did not have alcohol consumed, they would be more savvy but the alcohol does affect our common sense.</p></speech>

I made a suggestion, as did other members, relating to the filling of positions and vacancies on the board of the Road Safety Authority.  A suggestion was made that a group such as the IRVA would be well equipped and could have a positive impact.  The association could make an input in terms of the workings of the RSA.  The Minister said it was something he was going to consider.  He said he would look at filling board positions within the RSA.  Have any approaches been made to the IRVA in respect of becoming a nominating body for the board of the RSA?</p></speech>

Obviously, we work with all stakeholders.  We have been working for several years with the RSA, the Health and Safety Authority and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We would welcome being involved in anything like that.</p> <p>  We are coming from a different perspective.  We are emotionally involved.  We have experienced the absolute devastation.  Having experienced that and knowing how shattering it is for our families, we are compelled to do something about it.  These are avoidable deaths.  Deputy Fitzpatrick commented on how it was bad enough to lose a child through a serious illness.  Losing a child is the end of the world for families.  To lose a child in a situation like this, where the crashes are avoidable, is senseless.  We are compelled into action and into doing something about it.  That is why we do what we do.</p> <p>  Our families ask us why we do this.  They say it will never bring our loved ones back.  That is precisely the answer.  The members of the committee and the Members of the Oireachtas have it in their power to do something to change that situation and to help to save lives.  That is a great gift.  They have been given this trust by the electorate.  They are here to represent the needs of the electorate.</p> <p>  I understand what Deputy Troy said about not being emotionally involved.  We would never wish Members to be emotionally involved.  They do not want that knock on the door and we would not wish it on our worst enemies.  However, we want the committee to examine the scientific evidence and the facts.  The Road Safety Authority and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will provide the facts to the committee.  I appeal to the committee to make its decision based on that evidence.  I appeal to the committee to avoid listening to the vested interests.  I hope we have allayed the fears of the committee about people being caught the next morning.  There is a difference between someone who has ten pints and someone who has two.  The allowance for that is already in the legislation because we do not prosecute with a blood alcohol concentration of under 50 mg per 100 ml, except for novice drivers.  As I said, to determine whether an offence has been committed, an allowance of 17.5% exists.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can make allowance for this on the reading from the intoxilyser machines.</p></speech>

It is my understanding that the fixed charge notice for speeding is still &euro;80 regardless of whether the driver is doing 5 km/h over the 80 km/h speed limit or 160 km/h in a 120 km/h zone.  The fine is still &euro;80.  I believe that must change.  A graded system should be introduced whereby if an individual is doing 150 km/h in a 120 km/h zone, there should be a &euro;300 or &euro;400 fixed charge notice and six penalty points.</p></speech>

If a driver is doing 30 km/h over a 50 km/h limit, it is the same as doing 30 km/h over a 120 km/h limit.  The fine is &euro;80 and the driver is issued three penalty points.  If the driver goes to court and is convicted, the driver is issued five penalty points.  If a garda stops a driver for excessive speeding, he may also prosecute or pursue the driver for dangerous driving.  That can be added on.</p> <p>  Safety camera vans can detect people driving at a higher speed and provide the information.  For example, GoSafe, the private operator, provides that information and we can see whether we can pursue a prosecution for the additional offence.  For speeding by itself, the fine is &euro;80.</p></speech>

Believe it or not, it is not easy to prove dangerous driving against someone who is caught speeding.  There should be a specific speeding charge.</p> <p>  In the case of a graded system, consideration should be given to increasing the fines dramatically and the imposition of penalty points for speeding instead of the flat fee or penalty that exists at the moment.  If someone was facing a &euro;500 fine plus the imposition of ten penalty points on the licence for a single offence, it would concentrate the mind.</p> <p>  There is an epidemic of mobile telephone use at the moment, as committee members will appreciate.  Deputy Troy referred to the driver of the lorry on the mobile telephone.  I believe we are going to have to give An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na power to seize mobile telephones at the side of the road and have them examined to prove that an individual was using the telephone.  Moreover, there should be a major increase in the financial penalties for mobile telephone use as well as the imposition of penalty points.  I am also in favour of bringing in an automatic disqualification for mobile telephone use.  I regard it as being that serious.</p></speech>

I wish to congratulate Michael Finn who serves in Cork on his elevation to assistant commissioner and wish him all the best.  Rural Ireland is not bandit country.  In the past few days, an old age pensioner had the misfortune to be murdered in Ballysaggart, which is just over the road from me.  As the Garda was able to do its job, that means the force is on the ground and there is a Garda presence in rural Ireland.  I commend the force on what it is able to do even with such limited resources.</p> <p>  Everyone has been touched, directly or indirectly, by drunk drivers who cause fatalities on the roads.  We must acknowledge there has been a phenomenal increase in traffic on the roads in the past number of years, especially in the past two years compared with four or five years ago.  That is borne out by statistics.  It was mentioned that 3% of accidents are due to the condition of the road and the condition of the roads is not keeping pace with the volume of traffic.  Most cars that go for the NCT fail it.  If a car ends up in a crash, the technical people who investigate the crash sites are able to determine whether there were vehicle problems as well.  Do the Garda statistics show up whether faulty vehicles were involved in crashes?  </p> <p>  A campaign by the Road Safety Authority on driver fatigue, where drivers who were feeling tired were told to pull in, was a very good campaign that should be run again.  </p> <p>  I am aware of two fatalities on the motorway I use because people accessed the motorway from the wrong way.  It is back to the RSA and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, in regard to road design.  Deaths occur on the roads for many reasons.  I thank the witnesses for coming before us today.</p></speech>

A motorcyclist does not have the shell of a vehicle to protect him or her.  I am concerned about the central reservation, which are literally steel poles with connecting wires and when a motorcyclist is dismounted in this area, they effectively come in contact with razor blades.  Similarly, signposts and telecommunications poles are involved in many fatalities.  Can we do something better in regard to the engineering on that front?  Is there a way to try to reduce risk to motorcyclists?  The central reservation area is fine for a car, as it stops a car crossing over onto the oncoming vehicles but it has a different impact on motorcyclists.  I do not want to come across the type of stuff members of the Garda come across in the line of their work but is the central reservation area an issue for motorcyclists?</p></speech>

Motorcyclists are a problem for us, especially as there seems to be a culture whereby enthusiasts go out for a spin on a Sunday afternoon.  The attraction of the motorcycle is speed and we are working with the Road Safety Authority to see how we can target and educate that cohort on the dangers and risks.  As the Chairman said, the motorcyclist does not have the shell of the motor car if one has an accident when on a motorbike.  The motorcyclist is very vulnerable.  Last weekend I saw a statistic where we had a fatality and the motorcyclist was not wearing a helmet.  We must educate people.  They are even more vulnerable when on a motorcycle.</p></speech>

We have been approached by a number of approved driving instructors who have raised their concerns with the Road Safety Authority on learner drivers arriving to do their driving test unaccompanied and perhaps failing their test and leaving the centre unaccompanied.  Obviously the Road Safety Authority cannot do anything about it because they are not involved in enforcement, but it is the duty of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Would the assistant commissioner like to address that point, if he is trying to do something about it?</p></speech>

For the past number of years we targeted learner permit operations at centres like that, so we look.

For years the use of a trailer was part of the licence.  People had a licence for years and were well used to twisting and turning their trailers.  New rules were introduced and if one was on one side of a date, the rules of the old licence still applied but otherwise the new rules applied.  We sometimes make laws that push people outside the system.  Some people never had the opportunity of an education and are not able to read or write.  I am very critical of the RSA and the way it conducts its business by touch screen technology.  Would the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na try to come in behind my proposal of a practical system in some place like Mondello Park, where they could do all the practical exercises with the car and trailer?  The people I am talking about are bamboozled by this new system, and although they had a licence in the past it is pushing them outside the law.</p> <p>  This is totally wrong and should not be the spirt of the way things are done.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na need to move with the RSA and try to get something done on that.</p> <p>  I question the way the GoSafe vans are located and parked on the hard shoulder.  Is that safe?  Is it legal?  </p> <p>  In regard to drug testing for drivers, I know the Garda was trying to find a way of conducting such tests, but has a foolproof system been found to conduct such tests?</p> <p>  I note Dublin has been allocated almost as many Garda members as the whole western region.</p></speech>

One cannot go along and park in a driveway without the consent of the owner of the property.  There is a pretty rigorous process in regard to the GoSafe vans.</p> <p>  I understand what Deputy Fitzmaurice is saying about people who had licences for many years and could drive the car and trailer and are intimidated by the whole process he described.

Road safety and driver training should be core subjects on the second level curriculum in our schools.  Every second level student should have an opportunity to leave secondary school having obtained a full driving licence.  That subject should also carry the same points as French, Irish, German and any other subject with a view to going on to third level education.  It will encourage all students to participate and it would cut out an awful lot of the youthful bravado we see with guys trying to impress girls, for example.  If driver training and road safety was a core subject on the second level curriculum it would go a long way to doing that.  It is about time it happened.  Young people should be able to obtain driving licences at the very earliest convenience.  It might cost an awful lot of money to put in place but in the long run society will benefit.</p></speech>

Does the Garda have any say in their locations?  If so, why?  I come from Dundalk and most people in the area know where the vans will be on a particular day.

They are certainly having a massive impact in the zones where they are present.  Fatalities halved in the first 700 zones because people knew they were there.  The Deputy is dead right.  People knew they were there and they complied.  Should we have more?  I would love to see more.  In other countries they have fixed cameras so it is not hit and miss.  The camera is there all the time and that is a massive deterrent to people.  It influences behaviour because if people think they will be caught and get penalty points, they will behave.  My colleague is probably more <i>au fait</i>with its nuances because he was there from the very start of the programme so I will let him in to speak about it.</p></speech>

No other factor is taken into account in deciding where GoSafe vans go other than the collisions.  We identify the cluster of collisions on the road, we identify a stretch of road that is 2 km, 3 km, or 5 km long and then with GoSafe we select a site to carry out the enforcement.  It is the history of fatal and serious injury collisions that determine where they go.  We then deploy the vans there based on the times of the day and the days of the week when the collisions occurred.  We match it up.</p> <p>  GoSafe has key performance indicators it has to achieve and we give them some latitude in terms of time.  It cannot give exactly 15% of its time to a particular location so we will say we want between 12% and 18% of its time.  We give them some latitude either side of 15%.  It stays between the lines all the time in terms of the days of the week and the times of the day.  It is very much strategic in terms of enforcement.  It has reduced the deaths by 50% in the zones.  In some years we are talking about saving 22, 26 or 28 lives a year.  That is the figure we are looking at for recent years based on the halving of deaths, or less than that, in some of the zones.</p></speech>

I am not sure what we really think about them.  They are in areas where fatal collisions have occurred and they have changed driver behaviour in those areas in that when drivers are coming up to the speed van, they slow down, and when they leave the area they speed up again.  In that given spot, the collisions have decreased but outside of that area, on country roads, the collisions have increased.  That is because driver behaviour has not really changed.  A Garda presence on the road is vital.  Garda&iacute; can make this cost-effective if they are out there in numbers.  The number of people speeding is outrageous.  I experienced it this morning.  The number of people on their phones is outrageous.  Every time a person goes to his or her car, he or she is surrounded by people texting and driving, regardless of the speeds.  Some of them do it at 70 mph.  The Garda could be raking in the money.  If they can keep it in the traffic corps, that is well and good.  We need to get garda&iacute; on the road.  People need to see a Garda presence.  It is only then that they will not take chances with their lives and with the lives of our families.  That is very important.  The GoSafe vans are outside contractors.  I think the contract is for 6,000 hours a year.</p></speech>

The likelihood of encountering them is minuscule.  I rarely encounter one on my journey up and back to Dublin.  If they are there, we know where they will be, as the Deputy said.

I could not agree more with what two of the previous speakers said - one being Ms Price who lives in my constituency - about the need for a Garda presence on our roads.  That is critically important.  I am delighted that an assistant commissioner now has responsibility for the traffic corps.  I encourage him at every opportunity to fight to ensure the number of people working in this area is increased.  Education is a key factor.  That point was proven in December 2016 with the very good media campaign highlighting the dangers on our road.  As a consequence of that, coupled with the Garda presence on our roads, there was a very significant reduction in the number of road fatalities.</p> <p>  It has been suggested that an app can be downloaded on one's mobile phone that will monitor one's driving patterns.  That should be examined in greater detail.  It would help influence policy and help correct the driving pattern of motorists.  A person who always adheres to the law in terms of driving within the speed limit, the non-use of a mobile phone, wearing a seat belt, stopping at stop signs and all of that, could be rewarded with a cheaper insurance premium.  That is a measure that the Road Safety Authority might examine and that our committee will examine.  Someone will be appearing before the committee in the next few weeks or months with a proposal.  We will be working with the RSA on that.</p> <p>  We did not have much discussion about vulnerable road users, namely, pedestrians and cyclists.  I nearly knocked down a pedestrian before Christmas because he was walking on a country road, dressed in black from head to toe.  It was the luck of God that I copped him in time and swerved out to avoid him.  I have suggested previously that we should examine introducing a penalty for such behaviour as that person was acting irresponsibly.  Not alone could his life have been lost but I could have pulled out in front of another car and caused a much more serious accident and a number of lives could have been lost.  I would welcome the assistant commissioner's opinion on that.</p> <p>  In terms of proposal regarding a required distance to be observed in overtaking cyclists, I believe it is 1.5 m in rural areas and a reduced distance in urban areas.  What is the assistant commissioner's view on the practicalities of implementing that legislation?  It is unimplementable in some areas because of the width of roads.  There is also the issue of the behaviour of cyclists.  I met a cyclist on a Dublinbike cycling up the wrong way on Kildare Street on my way to Leinster House today.  What measures are in place to police that behaviour?</p> <p>  We have had a very good interaction with the witnesses, albeit there was a difference of opinion in one area.  Mr. Wilson spoke of the introduction of a gradient system of penalty points being a good system and a good suggestion for addressing the speed issue.  The only gradient system we are currently discussing is in regard to the blood alcohol level, which we have been debating for two and a half hours.  That is the only area where there has been an element of disagreement.  I thank the witnesses for giving of their time.  As one of them said, they are acting in a voluntary capacity.  They have engaged very honestly and truthfully and I hope we on this side have done likewise.  I look forward to engaging with the representatives of the association and with the Garda in working towards reducing the number of road fatalities because we want to halt and reverse the shocking upward trajectory of 2016 and to make sure that our roads are a much safer place in 2017.</p></speech>

That is an area we should explore.  Such technology exists and we should use it to help save lives on our roads.  I would support and encourage any proposal in that regard.</p> <p>  Regarding vulnerable road users, I know exactly what the Deputy spoke about in terms of pedestrians walking on the roads at night time.  I would have to argue that there is an element of irresponsibility if one is dressed totally in black.  Collisions and near misses occur, just like the one the Deputy described, because people do not take simple precautions.  The RSA has done a great deal of work on educating the public about road safety.  It even gives us yellow visibility vests to give it to people we come across who not wearing high visibility clothing and our members have done a good deal of that.  I can see the logic and merit in what the Deputy has said.  He asked whether we should consider introducing an offence where a person behaves recklessly in contributing to being a danger on the road by being out in the dark dressed in black where they cannot be seen by motorists on the road.  Such people put themselves, and other road users, at risk because a motorist may have to swerve to avoid them.  I can see the logic in the Deputy's proposal in that respect.</p></speech>

We have brought in a fixed charge notice that can apply to cyclists, of which my colleague, Chief Superintendent Aidan Reid has reminded me.  He is very disappointed to hear that a person was cycling up Kildare Street the wrong way.  We will pursue such offenders as we now have fixed charge notice for that.</p> <p>  The legislation being considered on motorists observing a minimum distance when passing cyclists will be problematic in terms of its enforcement in some areas.  It will be hard to adhere to the 1.5 m distance.  Not everyone will understand how to measure that.  Motorists would nearly need a tape to measure if they are maintaining a 1.5 distance and if they are stopped in traffic a cyclist can move in beside them.  There must be two-way responsibility.  Cyclists must accept that they cannot move out in the path of motorists.  A motorist may be complying with the law but the cyclist may not be playing his or her part in terms of compliance.  Enforcing the measure will be challenging in some ways.  As a yardstick, yes it is a good measure.  If the message we deliver from this debate is to tell motorists to stay out on the road, away from cyclists, that is a good thing.  Cyclists, because of potholes and other works on roads, can deviate and motorists need to be mindful of that. </p> <p>  I concur with the Deputy regarding having a variation in the awarding of penalty points.  It does not seem logical that the same penalty points would be awarded regardless of whether one is 2 km/h or 22 km/h over the speed limit.  Maybe that is an area we should examine. </p></speech>

Perhaps it is time to consider introducing a registration plate for bicycles.  Cyclists are not easily tracked down.  They break red lights, almost run over people and head off on their merry way and there is no way of tracking them down.  There is an argument for putting registration plates on pedal cycles.  I am just throwing out that proposal for discussion.</p></speech>

We are not talking about isolated cases but about cyclists who break the law on a fairly regular basis.  They treat red lights as being there just to add colour and they totally disregard them.  If there was some form of identification on bicycles, the offenders could be tracked down and punished.  It is currently very difficult to track them.  Garda&iacute; have an impossible job in tracking down cyclists.</p></speech>

The problem with that case was that it did not even get to a judge and jury.  Initially, the Garda and the Director of Public Prosecutions accepted a guilty plea on careless driving.  Clearly, that is not satisfactory where a life has been taken by someone with that driving history.  That is why we want these crimes treated differently.  They should be treated as vehicular manslaughter &ndash; let us call it what it is.</p></speech>

People have gone to jail for driving while disqualified.  A certain cohort will probably ignore the law regardless - they are totally reckless.  Imprisonment is probably the only solution for these people.  There has been considerable debate about publishing the list of disqualified drivers.  There is certainly merit in that.  The committee could talk to our colleagues in the Revenue Commissioners about this approach.  The chairperson of the Policing Authority worked there previously.  She has commented on those who have been named and shamed in that context and how there has been a certain level of compliance as a result.  It certainly assisted in that regard.</p></speech>

Repeat offenders should be punished.  It is important for us as legislators and for the Garda assistant commissioners to address this.  I imagine they have been in constant contact with the Minister.  We need to push from both ends.  I am a firm believer that everyone deserves one chance in life.  However, when a person makes one mistake, he should not be able to make two mistakes.  On leaving the committee today, we need to do something like that.  Repeat offenders should be prosecuted.</p></speech>

We have to look at cases where a defendant accepts a guilty plea on a lesser charge, thereby tying the hands of the judge.  Our families would prefer that the case goes to a judge and jury.  The hearing should take place and the jury should decide on guilt or innocence.  In the particular case in question, the driver fled the scene and had to be extradited.  Yet, the judge had to allow a reduction for the guilty plea and for remorse.<br/><br/>An apology means so much to our families.  As we have said, we are not looking for vengeance.  However, we want a strong message to go out that we are not going to accept impaired driving on our roads.  It is horrifying.  I have before me the figures from the Road Safety Authority for the five years in question.  Over 150 people per week were arrested for drink-driving.  These are only the people who are caught.  I have never been breathalysed and I am in my 50s.  There is such a small likelihood of being caught.  Over the five years, in excess of 40,000 people have been caught drink-driving and endangering others.  That is an appalling vista.  It is something we must tackle.<br/><br/>Deputy Troy referred to tiered penalties.  Can he indicate what we can do to reduce the level of carnage on the roads?  Does the Deputy condone this level of law-breaking?  How does he believe we can put a stop to it?  Does he believe the <i>status quo</i>is okay and that we can continue to live with 40,000 people breaking the law in every five-year period?  I reckon the figure is ten times greater if we include those who have taken chances and not been caught.  What do we do in that situation?<br/><br/>Reference was made to vulnerable road users.  People come to us after a serious crash has taken place.  A loved one has been killed.  Our experience in many cases is that vulnerable road users are dead and gone and so there is no prosecution.  In too many cases, the vulnerable road user is blamed for his or her own death.  This is why I believe it is too easy for the other party, the surviving driver, to say she did not see the deceased driver, the deceased pedestrian stepped out in front of the car or she did not see the deceased in the car mirrors.<br/><br/>This is why we call for mandatory checking when the investigation is taking place.  If all of the known contributory causes of crashes are investigated and if the other driver is then seen to be a careful driver, then we can blame the pedestrian.  Otherwise, we have to be extremely cautious.  It is simply unfair.  The families concerned have to live with the consequences of a loved one being blamed for his or her own death.  The families have no justice as a result.  Also, it is sending out the wrong message to the effect that the driver need not be careful or look out for vulnerable road users.  After all, it is in the law.  Everyone knows they must drive and keep a safe distance such that they can see clearly.  We have a duty to look out for vulnerable road users.  It is right to have a distance for overtaking cyclists.  All of us have seen the horrific clips on the cyclist Twitter accounts of lorries overtaking cyclists and whizzing past them as though they are ants on the road.  They are people and have the same right to be on the road as the lorry driver.  If it is not safe to overtake, then the driver simply has to bide time, wait until it is safe and give the cyclist the necessary distance.</p></speech>

Let us suppose a driver comes around the bend in a car at night and it is foggy and a pedestrian is wearing black clothes.  It is reckless on the part of the person wearing the black clothes.  Let us be clear about that.  If it goes to court, the driver of the car always goes down and there is a big insurance pay-out.  However, let us be clear on this point: there should be some responsibility on the person walking the road and that person should not be in black clothes.</p></speech>

Obviously, we all have a responsibility to keep ourselves safe on the roads.  I am suggesting that where the cyclist, pedestrian or vulnerable road users is killed, we should not automatically blame that person for his or her death unless or until we have established all the factors involved.  Therefore, if the driver was texting and did not see the vulnerable road user and then killed him or her, at least we have the evidence.</p> <p>  I have an issue with the question of drunk pedestrians.  The Road Safety Authority broadcasted an advertisement that we have all seen.  I have raised this with the Road Safety Authority.  The claim was that 66%, two thirds, of pedestrians killed had alcohol in their systems.  That is victim-blaming.  Let us consider the figures.  Over 200 were killed during the period in question, but there was only blood alcohol levels data for 40 of those.  Of those 40 odd, two thirds had alcohol in their systems.  We cannot continue to perpetuate that notion.  It is so hurtful to our families, who have suffered an injustice.</p></speech>

At the moment, if an individual is banned from driving for 20 years in County Monaghan, he can drive legally several yards up the road in Northern Ireland.  There needs to be a Europe-wide ban.  If an individual is disqualified in France or Germany, he should be automatically disqualified in Ireland.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the presence throughout the meeting of Ms Karen Newman, Mr. Ronan Treacy, Ms Julie Patton and Mr. Justin Temple.  They are welcome to the meeting.  I thank them for their attendance.  In fact, I thank all those present for attending.  I know the meeting was heavily dominated by the alcohol issue.  It may assist the committee if you have further information, especially on the discussion on the cohort with a blood alcohol concentration of between 50mg and 80mg.  Much of the attention centred on that.</p><p>If there are any statistics or anything else the witnesses feel is pertinent to this argument could they please furnish them in writing to the committee?  That would be helpful in our work.</p><p> The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and IRVA will never know the lives they have saved.  Unfortunately, we hear about the accidents that occur but not about those that are averted as a result of their work.  I said the same to the RSA and to officials from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The overall statistics show that.  We will never know the identities of the people who are walking around today because of their work.</p><p> We will be compiling a report and making recommendations.  This has been a very good meeting - we have been here for over two and a half hours - and a worthwhile exercise.</p></speech>
