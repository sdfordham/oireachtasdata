The usual mobile phone notice is given.  Please ensure to have them turned off if at all possible.  Today we have engagement with Mr. James Temple-Smithson, who is the head of the European Parliament Information Office in Ireland.  We have met him previously and, on behalf of the committee, I welcome him here today.  I understand he has been in his new role for a couple of months, so I welcome him to both the committee and Dublin.</p><p>Strong engagement with the European Parliament is very important to this committee and Members of European Parliament elected from constituencies in Ireland are welcome to join our meetings.  Members from this committee and others have taken part in interparliamentary meetings, we engage through the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs, COSAC, and a delegation from this committee recently travelled to Brussels and met a number of MEPs.  I am, therefore, sure that the members will be interested in engaging with Mr. Temple-Smithson today on the work of his office and how we could be improving our engagement.  I always say in situations like this that the more engagement we can have and the more that we as Members of the D&aacute;il and the Seanad can help his office, the more we would like that.  We want to be helpful and supportive in every way that we can.  </p><p>Members are reminded of the longstanding parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter but continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity by name or in such way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>I invite Mr. Temple-Smithson to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-01a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Temple-Smithson" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017030100002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for inviting me to address the committee.  It is a great honour to appear before the committee today.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak a little about the work and role of the European Parliament Information Office in Ireland.  As the committee heard, I became head of the office recently.  If I may, I will divide what I will say into three sections.  I will speak a little about our day-to-day work.  Then I will speak about the relations between the European Parliament and national parliaments, in particular the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Then I will say a few words on the big communications challenges I see over the next couple of years, which include those relating to Brexit and the European elections that are looming in 2019.</p> <p>  It is important to underline that the parameters for everything we do are set out for us by the governing body of the European Parliament - the bureau - which is made up of the President and the Vice-Presidents.  They set our terms of reference and approve our major projects.  I think our annual report has been circulated to the committee.  As it will see from the report, in a nutshell our job is to communicate about the work and role of the European Parliament and its members to Irish audiences.  There are four strands that we pursue, although I will not speak about them in detail, except to give some examples.</p> <p>  The core of our work relates to parliamentary activity and communication activities we undertake with regard to the agenda of the European Parliament.  For example, early last month we held what we called a stakeholder consultation on the posted workers directive, to which we were delighted to welcome Senator Craughwell, one of the committee's colleagues.  We gathered 20 or so of the organisations that are most impacted by and that would have the most impact on this controversial proposed legislation and gave them an opportunity to discuss with the rapporteur and draughtsman of the legislation, who came over from Brussels.  They had the opportunity to hear from her and to give their thoughts on the legislation at an early stage.  The legislation was due for its first committee discussion immediately after our event, which was chaired by Ms Deirdre Clune, MEP.</p> <p>  We have a series of programmes related to youth, mainly through the education system, where we provide information to teachers and students in primary and secondary schools, particularly transition year students, as well as in further education institutions.</p> <p>  There is an important media strand to our work.  We work with Irish journalists to provide information about the European Parliament.  Our press officer is extremely busy at the moment because the Taoiseach will be in Brussels meeting the President of the European Parliament tomorrow, as I am sure the committee know.  We also have a large number of Irish journalists attending the plenary session in March because it is widely anticipated that there will be some Brexit developments.  They might not take place in the Parliament but they may take place about that time and the Parliament will be an important actor.</p> <p>  The final aspect to our communications activities is that we no longer just do things and hope for the best.  We really try to measure the impact of our work.  In common with all parts of the European Parliament, we have key performance indicators.  We are still working through the methodology for the indicator for communications.  It is not a precise science and it is not finalised.  We have not got the magic formula yet, but our key metric is the hours of attention that we are able to generate for our work.</p> <p>  I will now turn to Parliament relations.  I have to mention an important caveat, which is that the first Vice-President of the European Parliament is one of the Irish MEPs responsible for relations with national parliaments.  I wish to make clear that I am not speaking on her behalf here.  She is new to the role, being just a few weeks into it.  What I am speaking about, therefore, is everything that went before she took over.  I have not had the opportunity to discuss with her directly.  I would like to make that clear.  I am sure she will have ideas of her own that she will develop over the coming months and we look forward to following up on them.</p> <p>  There is one other important preliminary remark to be made.  The Chairman referred to this in his opening remarks and in a sense I know that I am preaching to the converted because the Oireachtas is widely recognised as one of the most progressive and proactive national parliaments in terms of engaging with the European processes and the European Parliament.  The Chairman referred to MEPs attending the committee's hearings and the committee heard how much that was valued from the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr. Timmermans, when he was here last week, when Brian Hayes was here to put questions to him.  I know the committee makes use of video-conferencing.  This is a technology that the European Parliament has invested in.  We think it offers a great deal of potential to help join up the levels, particularly between ourselves and European Parliaments.  I would like to underline that we in our office enjoy extremely good contact at official level with the committee's clerk, Ms Lougheed, and with its representative in Brussels, Ms Hayes.  We very much value those relationships and are keen to develop them.</p> <p>  The committee does not need me to go over the established mechanisms that the Chairman referred to such as COSAC and the yellow card.  However, it is fair to say that the European Parliament in recent years has been keen to develop relations with national parliaments, both formally and informally, through the interparliamentary meetings that the Chairman mentioned.  This week there is one on asylum and next week there will be one related to International Women's Day and women in the labour market.  Although I know that there are some reservations about it, I think the European Parliament has been keen to develop the notion of a green card concept as a sort of counterpoint to the yellow card.</p> <p>  On the less formal side, there is now a process where the European Parliament writes, on the back of the Commission work programme each year, to national parliaments.  Under the current Commission we have identified in each work programme that there are perhaps 20 to 25 important pieces of new legislation that are, in fact, reviews of existing legislation.</p><p>That implies a slight change in the business model of the European Parliament, which has traditionally been focused on passing new legislation.  When that new legislation is reviewing legislation that already exists, we are shifting a bit.  The European Parliament wants to take a more holistic approach.  It is recognised that close partnership with national parliaments is very important in that respect.  Where there is existing legislation, national parliaments are perhaps best placed to inform whether that legislation has worked, has been implemented, has achieved what it is supposed to achieve, has been defective or is in fact totally fine and does not need reviewing.  There are the established processes of White Papers and Green Papers tabled by the commission.  It is important for a parallel process to take place at parliamentary level.  That is something the European Parliament has been pushing with this initiative.  In this context, we were very pleased to receive substantial and interesting input from the agriculture committee on some of the proposals in the work programme last year.</p><p> In a slight side note to that, we have established on the parliament's website relatively recently a repository for information and studies about the implementation of European legislation, which is open to anyone, national parliaments, local councils and local authorities, to upload work that they have undertaken that is then available to other jurisdictions and to MEPs.  It free for anyone to upload or download.  We hope that will help to join some of the dots that are perhaps not joined at the moment in the EU system.</p><p> The final point I want to mention about the connection between the parliaments is the European Parliamentary Research Service, EPRS, established in 2013.  It has a clear remit to co-operate with the research and library services of national parliaments.  I know that it has good contacts with Ireland's own Library and Research Service.  We believe that the research that our EPRS does can compliment the work of the research services of national parliaments, which inevitably have to focus their limited resources on the domestic agenda.  With the scale and expertise we can offer, we believe it can help with the understanding of European developments.  Last year, the EPRS produced over 1,000 products that ranged from two-page at-a-glance summaries of items on the parliamentary agenda up to detailed and in-depth analyses and studies that really got to grips with policy challenges and proposals.</p><p> Before I conclude, I will say a quick word on where these two worlds of communicating about the European Parliament and relations between parliaments collide.  That is at the members' initiative.  We are now looking at ways in which we can work with Deputies and Senators to provide to them information about the products and services we can offer that can help them in their work in the European dimension and help with communication on European matters where it is of assistance to them.  One thing we would like to do in that respect is invite Members or their staff to a training day in Europe House where we can set out some of these databases and European information sources that we hope will be helpful.  We hope to be in contact with Deputies and Senators shortly about that.</p><p> I said that I would say a couple of words on the challenges ahead.  Brexit is obviously a challenge in all walks of life and no less in communications.  It is funny that it is the reverse of a problem we often have when we are communicating about the European Parliament, which is that we often have a lot of information that we are desperately trying to interest people in.  Whereas with regard to Brexit, a lot of people are desperately interested in it, but so far we have not had that much information to communicate.  I guess that after Article 50 is triggered, that will change.  Once the European Parliament passes its resolution, which we anticipate will happen before Easter, we will have a basis for ourselves to communicate about the position of the parliament.</p><p> The Chairman referred to the committee's visit to Brussels recently.  Members met the key players, Mr. Verhofstadt, Mr. Barnier and other MEPs.  The committee is well-informed about this issue.  Once we move into the spring, I anticipate that we will step up our efforts in this area when the parliament has set out a position.  For example, we are planning an event in Dundalk in May to look at the impact on environmental policy in the cross-Border context of Brexit.  Once the debate gets into the nitty-gritty a bit more, I anticipate that we will identify more areas in which we can usefully add value by arranging that sort of discussion and event.</p><p> We are just starting to think seriously now about our institutional information campaign that we will conduct with regard to the European elections.  To be very clear, that is not at all the political campaign that will go on separately.  We conduct an institutional information campaign that is, of course, politically neutral by which our aim is to inform people of the fact of the European elections, that they are taking place and a little bit about what is at stake.  In particular, as we have done in the past, I imagine this time we will put a focus on young people and first-time voters who are traditionally less likely to turn out and try to encourage them to register and vote in these elections.</p><p> We are just starting to think about these challenges.  Much has changed in political communications over the last year.  There are more elections this year in which more will change.  It is already clear that some of the challenges we will face include tackling fake news by providing fast and accurate information to members.  How we will work with our partners in Ireland on this project is something else that we are looking at.  In this area in particular, I would very much welcome any input and thoughts from members.  That would be extremely instructive for me.  I thank the committee for its attention.  I would be delighted to respond to any remarks or questions.</p></speech>

I will now invite our members to contribute.  I call Deputy Bernard Durkan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-01a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017030100002#B00300"><p>I welcome Mr. Temple-Smithson.  I congratulate him.  He comes at a very important time and juncture in terms of the relationship between the individual member states and the European institutions of the parliament and the Commission.  He also comes at a very important time from the point of view of the international image of the EU, where it is going and where it is likely to end up.  Unfortunately, it would appear to some of us at least that the EU has begun to drift.  The philosophy of the EU has become indistinct.  The vision of the EU is not as pronounced as it used to be.  There are various groups throughout the EU - albeit not the most powerful or pivotal groups at this stage but nonetheless influential - that have another vision for the Continent and the EU.  We also have Brexit.  All of this presents a huge challenge to us.</p> <p>  I would be a strong supporter of the European concept.  Without that unity, cohesion and travelling in the same direction at the same time, I believe that Europe would be much the poorer.  It is impossible for Europe to survive without there being a recognition of the general broad thrust of where European policy was supposed to go and where the founding fathers of modern Europe had expected it to go.  We know that it had an inspiration at the time.  It was born out of despair.  When formed, the European Coal and Steel Community was there for a purpose.  We know what the purpose was.  All of that has become a bit nebulous in recent times.  There is an urgent necessity for the EU to reassess itself.  I am not going to mention any individual countries, but there are member states that seem to have moved away from the vision of Europe.  I am of the view that Europe cannot survive that way.  It has never survived in the past for very long when going in that direction.  I do not believe it can do so now.  There are those who suggest that we are in modern times, that we are in a different time and a different era and that we are not going to make the mistakes we made before.  I am sorry but that is not a fact and that is not true.  The mistakes have been repeated hundreds of times all down through the millennia.  There is no reason why that will not happen again.</p> <p>  I compliment the witness with regard to the focus on youth.  We need to depend on the young generation to identify with that modern vision of Europe.  We need them to express to us what their vision for Europe in the future is and will remain.  We need them to recognise the strength in unity throughout Europe and where that can go.  I have mentioned it before, but I thought it was a really sad sight when refugees were coming across the borders into Europe in recent years and one of the images promoted was that of razor wire.</p><p>Razor wire is something of which Europeans should be wary.  Its production to greet children and adults running away from war and famine and in fear of what would follow is a very sad reflection on sophisticated people and cohesive groups.  It is sad that the best that could be offered to the people in question was a hands-off approach which did irreparable damage to the image of Europe at the time.  I am the first to admit that it was not the European Union's policy but that of individual member states.  There is a need for individual member states to take ownership of the European project, a topic we have talked about here before.  If we do not take ownership of it, it will drift and create serious problems for each member state and even countries that are not member states.  Unless there is a clear recognition that we have a destiny that binds us together, we will return to the position we were in before joining.  Some of us were lucky enough to see the European Union emerging virtually from the beginning and would not like to see it disintegrate.  I have begun to notice, as I am sure everybody else has, various spokespersons, committees of the European Parliament and even individual Commissioners from time to time comment on and correct individual member states.  That is not their function as they are not our political masters.  Their job is to recognise what we have to say, as individual member states, and adopt it in a global European policy.  They must respect member states and their unfortunate public representatives and regimes. </p><p> I apologise to the Chairman for talking so long.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-01a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1360" speakername="Se&aacute;n Haughey" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017030100002#C00200"><p>I thank Mr. Temple-Smithson from the European Parliament Information Office for his presentation.  One thing of which parliamentarians are not short is information.  We experience information overload on a daily basis.  Having said that, from time to time we need specific information, particularly on what is happening in the European Parliament.  We need concise information because very often we receive queries from constituents about particular problems or proposed legislation.  It is welcome that Mr. Temple-Smithson has made his office available to us to that end.</p> <p>  I have a few specific questions.  My first question relates to a point made by Mr. Temple-Smithson about the European Parliament elections to be held in 2019.  He has a serious job of work to do to ensure citizens will engage in those elections.  Irish people, by and large, do not take elections to the European Parliament seriously.  Some do but many do not.  Very often elections to the European Parliament are used to have a protest vote or to campaign on a particular local issue.  Many candidates are hostile to the notion of the European Union in the first place, which is a shame.  We, therefore, need to engage citizens in the work of the European Parliament and the European institutions as a whole.  Obviously, that is not only a job for Mr. Temple-Smithson's office but for all of us.  Citizens or voters do not really engage in elections to the European Parliament until two and half weeks before polling day.  We all have a job of work to do to change that.  I wish Mr. Temple-Smithson well in his endeavours.  As parliamentarians, we must raise the profile of the elections and the issues to be debated once the election campaign starts.</p> <p>  I wish to discuss Brexit.  As the Chairman said and Mr. Temple-Smithson mentioned in his address, members of this committee visited the European institutions recently.  We met some MEPs, including Mr. Guy Verhofstadt.  It was mentioned to us that the committees of the European Parliament were working on sectoral issues related to Brexit.  For example, how can each of the committees scope out the issues to be addressed as the negotiations get under way?  Does Mr. Temple-Smithson have any information to give us on the matter?  I vaguely remember hearing that 20 reports had been commissioned by various committees of the European Parliament.  Has the initiative progressed?  Have the reports been finalised?  If so, can we access copies of them?  From an Irish point of view, it would be useful for parliamentarians and the Government to have the information contained in them to see how the issues have been scoped out and to learn what the concerns are in order to pursue the issues raised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-01a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1309" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017030100002#C00300"><p>I want to follow through on some of the issues raised by my colleagues.  We all accept that there is a democratic deficit in the European Union, but there is also an information deficit.  Providing information is the role of Mr. Temple-Smithson's office.  There is also a credibility issue.  The latest issue about which people are talking is the agreement reached on roaming charges in the use of mobile phones under which the same rates will apply anywhere in the European Union.  The various mobile phone companies have, however, come up with excuses to combat the move.  People can see straightaway that the measure should have a positive impact.  When one travels to the North from County Monaghan, one will receive a welcome to the UK message and details of charges.  There was enough goodwill to tackle the issue of roaming charges, but, in reality, the mobile phone companies can do what they like.  As people want to know what the current position is, I ask Mr. Temple-Smithson to comment on the issue.  I do not know if he has the background information available, but roaming charges in the European Union are one of the issues which cause frustration.</p> <p>  Members of the committee have mentioned the European Parliament elections to be held in 2019.  The number of voters has fallen in consecutive elections since universal suffrage was introduced in 1979.  There has been a turnout of less than 50% in every election.  In the years from 1999 to 2014 the average figure was 42.54%.  People have switched off, not just in Ireland, which is a big worry.  The European Parliament Information Office has a role to play in encouraging people to become involved and learn how the European Parliament works.  The exchange programmes involving young people and different groups are vitally important.  Are they organised by Mr. Temple-Smithson's office or MEPs?  Can Mr. Temple-Smithson's office facilitate exchanges?  There used to be a very busy outreach office on Molesworth Street but it has been relocated to new premises that do not have the same facilities.  It was possible on the old site to hold meetings and debates on the European Union, etc.  Some MEPs have expressed their frustration to me that the option to hold meetings on site is no longer available.</p> <p>  A total of 73 seats in the European Parliament are filled by British Members.  What will happen to these seats following Brexit?  Will they be divided between the other member states?  How will that impact on Ireland?  </p> <p>  As Mr. Temple-Smithson probably knows, people from the North of Ireland have been elected to the European Parliament.  When a debate is held on Ireland, all representatives from the North and the South are invited, which is important.  Does the European Parliament Information Office in Dublin cover the activities of parliamentarians from the North?  Is it allowed to do so?  Does Mr. Temple-Smithson think undertaking such work would be a good idea?  I am conscious that many Members elected to the European Parliament and many voters who participated in the elections in the North of Ireland consider themselves to be Irish.</p><p>It is part of the strategy many members are engaged in at the moment.

It is hell to access grants coming from Europe.  Do people come through the witness's office?  I know the southern regional assembly used to be involved in information for different organisations that were looking for funding from Europe.  It is positive that people see there is funding and linkage money there.  How do we get that across to those organisations?</p> <p>  On what Mr. Temple-Smithson said about the European Parliamentary Research Service, EPRS, and its contacts with the library service and so on, how do parliamentarians access that?</p> <p>  The petition system within the parliament gives Irish citizens another area to raise their own issues, such as taxi deregulation.  One does not hear of many people taking up that petitions role.  Does it still exist?  How do people do it?  We are inundated with different individuals and organisations coming to us with concerns over the failure of the Oireachts and other legislative organisations to deal with their difficulties.  What can we do as Europeans in that regard?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-01a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1393" speakername="Terry Leyden" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017030100002#D00700"><p>I welcome Mr. Temple-Smithson to the committee.</p> <p>  A very important point was raised by Deputy Crowe.  Although it may have a property nearby, I have never attended the European Parliament Information Office since it moved away from the Oireachtas.  I am sure this is true for a lot of people.  I think the witness's colleagues should look at that situation.</p> <p>  I was in London with the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly on Monday and Tuesday with the MPs and Lords in the House of Commons and the House of Lords.  The Brexit debate was taking place in the House of Lords.  It is full steam ahead as far as Britain is concerned.  By 30 March, Article 50 will be invoked.  We have intense negotiations and discussions taking place.  Ireland will play a pivotal role in this regard.  Ireland's interests must be protected in the negotiations.  It is not the witness's responsibility.  It is very important to inform the other member states of the situation we are in due to the decision by the British Government to leave the European Union.  We joined with the United Kingdom in 1973.  We negotiated separately, yet we joined on the same day.  We joined under certain terms at the time and we are not leaving.  We want to ensure an arrangement is put in place to ensure the departure of the United Kingdom will not be detrimental to the Republic of Ireland.  </p> <p>  When we are exporting to mainland Europe, it is vital that we have complete free access through the United Kingdom without any levies or tariffs.  That would be very much part and parcel of the agreement.  It is absolutely based on the fact that there will hopefully no tariffs on exporting to the United Kingdom.  There is deep concern regarding agriculture.  It is of paramount importance that no such levies would apply to exporting to the United Kingdom.  Our negotiators in the 27 countries will be taking a very active role in this regard.  It is a time of great concern here.  It is of great concern to the agricultural community, where prices are seeing an immediate drop, which is a very serious prospect for the future.  </p> <p>  One clear point made in the House of Commons and House of Lords was that the free movement of people in the island of Ireland is of paramount importance and must and will be retained at all costs.  No Irish Government will agree to the erection of barriers or customs posts between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  These issues were discussed in detail.  The MPs and Lords indicated they very much support the free movement of people throughout the length and breadth of Ireland.  They also support the preservation of the common travel area between the United Kingdom and Ireland.  It has been there since 1923, long before the European Union.  Those are the issues which are relevant at the moment.  They are concentrating the minds of all Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad, the House of Lords and the House of Commons and, hopefully, members of parliament in the other 26 member states.</p></speech>

I thought my voice was sufficiently low.  I apologise.</p> <p>  I welcome Mr. Temple-Smithson, and congratulate him on his permanent appointment in January.  As Deputy Crowe said, there is a general information and democratic deficit as regards European affairs.  Apart from this committee, and the good work the Chairman has been doing in meeting many different people and bringing them in to the committee and so on, there is even a problem within parliament, aside from the Brexit issue.  Brexit is something the witness can hang much of his programme on.  Irish people instinctively feel European, as opposed to being British or whatever.  While they are our great friends and all the rest of it, and we have a long association with them, we are going to be on the other side of the table, unfortunately, in these negotiations.  It would be wonderful if we could work out a bilateral arrangement with them and have it accepted by the EU.  I would say that anything that the witness is doing, either with the parliament or with the public, he can build it on Brexit.  It is so concerning to all citizens and to parliamentarians that it is going to be dominant, possibly for the next few years.  There will be no divorce for two years.  Britain are going to remain members of the European Union and presumably or hopefully after that there be a transition arrangement.  I urge the witness to do anything he can do to build better cohesion and provide more information and better involvement in the legislative cycle at European level by involving Brexit in it some way.  The more, the better.</p></speech>

I will try to respond to all points raised.  Please let me know if I do not.</p> <p>  It is well established that the question of the image and direction of the European Union is one that occupies the minds of communicators and politicians.  I agree that young people are a very important target for us to focus on.  There is a lot of survey evidence that shows that people under 30 are the demographic most enthusiastic about the European project.  This has been demonstrated not just in the Brexit vote, but everywhere in Europe.  It is very important for us to foster and encourage that.  The big challenge for us in the European Parliament is that that enthusiasm for Europe does not necessarily manifest itself in people turning out to vote in European elections.  That is a big challenge that we face.</p><p>I will now turn to the issue of the campaign.  I believe it is particularly relevant to young people, but the timing of our campaign for the EU elections, and timing in politics, as in everything, is critical, and in the 2014 EU elections we started trying to communicate in September before the elections the following June.  That was probably too early and we spread ourselves too thinly.  At the same time, it is true that the majority of attention is paid in the last two weeks, but we cannot leave the campaign until the last two weeks.  Getting that balance, and how we build up to a crescendo in the last two weeks, is something we need to look at in our campaign.<br/><br/>On the status of the specialist committee reports, the body in charge of co-ordinating the European Parliament's response on Brexit is the leaders of the political groups, the Conference of Presidents.  The reports were produced and sent to them.  For the time being they have not taken any decision on the status of the reports.  This is a kind of <i>ad hoc</i>process and there is no decision on the status of whether they will be published.  They have been pretty comprehensively leaked.  I have read all about them in the newspapers but not through the official European Parliament channels.  That is understood and perhaps the group will consider releasing these reports as they have been quite widely reported, but I do not know what the position is.  I will find out and write to the committee to let it know the position in this regard.<br/><br/>Reference was made to concrete benefits.  The point made about mobile roaming is very interesting in the context of the Border.  It feeds into my earlier points on the European Parliament needing that information about areas, for example, where the implementation of EU directives is not working properly or is malfunctioning.  That is the sort of information that needs to be fed in through whatever channels to parliamentarians and to the European Commission in order that they know that is the case.  I am not sure if there is official awareness that this is the case.  The status of that legislation in the North after 2019 is an open question.  Whether the situation will improve is also contingent on what happens there.<br/><br/>Deputy Crowe spoke of the turnout in the EU elections.  There are six people in our office so we cannot take full responsibility for the level of turnout, but we need all the help we can get.  This is why I was very grateful for the Chairman's suggestion and initiative to try to involve politicians at all levels in Ireland with that.  We would be very grateful for any assistance and will try to mobiles all the resources we can.<br/><br/>We can certainly assist with visits to the European Parliament.  We help a lot with such programmes when universities are travelling over.  We do not really have any financial resources.  The MEPs have a certain number of groups per year that they can sponsor and they contribute in that way.  We are always happy to help with logistical advice, planning and suggestions.  We can contact MEPs for the groups and help them to put together a good programme in order that they get a really good experience when they are there.  If the Deputy is referring to assistance with travel costs, that is really in the hands of the Members.<br/><br/>There is a long story attached to our premises on Lower Mount Street, which pre-dates me.  It is a great shame that we are where we are.  We do still have facilities and hold events, but we do not have the footfall.  I read recently that in the previous building we had one person employed full-time to deal with walk-in inquiries from members of the public, and that person was busy all the time.  The footfall at our current location creates one or two walk-in inquiries per day.  That is a great shame.  Looking to the future, we rent the building we are now in, we do not own it and the lease is for a certain period of time.  After that, the lease will be up and it may be possible to move again.  The prices in this part of the city are quite prohibitive but the location is important for the sort of facility we want to offer.  We want to be able to improve what we offer to citizens and to people who have inquiries, as well as for meetings.  That is well understood by the political authorities in the European Parliament and Commission, so let us see where that situation gets to.<br/><br/>I am not sure that I understood the point made about parliamentarians visiting.  When parliamentarians from Ireland visit the European Parliament, there is a communication effort for those events, which is handled by our colleagues in the press department in the Parliament in Brussels.  If Members are visiting from here and if they contact us, we can certainly hook them up with the press team in Brussels in order that they can link up and understand what is going on, especially if there are images being put out on Facebook or Twitter that members want to re-tweet, share or otherwise benefit from.<br/><br/>The European Union Parliament issues a limited number of grants in the area of media and communications.  There was a new call for expressions of interest last week on media and events related grants.  These are specific to the communications field and most of the grants are administered by the European Commission.  We hold a number of events in this area but we must be careful how we market them.  Since we are not the body giving the grant, we do not want to disappoint people by telling them to come along to an event about EU funding to find out how to get money.  Our thing is normally a bit more upstream than that, but we hope to hold an event in April about the EU budget for next year and financing the EU in the long term.  It is not, however, about organisations getting grants directly, although that also exists and we can help to point people in the right direction if members have constituents who are interested.<br/><br/>I will now turn to access to the European Parliamentary Research Service.  At the moment it is largely channelled through the Oireachtas Library and Research Service, but there are various mailing lists and alerts for which Members can sign up and we will happily put people directly into contact with them and talk them through it.  If we do hold this information session, which I would very much like to do for Members or their staff, we will explain in detail how they can sign up to get this information.  No one wants to get spammed by thousands of publications per year, but they want to get the interesting, concise information directly relevant to their work.<br/><br/>The petition process still very much exists.  We get inquiries about it and we explain to people how the petitions process works.  There are petitioners from Ireland on a regular basis whose petitions are considered routinely in the committee.  One of the innovations in the legislative cycle project is around the review of existing legislation.  When reviews happen, the European Parliament looks at petitions.  If there are a couple of dozen petitions about particular legislation, then we know this flags up a problem with the legislation and it should be taken into account by MEPs when that legislation is reviewed.  This had not happened in the past but it does now.  If anything, the petitions process has a more robust presence in the system than perhaps it did before.<br/><br/>Senator Leyden asked about the move of our premises.  He is right that the politics of Brexit are not for my level, but I believe it is important for MEPs to understand the dynamics and what is at stake in Ireland.  In our small way, in our reporting back to MEPs and the authorities, we communicate that and we do our best to make sure it is understood.  We invite MEPs from other countries to attend our events.  For example, MEPs from other countries will be invited to the event in Dundalk on the environment.  They will see for themselves and hear at first hand the issues.  We can contribute to the understanding of the issues in a small way.<br/><br/>Brexit will be the top issue and will feature prominently in our activities.  It is an opportunity and people are interested in the subject.  There is a real dearth of information and we can add value through our activities.  I thank the Chairman and the committee.  I am extremely grateful for the opportunity and for the members' encouragement.</p></speech>

We will, I hope, go through the different briefs one after the other and take questions members may have.</p> <p>  I welcome the opportunity to discuss with the select committee my Department's Revised Estimate for 2017.  I am accompanied by the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, and the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne.  To assist in our work today we provided a briefing note last week on the Department's funding for 2017.  It set out details of the Vote and the local government fund, as well as other key information.</p> <p>  The Revised Estimate sets out my Department's budget for 2017.  Gross expenditure of &euro;1.779 billion is budgeted for.  This represents an increase of almost &euro;400 million or 29% on the provision for 2016.  Such a significant increase in resources clearly indicates the priority the Government attaches to my Department's programmes and, in particular, the importance and urgency we have assigned to supporting the initiatives set out in Rebuilding Ireland, the housing and homelessness strategy.  The gross provision for 2017 is made up of over &euro;1 billion in current spending and over &euro;700 million in capital spending.  In addition, my Department's programmes will benefit in 2017 from resources available from the local government fund.</p> <p>  In 2017 we will see a very significant level of new investment in housing.  As I have previously stated, housing is an absolute priority for the Government.  This is evidenced clearly by the level of resources allocated to support my Department's housing programmes this year.  The Revised Estimate shows that &euro;1.2 billion is being made available for housing programmes in 2017.  In addition, local authorities will fund a range of housing services to the value of &euro;92 million from surplus local property tax receipts, bringing the total housing provision to almost &euro;1.3 billion.  This investment will see the housing needs of over 21,000 households being met in 2017.  Through a provision of &euro;732 million for capital expenditure which is made up of &euro;655 million of Exchequer funds and &euro;77 million from LPT receipts, self-funded by local authorities, local authorities and approved housing bodies will be in a position to deliver 4,450 units through a combination of construction, acquisitions, rapid build, Part V and returning vacant units to productive use.</p> <p>  The provision of &euro;566 million in current expenditure which is made up of &euro;551 million of Exchequer funds and &euro;15 million from LPT receipts, self-funded by local authorities, will mean that 16,600 additional households can be supported in 2017 under the housing assistance payment scheme and the rental accommodation scheme and through direct leased units.</p> <p>  The Housing Agency will be provided with capital funding of &euro;70 million, with the specific focus of engaging with banks and investment companies to acquire properties for social housing nationally, thereby increasing social housing delivery.  It is estimated that this mechanism will deliver 1,600 units in the period to 2020.</p> <p>  A new vacant repair and leasing initiative will allow local authorities to provide financial assistance for property owners to bring vacant properties up to standard in order that they can then be leased as social housing.  The scheme will be rolled out nationally, with a total investment of &euro;32 million, to enable up to 800 vacant properties to be brought back into use as new homes for families on local authority waiting lists.  A new buy and renew initiative will support local authorities and approved housing bodies to purchase private housing units in need of remediation, renew and make them available as social housing.  An initial capital provision of &euro;25 million will be available for this initiative in 2017.</p> <p>  The Government has also established a &euro;200 million local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, supported by an allocation of &euro;50 million in 2017.  The fund will provide enabling infrastructure on key sites to open up lands for early development.  The initiative has the potential to release the delivery of between 15,000 and 20,000 new homes by 2019.  We hope to be in a position to announce the fund next month shortly after St. Patrick's Day.</p> <p>  The Exchequer funding being provided for housing authority managed homeless services is up by almost &euro;28 million or 40% on the 2016 budget provision and totals almost &euro;98 million.  This will ensure the increased demand for emergency homeless services will be addressed effectively.  It will assist in supporting homeless households to access long-term and sustainable housing solutions.</p><p> In 2017, some 3,000 exits from emergency accommodation are expected to be achieved through normal social housing tenancies, provision of rapid build housing and the housing assistance payment.  Last year, the figure was 2,700 which was by some margin the highest ever in terms of housing solutions for homeless people.</p><p> As part of the Government&rsquo;s response to tackling housing supply issues, An Bord Plean&aacute;la has been entrusted with administering new temporary fast-track planning procedures for proposed residential developments of 100 or more units and large-scale student accommodation projects, known as strategic housing developments.  Under the new procedures the board will be required to complete pre-planning application consultations regarding proposed developments with the concerned developers and the relevant local authority within nine weeks of receipt of request.</p><p> The board will subsequently be required to make a final determination in respect of planning applications for concerned developments within 16 weeks of receipt of the planning application.  This potentially will result in planning decisions in respect of such large-scale residential developments being made within 25 weeks of the commencement of formal pre-application consultations with the board, as against the current two stage planning application process which can, in certain circumstances, take up to two years from initial design concept stage to securing ultimate approval.</p><p> Turning to water services, which seems to be a topical issue today, committee members will be aware that Irish Water took on responsibility for the delivery of water services from 1 January 2014.  The programme for Government commits to a capital investment programme, which includes the &euro;5.5 billion in capital set out in the Irish Water business plan to 2021, to continue to upgrade the dilapidated national water infrastructure.</p><p> The projected level of subvention and equity to be provided by the Government to Irish Water assumed in its business plan to 2021 averaged &euro;475 million in subvention and &euro;270 million in equity contributions for both 2017 and 2018.  Additional funding is being provided in 2017 to address the shortfall arising from the suspension of domestic water services charges.</p><p> The Government remains committed to supporting the group water sector as an important element of the water industry in Ireland.  This is reflected in the provision of &euro;17.8 million in 2017 for my Department&rsquo;s rural water programme, under which funding is provided for group water schemes.  A multi-annual approach was introduced in 2016 in respect of the rural water programme.</p><p> The new multi-annual approach provides enhanced funding certainty for priority investment needs in order to support the implementation of proper planning and sustainable development in rural areas, to meet the requirements of the EU drinking water directive in relation to rural water supplies, and to support the delivery of measures identified in river basin management plans to meet the objectives of the water framework directive.</p><p> The local government fund is funded principally by motor taxation and the local property tax, LPT, which is collected by the Revenue Commissioners.  In addition, a payment is made to the fund from my Department&rsquo;s Vote.  Local property tax continues to provide a sustainable, stable, alternative source of funding for the local government sector.  Save for an administrative change to the treatment of pension-related deductions, which is positive news for local authorities, the 2017 allocations of local property tax to local authorities are broadly based on the same mechanism and principles as were agreed by Government in previous years, with 80% local retention to fund the delivery of public services and the remaining 20% being redistributed to provide top-up funding to local authorities that have lower property tax bases due to variances in property values and density across the State.</p><p> These measures are necessary to ensure a balanced system of funding local authorities.  The Government has devolved more powers to local authorities by giving elected members discretion to vary the rates of LPT by up to 15%.  This allows for greater transparency and accountability at a local level.  The income sources to the local government fund this year are estimated to be motor tax of just over &euro;1 billion, LPT of &euro;460 million, and a payment from the Exchequer of &euro;365 million.  </p><p> My Department will make payments estimated at &euro;1.837 billion from the fund in 2017, including LPT payments to local authorities of &euro;500 million, payment of &euro;333 million to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for the maintenance of non-national roads and for public transport, payment of &euro;639 million to Irish Water, and a payment to the Exchequer of up to &euro;230 million.</p><p> The Department&rsquo;s 2017 Vote also provides funding for a range of community programmes.  The bulk of the funding, over &euro;42 million, is provided for the social inclusion and community activation programme, or SICAP as it is known.  SICAP, which was rolled out on 1 April 2015 as the successor programme to the local and community development programme, takes account of the new alignment structures in its delivery and objectives.  The programme is managed and implemented through the local community development committees, as the new governance model for local and community programmes in each local authority area.  The aim of SICAP is to reduce poverty, promote social inclusion and equality through local, regional and national engagement and collaboration.   I am confident the allocation of over &euro;42 million for 2017 will allow for the continuation of important supports for people in disadvantaged communities and will allow for the key, essential, front-line services delivered through the programme to be maintained.</p><p> Even though my brief is wide-ranging, I have kept my remarks as brief as possible in order to allow for a full discussion on the programmes and funding of my Department this year.  I hope my remarks provided a helpful introduction to what we need to get through today.  I thank Deputy Casey, in particular, for taking the time to be here.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-01a.37" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1357" speakername="Pat Casey" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP12017030100002#C00300"><p>No.  I will just make a few general comments and observations.  First of all, I thank the Minister and Ministers of State for being here this morning.  I feel privileged to have three Ministers here to answer questions.</p> <p>  We must all welcome the increased expenditure allocation for housing.  My concern has always been the percentage ratio of capital spending to current expenditure.  My belief is that capital expenditure is ongoing, never-ending and never gets us anywhere.  We are spending an extra &euro;223 million on capital expenditure, whereas there is an increase of &euro;183 million in current expenditure.  I would like the balance to be tipped more towards capital than current expenditure.  </p> <p>  I will focus on vacant units and urban regeneration, which come under the aegis of the Minister of State, Deputy English.  There was greater scope to address the housing problem more quickly by examining vacant units.  Realistically, we are looking at over 170,000 properties which, within a short space of time, could be brought back into use as homes for people.  In that case, we would not have the infrastructural problems identified with developing new sites, because water services and road networks are already there for the vacant units.</p> <p>  By returning vacant properties to normal use, we would also be revitalising our town centres.  That is a critical point.  One of the stumbling blocks identified in the vacant units policy concerns the certification process.  There are some blockages coming down the road because we are talking about obtaining disability access and fire certification for old buildings.  Such old buildings must also be compliant with planning regulations.  Will authorised certifiers be willing to sign off on these issues?  In fairness, as regards fire safety standards, we might not be able to certify off-the-cuff solutions that will have to be inventive in order to get old buildings back into use.  </p> <p>  If the vacant units had been completely managed by local authorities, with additional capital being put in, we could have returned many more homes for people more quickly than by building new properties.  That is my personal observation because it is my area of responsibility. </p> <p>  Planning has been presented here as a two stage process but, in fact, it is a three stage one.  We have the pre-planning process with the local authority, which is defined as a four week period.</p><p>That four week period is only to get a meeting, not a result.  People still have to deal with Part V of the Planning and Development Act and maybe high-level planning issues prior to them going to the nine week pre-planning process.  The fact that it is not time bound can leave us exposed in regard to the fast track planning process.  At committee level, we highlighted the lack of public consultation with local councillors about large scale developments.  In fairness to the Minister, he reacted to that.  During the nine week process, they have to go back to the rural areas to give them an outline of the projects that have been put before the board at the time.  On reflection, that should only be needed for a material contravention process, where the local representatives have had no input.  Previously, any large scale development would have been part of a county development plan or a local area plan.  The only real need to engage back with the local authority at local level was in regard to a material contravention.  The positive that will hopefully come out of this fast track planning process is that at the end of this three year process we will know how to submit a proper planning application for a large scale development and how to deal with that process in the long term.  If we get that alone out of the process it will have been worth it.</p><p> I suppose my heart is still in the local authority, which I only recently left it.  I was chairman the year the Putting People First document was launched.  I looked forward to the introduction of the local property tax because it felt as if it was giving power back to the councillors to make real decisions on whether to increase or decrease the property tax, and how to spend it.  In fairness, it was sold very well.  However, the public believed the local property tax would be a new source of revenue for local authorities but it was not.  It was just replacing the local government fund.  People still believe that local authorities have this new source of revenue called the local property tax.  Phil Hogan did a good job on selling that one.  After the first year, we all become aware that the local property tax was not returning local democracy.  The local authorities are losing 20% in terms of the national equalisation fund.  Local authorities that were doing reasonably well lost at least another 20% back to central government to be spent on capital projects.  </p><p> I am not going to argue against the need to spend it on housing, but we equally need to look at the local authorities.  Over the last seven years they have suffered enormously in regard to the provision of services.  We all have seen services being cut over those years.  Local property tax is defined as the revenue received from the local property tax to support the provision of local services by local authorities which are responsible for a range of services including, among others, housing; recreational amenities such as public parks, libraries, open spaces and other leisure amenities; planning and development; fire and emergency; maintenance; cleaning of streets; street lighting and so forth.  In some local authorities over 40% of their local property tax fund is taken from their control.  They have no say whatsoever in how that is spent.  We need to address that.  I appreciate that &euro;77 million of local property tax is being spent on housing and I have no problem with that.  However, we need to bring other services along with that.  </p><p> The local property tax baseline that has been used for local authorities needs to be revisited.  The methodology used to calculate it needs to be looked at.  It needs to be calculated taking account of the case on the ground.  It is a historical issue that needs to be addressed.  If we are going to address the deficiencies in local authority services, whether it be in housing maintenance and repairs or in the inspection of properties which we spoke about at the last committee meeting, every property in local authority ownership should be inspected on an annual basis, as should properties in the private rental market that are being taken on.  Resources are needed to provide that type of service.  Part of our brief is looking at the funding of local authorities.  We need to see exactly how the baseline figure is calculated.</p><p> For my sins, I was chairman of a local community development committee, LCDC.  I was around for the local enterprise partnership, LEP; the local area and community plans, LACP; the local action group, LAG; the local economic and community plans, LECP; and the local community development committee, LCDC.  The one thing that I looked forward to-----</p></speech>

The one thing I looked forward to was the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, because it was different.  It did not begin with an "L".  SICAP has replaced the local and community development programme, LCDP.  SICAP is using specific computer software, the integrated reporting information system, IRIS.  This is having implications on the ground.  I fully understand the need for data.  Data is critical to us making decisions.  However, there has been a little too much emphasis on getting that data, gathering it, and then inputting it, instead of helping people find solutions to their problems, such as trying to find a job.  </p> <p>  I look forward to the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne's announcement of the &euro;2 million community fund, and what that will involve.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-01a.44" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP12017030100002#D00700"><p>I welcome Deputy Ellis.  I am sure he will pitch in on the discussion as we go.  I have given an opening speech addressing the areas of funding provision, housing, water, local government, community planning, Met &Eacute;ireann and administration.</p> <p>  In some ways, I understand where Deputy Casey is coming from in terms of capital versus current spending on housing.  This is a big priority for me.  In spite of what people say about this Government, building new social houses is a huge priority for us.  We have committed &euro;5.3 billion to it.  I think the Department is the only one that has a multi-annual capital expenditure agreement within Government to spend very significant resources in order to add about 47,000 social houses to the current stock.  This has been committed to regardless of where the economy goes over the next five or six years.  The majority will be new builds through local authorities and approved housing bodies.  However, we cannot ramp up at the pace that some people would like us to.  It is physically not possible in one year to go from building 74 local authority houses to building 7,000.</p><p>We are dramatically ramping up.  Including approved housing bodies, AHBs, we went from a total build of 501 units in 2015 to 652 units last year and 2,434 units this year.  We are also bringing voids back into use.  As Deputy Casey has said, it is much faster to bring an existing house that is vacant or void or may need some work back into use than it is to go through the process of planning and building a new house.  We need to do all of these things at the same time to try to deal with the housing pressures.  That includes new builds, bringing voids back into use and acquisitions.  From memory, we spent &euro;203 million last year buying more than 1,000 houses.  All of those properties are now in social housing use.  Part of the plan was to get vacant houses back into the system and use them.</p><p> We are putting long term leasing arrangements in place.  We have the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.  The scheme that is providing the big numbers early on is the housing assistance payment, HAP.  It does not simply switch people from rent supplement to housing assistance payment.  Only about one third of people coming into HAP are coming from rent supplement.  The majority are new tenancies that need State support to get a stable home.  I would like to see an increased emphasis over time on newly provided social housing through local authorities and approved housing bodies and less of a reliance on the private rental market through HAP and rent supplement.  In the short term, we have to put significant current expenditure into HAP while we are building up that capacity.  We think 15,000 people will be added onto HAP this year.</p><p> At lunchtime today we will be rolling out HAP in Dublin.  We have already rolled out homeless HAP, which has been quite successful.  It provided housing solutions for more than 800 people last year even though the target was 550.  We will be adding mainstream HAP to the four Dublin local authorities as of this afternoon.  This will result in a lot of badly needed social housing provision through HAP across Dublin this year.  We are going from providing just over 13,000 social housing solutions in 2013 to more than 18,500 last year, even though the target was just over 17,000 - we were 1,500 above that - to a target of more than 21,000 this year.</p><p> Anybody who questions the commitment to social housing provision across a range of blended measures needs to look at the financial allocation that we are adding through both capital and current expenditure.  We are going from &euro;800 million to &euro;1.2 billion in one year, a 50% increase.  That increase will be continued over the next three years.  That is where the &euro;5.3 billion comes from in terms of capital expenditure.</p><p> I agree that there is an opportunity in vacant housing.  About 10% of residential properties in Ireland are vacant.  In the UK and the Netherlands it is about 2.5%.  If we were to reduce our vacant property percentage from just under 10% to 8% we would be bringing tens of thousands of houses back into use.  Surely we have the capacity to do that.</p><p> We are allocating significant resources through the repair and leasing scheme and the buy and renewal scheme.  We are trying to put a strong, stable, sensible rental market in place that will attract private property owners into the rental market when and where possible.  That market will be managed by the Residential Tenancies Board.</p><p> I agree with the sentiment of everything Deputy Casey has said in terms of wanting to focus more on capital spend and build.  However, in the short term I think we need a reliance on HAP to ensure we are helping the maximum number of families we can into social housing solutions that will significantly improve their quality of life.</p><p> There is a three step process in the new streamlined planning process for large developments.  There is a pre-planning element which involves an informal discussion between a developer or builder and the local authority to put in place the ground rules and make sure an application is going to be ready for what will be a statutory pre-planning nine week process.</p><p> In spite of what some commentary has suggested, the big change is that the onus will now be on the developer to put together a much more professional planning application than we have seen in the past.  I do not think poorly thought-out planning applications will even get through the statutory pre-planning process.  I think they will be thrown out.  Gone are the days when large applications would come in and then local authority engineers and architects would have to redesign them over a period of months through time extensions and so on to get them ready for consideration.  That should not be the role of local authorities.  Local authorities should be there to manage a robust and fair assessment process of professionally put-together large applications that are consistent with zoning and local area plans and so on.  Then we go through the timelines of 25 weeks which give funders and developers certainty in terms of when they are going to get decisions.  This certainty around timelines is very important.</p><p> We did get some negative feedback from councillors and, in particular, from Senators who were representing councillors.  We made some changes to take account of those concerns and to make sure councillors were informed of the detail of big applications that were coming through.  Even though councillors are not the ones that should be making planning decisions, they should know what is going on in their areas and they should be reassured that what is being proposed is consistent with the zoning decisions and the local area plans that they have approved.</p><p> I accept that the local property tax is replacing a different funding mechanism and it is true that it is not entirely new money.  What is different about this is that the local authority has a say over whether to increase or decrease that fund and has more discretion over how it is spent.  I am very open to this committee debating how local property tax is managed in terms of equalisation and the national equalisation fund.  However, we must have some equalisation process between counties that do not have the population base and capacity to be able to raise sufficient local property tax to provide basic services, and other local authority areas that have very densely populated areas with very high property values and are making a very large income from local property tax.  This year, I have decided to stick with the process that was in place last year.  If people have ideas on that, I will happily take them on board and tease through these issues.  I am not wedded to any one form.  What we have at the moment is reasonably fair.  Some local authorities argue that they should be allowed hold on to more, while others make the case that the equalisation fund does not give them enough.  It is a reasonable balance.</p><p> Councillors frequently tell me that they would like to have more autonomy in terms of how they spend their budgets, rather than it being linked to national policy around housing or roads or maintenance or whatever.</p><p>I am happy to have that discussion but my understanding is there is quite a lot of autonomy in terms of how LPT money is spent.  The idea that some of that money might go into housing makes a lot of sense for local authorities as well as for national policy.<br/><br/>On the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP - I think the public can get lost in some of the acronyms we sometimes use - how its funding is allocated really has changed the model.  There is very little political input and certainly there is no ministerial input.  I was essentially given a <i>fait accompli </i>which had been assessed by Pobal where projects and organisations had been prioritised on the basis of a scoring system and we effectively approved that.  That is how it has worked, and that is probably a good thing.</p></speech>

It follows on from a discussion we had at Question Time in the D&aacute;il during the week.  A major focus of the Department and ourselves is on the whole area of vacant properties.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, touched on it but there is certainly a better wind for us in terms of the urgency of getting houses back on track.  In many cases, the infrastructure is there already.  The water and sewerage infrastructure, the footpaths, the shops and so on are there to service these units, if we can get them back into use.  Many of our plans are actually activating these houses.  There is accommodation in the private sector as well.  Much progress was made with voids last year, with money allocated to bring 2,3000 units back into use in terms of our own social housing stock.  In terms of private property, we recognise that very often the people who own these properties do not have the cash to get them back to a suitable condition to be able to rent them out and that is the reason behind the repair and lease back.  The amount could be &euro;20,000 up to &euro;40,000 but in many cases in the pilot scheme, it has been under &euro;20,000, that is, to get the house back into use and into a condition that is acceptable.  That is what that is about.  There is a return on the money after a couple of years in terms of the lease back.  The money allocated there is &euro;32 million in 2017 and it could bring in a minimum of 800 units, or probably much more since that figure is based on the renovations costing &euro;30,000 or &euro;40,000.  That is one scheme that will work well.</p> <p>  There is the buy and renewal initiative where &euro;25 million has been allocated to local authorities.  Some local authorities are leading here in buying up vacant properties, and I would cite Louth as an example.  They are finding a mechanism under existing powers to take over vacant properties - in some cases very run-down properties - if they cannot find the owners.  It enables them to bring them back into use and that is what we are trying to do, so we are providing the resources there.</p> <p>  I refer to regulations, planning and direction.  I chair a working group on urban renewal and regeneration and we are looking at all of this.  It is a cross-departmental group with representatives from the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, who have a fair input into this.  There are local authority managers on it as well and other outside agencies are involved, from an architectural point of view, to see how we can strengthen the tool kit on offer to local authorities and other agencies to make this happen.  The Deputy is right that in many cases these vacant properties are on our high streets.  Under some rules, it is not economical to bring them back into play.  We are looking to see what we can do to ease this process around certification, planning and the regulations, including fire and so on, while not to renege on quality and on safety.  In many cases, it means the local authority would take control of this and lead this conversation.  It would mean meeting the owners of these properties and going street by street to see how this can be done and to get the properties back into use.  We said last week that we are prepared to work on this and maybe by the end of March, we will produce our initiative in this area, which will be a range of suggestions to make this happen better.</p> <p>  We will also look at the regulations because we know that in some cases, they prevent this happening and, in some cases, for good reason, in terms of safety.  Part of that is to come up with some new initiatives to encourage these vacant properties to be utilised again and to look at some towns and villages that have had a major difficulties because of their location.  Such towns have suffered decline over many years, predating our difficulties with the construction sector over the last ten years but going back 20 or 30 years.  If we are going to reverse that, it means having a conversation about the economic purpose of those towns and villages, where they are going and what their long-term vision is going to be.  That conversation is probably going to happen in terms of Ireland 2040 - Our Plan, on which the Minister is leading off on, and where we are going as a country from a planning point of view.  We often cite a town where there was a 20-year plan and on which &euro;150 million to &euro;180 million was spent over that timeframe to bring it back to where it is today.  There was a long-term vision there, and that same long-term vision will be needed in many of the towns and villages we are looking at through the urban renewal and regeneration.  Long-term commitment is what is needed here but one has to have a long-term plan in the first place.  We believe that the local authorities are central to making that happen, by pulling all the agencies together and taking the lead.  It is up to us then to find the resources to reward that.  In the short term, we want those residential properties to be in use and we are looking at the planning regulations and changes to be made in April, I think, for the commercial properties to be reused as residential properties and to make that a more streamlined process.  We are doing what the Deputy has suggested we do.</p> <p>  The vacant property register is on track to be completed before the end of the second quarter of 2017 and that will give us the information on these vacant properties.  We can then try to analyse that and see how we work it.  I totally agree with the Deputy that there is a win for taxpayers in getting these vacant properties into use.  Our job as a Department, along with local authorities, is to try to make this happen and make it easier, which is what we are trying to do.  In some cases, that means tweaking regulations, if needs be, in the correct manner and reducing the cost of doing that and providing certainty.  If one talks to someone who owns a property, having this conversation about how to restore a property and bring it back into use is a nightmare.  We have to make it easier for people to do that because we want to bring the property back into use.</p> <p>  The Chairman asked about build versus purchase or renewal of vacant properties.  We have a range of offers across the different schemes.  The Minister and I meet local authorities and engage with officials and our message to them is that there is a range of schemes and that they should let us know what suits best in their areas.  In certain counties, it makes sense and it is better value for taxpayer to buy up properties and bring them back into use, certainly where there are many empty properties.  In other areas, it is essential that we fast-track construction and get construction projects up and running again but there is space within the schemes to apply what suits best for each local authority.  As the Minister said, it takes time to rebuild that construction capacity for social housing, which is the end game here.  That is what we want to do.  In the meantime, in some cases, it makes a lot of sense to activate vacant properties and buy up empty properties, which we are doing through the Housing Agency and the various schemes.  If we go into any estate in any county, we come across empty properties.  We are trying to find out who owns them.  Local authorities are doing that  and they are compiling a register.  Most of those properties are probably mortgaged and owned by a lending institution.  The Housing Agency is trying to buy them in bulk.  On streets, often properties have gone into decline over a number of years.  </p> <p>  We have enough schemes with enough options.  We have to work with local authorities at county level to make a decision about what is best for them in their own county and we will facilitate that, as will the Department.</p></speech>

This has been requested by many people.  The Minister will be aware of &Oacute; Cualann in Ballymun, which is co-operative housing, and it is working off a site that was fully serviced.  As the Minister said in respect of plans to service different sites, money has been set aside for the local authorities.  Is there any way to use co-operatives, such as this one, a bit more?  They are delivering affordable housing at a price.  </p> <p>  I refer to the plan for PPPs.  We have five sites or whatever the number is and there is one such site in Finglas.  We are running into major problems with this in terms of the communities.  I have very serious concerns about the way it is being done in the Finglas area but what has happened is that we have sold people the idea that the social mix was there.  That is the message which has been sold by Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il, the Labour Party and even our party, that is, that there should be social, affordable and private together.  With the PPPs, for example, there will be 100% social housing in the Finglas area.  If that was delivered in the right way, with all the proper facilities, I would not have a problem with it but, unfortunately, that is not the case.  From what I can see, the PPPs are in serious trouble.  I know from talking to managers in Dublin City Council that many of them have serious doubts at to whether PPPs can be delivered.</p><p>I am unclear what provision has the Department made for this year.  Most of them will be delivered down the road but is any provision being made?  I note that in an increase of &euro;38 million, a provision of &euro;98 million went into homeless services.  Does the Minister envisage that rising further or does he see it levelling out?  The indicators at the moment show that homelessness is still rising, which indicates something is going wrong somewhere in what is being delivered.  We have the rapid builds coming on stream across a number of areas, including 40 units in my own area.  Does the Minister envisage the policy changing?  Are these to be directly solely to homeless people or will there be a combination or people who are on the housing list, homeless people and so on?  Does the Minister see that the rapid build housing will be used more in that way?</p></speech>

The Revised Estimates show &euro;1.2 billion is being made available for housing programmes in 2017.  While that is an increase on previous years, it is on a par with or less than what was spent on social housing even in the 2000s.  This has to be put into context.  Fingal County Council, to give one example but there are many others, has not built a house in three years.  It probably will not build a house this year either.  There are a couple of schemes but we will see.  The level of investment that would be required to make up for the lack of action for a number of years ,while the Minister's own party was in office by the way, requires a lot more than that.  I wanted to raise what the money is being spent on because we know it is not being spent in the old way of just giving local authorities money to build public housing but is being spent on a whole range of things.  At least ten times, the Minister of State used the phrase getting properties "back into use".  I have a major problem with public money being given to private owners of property to get them to get it back into use to be "leased for social housing" or in other words, probably let out for HAP or one of these other schemes.  That is not investing in public housing and makes no sense. When the committee on housing met over the summer at a time when others did not - I am beginning to wonder why we bothered - the  idea was raised of acquiring empty vacant houses for public use, not just doing them up for whoever owns them.  Acquiring properties is something on which we should be spending money.</p></speech>

Councils are buying houses on the open market and I do not have a problem with that because there is an emergency and it has to be done but we all know that is not a sensible policy in the long term because it means buying houses at top dollar when they could be built.</p> <p>  I refer to an affordable mortgage scheme.  I would have thought that Fine Gael, as the party of the home owner and so on, would be interested in this but there seems to be very little interest.  Will councils be encouraged to have an affordable mortgage scheme?  We have often debated this mixed tenure policy, which sounds great in theory.  I live in a mixed tenure estate of 720 units that was built by Fingal County Council in the early 2000s with a private developer.  Of those, 200 were sold on the private market, 400 were sold as affordable mortgage units and about 100 were for council tenants and consequently, there is a range of incomes in the estate.  There are teachers, nurses, manual labourers and all sorts of people.  If an affordable mortgage scheme was in place the councils could build estates in which some units could be for social housing and others could be for affordable mortgages for those who do not qualify for social housing but cannot buy a house on the open market.  I wonder why there apparently is so little enthusiasm for doing that because it used to be something councils did routinely.</p> <p>  On the section on water, yesterday afternoon this issue seemed headed towards a resolution, in that the committee which had been set up by the D&aacute;il to look into it seemed to be reaching some kind of consensus that water charges should be abolished, people should get refunds -----</p></speech>

That was already part of the Estimate and it will be part of a Revised Estimate if the decision is made to proceed in a way that does not involve a revenue stream from water charges in the future for the rest of the year.  My position on this and that of the Government has been to try to find a compromise that the D&aacute;il can support, that parties can work towards, that makes sense for the country, that can be accepted broadly across society and that can be consistent with our legal obligations under the Water Framework Directive.  All I said yesterday was that I do not see how I can introduce legislation against the advice of the Attorney General when I know that it is likely to lead to court action by the European Commission and to fines being imposed on Ireland.  That would be hugely irresponsible of me.  I am happy to work with the compromises that everybody is working towards whereby effectively we are doing away with water charges for normal use in houses.  The only thing that I have said, and I am very consistent with the expert commission and the European Commission on this, as well as with the Attorney General's advice, that of my own Department and some other political parties, is that for us to be compliant with commitments to which we have signed up under the Water Framework Directive, there needs to be some polluter pays principle under our water strategy whereby there is a consequence for wasting large volumes of water.  That is all.  The Joint Committee on Future Funding of Domestic Water Services will continue to do its work.  I hope it can work on the basis of a working paper that the committee Chairman made available yesterday, which I think is a very good working document that involves everybody having to make some compromise.  While I hope that can be the basis of finding a resolution, I will leave that to the committee concerned.  I was asked a direct question yesterday as to whether I would introduce legislation against the advice of the Government's independent advice coming from the Attorney General's office and I said I could not do that.  While I think that is just a fair and honest position from me, I am happy to work with all parties to try to find a resolution to this issue because it is something that has dogged Irish politics for far too long.</p><p>We have big issues to deal with as a country, as a Government and as an Oireachtas.  I hope that everybody will work towards finding a solution to this issue so that we can move on.  That is really all I can say on the water issue.</p><p> In regard to some of the other issues-----</p></speech>

It is not always possible.  Sometimes we will fund the more traditional local authority housing estate.  We have signed off on many of those in the last six months.  Tens of millions of euro are being spent on them.  On big sites such as O'Devaney Gardens, Oscar Traynor Road, St. Teresa's Gardens and so on, there are very significant sums of public money going into regenerating communities as well as providing social housing.  We are trying to incorporate mixed tenure, which would include affordable rental where possible and private housing, as part of those developments.  That is a good thing to attempt to do.  Many other parties support us in trying to do that.  However, it is not always possible.  It depends on the size of the site and the number of houses concerned.  Many of the sites Deputy Ellis referred to comprise 30, 40 or 50 social houses.  Trying to force mixed tenure into smaller estates might be more trouble than it is worth.  The core issue here is to get social housing of good quality built with good facilities as part of those developments.</p></speech>

However, I am aiming for the affordable housing that was delivered in the past in different estates.  Substituting affordable housing for affordable rental housing, as the Minister is doing, is not what many people are looking for in certain areas.  We need an affordable housing scheme where people have mortgages.</p></speech>

Our focus to date has been on trying to get social housing built, trying to get capacity in place to build, trying to get a lot of sites that have been basically stagnant for a decade up and running again and trying to build capacity within affordable housing bodies and local authorities to build social housing.  Many local authorities were very badly caught out with affordable housing estates and projects.  My own local authority, Cork County Council, was badly caught out when affordable housing suddenly became more expensive than private housing which had dramatically reduced in value over a very short period of time.  Some of the financing arrangements that local authorities had in place for affordable housing projects exposed them to a lot of debt.</p></speech>

In principle, I do not disagree with Deputy Ellis that we need to look at an affordable housing model.  How we provide accommodation in places like Dublin city centre for people to be able to work and live in close proximity is key.  I have an open mind on whether that is through affordable rental, through increasing supply to try to bring prices down, or through some form of affordable purchase scheme in the future.  </p> <p>  All the pressure on me to date has been finding social housing for the 91,000 people on housing lists, how are we going to deal with the needs of families that are homeless or under threat of becoming homeless, people who are being squeezed out of the private rental market, people who are living with relatives and so on.  Most of those people are not able to buy at the moment.  We need to focus our resources on trying to get social housing provision increased.</p></speech>

It is less of a problem outside Dublin, apart from areas such as Galway and Cork.  We are looking independently at the cost of building houses through the Housing Agency and through the Department.  In Dublin, depending on what estimate one looks at, one needs to factor in &euro;60,000 for site purchase.  This seems crazy to me.  If we are talking about private site values of &euro;60,000 to &euro;80,000 per house, using publically owned land to provide affordable houses as well as social housing in mixed tenure developments is a good strategic way of getting value.  There is very little black and white here.  There is a lot of grey when it comes to housing.  We need to get many different approaches working in tandem to increase supply where it is needed.</p> <p>  I know there is frustration that the number of homeless people continues to rise.  We have a big focus on families and on getting families out of hotels.  This will continue for the next four or five months.  I have said that we do not want hotels to be used as emergency accommodation for families after the middle of this year.  This is primarily a Dublin issue.  We have a plan with chief executives from each of the four Dublin local authorities.  We are going to work incredibly hard to try to deliver on that commitment but I think we can do so.  We are also delivering for people who are at risk of rough sleeping.  We need to deliver more.  Most of them are individuals in emergency accommodation.  The focus for the first six months or so was to try to get emergency facilities improved and to get sufficient numbers of beds in use in Dublin, in particular, so that people would not have to rough sleep on the streets.  I have spoken to rough sleepers, particularly last September when we were trying to assess how many extra beds were needed in the system to ensure that people had the option to go to a safe emergency shelter.  That is why we added three new emergency facilities before Christmas and why we are adding another hundred beds at the moment.  We are spending millions of euros doing that.  However, that is not the solution to homelessness.  The solution to homelessness is to find homes for people.  Emergency accommodation needs to be a temporary transition, not a permanent or semi-permanent solution for people.  Ultimately, that means social housing.  It means long-term leasing arrangements, an increased emphasis on rapid builds and a housing first approach towards homelessness.</p><p>Last year we saw increases in the numbers of people coming into homelessness, and obviously we need to slow that down.  If one looks at the results in this regard, while significant numbers still are in homeless accommodation, 2,700 housing solutions were put in place for homeless people and families last year.  That is significantly more than ever before and this year, that figure will be more than 3,000.  If one takes the figures for families, on which I have a real focus, the figure for January shows the number of families that are homeless has fallen and the number of children, in particular, in emergency accommodation has also fallen but it is still far too high.  The estimate has increased from approximately &euro;70 million last year to just under &euro;100 million this year.  I think we spent approximately &euro;40 million on hotel rooms last year.  We can get much better results for families by spending that money in a different way.  That will be a combination of rapid build, conventional social housing, long-term leasing arrangements for people, homeless HAP and HAP generally, as well as much more suitable tailor-made emergency accommodation for families as a short-term transition measure while we find long-term housing solutions for them.  Some people have accused me of promising too much in this area but we should promise in an ambitious way on a short timeline and try to deliver on that, which is what I am trying to do.</p></speech>

In total, that programme is expected to deliver 1,500 social housing units through PPPs.  There is a tendering process that will mean that in most of these projects, the money will be spent next year rather than this year because it takes time to ramp that up.  We should use public private partnerships.  They were much more expensive ten years ago than they are now and we should use PPPs for infrastructure generally.  We can put together much more competitive funding packages for that now.  Ultimately, for me, this is about trying to build houses as quickly as we can and using the capacity and the efficiencies of the private sector to be able to build social housing for us.  If a PPP model is the best model to do that, then I am up for that.  We take every site and every project on a case-by-case basis.</p></speech>

They are even talking about a lot of these public private partnerships going to co-operative or voluntary housing and perhaps the councils themselves buying some of the units within these PPPs.  Is it acceptable to the Minister that the councils could buy into the PPPs as well?  I am curious because this is being suggested now.</p></speech>

It has been appointed to act as the lead local authority for the delivery of the social housing PPP programme in respect of this first project bundle with Cork County Council appointed to act as the lead local authority in respect of the second project bundle.  The identification and selection of sites for the third project bundle is currently under way and is expected to be finalised in coming months.  One can consider how PPPs have worked in delivering schools, for example, where one gets developers who have the capacity to deliver quickly on real scale and to help finance projects.  We should learn lessons and take what has worked and what has not worked with some of those PPPs and apply that to delivering social housing; that is all we are trying to do.  If there are specific issues in respect of sites and cases, I would be happy to hear about them.</p></speech>

I note we are ramping up.  I am not defending the numbers for last year and the year before.  We need to continue to ramp up.  Fingal has had a big focus on acquisitions in the last number of years.  The Deputy is right, actually, that we should be focusing on buying up properties to get them into social housing use quickly.  We spent &euro;203 million last year buying more than 1,000 properties that were vacant and were not being used last year and are now in social housing use.  As for the idea that we are not acting on that; we do not agree on some things but we do agree that we need to buy up properties that are not being used and may be vacant to get them into social housing use quickly because many families need the State to act with a sense of urgency on social housing provision and it is.  That is why we are also driving rapid build.  Rapid-build projects have been a real headache for this Department and for local authorities but we are trying to use new technology to get houses built faster.  We will look at anything that can do that, within reason, that still represents good quality of build and planning and so on.  Rapid build is only part of the solution but it is something that can deliver projects on a timeline that probably would not be possible with conventional projects.</p> <p>  On the repair and leasing scheme, we are not giving people grant aid to do up their houses.  What we are saying is that if somebody has a property at the moment that is vacant and is not being used, and if we ask them why they are not renting it, particularly in areas where there is quite high rent, one often gets the answer that the owner would be obliged to put &euro;10,000 or &euro;15,000 into the property to make it ready for the rental market.  We would like to be able to tell such people that we will fund that for them and will then take that cost out of their rent for the next ten years.  As a result, the cashflow problem a property owner may have to make available that property for a long-term tenancy for social housing purposes can be a win-win for everybody.  We get a house into which to put a family for ten years, the local authority or an AHB looks after that tenancy for the landlord and manages the repair that is needed to get the property up to the standard needed to be able to do that.  That gets a vacant property into use for social housing.  This is not a grant.  It is simply the State helping with a cashflow problem that would otherwise result in a vacant property remaining vacant indefinitely into the future.  We will see how that works.  We have piloted it in Waterford and Carlow - they are particularly keen on it in Waterford and think that it can work - and so we are going to test, particularly in Dublin where there are real pressures, as to whether this can deliver long-term tenancies for social housing tenants.  </p> <p>  On affordable mortgages, I would like to do more about local authority mortgages.  If one looks at the statistics, a lot of people do not even know they exist.  Do not forget that for someone to get a mortgage from a local authority, they must be able to show they have been turned down by at least two banks but there are a lot of people in that category.  We are looking at relaunching local authority mortgages.  There obviously must be a robust assessment of the ability to pay and credit rating and so on, otherwise the State would be lending irresponsibly and we cannot stand over that.</p><p>I would like to see more of a role for local authorities to work with people who may be transitioning from social housing to buying something affordable.  There are many properties across Ireland, outside Dublin, that are for sale for &euro;70,000 or &euro;80,000.  Not every house for sale costs &euro;200,000 or &euro;300,000.  There are many towns and villages that can accommodate people at relatively affordable house prices, particularly if we are bringing many vacant properties back into use.  Local authorities could do more here.  We need to work with them to make sure that is a financially sound proposition and that it is also legally sound with regard to state aid rules and so on.  We are looking at that and we may come back to the committee about it if and when we launch it.</p></speech>

On the planning process, is the initial pre-planning with the local authority a requirement before one goes to the nine week pre-planning with the board?  My concern is that there is no timeline for that.  On the local property tax, LPT, I fully agree with, and understand, the national equalisation process.  I also fully accept that there has to be something there but my argument is about the LPT baseline that is applied to local authorities.  Those of us coming from local authorities would argue that is probably incorrect.  Is the methodology in calculating that LPT baseline similar or consistent in all local authorities?  How does that mechanism work?  I accept that the excess over and above that is rightly being spent on capital infrastructure for housing but it is having an effect on the services being provided at local level.</p> <p>  I am not getting into the water debate and what might happen there but I welcome the slight increase in funding for group water schemes.  I refer primarily to rural Ireland and smaller towns and villages in the context of the national planning framework that is on the horizon.  Regardless of what happens at the committee and what water charging regime comes out of it, it will never fund the capital investment required to deliver a revitalised rural Ireland with respect to water and sewerage schemes in towns and villages.  We know that most of them are at capacity and have no room to expand.</p> <p>  I come back to vacant units.  I have my constituency office in Arklow.  It is a prime example of how important vacant units are.  Arklow has no wastewater capacity at all.  It is the pipeline.  It might start in 2019 and might be finished in 2022.  There is no capacity for new builds in Arklow.  We have nearly 1,000 on the list.  Probably 60% of the properties over shops on the main street in Arklow are vacant, and probably 35% to 40% of the properties on the street are vacant.  That is why we need to put more emphasis and resources, if we can, into converting vacant units into potential homes for people.  That is the case I am making.  That is the reality on the ground out there.</p></speech>

Will vacant houses in rural places qualify for the repair and leasing scheme, or will the towns that have greater need and greater housing lists come first?  The Minister says he has &euro;32 million for 2017.  Will it be for cities like Dublin, Cork and Limerick, where there is a much greater need?  Can the Minister clarify if everyone who applies to get this loan - it is a loan, not a grant - will qualify?  If they qualify, will the councils only give the loan to areas to which they want to give it, or where they need it for someone who is on the housing list?  Will the loan extend to areas where there is neither need nor pressure for someone to be housed?  Many people in my county expect that this will apply to every small village and rural community, and that they will be able to avail of this loan.

We have an agreement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to spend &euro;32 million to go through an initial phase which will involve approximately 800 to 1,000 units with the money that is available.  That money is available this year.  We will be working through approved housing bodies, AHB, and local authorities to try to get properties back into use where there is the most need.  I think there will be some repair and leasing schemes in rural areas, but the majority will be in urban areas where there is the most social housing need.  There are other things that we need to do to help people to repair homes in rural areas.  The Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, has announced initiatives around that involving home improvements and tax incentives.</p><p>This is primarily part of a social housing strategy.  We have to focus on the parts of the country that have the most social housing need, and we have to put money into getting private houses into long-term lease arrangements that can accommodate people on social housing lists.  To be clear, it is not a loan, <i>per se</i>, although I suppose it could be called that.  It is essentially a local authority or an AHB getting money from us to fund the repairs that are needed in a house and then factoring in the repayment of that money over a five to ten year period through the rent that will be paid.  It is a loan of sorts, but it is really to deal with the cashflow problem that many private property owners might have.</p><p>I suspect there are many cases in Kerry whereby if somebody had &euro;15,000 to be able to do up a house to make it available for lease for the next ten years, he or she would probably do it.  As people may not have the money immediately, they cannot change the boiler or do up the house or whatever.  That certainly seems to be a barrier from anecdotal evidence and we will now test it with the new repair and leasing scheme.  We will see how it goes.  If we get 800 units delivered quickly, we will certainly go back to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to try to get sanction to do much more.  I would like to spend hundreds of millions of euro on this if we could, but currently we have sanction to spend &euro;32 million.  We need to show that it works and many people are saying to me they think it will.  Let us wait and see.</p><p> I would also like approved housing bodies to be a big part of this.  Local authorities can of course do it but sometimes, particularly in Dublin, we find organisations like Respond!, Cl&uacute;id, Focus Ireland, the Peter McVerry Trust and maybe others may well want to put people on the ground, knocking on doors, asking private property owners whether they would engage with this process and make their properties available, especially if they are in areas with much social housing demand.  That kind of proactivity on the street is exactly what we need to try to get units delivered quickly.  We will also be sending guidance to all local authorities on repair and leasing, how it can work and where the priorities should be.  Nobody will be in any doubt in that regard.</p><p> There is a broader issue of helping people in rural areas to get vacant properties into use.  We will be launching a vacant housing strategy as part of the overall housing strategy.  We said we would have that done by the end of the second quarter of this year and the Housing Agency has been working hard on that.  We will launch that and there will be a focus on trying to get as many of the 200,000 or so vacant residential properties in the country into use as we can by incentives.  It is an obvious answer that Deputy Casey and others have referred to for very good reason.</p><p> I will be a little careful in what I say about Arklow as I am told there are legal proceedings under way with some of the issues.  I do not want to say anything that may influence those cases.  In general, the idea that we have towns and cities with very significant vacancy percentages while we are trying to build new housing developments on greenfield sites that must get services and wastewater treatment facilities etc. seems to be madness.  We have to focus on existing infrastructure and getting the most out of that as well as adding new infrastructure.  We have 43 towns where raw sewage is going into rivers, lakes and harbours.  In my own city of Cork, 50,000 houses are pumping raw sewage into the harbour every single day.  I am told that amounts to approximately 34,000 wheelie bins full of wastewater every day going into a harbour I have grown up beside.  That is not acceptable and the issue will be solved within the next 12 months or so as Irish Water puts infrastructure in place to deal with the matter.  That needs to be replicated in places like Arklow and elsewhere.</p><p> We have been speaking to people in Irish Water to ensure its capital investment programme, particularly around wastewater treatment, matches the housing plan in order that it focuses resources on where houses are likely to be built in the next few years.  A number of developers come to our housing delivery unit saying they can deliver a specific number of houses on zoned land, in some cases with planning, but they do not have the necessary water infrastructure to facilitate that.  Most of them come before getting planning as they are afraid they will not get it because the infrastructure will not facilitate housing development.  It is a big issue and we must work in parallel with Irish Water in the same way we would have worked with local authorities on water provision in the past to ensure we are investing in a sensible way in terms of roads, water and other infrastructure in facilitating new housing development.  In particular we must focus on using existing infrastructure.  It is a no-brainer, to be honest.</p><p> We now have a multi-annual rural water programme for 2016 to 2018, with various funding measures around public health compliance, enhancement of existing schemes, rural group water schemes, and a transition of schemes from public water to the wastewater sector.  A series of investments are happening and because we can give some certainty around multi-annual investment, it makes it easier to deliver on that.  There will be more of that.  If we are serious about creating counterbalances to Dublin with respect to increasing populations in other parts of Ireland, water infrastructure will be core in doing that.  It will cost money, which is why the decisions we make around how we pay for domestic water supply cannot simply just be on the basis of being popular all the time.  We must make some decisions that are good for the country as well as being acceptable to the vast majority of people and political parties.</p><p> With regard to the baseline calculation for local property tax, LPT, my understanding is there is a method of doing this that is fair to everybody, based on issues like population density, overall population and investment criteria.  In particular there is a link to what those local authorities would have been spending in the past to try to maintain a core level of service.  That is why, from last year to this year, the one thing I insisted upon was that no local authority would lose out with the LPT allocation on what was available last year.  I would happily have a conversation with the committee on managing LPT, how we prioritise and how we create a redistribution of resources to ensure rural Ireland does not lose out.  I assume if Deputy Danny Healy-Rae was still here, I expect he would have pretty strong views on counties that simply do not have the population density to be able to pay for the resources they need.</p></speech>

She is very welcome on the morning of what will prove to be an historic day, of which we are all very conscious, and once again I thank her.  Apologies have been received from Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile.</p><p>I welcome Ms Maria McDonald of the Victims' Rights Alliance to discuss the issue of penal reform.  On behalf of the committee, I thank Ms McDonald for her attendance this morning.  I also acknowledge the presence of her colleague, Ms Fiona Murphy.  I wish to remind everyone that the joint committee agreed, as part of its work programme for 2017, to look at the area of prisons and penal policy.  We contracted the title of this element of our work programme to penal reform.  This is the second external engagement and the third focused address on this issue by the committee.  Ms McDonald will be invited to make an opening statement to the committee and this will be followed by a question and answer session with committee members.</p><p>Before I invite Ms McDonald to make her address, I must caution her in relation to privilege in the context of these and all Oireachtas committee proceedings.  I draw attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, she is protected by absolute privilege in respect of her evidence to this committee.  However, if she is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continues to so do, she is entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of her evidence.  She is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and she is asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, she should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>Without any further ado, I invite Ms McDonald to present her address.</p></speech>

The VRA is an alliance of victim support and human rights organisations in Ireland, namely Advocates for Victims of Homicide, the CARI Foundation, the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network, the Immigrant Council of Ireland, Inclusion Ireland, the Irish Criminal Justice and Disability Network, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, the Irish Road Victims' Association, the National Women's Council of Ireland, the Irish Tourist Assistance Service, One In Four, the Rape Crisis Network Ireland, Ruhama, Safe Ireland and Support After Homicide.  The alliance was formed with one key goal, that is, to ensure that the EU victims directive is implemented in Ireland within the proposed timeframe, with all victims of crime in Ireland in mind.</p> <p>  Our members have different views on penal reform, sentencing and prisons.  For that reason, this submission is limited to the rights afforded to victims under the victims directive and recognised rights provided to victims of crime in other common law jurisdictions.  Given the short time available, it has not been possible to get all our members to sign off on this submission.</p> <p>  Member states of the EU, including Ireland, were required to transpose the victims directive into law by 16 November 2015, but no legislation has been enacted to date to transpose the directive in Ireland.  The publication of the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill 2016 on 29 December 2016 was the first major step in putting victims at the heart of the criminal justice system.  As members know, that Bill is currently before the D&aacute;il.  The Bill is a comprehensive document which has had the benefit of significant consultation with key State and non-State agencies working with victims of crime, including victim support organisations.  It broadly mirrors the content of the victims directive, although there are some glaring omissions.</p> <p>  The necessity to implement dedicated victims legislation is illustrated by the contents of the Guerin report, the Garda Inspectorate report from 2014, the VRA report from 2014 and the O'Higgins report of 2016.  A survey by some VRA members indicated that 72% of victims surveyed said that they felt re-victimised by the criminal justice system.  This should be compared with the figure of 49% of victims who indicated that they felt re-victimised by the accused.  The risk of re-victimisation and intimidation should be reduced as much as possible and safeguards should be put in place to protect victims of crime during the sentencing and parole processes and on the release of the offender from prison.</p> <p>  The Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill, if implemented, will put victims of crime on a statutory footing in Irish law for the first time.  There is currently no legal definition of a victim of crime in Irish law.  Section 2 proposes to define a victim as a person who has suffered physical, mental or emotional harm or economic loss which has been directly caused by an offence.  This mirrors the definition in the victims directive.  Family members are deemed to be victims for the purposes of the Bill if the death of the victim was directly caused by a criminal offence.  A family member will not be entitled to the rights under the Bill if he or she has been charged with, or is under investigation for, the death of the victim.</p><p>One of the major omissions within the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill 2016 is the absence of restorative justice.  There has been growing recognition that restorative justice should be explored to address the need of victims of crime for redress.  It is a process that is being increasingly used by victims of crime in Ireland such as, for example, Le Ch&eacute;ile in Limerick.  Article 2(1)(d) of the victims' directive defines restorative justice as meaning &quot;any process whereby the victim and the offender are enabled, if they freely consent, to participate actively in the resolution of matters arising from the criminal offence through the help of an impartial third party&quot;.  Member states are not required to establish restorative justice services but where they exist, member states were required to have safeguards in place for their use. <br/><br/>Article 4(1)(j) of the victims' directive asserts that victims must be informed, on first contact with the Garda, of &quot;the available restorative justice services&quot;.  Article 12 of the directive outlines safeguards to protect &quot;the victim from secondary and repeat victimisation, from intimidation and from retaliation&quot;.  Restorative justice should only be used if it is in the interest of the victim to do so based on his or her free and informed consent.  A victim can withdraw his or her consent at any time.  Prior to agreeing to engage in restorative justice, a victim must be given complete and unbiased information.  This should include information on the outcomes and the supervision of the process.<br/><br/>Article 12 of the victims' directive also provides for the safeguard that an offender must acknowledge the basic facts of the case, which is incredibly important.  The agreement of the parties must be voluntary and it can be considered in criminal proceedings that follow, such as the sentence.  If restorative justice is conducted in private then it is confidential and cannot be discussed without the consent of the parties, save where there is a prevailing public interest to do so.  Victims that choose to engage in restorative justice should have the benefit of these measures in Irish legislation pursuant to the victims' directive.<br/><br/>Ireland has no statutory scheme for restorative justice.  Notwithstanding this, judges have recommended its use to victims of crime in the court process.  Sections 26 and 28 of the Children Act 2001 invite victims to be involved in a conference convened by a probation and welfare officer, which is a form of restorative justice.  Restorative justice was included in the scheme of the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill that was published in 2015.  It was, therefore, a surprise that restorative justice was not included in the recently published Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill 2016.  The failure to include restorative justice safeguards is an obvious omission of Ireland's obligations under the victims' directive.  Infringement proceedings may be instigated by the European Commission should the Bill not be amended to include such a provision.  The necessity of including restorative justice in legislation is illustrated by the fact that a court had suggested the use of restorative justice to a victim in circumstances that did not take account of the safeguards provided for in the victims' directive. <br/><br/>I am sure all members are familiar with the strategic review of penal policy of 2014.  The review acknowledged that the victims' directive &quot;promotes the appropriate use of restorative justice services which is in line with the existing delivery of such services in this State&quot;.  Furthermore, without being provided with information on the available restorative justice measures, victims will be unable to access their rights thereunder.  The victims' directive requires that victims be informed of the available restorative justice services.  The Garda victim information leaflet, which was drafted in order to comply with the State's obligations, only makes reference to restorative justice services being available where the offender is under 18 years of age.  There are other restorative justice services available to victims of crime who are adults.  The Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill 2016 does not require the Garda to provide information on restorative justice.  Again, this is a glaring omission in light of Ireland's obligations under Article 4 of the victims' directive.  Failure to adequately provide information on restorative justice significantly dilutes a victim's rights under the directive.  It illustrates the difference between providing rights on paper and accessing them in practice.<br/><br/>Victims have a right to information on an accused's remand and release from custody.  Article 6(5) of the victims' directive provides that victims must be &quot;offered the opportunity to be notified, without unnecessary delay, when the person remanded in custody, prosecuted or sentenced for criminal offences concerning them is released from or has escaped detention&quot;.Furthermore, victims should be informed of measures that have been implemented for their protection where an offender has been released or escaped from prison.  Section 7 of the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill provides that information should be provided to the victim on the offender's release or escape from custody.<br/><br/>Currently, upon request, victims can receive information from the Irish Prison Service about an offender's release from prison.  However, once a victim opts in, he or she is provided with all information that the Irish Prison Service would deem relevant in the circumstances.  Victims should be able to pick and choose what information they want to receive.  For example, some victims are re-victimised every time they receive an update on an offender while other victims would like to know as much information as is available.<br/><br/>In Canada, the Victims Bill of Rights Act permits victims, upon request, to receive information from Correctional Service Canada, which is like our Probation Service, about an offender's progress towards meeting the objectives of a correctional plan and information on the correctional plan.  Correctional Service Canada also gives victims access to a photograph of the offender prior to his or her release into the community.  Victims can request access from the Parole Board of Canada to listen to an audio recording of a parole hearing if unable to attend in person.  At present, victims of crime in Ireland are not entitled to a photograph of an offender nor are they able to attend or watch a parole hearing online.  The Victims Rights Alliance, VRA, is cognisant that the rights of the accused must be balanced with the rights of an offender.  However, at least where there is a risk of re-victimisation or intimidation, a victim should be offered the opportunity to have sight of a picture of an offender prior to his or her release from prison.  Furthermore, should a victim wish to attend a parole hearing he or she should be given the opportunity to do so or given the opportunity to hear a playback of the parole hearing or both.  In June 2016, Correctional Service of Canada and the Parole Board of Canada launched an online victims portal whereby victims of crime could receive and view appropriate information about the offender, view and manage preferences for receiving information and submit a victim statement to Correctional Service Canada and the Parole Board of Canada.  In addition, they could request to observe a parole hearing, request to present a victim statement at a parole hearing and request a copy of the parole decision.  It might be worth considering running a similar pilot programme in Ireland.<br/><br/>Like the Irish Penal Reform Trust, the VRA believes that the parole process is in need of reform.  The independence of the parole board is essential to ensure that justice is adhered to, not only for the victim of crime but also for the offender.  The author is aware of one instance where a parole board member referred to a victim who sought revenge on an offender.  This example is mentioned to illustrate the issue of bias and the importance of an objective parole board.  It is respectfully submitted that legislation relating to the make-up of a parole board should be cognisant of Article 1 of the victims' directive, such that &quot;Member States shall ensure that victims are recognised and treated in a respectful, sensitive, tailored, professional and non-discriminatory manner, in all contacts with victim support or restorative justice services or a competent authority, operating within the context of criminal proceedings.&quot;  The Irish Parole Board may be deemed to be a competent authority for the purpose of this legislation.<br/><br/>Article 25 of the victims' directive provides that &quot;officials likely to come into contact with victims&quot; should get both specialist and general training appropriate to their level of contact with the victims of crime so as to &quot;enable them to deal with victims in an impartial, respectful and professional manner&quot;.  Having due regard to the independence of the legal profession the victims' directive recommends that training be made available to &quot;increase the awareness of judges and prosecutors of the needs of victims&quot;.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties, in conjunction with The Bar Council of Ireland and the Law Society of Ireland with financial support from the Justice Programme of the European Union, are developing a training programme for lawyers on the victims' directive.<br/><br/>The VRA is cognisant of the independence of the Judiciary.  However, I draw the committee's attention to a Private Members' Bill in Canada, namely, an Act to amend the Judges Act and the Criminal Code (sexual assault), which was introduced in Canada last Thursday, 23 February.  The Bill appears to have general support in Canada.  In summary:</p><blockquote>This enactment amends the Judges Act to restrict eligibility for judicial appointment to individuals who have completed comprehensive sexual assault education.  It also requires the Canadian Judicial Council to report on continuing education seminars in matters related to sexual assault law.  Furthermore, it amends the Criminal Code to require a court to provide written reasons in sexual assault decisions.</blockquote><p>On Monday I spoke with Judge Hinkle and Anna Evans of the Massachusetts Trial Court, who developed and implemented training specific to domestic violence in the Massachusetts Trial Court.  The training has been effective and well received by employees across Massachusetts who work within the courts.  The Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Trial Court has made it compulsory for all judges to participate in the training programme, including court officers, facilitation offers and some lawyers, such as guardians <i>ad litem</i>.  Training is essential to ensure that victims of crime get access to their rights under the victims' directive.  Persons working with victims of crime within the sentence, restorative justice and parole process should receive appropriate training.<br/><br/>I thank the committee for giving the opportunity to speak here today.  I hope that my presentation was not too lengthy.  I hope that we will have an opportunity to speak more generally on the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill 2016.  I thank the members for their time. </p></speech>

Historically, victims were very much peripheral to if not ignored by our criminal justice system.  I think everyone here welcomes the fact that in recent years victims have become more central to the criminal justice process.  This will be more apparent this evening when the D&aacute;il debates the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill, which, in general, we support.  I commend Ms McDonald.  It is important that there are groups which take into account the interests of victims because interest groups have an impact in altering legislation.</p> <p>  One of the questions I wish to ask concerns the area of penal reform, which is an issue we are considering.  It is not fair that people sometimes put penal reform groups on one side and victims' groups on the other.  What are Ms McDonald's views on the effectiveness of prison and the extent to which it should be used as a punishment?  She spoke about restorative justice.  Can she give us examples of the type of restorative justice she thinks would be effective in meeting the demands of victims while, at the same time, rehabilitating the offender?  Rehabilitation of the offender is one of the functions any legislation in this area must have.  My third question concerns parole.  I do not know whether Ms McDonald is aware of the Parole Bill.  If she is, what are her general views on it?  I ask her to deal with these three issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-01a.130" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria McDonald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017030100002#D00300"><p>Regarding the effectiveness of prisons, I am in a difficulty in that, as I mentioned at the start, all our members would have different views on the use of prisons.  For example, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties would have a very different view to Advocates for Victims of Homicide.  I will speak about the matter in the context of fines, which I think were discussed with the Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT.  Some members may be familiar with a Bill published by the former Minister, Mr. Alan Shatter, namely, the criminal justice (community sanctions) Bill.  The Bill concerned fines and the amending of the manner by which they are carried out.  Mr. Shatter indicated that he wished to set up a specific fund through which fines would be paid out to victim support services.  I see it in this context: if one is looking not to put somebody in prison and fining them instead, cognisance should be taken of the victims' issues.  If those moneys were then put into victim support services to facilitate counselling or support services for victims of crime, the Victims' Rights Alliance would see this as very beneficial.  In addition, it may be a means whereby it would be more appropriate that the individual not then be in prison; rather, that he or she is contributing back to the community through the money he or she is affording to those circumstances.<br/><br/>Regarding the demand for restorative justice, victims and the benefit they are seeing in this respect, as the committee already knows, the Probation Service runs a programme for offenders.  Victims have the option to benefit in that they are asked whether they want to participate in the programme.  It is up to the individual victim.  Much work and research is being carried out on victims of sexual abuse engaging within the restorative justice process.  Some of our members would have very different views on this.  For example, some of them think it would not be appropriate in particular circumstances, but it is very obvious that it is up to the individual victim whether to engage in the process.  Some research indicates that some victims of sexual abuse, particularly within family circumstances, have found the programme beneficial.  Again, it is up to the individual as to whether he or she engages with it.  I can give the committee an example of a case in which it would be inappropriate to request a victim to engage with the restorative justice process.  I refer to a case reported in 2014 in <i>The Irish Times</i>in which a judge requested that a victim at a sentencing hearing consider engaging in restorative justice after a very lengthy trial process during which the accused, who had sexually abused the victim as a child, had not accepted any of the facts of the case.  Furthermore, the accused still did not accept the facts even after having been found guilty.  The judge asked at the sentencing hearing whether the victim would like to engage in restorative justice.  This obviously puts a victim on the spot.  He or she will not be familiar with the information and it would not be appropriate in such circumstances for him or her to engage with the programme.  I am familiar with restorative justice processes that have occurred in the midlands regarding the Travelling community whereby, as some members would be aware, there can sometimes be feuding and other issues between families.  One day someone is a victim of crime and another day that person is an offender.  In that context, the programme was incredibly successful in the midlands community, and the cases which came before the courts significantly reduced as a result of that restorative justice programme.  However, funding for the programme was subsequently cut and the cases started to come back before the courts again.  Fewer victims were involved as a result of the restorative justice process, so it can be incredibly beneficial.<br/><br/>Regarding the parole process, I have had sight of the Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill and the Sentencing Council Bill 2017.  The one thing I would note from the Parole Bill 2016 is that victims are kind of absent from it.  I understand that a very objective board is needed but, at the same time, I note that the Sentencing Council Bill 2017 makes reference to individuals who have knowledge regarding the welfare of victims of crime.  The welfare of the victims of crime can be very different to somebody who is working with a victim support organisation because, in the latter context, somebody could be potentially objective.<br/><br/>Regarding training, it is very important the Judiciary is involved in any parole process, but I believe any laypersons- for want of a better word - involved should undertake appropriate training to understand the difficulties and trauma experienced by a sexual abuse victim, for example.  Based on the victims' directive, they are actually required to engage in such training anyway - for example, if writing written statements to the Parole Board.  The example I gave was a Parole Board member using the word &quot;revenge&quot;, I think because the individual did not understand the trauma these victims go through and the reasons they put certain information in victim statements.  If they have greater understanding of this trauma and are given training in victims' rights, needs and interests, a Parole Board member would be, as I said, much more able to deal with the matter as appropriate.</p></speech>

I have a few questions.  She highlighted in her statement restorative justice and the fact that it has been excluded from many of the draft proposals from the Minister's office.  Does she feel the victims directive is not being transposed fully and properly in this draft Bill?  If not, why not?  Has she had engagements with the Department of Justice and Equality as to why it has not provided a more wholesome Bill?  She mentioned Canada.  Can she provide other comparative examples of countries that have done this properly and transposed it effectively?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-01a.143" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria McDonald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017030100002#D01600"><p>The Bill is very good in dealing with a significant number of issues under the victims' directive, but there are some major omissions, which I mentioned.  For example, it is an obligation under the victims directive to facilitate the referral of victims to victim support services by the body that receives a complaint from the victim.  On our end, this would be the Garda.  The directive uses the word "shall": it states that the Garda shall facilitate the referral to victims of crime.  Currently, the Bill states that a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission may refer a victim where he or she consents.</p><p>The difficulty is that a victim could consent to being referred but, due to this discretion, a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would still not refer the victim.  There are obviously serious implications for the victim because it could cause re-victimisation in that context.  The victim is not being provided with that support and they do not understand why they are not getting that support.  There is a positive obligation for the Garda to facilitate referral for all victims of crime.  In that context, that section is incorrect and should be amended.  In my view, it does not comply with the directive.<br/><br/>From my understanding, the reason the restorative justice aspect is not included in the Bill is because there is no statutory scheme for restorative justice.  However, victims are involved informally in such processes, although they are offender-led.  If a victim is engaging in such a process, or, in the example I gave the committee earlier of a judge requiring or requesting that a victim engage in such a process, then in those circumstances the safeguards should be put in place in legislation to ensure that a victim is not re-victimised.  That is the reason for that process.<br/><br/>Another issue with the Bill is that all victims of crime must have an independent assessment by the Garda to ascertain whether they have special protection needs and, as such, this relates to the type, nature and circumstances of the crime.  For example, factors which would need to be considered in that individual assessment include whether it is a hate crime.  The personal circumstances of he individual involved, whether he or she has a disability, for example, must also be considered.  Currently, the manner by which the legislation is drafted limits the individual assessment to consider particular types of motives.  It should be open-ended rather than limited.  For example, I know, thankfully, matters will change today but Travellers were not included in the definition of ethnicity.  Accordingly, Travellers would not be entitled to the special protections under the Bill, if they were, for example, subject to a hate crime.  I know things are changing today - thank God - but that is an example where issues may arise in the future.  It needs to be open-ended to ensure all victims get those special protection needs.<br/><br/>It is all very well having legislation but unless one has a means to ensure victims&rsquo; rights are protected, it will fall by the wayside.  Victims, as we all know, have great difficulties with having an appropriate complaints process available to them.  From our research, we find that they are afraid to make a complaint to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na because it might affect their case.  When they do go to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, they also find it might affect or they believe it has affected their case.  The process by which GSOC goes through a complaint can take two years or more.  Victims feel they do not get what they need out of that process.  Under the directive, if one is getting information or support services, all one wants is that information to be given straight away.  We suggest a simple and clear complaints process for victims to ensure if they do not get information when they reach their trial date, they will get it as soon as possible.<br/><br/>For the past several years, we have been advocating for a federal ombudsman for victims of crime, which would be keeping in line with the Canadian approach and the recital to the directive, which would be a preamble, for example, to the directive.  It would suggest the establishment of one-stop shops for victims of crime.  If there is a complaint, an ombudsman&rsquo;s office would be able to deal with it in a swift way.  I have been in contact over the past several years with all the ombudsman offices, including GSOC and the Ombudsman for Children.  Within their current format, there is nothing preventing them from actually identifying a victims&rsquo; ombudsman within their offices without establishing a new office <i>per se</i>.  Obviously, there will be procedural issues around that but, from a monetary perspective, one would not be establishing a new office.<br/><br/>On the Deputy's second question on the parole process in other jurisdictions, Canada would be the one with which I would work most closely and would recommend its use.  For example, as I mentioned in my opening statement, being able to pick and choose what information one receives, to be able to view a parole hearing online might be basic, but at the same time, they reduce the re-victimisation of the victim while also providing them with appropriate information.  It is a similar approach in the United States where information is provided, one can either opt in or opt out and one can view parole hearings or attend them.<br/><br/>In Canada, there is a victim surcharge.  For example, if an offender commits a crime, then he or she would have to pay a victim surcharge as opposed to a fine.  Those moneys will go directly to pay for the ombudsman's office or victim support organisations, for example.  In 1984, America implemented the Victims of Crime Act which, similarly, has a victim fund where moneys are paid directly to victim support organisations.<br/><br/>The criminal justice (community sanctions) Bill 2014, envisaged by the former minister, Alan Shatter, indicated the moneys would go to the Department of Justice and Equality.  I am of the view that any victims&rsquo; moneys should go to an independent source.  The reason I say that is because currently the commission for victims of crime does not exist anymore.  If one looked at the Department website, it would lead one to believe there is an independent body currently assessing moneys that go to victims of crime.  However, all moneys are distributed by the Department of Justice and Equality&rsquo;s victims of crime office.  Transparency is incredibly important to ensure moneys are given to victim support organisations.  We all know of incidents and difficulties which have arisen with charities recently.  We all want to ensure that those moneys are given in a transparent way and that victims know how and when they are going get it.  I am not in any way criticising the Department of Justice and Equality&rsquo;s victims of crime office.  It does a great job.  However, victims believe that the commission for victims of crime still exists when it actually does not.  If there was to be a victim surcharge, I would recommend it would go to an independent source such as a commission or an ombudsman's office rather than going directly to the Department of Justice and Equality.  As we all know, sometimes means change in Departments.</p></speech>

In fairness to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, in recent years she has increased the funding for victim support organisations annually.  I do not remember the exact figures but one is looking at an increase of approximately &euro;5,000 for each organisation.  Although she has substantially increased it by 20%, in reality it is little money for the victim support organisations.</p> <p>  The victims directive under article 8 indicates victims are required, legally, to victim support services free of charge before, during and after the criminal justice process.  The difficulty arises with how we have a fragmented victim support system, unlike the UK which has one organisation, Victim Support UK.  Here it is not Government-led but NGO-led.  While that is a positive point, it also means that they are relying significantly on Government moneys to provide services.  When they are under-resourced, it means the victims cannot necessarily access them.</p></speech>

We are all going to be well-informed for the debate to take place over the next two days.  That is good because it is bringing in a new and fresher perspective on the legislation which will be important.  Then we can get it right when it comes back on Committee Stage.</p> <p>  We are in a little bit of an unusual situation in that the committee is discussing this Bill in the context of penal reform.  Rather than the supports necessary for individual victims, we are looking at what society does with offenders in order to reduce both recidivism and the number of victims by grappling with the issues of crime.  In that context, the point about the absence of restorative justice is important.  I know it is emotionally difficult and Ms McDonald made the point very well for it to be individually tailored to whatever situation, as well as it being voluntary.  If we can get into that process, its success rates are phenomenal in reducing levels of reoffending.</p><p>While I think it was mentioned, it should be really spelled out that there are services in Ireland for restorative justice and a legal obligation under the directive to inform people of them.  However, that is not being done.  It is certainly not being provided for in the legislation and it is not even being done going forward.  It is incredibly poor if it is the case, not just in terms of recidivism but because victims are empowered if they can confront the person who committed a crime against them.  They can deal with those issues and get some of their confidence back.  It is incredibly powerful and often has a dramatic effect on the person who committed the crime.  I am curious about that end of things.</p><p> The other thing we come across is people being re-victimised by the system, which was also mentioned.  When all of the Garda controversy started, we were inundated with cases from people all over the country who had been the victims of serious crimes like the murder of loved ones and other horrendous crimes.  At their weakest point, they turned to the State for assistance and were actually re-victimised because in some instances either garda&iacute; were involved in the original crime or the offender was in with garda&iacute;.  They then became the victims of a whole pile of unnecessary and unwarranted attention and harassment.  Those cases resulted in the unfortunate independent review mechanism and not much justice.  That links in with the current lack of State support.  How does one stop those who are in the system from reoffending the victim?  I am probably not explaining myself very well because I have the flu.</p></speech>

On the provision of information, she pointed out correctly that they are legally required to provide information on the available restorative justice services.  That is the actual wording used within the directive.  The Garda leaflet which is currently made available to victims of crime refers to the restorative justice services available under the Children Act.  They are the provisions I mentioned in my opening statement.  However, as the Deputy rightly pointed out, Le Ch&eacute;ile, the Probation Service and a significant number of other services are also available to victims of crime.  Therefore, the Garda is currently not compliant in not providing that information.  It does not necessarily have to be in the leaflet <i>per se</i>but it must be accessible somewhere - for example, online.  The difficulty that arises based on the fact that it has now been removed from the Bill is that the Garda may now amend its leaflet to not inform victims about any restorative justice services whatsoever.  As the Deputy indicated, that would prevent victims and offenders from benefitting from the significant progress which can be made as a result of restorative justice and the rehabilitation which can result.<br/><br/>I spoke with a victim of crime who had engaged in a restorative justice process where a family member had died and she indicated that the process was remarkable in the benefit she got from it.  She was able to understand what had happened to her child.  The family wanted to know how the child died.  She also became close to the offender who suddenly understood what the impact of that crime had been on the family.  They are in regular contact.  While that does not happen in all situations, if people feel they can engage in that process, rehabilitation may occur and hopefully that individual will not come back into the prison system again.  The difficulty that arises in relation to the right to information more generally is that even though there is a Garda leaflet, many victims do not even know it exists.  It is not very easy to find.  Garda&iacute; are not necessarily giving victims the leaflet.  They may have to go online to find it.  It would be even more difficult for them to find out about the available restorative justice services.<br/><br/>Re-victimisation within the criminal justice process is obviously a major issue and training is key, including within the parole and sentencing process.  Also, there must be appropriate supports in place, for example, if a victim comes in during the sentencing process.  It is often forgotten that a significant number of sentences are appealed.  The victim has to go through the trauma of an appeal against conviction or sentence not knowing what is going to happen.  The supports may not be there which were originally in place.  One must ensure that they are very well informed.  I have come across a significant number of cases where victims were informed at the last minute that a sentencing appeal was coming up, which can cause a massive level of trauma.  Adjournments should be made to facilitate the informing of victims.<br/><br/>In the context of re-victimisation and the offender, training within the prison system to give offenders the opportunity to understand their behaviour facilitates rehabilitation.  It is not always possible to involve a victim in that process, but if programmes could be established within the prison system to look at that, it would be very positive from a rehabilitation perspective and reduce in the long term the re-victimisation of victims of crime.  I hope that answers the questions.</p></speech>

The first relates to information and victims of crime being able to access it.  One of the issues there is not only relates not only to victims but also to garda&iacute;.  The latter have an obligation to provide the information.  I question whether many members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have that information to pass on.  Is there any central database or list of all restorative programmes in the State?  If a garda does not have the information, he or she cannot pass it on.  Does the Victims Rights Alliance know whether there is an aspect of Garda training that addresses this?  Is there any obligation on chief superintendents in charge of divisions to ensure that the officers under their command have this information?  Exactly what is the process to ensure that garda&iacute; have the information to be able to pass it on to victims?</p> <p>  The other issue is the sentencing process.  I have always been very critical of the way judges have no obligation to engage in continuing professional development.  As such, there is no ongoing training for judges.  One becomes a judge and one can remain in the position for however long one wants, with no obligation to engage in any training whatsoever.  The Canadian model was referred to by Ms McDonald.  Does it involve mandatory training?  Ms McDonald said a judge made it mandatory for people within his courthouse, but is it mandated by the state in Canada?  Are there models in which there is mandatory training for judges, in particular in relation to sex crimes, domestic violence, and homicide?  If that was an aspect of the Judiciary, how would it help victims of crime?</p> <p>  I acknowledge that there are various omissions in the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill.  Hopefully, we can address those on Committee Stage.  The one that has really stuck out for me is restorative justice.  It sticks out because the Department included it in the general scheme of the Bill and as such recognised that restorative justice was a critical part of transposing the victims' directive into Irish law.  Yet, it is missing from the published Bill.  Ms McDonald said it may be because there is no statutory scheme.  That may be the case, but has the IVRA received any information as to why that was pulled from the publication of the Bill having been included in the general scheme?  My understanding is that it is not just that there is no statutory scheme, but also that there is no legal definition in law of what a restorative justice programme is meant to look like.</p></speech>

Those offices should have basic information available, for example, the support services that are available, the details in regard to restorative justice and how victims can get expenses, given some victims cannot even afford to go to court.  From my experience, it depends on the divisional area the person is dealing with.  Several cases have come to my attention recently where certain more serious crimes have been treated differently to other crimes which are deemed more minor.  For example, four cases have come to my attention in the last few weeks in regard to hit-and-run incidents - not fatal accidents, but where cars were run off the road.  None of those individuals received information in regard to appropriate support services or the information which is legally required to be provided under the victims' directive.</p> <p>  Obviously, resources are a major issue for the police, although I am not in any way criticising the police.  At the same time, the directive is very clear that once a person is a victim of crime, and it does not matter what type of crime it is, the person is entitled to receive that information and the Garda cannot pick and choose which victims get it and which do not.  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien has highlighted a very important issue.  There certainly needs to be streamlining to ensure it is clear to all garda&iacute; what information needs to be given.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned training.  Training in regard to victims' rights is provided to new recruits in Templemore.  As I understand it, empathy has now been included in that process, and if a trainee garda does not show empathy or is not engaging with the victim appropriately, that trainee will have to repeat the exams, which is a very positive development.  The difficulty which arises is for individuals who are already within the current process as to whether appropriate training has been given.  I have been told training programmes are available to current staff members but the issue is that I do not know at what level the training is provided or what the uptake is.  It is something that needs to be looked at.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether the Canadian model was mandatory.  The Bill which went before the Canadian Parliament last week would make it mandatory for all of the Judiciary to engage in that process, which would be very significant.  I would have to do further research to know whether it is mandatory in other jurisdictions.  Obviously, given the independence of the Judiciary, it is something which would usually be judicial-led.  For example, the example I gave of Judge Hinkle's incredible work in Massachusetts was judicial-led and we are working with all of the different groups and parties within that jurisdiction.</p> <p>  With regard to the benefit, Judge Hinkle provided evidence that highlighted the significant benefit that has been seen in Massachusetts through using scientific evidence in regard to trauma for victims of crime and the training of judges in that regard.  The example I was given was that judges there are now informed of the triggers which need to be watched for in domestic abuse and sexual abuse cases, for example, triggers that might indicate a potential suicide or that the victim is in danger.  These are not necessarily obvious and, as I understand it, this has made a massive difference in terms of the understanding of the process from a judicial perspective.</p> <p>  The committee will be aware that, very often, victims of crime and of domestic abuse may have a protection order but they then breach that protection order themselves.  As I understand it, the judges there had a better understanding of why that was happening.  It can be a very frustrating for a judge who is trying to give those orders when the victim is continually breaching them rather than the offender.  To understand why that is happening can be very beneficial for the understanding of the judge in that process.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked why restorative justice was being pulled, in effect.  I would point out it was not originally intended to be in the scheme.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality worked very closely with the Victims Rights Alliance and other organisations.  We had highlighted the need for it to be included and that is why it was subsequently included in the scheme of the Bill.  It will be noticed there are other things in the scheme that did not subsequently come into the Bill.  As I understand it, this may be with the Attorney General and she may be currently considering the matter.  Again, there is no restorative justice legal process in Ireland and there may be concerns in regard to whether it forms part of the criminal justice process, which I submit would fall within the definition of the victims' directive.  The Deputy mentioned there is no definition of restorative justice but the victims' directive does provide a definition of restorative justice and that has direct effect.  Legally, therefore, the definition of restorative justice in Ireland is the same as the victims' directive in the context that is currently used.  Ireland must have regard to that, regardless of whether it has legislation in place.</p></speech>

In any case, I was talking to somebody who is involved in training the Judiciary in England, where there is ongoing training.  One of the scenarios that was put to a number of judges was a domestic violence scenario, and it was amazing how different the judges' interpretation of the evidence put forward was to that in the victim impact statements.  There was no cohesion or unity in terms of the sentencing of the offender.  In some cases, the judges took into account the victim impact statements and in other cases, they were not taken into account as much.</p> <p>  That is where the training needs to come in.  It should not matter what courthouse one goes into.  If the same evidence is presented in Dublin, Cork or Limerick, the same process should be available for victims and the same information should be given.  I believe the members of the Judiciary are not aware and some of them are there way too long, to be honest.</p></speech>

One of the biggest issues is that there is no obligation on them to engage in any training whatsoever.  There is no way of removing them either, which is the big problem.  Members of the Judiciary cannot be forced to engage in training and - I know we are in public session - where there are judges who make absolutely mind-boggling decisions that no one understands, and they do that consistently, there is no way or removing them.  As long as we have a situation where judges like that remain in place, then victims will always be failed.  That is my honest belief.</p></speech>

I have spoken with some judges.  The victims' directive is on their agenda and they have been provided with training in regard to certain aspects.  I am aware of that, although there is only so much I can say.  I am very hopeful because, having been before the courts, I have seen how a significant number of judges are using the victims' directive and are cognisant of the victims' directive, notwithstanding the fact the legislation is not yet in place.  It is very difficult for them.  For example, the victims' directive requires that a victim would not be cross-examined about his or her private life not related to the criminal offence, where he or she has special protection needs.  That is massive; it is a mind change.  The only way a person can be cross-examined now is if it is due to the person's prior sexual history.  Judges have been aware of that and they have been managing it.</p> <p>  I understand the Deputy's position and the issues.  I understand the new judicial council Bill will facilitate some of those changes.  It might be appropriate to look at the Canadian Bill that is being put forward to see whether something could be written into the judicial council Bill in regard to the reporting of the sexual abuse training that is being provided or the training on certain other issues.  That does not require the members of the Judiciary to do it and still allows for their independence, but it does provide transparency and accountability as to what training has been done, and it makes the public aware it has been done in that context.</p><p>I thank the witness for her presentation.  There is so much involved in this whole area and it is so complex.  It is not going to be easy to make things better quickly.  It is probably going to require a cultural change in a lot of areas.  To pick up on the points made by Deputy Jonathan O'Brien regarding education, legislation is grand but it is pointless and meaningless unless it is implemented.  The Garda Inspectorate, for example, has completed three reports since 2013 but how many of its recommendations have been implemented?</p><p> In terms of the last report, which was on Garda reform, the garda charged with overseeing implementation of the reform programme in Phoenix Park is actually more a part of the problem than the solution.  Deputy O'Brien spoke about training for judges but there should also be more ongoing training for garda&iacute; and that training should be done by civilians rather than by in-house staff.  To the best of my knowledge, it takes about four times longer to qualify as a hairdresser than as a garda.  That has to be an issue.  Even in football, League of Ireland managers who have all of the qualification badges must go on refresher courses or they lose their licences.  We should apply that to other areas.</p><p> We have been talking about reducing recidivism which will, invariably, reduce the number of victims of crime.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be involved in a big way in that and even with the best will in the world, they will need more resources if we are to see a new approach.  They are underresourced and are hard pressed to do their job as it is.  Without resources, a lot of what we are talking about is pie in the sky, in terms of them getting involved in a whole lot of other areas that would be very positive.  The State will have to recognise that more resources will be needed; otherwise we are just talking to the sky.</p><p> At the start of her presentation Ms McDonald spoke about the validity of using prison for certain things.  I am strongly of the opinion that about 90% of the people in prison should not even be in there.  Avoiding prison by paying fines is all very well for those who can afford it but it amplifies the divisions in society in the sense that it is not a big problem for those who are not short of money, but it is a huge problem for those who are short.  Paying a fine rather than going to prison is a punishment for the less well-off but not for the well-off.</p><p> This committee has discussed the fact that fining people who are poor in order to keep them out of prison is definitely a punishment but those who are well-off should be made to do community service rather than being able to buy their way out of their problems.  In terms of stopping such people from re-offending, the fact that they can just write a cheque every time they get into trouble means that there is no incentive for them to change their ways.  If they are made to do community service, however, they will think twice because a lot of them would find that demeaning, despite the fact that it would be very educational for them and might bring them down to earth a bit.  Coming up with schemes to keep people out of prison has to be a good thing because putting people in prison is doing nothing to reduce recidivism and in that sense, is doing nothing for victims.  </p><p> The sentiment of so much of what Ms McDonald has said is very good.  Does she think that the State is prepared to put its money where its mouth is and provide the resources that are needed in order to make all of this happen?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-01a.165" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria McDonald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017030100002#H00300"><p>Yes, he is going to get me into trouble although I make trouble for myself sometimes too.  Deputy Wallace made three points, the first of which relates to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and training.  I completely concur with the Deputy.  Training must be provided for current staff members, not just for recruits coming out of Templemore, and appropriate resources must be made available to provide that training.  I would like to see more victim support organisations involved in providing trauma training to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na so that they can better understand why victims of crime are sometimes not in a position to give evidence, to produce a victim impact statement or why they may do things that seem inappropriate, for example.  Trauma training is very important in that context.</p> <p>  The second point related to fines.  As I said already, I have to be quite careful about what I say here, given that our member organisations have different views on the prison service.  That said, I personally have seen instances within the courts process where compensation has been required to be paid and the individual concerned was able to pay it but another individual would probably have gone to prison in those circumstances.  In that sense, an individual's resources can determine whether he or she goes to jail in certain circumstances.  If a fine is imposed, I would recommend that a victim surcharge or some form of compensation should be established in order to at least give money back to the community.  </p> <p>  The Deputy also raised the issue of community service which is very effective.  I have seen it work well.  From the perspective of a defence lawyer, I have seen the benefits of community service.  Certainly, it is a means of keeping people out of prison but it can also be of significant benefit to society as a whole, depending on the work undertaken.  It is very helpful in certain circumstances.</p> <p>  As to whether the State is prepared to provide funding for victim support, there has been an increase in such funding in recent years.  However, I am afraid that millions of euro need to be provided in this area and I do not say that lightly.  We are not just talking here about victim support organisations being adequately funded, but also An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The latter has seen a significant increase in resources in recent times, particularly for information and communications technology.  Victims now engage with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na via information and communications technology and I know that the website is being changed at the moment.  Money is all very well, but there must also be a willingness to change.  I have been indicating for some time that changes need to be made to the Garda website for victims of crime.  For example, if one clicks the information on support services tab, one sees a link to the Commission for Victims of Crime which does not exist anymore.  I know that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is updating its website and I welcome that but we cannot wait forever for the changes to be made.  The victim support information should be updated now.  We should not have to wait for those resources to be made available.  Victims should be able to access that information online.</p> <p>  I have also been advocating for a long time a system that has been rolled out in the UK and in various formats in other jurisdictions, namely, a track-my-crime facility.  Victims can log in securely and access details of their case.  They are provided with a response to their queries within 24 hours.  Information is also translated for those who do not speak English.  This also means that there is a written record because often victims will say that they telephoned five or six times but no-one called them back.  The e-mail format means that victims can receive the information they request.  A pilot scheme was run in the UK and while there were some initial teething problems, the system has now been rolled out nationwide.  In the long run, from a resource perspective, providing victims with information, support, protection and in some cases counselling, will reduce the costs to the State.  In terms of hospitalisation, inquiries, complaints to GSOC and what is required and so forth, if victims are given the information they need straight away and resources are made available, that will facilitate a much better process for victims of crime and reduce costs for the State in the long run. </p></speech>

The traffic was very bad.  I thank Ms McDonald for her presentation.  I have a few queries around the training of judges, garda&iacute; and the area of addiction.  We know that for a lot of those people in prison who are perpetrators of crime, addiction is very much involved.  I do not know what the statistics are on how many people are in prison because addiction has brought them there but I imagine it is quite a high figure.  Does Ms McDonald believe it to be a good idea for the police, judges and members of the Irish Prison Service to be trained in understanding the disorder of addiction?  When somebody who is in addiction presents at court having committed a crime, judges could look at the possibility of giving them the option of a referral to an addiction treatment centre.  Would that be one way forward?  Many people in such cases are in addiction, albeit not all of them obviously.  Instead of asking them to pay a fine or giving them community service, could this be an option? I agree with Deputy Wallace that it is a huge cultural change.  It is important to implement all of the reports that have already been produced.  Great work has been done on reports but there has been very little implementation.  My question is on the disorder of addiction and how it can be addressed when it comes to crime.</p></speech>

I will answer the second part of the question first about offering offenders rehabilitation in order to seek help.  That happens currently, in an indirect manner.  The victim always must consent to that process.  Offenders may decide they want to seek help, they may contact Cuan Mhuire, which may set up a place and the judge might give such offenders the opportunity to engage in that process.  Potentially, in those circumstances they may give a suspended sentence, depending on what comes out of it.  It is generally up to the offender to engage in that process themselves.  From a victim's perspective, rehabilitation is very important because addiction is a spiralling issue, where a person is going to come back before the courts again and again.  If the addiction can be resolved then the chances of re-offending are very likely to fall.  It would therefore be very positive from the victim's perspective.  How one actually strategically does that is a difficulty because as I have said, it is sometimes quite difficult to get in to those rehabilitation processes.  Unless there is a clear process available to the judge as to what they can and cannot do in those cases, and unless the offender is aware of them, then it can cause difficulties.</p> <p>  On the issue of training, I completely concur that training should be provided on addiction issues.  It would be of benefit to the offender and the victim of crime.  I was involved in a case involving gambling addiction and the judge understood that concept so the offender got help and support, whereas another judge may not have understood the concept of gambling addiction and a very different result may have happened for that offender as a result.  It is important that judges understand addiction.  Very often somebody comes before the courts again and again, so the judge would very often like to have an option to refer that individual to get support services if possible.</p></speech>

It is very hard for an offender when they are in that addiction process to know about the services or to consider their options.  They must be told about them.  Arguably, the judge could have a role to indicate this, to ask the offender if it is something they have considered and suggest they talk to their solicitor about it.  With training, solicitors and barristers would also need to be aware of the appropriate services and the local services, not just the Judiciary.</p></speech>

In Ms McDonald's opening remarks, she indicated that were the Bill not amended, the State could find itself facing infringement proceedings by the European Commission on foot of its failure to properly transpose the directive into Irish law.  The deadline for that is more than 12 months past.  Have any infringement proceedings been taken against any errant member state?  What is the current status?  We have looked at some of the international realities but let us take a little snapshot of the situation of the member states.  More than 12 months beyond the deadline, how out of kilter are we with other member states in this regard and do we know if the European Commission has applied any pressure across the member states who have not complied as required?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-01a.171" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria McDonald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017030100002#J00600"><p>The story there is that infringement proceedings have issued against Ireland and 11 other member states, as of December 2016, for a failure to communicate in respect of the victims' directive.  That is different to infringement proceedings for not implementing the directive.  It is because they have not informed the Commission whatsoever what they are doing.  I understand that while Ireland is still outstanding on this issue, a significant number of those member states have now provided communication.  Even if they did not communicate it, they actually have legislation in place within their own jurisdictions so they are complying.  Even though 11 states seems a lot, it is actually a lot lower, and Ireland is probably one of only a few countries that remain outstanding in not having in place some form of legislation.  Just because other member states have legislation in place does not mean the legislation is very good and it does not mean that victims are getting their rights in practice; it just means those countries have put it within the criminal justice system.  Once this Bill has passed, Ireland would then communicate on the law because it cannot communicate it until that happens.  From speaking with my contacts within the European Commission, restorative justice is a major issue and although I cannot speak for the Commission, based on the victims' directive, it would deem that the absence of the directive in Irish law is obvious and may result in infringement proceedings.</p> <p>  There is another issue around the definition of a victim of crime.  The victims' directive includes indirect victims of crime.  This would include a child who had witnessed domestic abuse.  This may be an oversimplification of it but it gives an example.  This is not currently covered within the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill 2016 and the Commission may also be concerned about this if the Bill is implemented in its current format.  Regardless of whether one reports a crime, a person is entitled to support services and information.  Indirect victims such as children are also entitled to that right to information and support services.  If they do not fall within that definition then it could cause difficulties at a later date.</p></speech>

I cannot fully answer the Chairman's question but a significant number of the countries have.  I know that with Brexit it may not be the best example but the UK has a victims' code in place.  The UK had this in place even in advance of the victims' directive coming into force.  The code does not, however, have legal force.</p><p>The issue which arises, while they have complied with the directive, is whether victims are going to be able to access those rights in reality if it does not have legal force.  In those circumstances, does it really comply with the victims' directive?</p></speech>

I hope everyone is keeping well.  I welcome to the meeting the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring, Ms Katherine Licken, Mr. John McDonough, director of the National Archives, Ms Sharon Barry, assistant principal officer, and Mr. Tadhg O'Shea, higher executive officer, in the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  T&aacute; f&aacute;ilte romhaibh go l&eacute;ir.</p><p>I draw witnesses' attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Any opening statement or other document submitted to the committee may be published on its website after the meeting.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I call the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, to address the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-01a.184" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22017030100002#F00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to address it today on the National Archives (Amendment) Bill.  I just want to say that we have been here since 2.15 p.m. and it is planned that we will leave around 4.30 p.m.  That was the anticipated time as I believe other officials will come in at that stage.</p> <p>  This proposed legislation will provide the flexibility for certain Departments to transfer records to the National Archives for public release after 20 years rather than the current 30 years.</p> <p>  As the committee may be aware, the British and Northern Irish Archives have moved to a 20 year rule for the transfer of records to the British Archives and the Public Records Office of Northern Ireland, PRONI.  However, in Ireland, the statutory period for transfer of departmental records remains at 30 years.</p> <p>  The Government recognises the importance of synchronising the release of certain records between Ireland and the United Kingdom, particularly in regard to those records relating to Northern Ireland and Anglo-Irish issues.</p> <p>  The proposed legislation will allow for the early release of records if the relevant Minister and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs are satisfied that it is warranted by virtue of the historical or public interest value of the records or to facilitate fair reporting of matters of common interest to the State and other jurisdictions.</p> <p>  I am conscious of the fact the proposals will have resource implications for Departments which would have to be managed within existing budgetary allocations.</p><p>For this reason, the change will be implemented on a phased basis, starting with Departments and offices that have holdings with significant numbers of Anglo-Irish and North-South records, namely, the Departments of the Taoiseach, Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Justice and Equality, and the Office of the Attorney General.  The intention is to move to a full 20-year rule for all Departments over time as resources permit.  That is not possible at present, however, due to the capacity constraints at the National Archives and the significant resources which would be required.  A phased implementation approach will assist in terms of the inevitable resource implications for Departments, while providing flexibility for the early release of records where appropriate.</p><p> I am aware that many Departments are not fully compliant with the current 30-year rule.  As part of the process of implementing the 20-year rule, I will write to all Departments to ascertain how many files that are over 30 years old are currently being stored by Departments, offices and the courts, and the cost of this storage.  Savings could be made across the entire system if the need for offsite storage were reduced.  I am also aware of the limited physical capacity which the National Archives has to store our archives.  I have allocated &euro;8 million to develop the National Archives in this regard.  In due course, I will make proposals to deal with the current backlog of records in Departments that are more than 30 years old.  The lack of a records management policy for digital records is also an issue.  I was pleased to be in a position to provide the National Archives with &euro;150,000 in 2016 and &euro;300,000 in 2017 to assist in the work on digital records and a public sector records management policy that is being undertaken by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in conjunction with the National Archives.  This policy aims to provide universal guidelines for the public sector on the management of born-digital material.  Crucially, it will scope out the requirements of the National Archives in starting to accept digital records from Departments and the task of making digital records available to the public.</p></speech>

She has said that "the proposed legislation will allow for the early release of records if the relevant Minister and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs are satisfied that it is warranted by virtue of the historical or public interest value" of those records.  Is that a new addition to the Bill?  Is it not covered by section 8(1) of the National Archives Act 1986?  Is the suggestion that these records should not be released unless the Minister is satisfied their release is warranted by their "historical or public interest value" a new provision?  I will explain my concern.  Who is anyone in government or in the State to say what is of "public interest value"?  I wonder whether this is a new addition to the Bill.  It would concern me if it is.</p> <p>  I am slightly concerned that allocations for the National Archives could not be increased to offer the resources needed in the context of this good move and this welcome Bill.  I have spoken separately to representatives of the National Library who have called on Members of the Oireachtas to provide for a digital deposit that would allow digital materials to be archived.  Will that form part of the copyright Bill that is due to come before the Oireachtas?</p> <p>  I ask the Minister to provide more details on the &euro;8 million that is to be spent on developing the National Archives.  Trinity College, UCD, the National Archives and the National Library, which has State responsibility for archiving, have argued that we need a greenfield site.  It strikes me that we need a long-term and future-proofed archive location that is well fitted-out.  This would ensure the bodies that are statutorily obliged to deal with archiving can do so and everyone can have easy access to the materials of the State.  I would like the Minister to respond to my questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-01a.188" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22017030100002#G00400"><p>The Senator has rightly pointed out that an addition is being made to the Bill.  I decided to make this change, after giving careful consideration to the move to a 20-year rule, because I am of the opinion that notwithstanding the significant resourcing issues involved, it is important to provide for the early release of records of significant historical or public interest value.  We are trying to provide for some flexibility in how material of significant value is made available.  In particular, we want to focus on material of North-South interest after 20 years.  The UK and Northern Ireland are releasing their material after 20 years.  We do not want to be left on the back foot.  We need to release similar material from our records so that the full picture is reflected.  That is why a new provision is to be included in the Bill.  We do not have the resources to change immediately from 30 years to 20 years.  This is a massive undertaking.  We want to deal specifically with the Departments and offices where most of these records are held, namely, the Departments of Justice and Equality, Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Taoiseach, and the Office of the Attorney General.  We are doing this to make sure we are not left behind in matching the material that is released in the UK after 20 years.</p> <p>  We have given a commitment to invest &euro;8 million to improve the storage facilities in the National Archives.  I understand the plan should be ready to go to tender towards the end of the year.  It is a big undertaking and it is important that we get it right.  It is a question of how a big warehouse at the back of the National Archives can be married into the existing building.  We need to maximise the space available at the archives.</p> <p>  Under the Creative Ireland plan, we have asked all the cultural institutions to come forward with their capital plans for the coming years.  We want them to reflect on what they need to do and to propose five-year plans for how we can support them as we go forward.  The wonderful renovation programme in the National Gallery is almost complete and will open to the public soon.  It has taken a number of years for this fabulous development to reach an end.  We are working with the cultural institutions by looking at their plans and ambitions in the context of the capital plan.</p></speech>

It is great that material will be released after 20 years rather than 30 years.  We seem to be reacting to Britain and the North in order to harmonise with them rather than doing this for the positive good.  Ideally, this would be done over a shorter period of time.  The Department should not be placing a value on certain records rather than others.  A 20-year timeframe should be the norm for all information coming out of the Department.</p></speech>

The Minister said she is "aware that many Departments are not fully compliant with the current 30-year rule".  We are moving to a 20-year rule now even though the law as it stands under the 30-year rule is not being implemented.</p><p>I understand the Department occasionally has been laggardly in getting its records in on time.  With various legislative measures passed by the Houses, enforcement is less than optimum.  The more we pass legislation that places impossible expectations on people, the less respect there will be for the law, as more people will disobey it and we will be chasing the game all of the time.  I would rather that we pass a little less and obey it than pass much more and have people not bothering with it or the Oireachtas.  Maybe the Minister will focus on the question of whether there should be a sanction on Departments that do not comply with the law.</p><p> Out of curiosity, is every record of everything that is done given to the National Archives or is there a distillation?  With the invention of e-mail, I imagine that files are getting thicker quicker.</p></speech>

The &euro;8 million will not even be a drop in the ocean.  Five hundred years ago, people wrote by hand.  Then they started printing, and we thought we were great when we got electric typewriters.  Now, 50 versions of a document can be created in a word processor.  There are certain ways of avoiding all of that, but that is secret knowledge of Secretaries General.  Are we keeping everything and how will it be managed physically?  Switching the timeframe to 20 years will add a further ten years.  In the past ten years, we have probably produced as much material - I do not know if the Minister has statistics on this - as was produced from the 1920s to the 1950s.  I imagine that, since word processors became common and the Internet became even more common, the growth in archives has been exponential.  Is there a plan in place to make this law work or will we be just congratulating ourselves on passing another law even though nothing will happen because the law is unrealistic?</p></speech>

The Deputy is right, in that there is a large amount of material.  This is a matter of deciding what we need to keep.  I understand that, currently, everyone is keeping everything.  We are undertaking a pilot study with four Departments.</p></speech>

The National Archives Act allows Departments to identify particular records that merit long-term archiving or preservation by the National Archives.  A Department or body can apply for a disposal order to destroy records that do not merit long-term preservation.  Broadly speaking, 20% of a Department's output ends up in the archives.</p></speech>

There is an expense in keeping records.  The public service records management project will allow us to have a policy so that people will know what they must keep.  We provided &euro;300,000 to the National Archives to develop electronic and paper guidelines as part of the project.  Guidelines will issue to Departments, making it clear what they must keep.</p> <p>  This Bill is being progressed to provide Departments the flexibility to release certain classes of records earlier than the standard 30 years if they feel the historical or public interest value of the records warrants early release.</p></speech>

We will give directions to public bodies to reduce their spending on offsite records storage and we will produce a framework by which public service bodies can implement electronic systems.  The long-term plan is to develop the public service's records management capacity, especially as regards electronic records, and the capability of the National Archives to assess and preserve digital records.</p> <p>  As we all know, we have come through difficult times in the economy.  Resources have been tight and people have had to prioritise.  The situation is improving, though.  The unemployment figure is down to 6.6% and more money is coming into the Exchequer.  Therefore, it is time to put a stronger focus on this.  There needs to be clarity regarding electronic records.  At a personal level, people put photographs on discs, for example, and are not as careful as they should be.  Sometimes, it is hard to beat a paper copy.  We must focus on this matter more and I will raise the issue with the other Departments.</p></speech>

Over time, there has been an erosion of people's respect for statutory duties.  When computer systems were being introduced, a wise person told me that, if I had a paper accounting system that was in a mess, all that the computer would do would be to multiply the mess.  If someone does not comply with the 30-year rule and management issues new guidelines, the time taken will double because he or she will start looking through records to see what the guidelines apply to and find ways of not complying with the law.</p> <p>  I am not satisfied that I have received an answer today as to what will be done to ensure that "30 years" is "30 years".  Regardless of whether the National Archives approve a disposal or lodging order, the time is supposed to be 30 years to the day.  Until we get compliance with that - I am referring to the legislation's wider provision under which the timeframe will go to 20 years rather than the narrower provision of certain documents being picked - Departments will be more in breach than in compliance, given the explosion in the number of documents that will need to be sifted through to decide whether they are "In" or "Out".  I do not like laws that are not observed.</p></speech>

Lack of compliance has been a function of the reduced resources of the past ten years.  We must build capacity.  The records management plan will help in that regard and place a renewed focus on the issue raised by the Deputy, in that Departments will have to comply with these rules.</p></speech>

I read a great book by Mr. Neil Postman in which he discussed information and how our main problem now was how to store it.  That is effectively what the committee is debating.

An Teachta &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v put an interesting question.  Will the criteria for the types of documents to be kept and the types of documents to be put into the National Archives be detailed in the Bill?  Will that be the decision of a Minister or of a Department or where will the decision be made?</p></speech>

The guidelines will be done in conjunction with the National Archives.  The Departments must find out how much is there and how much needs to be kept.  They will have guidelines to work from.  Then it will be referred to the National Archives, which can then decide what needs to be retained.  They must get approval from the National Archives as to what goes into storage.  I believe that about 80% of the documents can be disposed of.  That is a real problem at the moment.  Departments are storing mountains of documents and the chances are that they will not need to keep more than 20% of them.</p> <p>  However, we need to have the policy in place in order that the staff will be clear about what needs to be kept and what does not need to be kept.  A smaller amount of material will then be presented to the National Archives, which will go through it as a final check.</p></speech>

The plan aims to assist in the establishment of a coherent and consistent approach to records management within the public service.  There will be a clear plan to deliver the policies, guidelines, structures and systems to achieve the objectives.  There will be guidelines for staff in various Departments.  The criteria to be set will include items of significant historical or public interest and will aim to facilitate balance and fair reporting on issues common with other jurisdictions and, where the resources are available, to facilitate the records' early release.  They will also have guidelines on what needs to be kept and what can be let go.  That is what is important.</p></speech>

I know we are not discussing it, but we are discussing the future storage of digital information.  There is no scope in the 2016 Bill to enable the National Library to collect digital material in any meaningful way.  The suggestion is that it would be possible to scope and capture the entire <i>.ie</i>domain because most websites just disappear after a short period of time.  Year by year we are losing information and potential for researchers down the line.  It would be great to have that amendment to the copyright Bill, as proposed by the National Library.

I know the committee has already met many rural stakeholders in respect of this matter.  As the members of the committee will be well aware, I have lived and worked in rural Ireland for almost all of my life and I believe passionately in the potential of rural communities.  I see the resilience, resourcefulness and tenacity of my own rural community and I know that this is replicated right across Ireland.</p> <p>  The Action Plan for Rural Development, which I launched last month, will help to contribute to my goal of improving the quality of life for those who live and work in rural Ireland.  In my view,  rural Ireland does not need to be saved or rescued.  Rural Ireland can and does make a huge contribution to our economy through innovative industries, thriving community activism, new approaches to attracting tourism and also through its commitment to creativity and culture.  I fully acknowledge the challenges which face rural communities and we are not trying to whitewash those challenges.  However, the new action plan provides the necessary supports and structures to enable Government, at both central and local level, as well as businesses and rural communities to work together to achieve sustainable rural development.</p> <p>  While previous Governments recognised the importance of rural development and invested in initiatives to support rural communities, these initiatives tended to operate in a piecemeal manner.  In other words, there was no co-ordination.  Notwithstanding the focus on agriculture and the food sector generally, rural Ireland and rural development has tended to be peripheral, rather than central to economic and social policies.  This approach must change and that is why the co-ordinating mechanism created by this action plan is so important.</p> <p>  The Commission for the Ecomonic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, report, which was published in 2014, called for a prioritisation of the establishment of a central structure at Government level to co-ordinate rural development across all Departments.  The lack of such a structure was seen as a significant impediment to progressing rural development in Ireland.  This deficit has now been addressed through my own role in co-ordinating rural policy across Government and the creation of the regional and rural affairs division in my Department.  However, responsibility for rural development is not and cannot be the preserve of just one Department.  It is the responsibility of everyone around the Cabinet table.</p> <p>  The Action Plan for Rural Development takes a whole-of-Government approach to the economic and social development of rural Ireland and acts as an overarching structure for the co-ordination and implementation of initiatives right across Departments and other public bodies.  The key element of this plan is the process of bringing together many Government Departments and agencies, recognising the importance of what they are doing individually to contribute to rural development and multiplying their impact through a collaborative approach.  No previous Government has put in place such a co-ordinated and comprehensive plan of action to support rural development.</p> <p>  One of the five pillars of the action plan focuses on supporting sustainable communities.  The objectives of the actions under this pillar are to revitalise our rural towns and villages and support people to live in them; enhance local services such as healthcare, schools, and policing; empower local communities by including the views of rural dwellers and communities in decision-making processes; and build better communities through investment and support for community development, social inclusion and rural security.</p> <p>  Our towns and villages are at the heart of rural communities and should be places where people can live, work, access services and raise their families in a high-quality environment.  It is important, therefore, that we implement measures to help breathe life back into our rural towns and villages and enable them to become vibrant places where people socialise, live and work.   While great interest has been shown by the media in the town and village renewal scheme, this is just one of a range of measures we are taking under the action plan to support our rural communities.  My Department will also provide funding to support towns, villages and parishes through the CL&Aacute;R programme, which has a budget of &euro;5 million this year, as well as through the built heritage investment scheme and the structures at risk fund, which have a combined budget of &euro;2.8 million for 2017.  The Heritage Council will be administering a heritage and community grants programme along with a historic towns programme to develop and expand the ongoing work of the Department&rsquo;s historic towns initiative and the Irish walled towns network.  Other schemes, such as the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, better energy communities scheme will also support town and village renewal.</p> <p>  One of the characteristics of Ireland is the wide diversity of communities across our rural landscape.  While many of our communities are based around towns and villages, others are more dispersed, including our island communities.  It is important that we also support these communities.  There are different requirements and different needs in every community, but connectivity with others and access to economic opportunities are fundamental issues for them all.  In this regard, my Department will work closely with other key economic Departments and agencies to support economic development in the regions.  Strong regions provide the basis for improving economic opportunities and the jobs potential of people living in rural areas.  The Government&rsquo;s objective is to support the creation of 200,000 extra jobs in the economy by 2020, with 135,000 of these jobs outside of Dublin.  The announcement yesterday that the unemployment rate has now fallen to 6.6%, down from a peak of 15.2%, is very welcome in this regard.  The various regional action plans for jobs, which are co-ordinated by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, will play a key role in improving the operating environment for businesses so that enterprises can start up, grow and create employment.  My Department is working closely with the aforementioned Department to ensure that our respective action plans are complementary and mutually re-enforcing. </p> <p>  Through the Action Plan for Rural Development we are also placing a focus on maximising the potential of our tourism sector and developing activity tourism that particularly benefits areas in the countryside.  This is a growing sub-sector internationally and we have not yet fully tapped into the growing customer base for our natural assets in this area.  Similarly, we have potential to optimise our built heritage, which is often rooted in rural Ireland, to attract more visitors and provide increased employment opportunities for local communities.  Approximately 85% of overseas visitors to Ireland in 2015 visited at least one region outside of Dublin.  We are working with a number of agencies to build on this and realise the full potential of rural tourism. </p> <p>  When we talk about vibrant rural communities, I am always struck by the important role which the arts and culture play in bringing people together at a local level and contributing to people&rsquo;s quality of life.</p><p>It is important that cultural participation is actively supported in rural communities as a way to combat rural isolation, enhance and contribute to the vibrancy of rural Ireland, and generate economic activity, for example through cultural tourism.  Culture 2025 aims to increase the participation of individuals and communities from across Ireland, including rural communities, and will provide a platform for bringing together the numerous local, regional and national cultural entities with a view to sharing best practice, and developing synergies.  </p><p> A couple of weeks ago, I announced the allocation of &euro;9 million in capital funding for arts and culture centres across the country.  This was the most significant investment in regional arts and cultural centres in a decade and goes to the very heart of what I am trying to achieve through the Creative Ireland programme.  Our language is, of course, an essential part of our culture and connects people in a way that defines our identity.  Our Gaeltacht regions often provide the first real experience of rural Ireland to our young people who are reared in the cities, as they attend summer courses in the Gaeltacht.  However, the Gaeltacht regions are also home to many successful enterprises and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is targeting the increase of 1,500 jobs in the Gaeltacht regions over the three-year lifespan of the action plan.</p><p> Connectivity between, and within, communities is also addressed in the action plan, with a particular focus on improving mobile phone and broadband access, improving rural transport links and protecting people&rsquo;s property through flood defence measures.  The roll-out of the national broadband plan constitutes one of the single biggest investments in rural Ireland for generations and will allow communities and businesses in rural areas to compete effectively and realise their full potential.  It is important to recognise that a lot has already been done by commercial service providers to roll out broadband to an increased number of rural areas.  As the committee will be aware, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is currently involved in a tendering process which will see intervention in areas not likely to be covered as a commercial proposition.  While the roll-out of broadband in the intervention area will commence once the contracts have been awarded, the Government is already taking action to accelerate and facilitate both broadband roll out and improvements to mobile phone reception in rural areas by implementing the recommendations of the report of the task force on mobile phone and broadband access.  </p><p> Improved transport links to and from rural areas will be addressed through actions relating to the rural transport programme, the regional airports, and transport solutions designed to meet particular needs, such as those of island communities.  Investment in flood relief measures will be doubled to &euro;100 million per annum by 2021, with over 100 new measures planned for rural communities.</p><p> In concluding, a Chathaoirligh, I would like to put on record my thanks to this committee and to individual Oireachtas Members, for the suggestions I received when I was developing the action plan.  It is clear from the submissions received that we are all passionate about supporting rural Ireland and that we all have the interest of rural Ireland at heart.  Some of the ideas put forward by the members of the committee which are reflected in the plan include the development of an effective rural-proofing model; the examination of rates issues for small businesses in rural Ireland; a range of measures to improve flood defences, as mentioned previously; and capacity building measures for local communities.</p><p> This Government has now put in place a comprehensive plan for rural development which provides the policy and operational environment in which rural communities and businesses can thrive, succeed and realise their potential.  I fully intend that the vast programme of work across Departments and agencies will be effectively and efficiently delivered and that we will achieve significant gains and improvements across all the sectors encompassed by the plan.  In short, the implementation of this action plan will help ensure that rural communities not only remain viable, but flourish and prosper over the years to come. </p><p> I hope that this committee will join me on the journey of changing the perception of rural Ireland, of presenting rural Ireland as modern, dynamic, creative and an essential part of Ireland&rsquo;s economic and social fabric.</p></speech>

I appreciate that the Minister and the two Ministers of State, Deputies Michael Ring and Se&aacute;n Kyne, live in rural areas, but I think this debate is unrealistic.  The action plan is not an action plan.  The system got the better of it.  It took everything it was doing already and put it into the plan because there was nothing new to be said.  The &euro;60 million, which we are not even sure about, is very little money in the context of rural Ireland.  The reality is the system lives with the <i>status quo</i>.</p><p>We have to face a second reality.  In many ways rural Ireland is very unfairly treated and has been for many years.  I think, in the heart and soul, the Minister and Ministers of State know this.  I am not saying it happened suddenly under this Government but nothing will be done to address it unless we face facts.  In many ways we pay taxes for services we do not get.  There is a big debate about water and sewage.  If free water and sewage is given to cities it will be the case that we have been paying in, but we will not be getting anything out of it.  </p><p>When we check on the Bus &Eacute;ireann subsidies, one would think the subsidy per head of population in the really rural parts of Ireland, when we take out the cities of Galway Limerick and Cork, would be very high.  I understand it could be as little as a tenth per head.  In other words &euro;10 is paid in Dublin for every &euro;1 paid for public transport in rural areas.  This idea that rural areas are a drain on resources is often totally untrue.  In rural Ireland it tends to actually be a case of Muhammad going to the mountain rather than the mountain going to Muhammad.  </p><p>What do we actually give rural houses?  We give them a road but let us be honest about it, since we already have a dispersed population the roads will have to be put in unless rural Ireland is denuded of its population.  We give them water.  Water is very cheap to provide.  It can be done for approximately &euro;6,000 a house.  Even in the most isolated areas it would be approximately &euro;8,000.  We could not provide sewage at that cost.  We will give a one-off subsidy, that would not build a bypass, for getting fibre broadband to every house.  </p><p>What do we not give that we give in urban areas?  We provide capital and current for sewage all the time.  We provide capital and current for street lights all the time.  We provide capital and current for pavements all the time.  We continuously do street cleaning in cities and we do not in rural areas.  There are also things like public parks and so on.  The first thing that we all should agree, as rural people, is that rural Ireland pays taxes on the same basis as everybody else but it does not get the services.  There is this idea that it is expensive to service rural Ireland.</p><p>The second thing that worries me is a narrative there has been in Government that Ireland's future is about towns and villages.  I have fought against it and I was instrumental in blocking one Government who tried to refresh the spacial strategy to eliminate people living in the countryside.  I rewrote the previous one before that in huge detail.  I will claim to have been the guy with the hand up to stop this twice when I was in Government.  This concept that rural Ireland's future is about towns and villages seems to be in all the speeches given today.  It keeps coming up and they keep putting it in.  </p><p>I know how these things are generated.  The system keeps generating them.  It keeps referring to towns and villages, people living in our towns and villages and so on.  With the Internet, that is a nineteenth and twentieth century concept.  With the Internet, people do not go to their local town to go to the bank.  They go to their mobile phone.  With the internet, if people want to book something or even if they want to buy clothes, most people now do it on the phone, on the iPad or on the laptop.  The private companies, by the way, do not seem to have any problem delivering to anywhere and everywhere, even up the mountain. The reality is that anywhere someone wants it they will get it.  </p><p>The idea that we all have to conglomerate is wrong.  In my view it is where we get a lot of our social problems.  The Government has to declare for or against, because the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, is drawing up a plan and it seems to be more about conglomeration and what they call critical mass, which is absolutely ridiculous in the internet age, than it is about facilitating people to live where they want.  I will ask very straight question here today and I will only make one final point because time is short.  Does the Minister see a conscious effort to try to change the settlement pattern of the past?</p><p>Most people did not live in street villages but rather in townlands.  Does the Minister see a conscious effort to try to change that and move people out of the countryside into towns and villages?  Is that part of Government policy, as it seems to be?  As I pointed out before, it even seems to be in the action plan.  We need an honest answer on this one.  If it is so, what is the advantage, as I can give plenty of disadvantages?  If we want to find pockets of social difficulties for children with drugs etc., we will find it in socially segregated housing estates in our towns.  We have to ask where the Slaughtneils, the Ballyheas and St. Thomas' come from.  They are examples of small populations producing fantastic results and why is that?  It is something in the construction of the communities.</p><p> We must ask the fundamental question of what is the Minister's vision for rural Ireland and is it one where we will push people into towns and villages?  That is the policy of most of the Departments and particularly the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  One-off council houses are not being built in the countryside and in Galway housing loans are not being given for a one-off house.  All the documents produced by the Department, including the recently published document, are pushing us into towns and villages.  If that is not the Minister's policy, what is she going to do to change the policy of the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, which is in that direction?  I have a suspicion that the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, knows in his heart and soul I am not talking about politics here.  It is something about which I have been consistent since I moved from Dublin 4 to Connemara.  There is a value for life in real rural Ireland and there is real geography in it.  It is not about scattered houses but communities that function.  The Internet has made that viable into the future.</p><p> I have a second plea.  I spent 18 years as a co-operative manager in a small community co-op in Corr na M&oacute;na.  We set up many enterprises, some of which succeeded and some which failed.  One that succeeded - I did not make it successful - metamorphosed into what is now called ECC Teoranta, which is a massive timber mill.  We need roads and broadband, which is obvious, but one other element is needed.  I can give both the problem and the answer.  The problem is that businesses in start-up mode need cash investment, possibly through preference shares that could be paid for when the company turns a corner, which normally takes four or five months.  Will the Minister consider going to the Minister for Finance and asking him for &euro;100 million to be given to the Western Development Commission?  It can be 20-year money or whatever but it should be invested in rural enterprise.  Rural start-ups will not get this from venture funds of banks but this would allow rural enterprises to get their hands on cash.  The Minister can look at the likes of McHale and I can guarantee her that if she provides the money, she will get the return.  We have starved rural Ireland for too long.  Amounts of &euro;5,000, &euro;10,000 and &euro;20,000 are a joke if somebody is trying to set up a real industry anywhere in the country, and the rural areas are no different from urban areas in that regard.</p></speech>

I live in rural Ireland and I particularly defend the right of rural people to live in their rural communities absolutely.  I fought that fight many times on Monaghan County Council as well when directives came from the Government that there could be no one-off houses and areas should be under strong urban influence.  A plethora of stuff is coming back to bite us now.  I spent 12 years as a credit union manager in Cootehill in County Cavan and I absolutely believe there are huge opportunities in working with the credit union movement to provide support to local indigenous industries.  Nobody knows better than the local credit unions the character and ability of people to get a business running.  Those people know best as they are on the ground.</p></speech>

It is about finding the correct mechanism to do it.  I support the principle that they should get all the support they can because the local indigenous industries are creating jobs.  Three or four jobs in a local community are worth 50 or 100 jobs announced in big towns.  They make the difference.</p> <p>  We are investing in rural Ireland across the Government.  There has been a 9% increase in the allocation for our local and regional roads.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, recently opened the sports capital programme, which has &euro;30 million available nationwide.  We all know how the sports capital programme benefits rural sports clubs across the country.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, has allocated an additional 500 places for the rural social scheme, which is in addition to the &euro;7 million of the rural recreation programme coming from my Department.  There is &euro;40 million allocated for the Leader projects this year and I recently announced &euro;9 million for the arts and culture capital scheme, which will support arts centres right across the country.  There is much happening and the Action Plan for Rural Development is proof of a cross-Government commitment to support rural communities.</p> <p>  This committee asked us to act on the failure to develop a coherent rural development policy in Ireland, which can be in part explained by poor governance structures.  The Commission for the Economic Development in Rural Areas noted that the White Paper on rural development published in 1999 was weak in terms of delivery structure rather than ideas, lacking ministerial leadership, resources, statutory underpinning, institutional performance and delivery mechanisms.  This plan is pulling all of that together.  It is about working together and making a difference to rural Ireland.  When investors come along and google a particular area in which they want to invest, they want to see positive news coming from the area.  If they see negative narratives from the location, they will not want to go there.  We need to work together to promote rural Ireland.  We are all rural Deputies and we want to showcase our areas.  We want people to invest in rural Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-01a.261" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1235" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22017030100002#M01300"><p>I might put a few questions to the Minister.  I understand what she says about negativity and that too much negativity will not necessarily sell an area.  I suppose sometimes if an Opposition Deputy does not focus on problems, they will not be fixed either.  One is caught between a rock and a hard place in that regard.</p> <p>  In economics there is a view that one should get the economic model working correctly rather than adding smaller elements to try to support a failing economic model.  There is much good stuff in the plan that the Minister has brought to bear and much that would bring a positive difference to many people in rural Ireland.  I am still of the view that the economic model for rural Ireland is still in trouble.  I say this because we have had a wealth of groups in here with information that is not as positive as it should be.  For example, An Post indicated 500 post offices were not currently economically viable and Teagasc told us only a third of farmers - the backbone of the rural community - are independently viable.  If we take away the single farm payment or the fact that a third of farmers work outside the farm to supplement it, only approximately 30,000 farmers in the State are making the &euro;19,000 deemed to be able to make a living.  That is a shocking fact when we are considering development of the rural community.</p> <p>  A key action in bringing the other approximately 60% of farmers into the profitable sphere would be to enhance their ability to get into the energy development sector.  I mentioned feed-in tariffs to the Minister before and such tariffs for small-scale wind and solar and bio-energy.  I know farmers in County Meath with an abundance of slurry who could easily use the methane from it to create small-scale electricity generation.  They are waiting for planning permission to beat the band.</p><p>However, they are waiting for the Renewable Energy Feed In Tariff to do that.  In a society that is hungry for energy and in a country that will have &euro;600 million in EU fines by 2020 if it does not decarbonise, and in a sector that is crying out for product from which to make extra income, those three elements should be pushing the Government towards taking action, but we are not near that action at the moment.</p><p> Those in business - be that a company like Google or a small enterprise - will say that the key elements to doing business are having product, having a customer, having access to that customer in transport and communications, and having competitive inputs into the creation of those products.  The transport infrastructure in regional and rural areas is a mess.  When representatives of the NTA appeared before the committee a few weeks ago we asked them the basis on which they were making decisions on transportation investment.  They told us they made those decisions based on where demand was strongest.  That is the logical objective.  However, in order to make regional and rural areas more effective, it is necessary to disrupt that objective and make the objective building for future demand in the regions and in rural areas.  They are two mutually competitive objectives and the latter objective is not being met.</p><p> We also hear what is happening with regard to Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Places like Derry are losing their Bus &Eacute;ireann connection.  The Athlone to Westport and Dublin to Clonmel connections are to be lost.  People living in Donegal, Tyrone and County Derry currently have no motorway, no rail line and no air connectivity with Dublin.  Now they will have no State bus service to Dublin.  All the reports and action plans in the world will never rebalance the loss of connectivity.  That will take money beyond the existing demand.  It will take disruptive money as well.</p><p> The Minister also mentioned credit unions.  I have met the regulator of credit unions.  The Government's policy for credit unions is not on the same page as the Minister has articulated here.  I agree with everything she said about the role credit unions could play in the country's development.  However, the credit union sector is being driven down.  Slowly but surely it is being regulated out of the space it is in.  It has &euro;10 billion sitting in AIB and Bank of Ireland earning no interest.  It wants to invest that money in the development of housing and small businesses, but is being prevented by the regulator and Government policy.  While there has been movement which can be measured in inches to create more space for credit unions to operate, the Government has put a cap on the development of credit unions.</p><p> I ask the Minister to consider the development of Border enterprise development zones within the national strategic development plan that is being development at the moment.  Given that the Minister comes from a Border area, she should make a strong play for the Government to develop specific tools to allow towns such as Monaghan town, Enniskillen, Dungannon, Strabane, Lifford, Letterkenny, Newry and Dundalk to grow into the future.  Those towns are different from most of the other towns.  There are many towns on the natural periphery of this country.  The Border is a man-made periphery.  It is a periphery that should not be there but it exists because of the dysfunction of the relationship between Britain and Ireland.  Those towns will suffer the most and take the brunt of Brexit in the future.  I ask the Minister and her officials to develop a Border development zone to offer some competitive advantage for those towns to deal with the challenges they have in the coming years.</p></speech>

I absolutely agree with the idea of a Border development zone.  It is well worth considering in the context of Brexit, which will clearly be felt more severely along the Border areas than elsewhere.  We are looking at increasing tourism in rural areas.  I have specifically proposed developing a "borderlands" tourism initiative running from the Cooley Peninsula to the Donegal coast.  That would naturally bring in a band that links a tourism trail into and out of the North.  I am very keen on promoting and developing that.  Brexit presents an opportunity to work even closer together.  We will never need to work closer together than we will need to on Brexit.  That is something I am looking at developing further.</p> <p>  The lakelands project existed some years ago and is something we should be looking at.  The action plan for rural development calls for the further development of the lakelands project, which will have an impact on Border counties such as Cavan and Monaghan as well as Longford and Roscommon.</p> <p>  The Chairman mentioned farming.  We continue with the roll-out of CAP payments, which is worth over &euro;1.2 billion to farmers.  The last budget introduced a number of taxation measures to assist the farming sector including: an increase in the earned income tax credit for self-employed; the roll-out of a new income-averaging step out for farmers; the extension of farm restructuring capital gains tax relief to the end of 2019; the investigation of taxation measures which might support farmers through periods of income volatility which they have had recently; and the implementation of changes to the farm assist scheme which will increase the value of the weekly farm assist payments for low-income farmers and in particular for those with children which will ensure that farm families are supported in actively farming their land.</p> <p>  We have the development of the training and advice initiatives aimed at farmers to assist in farm management.  Farm safety is a big issue and it is also mentioned in the plan, as are sustainable farming and off-farm income generation.</p> <p>  I agree with what the Chairman said about the huge opportunities in the energy development sector.  The action plan contains several actions that relate specifically to renewable energy.  I agree that a considerable amount of farm waste could be used more effectively and turned into renewable energy.  There is a full section on renewable energy that has been developed in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.</p></speech>

It is expanding rural link services.  It is about communities coming forward and indicating demand.  In Cavan where I launched this, it goes not just into the town.  It is going from, for example, from Butler's Bridge into Cavan town, right through the town and into Ballinagh, which is a good idea.  The local people said there was a need for such a service.  It is about tapping into what the local demands are.  It is a wonderful service.  I know towns across the country light up on Thursday or a Friday morning when they come in.  They are brought in on the rural transport and go for their shopping.  They might go for a drink or have a cup of coffee.  It makes a huge difference to small towns when people come in.  I very much support that.  It will revitalise the towns that people are not getting into when they can put on this public transport.</p></speech>

I am interested in Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's point about scattered communities.  They are not scattered communities; they are communities, but to the person with another experience they may look at times to be scattered.</p><p>I am grateful for that remark.</p><p> I want to focus on heritage.  Our culture has no context without heritage and without culture we have no art.  When we think about heritage, we have to presume that includes our national cultural institutions.  It is the tunnelled buildings on Moore Street.  It is the built and the natural.  It is the Giant's Causeway and Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne.  It is also our landscapes and hedgerows, which we will be discussing at length tomorrow.  I appeal to this committee to understand that the Bill proposed tomorrow is anything about a heritage Bill.  I appeal to Deputy Eamonn &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's party to protect our hedgerows.  They provide a vital resource to many species of wildlife.  Our hedgerows are a pathway for all of those species and for our pollinators given that we do not have natural forests across this island.  There is scientific evidence against this Bill from within the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  It runs against the grain of all local authority proposals and strategies for heritage.</p><p> I appeal for Fianna F&aacute;il's support for the amendments tomorrow so that we do not widen the opportunity for members of our farming community to cut hedgerows.  The state of our built and natural heritage, as the Deputy said, is a significant economic asset, marketed abroad by F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  It is scandalous, given that contribution to our marketing abroad for both our foreign and domestic tourists, that those sites and the people who invest in them might be under-resourced.  We need to analyse that in the context of us pushing this image abroad.  It is scandalous that we would have under-resourced heritage sites.  It would be threatening our heritage in a way that we will see tomorrow.  I appeal to the Minister to consider that Bill tomorrow.  I appeal to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Fianna F&aacute;il to do likewise.</p></speech>

It was interesting that most of the people that spoke and were critical of the Bill never lived in rural Ireland.  We are all for heritage and protecting the environment, but we have to live there as well.  I live in a place where the biggest complaint I have all summer is that people will not be able to get up and down their roads as a consequence of growth.  They are paying their taxes, including road tax.  They want to be able to get to work and to get their children to school safely.</p> <p>  I want to take up an issue that the Chairman raised about rural towns and villages.  He is quite correct.  He mentioned An Post and post offices being closed.  The biggest problem that we are faced with and that maybe the Chairman and others will face in the years ahead is that of broadband.  We need broadband very badly, but it has an economic impact, since more people are buying from the Internet now.  We are going to lose more shops and businesses because of the Internet.  That is the problem with progress.</p> <p>  The Chairman talked about infrastructure.  I will give a simple example.  When I was Minister of State with responsibility for tourism, one of the greatest things that was introduced in this country was the Wild Atlantic Way.  It was one of the greatest initiatives by any Government, and it has created jobs in tourism and brought people to rural Ireland who had not been there for many years.  The infrastructure was there.  Signage and promotion were needed, as well as for Government and F&aacute;ilte Ireland to take it seriously.  With State agencies, local authorities, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Government working together, that has turned out to be a tremendous success.  Many thousands of jobs throughout this country have been created because of the Wild Atlantic Way.  The Chairman talked about infrastructure and is quite correct.  He talked about the negativity and positivity.  I went to Ennis recently, since I was at a wedding in Milltown Malbay.  The infrastructure is improving, but we need to see further improvements.  The more that the motorways are opened up and the easier it is for people to get access to rural Ireland, the more people will live there.</p> <p>  The officials in my Department have to talk to officials from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v raised this issue and I spoke about it on the radio today.  Legislation was brought in many years ago by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's Government about water planning.  It had to be looked at.  The amount of young people who have been given sites by their fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters and cannot build on their own land has to be looked at again.  We have to give people an opportunity to live in rural Ireland.  I do not know the word now used for the new scheme, but planners appear to be trying to stop people from living in rural Ireland.  If we are serious about people living in rural Ireland, we have to make it easier for them to live in it, and we have to give them some of the services that they need.</p></speech>

I have been on many journeys through rural Ireland in my lifetime.  The last journey I joined was Mr. Pat Spillane's journey.  It did not work out, though not through any fault of his.  He was passionate, wanted it to work out, but it did not happen.  I am worried that this plan is very much a copy and paste or whatever it is called.  The Minister of State spoke about people not being negative, and is correct in that.  It is hard but, if one wants to talk honestly about rural Ireland and comes from it, one sometimes has to look at the negative things there that are making life very difficult for people.  There are a few issues there and I have listened to what the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, has had to say in the last couple of minutes.  I would jump over there and pat him on the back because a lot of what he said was from the heart.</p> <p>  I am afraid that I would not in any way be in favour of what the gentleman to my left, the Senator, said about verge-cutting.  It is a huge issue for rural Ireland.  We are not environmental monsters.  We are protective of our communities.  I always felt that the responsibility for verge-cutting should never have gone from the local authority.  I am convinced that is the only way it can be carried out.  I am in west Cork.  In fairness to the Cork county council, it has an initiative where it part-funds the verge-cutting if communities want to come and get involved.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, said, nobody could take that away from the Wild Atlantic Way.  The success of that has been incredible, though planning permission is a massive issue which has been going on for many years.</p> <p>  The Minister of State mentioned jobs.  The biggest employer in my area at the moment is Turas Nua.  This new initiative that the Government set up for people that are unemployed-----</p></speech>

They all have fancy names.  The bottom line is that it has been the ruination of community and voluntary groups in my area.  If somebody is in JobPath, Turas Nua or whatever we call it, that person is firstly taken off the live register but still does not have a job.  Secondly, that person cannot take a community employment, CE, job, a rural social scheme, RSS, job or a T&uacute;s job, while he or she is involved in Turas Nua, which could go on for a year or two.  That is a huge issue in my area, and in other rural communities.  It was brought up in the D&aacute;il last week.  In a city, one might get away with that since there is a huge population of people and there might be a high proportion of unemployed, so other people can be found.</p> <p>  In a rural community, there are gifted people that may have lost jobs and may have opportunities on an RSS, T&uacute;s or CE scheme, but cannot take them because they have been sucked in by this new JobPath.  It looks nice for the live register figures, but the bottom line is that unemployment is still very high in west Cork and I can only speak on behalf of west Cork.  It is still very high in my own community.  That is a matter that the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs should look into.  I am not saying that JobPath should not be there.  One should still be entitled to go onto an RSS, CE or a T&uacute;s scheme while in JobPath, until JobPath finds a person gainful employment.  If it does, that is a different thing.</p><p>That is something that needs to be looked at because it is a big issue for rural Ireland at the moment.  It is a big issue for the community and voluntary groups which kept this country rolling on.  They are not going to find a workforce for the meals on wheels or to carry out the Tidy Towns work, or whatever.  I welcome the Minister's initiative here on rates, an issue for businesses in rural Ireland, because that has been a disastrous situation for a lot of people trying to start businesses in small rural towns and villages.  They find it very difficult and rate are killing them.  We will see how that rolls out and we welcome it for the time being.  </p><p> I came in late, but I heard no mention of post offices.  I have extreme worries about the future of our rural post offices, which are the lifeline of the local area.  Rural roads were mentioned.  I come from a community that has seen very little investment in our roads.  There was mention of motorways; the nearest motorway to me is about two hours drive from a peninsula.  I would leave in the morning, sometimes at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m.; there is not even an initiative there to create passing bays to open up west Cork as a place of business, this is what we need.  We need better investment for our roads.  </p><p> The Minister speaks about farmers, they are going through a very difficult period.  Yes, some of it is weather related which is nothing to do with the Minister personally, we accept, but there are things out there such as the GLAS payments.  More than 8,000 farmers have not received a GLAS payment yet, and we are told for the last three to four months, and any TD here is probably getting it in the neck in their constituency offices, it is due to a technical issue.  For the love of God, somebody needs to have a head roll there and be put out of their job if they cannot resolve a technical issue to give farmers their payment.  These farmers are in a situation where they cannot pay banks and cannot pay contractors.  The grain farmers have had no compensation package put in place although there has been a lot of talk, and it was voted for in the D&aacute;il.  These are the issues.  I do not want to preach negativity but these are the facts on the ground.  </p><p> On mobile phone coverage and broadband issues, we are talking about 2020, 2021.  I am sorry but the people in west Cork, Mayo or wherever want that issue resolved now.  I encouraged and supported an initiative between the Minister and the communications Minister, Deputy Naughten about these mobile phone repeaters and it needs to be researched quickly and both of the Ministers need to bring in the mobile phone companies and make them accountable because they are not accountable to anybody.  We are doing a lot of talking but nothing is happening.  Details of some initiative on mobile phone repeaters were e-mailed to us.  It is a brilliant idea for rural communities which do not have a mobile phone service; it was done with broadband many years ago so it can be done with mobile phones.  I think it was an initiative of Deputy Naughten's but Deputy Humphreys was involved as well.  I just hope to God this plan works or is seen to work in some way.  </p><p> The Leader funding is not rolled out.  It was the backbone of many rural communities.  There is no money available at this time.  In west Cork we use to have one company, now we have three and nobody seems to know who is running what, it is a pure farce.  The Minister's ear is worn from me saying that so I will not annoy her more with that today.  When these things are being rolled out, I would like to see who is calling the shots.  </p><p> We pushed very hard for the programme for Government to have extra jobs in the rural social scheme, which is a very good scheme for low income fishermen and low income farmers.  We got 500 jobs.  That was brilliant because it was the first time anything had happened in a number of years.  Then it rolled out.  Cork County is a huge county and it got only 39 extra jobs.  I apologise to Deputy Ring if I insult his county, but there were 79 Mayo.  That is not good enough.  Who is pulling strings here?  The bottom line is that it should be fair across the board.  In one company alone in West Cork Development Partnership, we could have had 40 people but the whole of Cork County only get 39.  I presume other counties will be complaining too that they did not get enough.  I question things at times.  I come from rural Ireland, my heart is embedded deeply therE.  That is what brought me into D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and I will fight my corner for my people as long as I can and if this plan works, I will be in here to praise it.  Not everything can work, I accept that, but aspects such as rural broadband and mobile phone coverage are major issues and if we want to create employment in rural Ireland that is the way forward.</p></speech>

That will be the measure of its success.  We will be developing indicators to measure the impacts and there is a monitoring committee set up, which will meet shortly.  There are 276 actions in this plan.  We will monitor them and the people in Departments and the Ministers who make promises will be held to account.  The Deputy referred to Turas Nua and the document states clearly that it aims to "maintain the provision of schemes such as the rural social scheme, community employment, back to education allowance and t&uacute;s in rural communities and the Gaeltacht having regard to the declining numbers on the live register and the need to ensure that these schemes are targeted to the needs of jobseekers and others". The people who are responsible for that are in the Department of Social Protection and they will be held to account.  People have made commitments in this plan and they have to deliver.  My job is to sit down and chair the monitoring committee, bring in the relevant stakeholders in the Departments and find out if it is happening.  The Deputy mentioned Pat Spillane.  He has come on board and I am delighted that he has agreed to become a rural ambassador.  He is going to go out and he is going to listen to communities and if there is a problem he will be back telling me and he will be rapping on my door to say what is not happening.  I know that the members here will know if it is not happening.  This is a living document.  If things are not happening come and tell us about it because the actions are here.  There are 276 of them.  What we want to do is change the narrative about rural Ireland.  I know there are challenges, I absolutely accept that but we want to show that rural Ireland is modern, it is dynamic and it is creative and it makes a huge contribution to our economy.</p> <p>  On jobs, positive figures were published yesterday that showed unemployment down to 6.6%, down from over 15% in 2012.  There is a target to create 135,000 jobs in rural Ireland.  In 2016, 72% of jobs were created outside of the greater Dublin area.  It is about getting the message out that you have got to go to rural Ireland, give them an opportunity.  There is loads out there and  there are committed and hard working people.  There is energy and enthusiasm in rural Ireland that one will never get anywhere else so why not get out there?  The word to the IDA is that we will increase foreign direct investment by 40% in the regions.  The focus has to be on rural Ireland.  That is my job.  I have said on numerous occasions that I want all Departments to positively discriminate towards rural Ireland.  Think rural.  There are job increases in all the regions.  These are full-time, high quality jobs.  What we have here is a broader-based recovery.  Employment is growing in every single sector.  It is happening in rural Ireland but we want that to continue and we want a bigger focus there.  We know that 135,000 jobs are to be created in rural Ireland over the lifetime of this plan.</p> <p>  On broadband, more than 1.4 million premises in Ireland have access to broadband because of the policy delivered by this Government and the last.  Towns all over Ireland now have access to high speed broadband and the telecoms sector continues to invest with more and more services to be rolled out.  The challenge now is to push that investment into rural areas beyond the towns because a lot of the towns have got broadband.  To update Deputy Collins on the Cork figure, 155,000 properties have access to high speed broadband in Cork.  Another 2,300 properties will be coming on stream in the next couple of weeks.  Work is happening on broadband and it continues all the time but we have to keep the focus there.  Members will know about the national broadband plan and that it is for every single house.  We are actually being watched by the rest of Europe because this is the first plan of its kind to put high speed broadband into every single house in Ireland.  That is ambitious and something that we need.  It is going to be good news for rural Ireland and Ireland generally when that is delivered.</p></speech>

I have a problem with hedges along the roads that obscure a person's view while driving or walking.  I make no apology for calling for hedges in such circumstances to be cut all year round.  As I said when I was a member of Kerry County Council, birds are not so foolish to build nests on the side of the road where a lorry could whisk off all of their feathers, blow their nests to smithereens and destroy their families.</p></speech>

A ridiculous case has been made to protect birds.  I always put people before birds.  I represent a particular county and know that the countryside does not look well when the hedges are not cut.  Hedges should be cut all year round.  We are talking about the roads that people use so their safety must take first priority.</p> <p>  We have spoken about the local improvement scheme before but it has not been mentioned in the plan.  I wish to say to the Minister for the Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and her Minister of State that the people who live in rural Ireland are entitled to have good roads up to their doors every bit as much as the people who live in Dublin 4.  The former Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, abolished the local improvement scheme because of a belief that the public or the taxpayer should not be asked to pay for private roads.  They may be private roads in the sense that they have not been taken over by local authorities but they are public roads and provide a public right of way to homes.</p> <p>  The local improvement scheme helped many people.  Today, the Minister said the scheme still exists, but it exists in name only because there is no funding available.  The local authorities have said that they have no money to fund the scheme.  Kerry County Council has a file that contains 160 sanctioned applications and over 500 applications that await assessment.  On top of that class three roads are not included in the road restoration or improvement programme.  The council only considers through roads or link roads for funding.  We have been denied.  The people pay road tax, property tax and every kind of tax so they are entitled to use the roads.  People must pay far more for their national car test and repairs because the roads are a shambles.  At present, we do not even have the proper amount of money to maintain roads.  All of this means safety has again been compromised.  One can see leaks on the sides of the roads, particularly if it has rained.  If a young person drives in such circumstances, there is a danger that when he or she drives into a pool of water the driving wheel will be whipped out of his or her hands, the vehicle will be propelled over the ditch and, more often than not, the driver will be killed.  People often talk about safety on the roads and the Road Safety Authority so maintaining roads should be a priority.  The Government has not provided enough money to maintain roads.      </p> <p>  I agree with what Deputy Collins said about GLAS payments.  My phone has broken due to the amount of calls I have received about GLAS payments.  Does the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine have enough money for the scheme?  He has given us the spiel about having a technical problem.  Does he have the money for the scheme?  People are entitled to receive their payments and I can cite several examples of difficulties.  I know of a poor man who needed to pay his daughter's college fees.  He needed to receive his GLAS payment after Christmas but he has not received it yet, which is unfair.  The payment was supposed to have been paid to everyone.</p></speech>

Sadly, they cannot join.  There are also people who are in receipt of social welfare payments but do not want to avail of the rural social scheme.</p> <p>  The real problem with rural Ireland, in particular Kerry, is that we have no infrastructure.  We do not have a motorway or road into the county and we do not have broadband.  Mobile phones that did work do not work now, whatever has gone wrong with them.

The county is doing fairly well but there is always room for improvement.  I have looked at the figures for other counties and know their situation is not as good.  The service is being worked on and is being rolled out.  Every week more connections are being made to high speed broadband.</p> <p>  I thank the Deputy for his support on the hedgecutting issue.  There has been a lot of misinformation about the hedgecutting Bill.  I want to make it clear, and I will outline my views again in the Seanad tomorrow, that we must strike a balance between road safety and protecting the environment.  I genuinely believe that the Heritage Bill has struck that balance.  We do not want to slash the hedges down to stumps just to reduce them by one season's growth.  People will realise that when they read the details.  Everything in life is about achieving a balance.</p> <p>  I know that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is doing everything he can to resolve the issues with GLAS.  We have all received telephone inquiries about the scheme.  Improvements have been made and a lot of resources have been invested to resolve outstanding issues.  We will raise the matter with the Minister again. </p> <p>  The 500 extra places announced for the rural social scheme are welcome.  The Deputy raised some issues that are more suited to the Department of Social Protection.

I ask the Minister to do something about the planning scenario that has deprived young people from having a home.  At present, rural areas are treated as areas under urban generated pressure.  The policy was adopted to stop people leaving towns and building in areas outside of towns.  The policy also stops a person in a rural area who buys a site 300 yards away from getting planning permission to build a house for himself or herself.  I refer to a person who is already in the area, and has been born and reared in the area.</p><p>He is deprived of getting planning permission for a site he could buy that is 350 m away because it is an area under urban generated pressure.  There must be some way of addressing it and of giving some direction to the local authorities.  It was raised in Kerry County Council last week and got no hearing in the world.  It has to be sorted out nationally.  </p></speech>

The last issue regarding planning is something about which we need to talk to the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  There is no question about it.  Something has to be done and the national plan will have to be looked at again.</p> <p>  The reason the previous Minister dropped the funding for local improvement scheme, LIS, roads is because there was no money in the country but when local authorities got their discretionary grant they could put a percentage of it into LIS roads.  The local authorities themselves have washed their hands of the LIS roads.  They have discretionary funding from their own resources and when we did research on local authorities all over the country, we found they put very little money into them.  I suggest the committee brings the Minister, Deputy Ross, in here.  I have very little money in the CL&Aacute;R programme.  I am prepared to put some money in but I will not do the job of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, which has a bigger budget than I have.  I have only &euro;5 million nationally.  If the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the local authorities put some funding in place, I will try to find some funding from CL&Aacute;R to match it.    </p></speech>

As I circulated a statement earlier on the <i>Lusitania</i>, I will now briefly outline the general framework for looking after underwater archaeology.  The relevant legislation, which comprised a new national monuments code at the time, was introduced in 1987 to give automatic protection to all shipwrecks over 100 years old and to allow similar protections to be extended to newer wrecks of particular historical significance, as well as to underwater archaeological objects.  Following a subsequent pilot study of shipwrecks around the coast in the late 1990s, which highlighted the need to properly quantify this aspect of our cultural heritage, a dedicated underwater archaeology unit was set up in the Department's national monuments service in the year 2000.  There are three main strands to this unit's work in protecting underwater archaeology.  The first consists of the development of an archive of information on shipwrecks.  That is the wreck inventory of Ireland database.  The second is undertaking on-site dive surveys, excavations and monitoring of archaeological sites as required.  The third is developing mitigation measures on development impacts.  The current round of OPW flood prevention schemes is a very good case in point because they involve a very significant disturbance of riverbeds around the country.  To date, the unit has built up a database of 18,000 shipwrecks and has completed numerous surveys and excavations at site ranging from Bronze Age log boats to 16th and 17th-century trading vessels and warships.  Through the planning process, the underwater archaeology unit advises on development proposals that may affect underwater archaeology, for example proposed works on the foreshore or aquaculture proposals.<br/><br/>Most relevant to today's business, the unit assesses applications for licences to dive or investigate protected wrecks, including the <i>Lusitania</i>.  The <i>Lusitania</i>is privately owned but is subject to an underwater heritage order made under the 1987 Act because of its historical importance.  The most recent dive licence issued for the wreck, which was last year, included 20 detailed conditions and it allowed the owner to raise the ship's telegraph which he intends to put on display in a local museum.  The licence reflected the formal memorandum of understanding that is in place between the Department and the owner of the wreck to facilitate our greater mutual co-operation and collaboration.  The owner is particularly interested in researching the cause of the second explosion that caused the ship to sink 18 minutes after the original strike.  The licence also recognised the unique and extensive knowledge of the wreck site by the person undertaking the dive, the particular hazards and difficulties involved and also the fact that the nature and location of the artefact that was to be brought up was known and that it had previously been filmed on the seabed.  Under this particular licence, which is the last activity undertaken on the wreck, a number of significant recoveries were made, which will ultimately go on display in a new museum planned for the Old Head of Kinsale.</p></speech>

I have a number of questions to address to Mr. Allen.  This is one of the most important wrecks off the coast of Ireland.  It has massive archaeological importance and is also a war grave because well over 1,000 people went down with the ship and were lost with it.  I understand that typically the process that existed until very recently was that a licence was provided with an input from the sub-aqua archaeological teams that exist and from the National Museum.  It would have included methodologies and some level of supervision.  We know from newspaper and other reports there was a significant break in that practice, which happened very recently at the last dive between August and October, and for some reason no methodology or archaeological supervision were provided.  In addition, the telegraph, which was the subject of the dive, was damaged and lost.  We will tease out the argument that could be made about why there was a significant break in the practice later.  The telegraph is an important item in trying to understand the bearing, route and location and the orders from the captain to the engine house of the ship.  The fact that it was lost probably gives a certain level of corroboration to the views of the people in the National Museum.</p><p>They believe that they should have had an input and that there should not have been a break with that practice.  Why was there a significant change in the practice on these types of ships around the coast of Ireland?</p></speech>

In this case, there was a departure from what would have happened previously.  We have issued a significant a number of licences over the years to the owner of the wreck and to people acting with his consent to carry out investigations for recreational dives and so on.  In the normal course, the requirement would have been for a methodology.  The issue arising in respect of the last dive was the fact that there was no requirement for an archaeologist to be present when the recovery of the telegraph was being made.</p> <p>  We have a memorandum of understanding with the owner.  We have a long-standing relationship of a business nature with the owner.  In the past, he has complied with the requirements set out.  He made an approach to the Department explaining that an exercise was going to be undertaken in bad weather.  He had an envelope or a chronological window of opportunity to do it.  The weather was bad.  He sought our agreement to carry out the dive without the necessity of having an archaeologist present.  Representatives from our underwater archaeology unit in the Department proposed to go down there.  In the end, the officials decided not to go.  The licence condition was adjusted in order that he was able to carry out the dive without the necessity of having an archaeologist present.</p> <p>  Particular factors arose in the case that lay behind this decision, some of which I referenced at the outset.  I will repeat them.  For starters, the diver who was to carry out the recovery had unique and extensive knowledge of the wreck site because he has been down there innumerable times working for the owner of the wreck under a licence granted by the Minister.  Second, the question of the arduousness of the dive and the hazard to human life arose.  This is relevant in the context of making someone go down or getting someone to go down who did not necessarily need to go down.  The fact that the nature, composition and location of the artefact concerned were known was relevant.  We knew where it was and what it was.  It was not something delicate.  It was a metal object.  The artefact has previously been filmed on the sea bed.  We had film of it and we knew where it was.  We knew its disposition and so on.  Finally, the intention of the owner was to place it on display in a local museum.  Having considered all these factors, we agreed, on this occasion and because of the particular circumstances and the particular artefact and the fact that there was no particular risk to the artefact concerned, to allow him to proceed without the need for the presence of an archaeologist.</p> <p>  As the Chairman said, he was taking up a telegraph and pedestal.  They were in two separate pieces.  If the committee wishes, I can read out an extract from the report of the dive that we received.  The report explained what actually happened.  I am keen to read out the report to illustrate that the fact that no archaeologist was present had no impact or bearing on what happened in this case.</p></speech>

He is the only person who could report on what actually happened on the sea bed because he was the only person down there.  Normally, an archaeologist would not be on the sea bed in any event.  The fact that he was working for Gregg Bemis would not change the reality.  In other words, even if an archaeologist was present, we would have received the same report.  He said that the lift bag burst.  The telegraph was sent to the surface using a lift bag.  He said that the procedure was the same as that used to recover five items during the 2011 dive survey.  He said the pedestal was tied to the shot line and hauled up as he did not have a second lift bag, since only one item was intended to be recovered.  They had thought the item was in one piece.  They were only taking up one item.  The lift bag was tested prior to use and was in perfect working order.  However, when used in this instance, a pin hole in the bag allowed the air within it to escape when it was on the surface.  The defect could have occurred when entering the water from the boat or when those involved were on the wreck site, where numerous jagged steel edges were detected.  Essentially, the lift bag burst and the telegraph went back to the bottom.  The pedestal that was tied separately to the shot line came up and was kept up.  This was simply an equipment failure that would not have been-----</p></speech>

Beforehand, there would have been a partnership arrangement.  I find it difficult to understand why a change was made to the licence conditions at the 11th hour, without the opportunity for the National Museum of Ireland to express a view on the matter.  I gather that the museum is also concerned by the implications of the decision for the regulation of future operations at underwater archaeological sites.  Moreover, museum officials were shocked to hear that the telegraph has now fallen to the sea bed at a depth of some 90 m and had been lost and presumably damaged or destroyed.  There is a clear rupture of a relationship that had been in place in advance of all other dives.  Is that not correct?</p></speech>

A one-off decision was made in this case to allow this artefact to be recovered because of the particular circumstances that I have outlined.  I gather the Chairman is referencing a letter from the director of the National Museum of Ireland to me.  He indicates in the letter that the telegraph went back down.  He said that this was the consequence of permitting such work to be undertaken without the appropriate archaeological methodology in place.  I wish to point out that the telegraph was brought up in the same way as previous recoveries had been effected.  It was an equipment failure that caused it to go back down again.  It was nothing to do with the methodology or the presence or otherwise of an archaeologist.  The bag burst and it went back down.</p></speech>

If archaeologists had been present, it is highly unlikely that they would have gone down on the dive.  That has not happened in the past.  In general, the archaeologist would possibly have been on the deck or would have been on the boat and might have been in touch by radio with the divers.  However, the idea of an archaeologist going down is not something that has been effected in the past.  Archaeologists have not gone down in the past.  They would have been present on deck but they would not have been unable to intervene to save the artefact.  The bag burst.  It was an equipment failure.</p></speech>

I will provide a copy of that letter.  The letter sets out the exceptional circumstances, including the fact that weather conditions were unlikely to facilitate more than one dive and the imperative to minimise the risks associated with operating at the extremes that would apply, as well as the business I referenced earlier about photographic evidence and so on.  I said that given those exceptional circumstances the Department was agreeable, on a once-off basis, to the recovery proceeding without a prior survey, subject to the other conditions of the licence being observed.  That letter issued to Mr. Bemis on 12 July.  I note that the letter from the director of the National Museum of Ireland is dated 14 July.  That letter refers to the dive having taken place the day before.  I gather the dive took place the day after, that is to say, 13 July.</p></speech>

It is a relatively modern wreck in comparison with what we normally deal with, such as Spanish Armada vessels, where clearly completely different criteria apply than would apply to the <i>Lusitania</i>.  The artefacts we are talking about are made from bronze and are less susceptible to damage.  They are more durable than the timber from a medieval ship being lifted from a seabed.  The Drogheda boat, for example, taken from the River Boyne was a wooden medieval ship and we have also dealt with Corrib longboats, which are also timber.  The circumstances that apply in the case of the <i>Lusitania</i>are radically different than those which arise in the generality of cases.  The dive was being undertaken by someone who had more experience than anybody else of the dive site of the <i>Lusitania</i>.  The whereabouts of the artefact was known and its nature was known; that it was a metal, bronze object.  It had been filmed previously and the actual loss is, we hope,  temporary.  Divers went down subsequently to try to find it and they intend to make further efforts in that regard.  The loss was caused by equipment failure and not through any flaw in the methodology or the approach taken to raise the artefact.  </p></speech>

I am not saying it would not happen again; it is unlikely to happen again but it certainly has no precedent that would apply more widely than in this case.  The conditions attached to this licence differed to conditions attached to previous licences, which differed to conditions attached to licences before that again.  The licences are geared to reflect the circumstances of the particular operation involved.</p></speech>

The National Monuments (Amendment) Act 2004 states &quot;The Minister shall consult in writing with the Director of the National Museum of Ireland before granting a consent under paragraph (<i>a</i>) of this subsection.&quot;  Is this committee to understand that the displeasure articulated in the letter to Mr. Allen by the director of the National Museum of Ireland will not be repeated and that the original partnership arrangement that existed would be adhered to in the future?</p></speech>

From his letter, it appears to me that the director of the National Museum of Ireland was especially concerned that the absence of an archaeologist had resulted in the artefact being lost.  It was explained to him that this did not happen.  In his letter the director also asked to be reassured that this turn of events could be understood as exceptional and that it was not representative of a major change of policy regarding the protection of underwater archaeological heritage in Irish waters.  The museum had been consulted about this licence.  The licence had been issued.  One condition was taken out of the licence subsequently, which is the one we are talking about.  The museum had been consulted about it so it was entirely <i>au fait</i>with what was happening.  The museum had, I presume, come back to us.  We consult the museum as a matter of routine regarding every underwater archaeological licence.  In many cases the museum does not come back to us at all and we hear nothing back.  If we do not hear anything back within ten days we assume there is no objection.</p></speech>

How many days in advance would that have been?</p></speech>

We either got an observation saying it had no objection or we received no reply.  In fairness, in most cases we get a reply, whereby the museum gives us some comment or states it has no objection.  I cannot say what happened in this case and I would have to check it for the Chairman.  That process, however, would have been undertaken.  The museum would have seen the licence, as it would have seen previous licenses.  This licence is very similar to previous licences, which would have been approved and seen by the museum also.  I wrote back to the director and my colleague is giving the Chairman a copy of the letter.  He was given an explanation as to what had happened and was assured it was not a precedent for anything else, did not represent any change and was simply a one-off relaxation of the requirement for an archaeologist due to the particular circumstances of the case - as I have outlined - and that there was a lot of knowledge about the artefact.</p> <p>  We must also take into account that the owner has pledged to make this artefact available to a local museum, along with previous lifts from the wreck.  We must be conscious that if an archaeologist is required to be present there are costs associated with that.  It is a question of being reasonable in the circumstances.  In this case I took the view that given what was involved in the circumstances there was not a lot to be gained by the presence of an archaeologist.  The temporary loss, as I have explained, of the bridge telegraph is not permanent, hopefully.  It would have happened with or without an archaeologist. </p></speech>

It is important to articulate there is a strong fear among the archaeological community and those who are interested in the heritage and history of the wrecks in the waters around Ireland, as well as anxiety that we ensure a maximalist view regarding the criteria and law to make sure this heritage is not lost to future generations.  Many people will still question the fact of the change in the approach to the licensing and the loss of the bridge telegraph artefact at the same time.  Mr. Allen said there would be a likelihood of the telegraph being found.  What is the likelihood?</p></speech>

The diver has given us an interim report that explains he has gone down a number of times since to try to find the artefact.  He has failed so far to find it.  He has said that if necessary, he will get a remote operating vehicle that will go down and to film the seabed remotely.  They are quite determined to get it back.  I see no reason not to.  There would have been no damage done to it as this is a robust, heavy piece of bronze that would not be damaged by falling.</p></speech>

The biggest risk is trawlers and nets being trawled across the wreck.  This has damaged the wreck significantly in the past.  The telegraph that was brought up when they were down looking for the original one in October had net filament attached to it.  It had been dragged from its original location to where they came across it.  We have an agreement with the divers, formalised in the memorandum of understanding, that if they come across artefacts that are clearly dislocated from the wreck, they are entitled to take them up and recover them.  They have done this with the second telegraph artefact.  They have undertaken to go back down to look for this.  I hope it will happen in the coming year and we will get it.</p></speech>

Logistically it would be a nightmare.

A measure such as that would take the Naval Service to be on site and that is not practical.  In theory, a fishing boat dragging a net across the wreck is probably in breach of the underwater heritage order because it is disturbing the wreck, which is a protected structure.  In theory, the Minister's consent is needed in that regard but in practical terms it is difficult to know what we could do.</p><p>There is probably nothing practical that can be done to protect it.  There is a German submarine in Cork Harbour and the same issue arises with that.  There have been difficulties in protecting it from people diving down and interfering with it.  If the problem is not nets, it can be something else.  We will come back to the committee on that but, to be clear, there is no precedent.  It is a one-off because of the particular circumstances.  I have responded to the director of the museum and asked him to confirm that for me.  I did not hear back from the director of the museum so I am assuming he is now happy that the undertaking has been given and that it has not happened.<br/><br/>It is probably the case also that the licence we are talking about now was the last such licence given for the <i>Lusitania</i>.  There is not a subsequent one where the committee could see that we have reverted to the norm in a different circumstance.</p></speech>

We now turn to considering the current situation in Bus &Eacute;ireann.</p><p>I welcome the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, to our meeting which is the fourth in a series convened by this committee to discuss the very challenging situation that presents itself at Bus &Eacute;ireann.  We have heard from the acting chief executive officer, CEO, of Bus &Eacute;ireann, Mr. Ray Hernan, the unions and most recently the National Transport Authority, NTA, and the Department of Social Protection.  I am delighted to welcome the Minister and his officials, Ms Deirdre Hanlon, Mr. Liam Daly and Mr. Garrett Doocey.  I thank them for giving us their time this morning.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p></speech>

At this very delicate time of a potentially serious industrial relations dispute, I believe we are all required to exercise great care so that all opportunities are taken by the company and its employees to resolve the issues that have led to this threatened strike.  However, I am happy to dispel some of the often well-intentioned but incorrect claims that have been made by some committee members about the causes and origins of this dispute.  In particular, I want to rebut suggestions that I am not doing enough to enable a settlement to be reached by the parties.  I will also deal with the false claim that the dispute stems from policy failure by my Department.</p> <p>  Let me address the issues one by one.  First, Deputies have criticised the level of public service obligation, PSO, funding and called on me to increase the allocation.  That is exactly what I have done.  This year the total PSO has increased by 11%; last year it increased by 13% overall and Bus &Eacute;ireann itself actually benefited from a 21% increase in its subvention in 2016.  As committee members are repeatedly informed, however, subvention is provided for PSO services only; under law it cannot be provided for commercial services.</p><p>Deputies have raised the issue of the funding of the free travel scheme and have called on me to examine whether it requires modification.  Again, that is exactly what I have done.  Both the Minister for Social Protection and I have instructed our Departments to examine the funding levels of that scheme and report back to us very shortly.  That examination is a short and focused piece of work and is progressing well.  I expect that the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and I will resolve the issue satisfactorily.</p><p> Some Deputies have alleged this Government is attacking the public bus service in rural Ireland.  That is nonsense.  We are actually expanding the public bus service in rural Ireland through increasing the amount of PSO funding to Bus &Eacute;ireann, as I have already pointed out, and also through providing a 24% increase in funding to the rural transport programme.  Again, we need to stop confusing issues.  The vast majority of people in rural Ireland who use a bus travel on a PSO service or a commercial operator other than Expressway.  There are no threats to those services. In fact, they are expanding.  They are seeing increasing passenger numbers, and in the case of PSO services, increasing taxpayer funding.</p><p> In relation to rural Ireland, I have been consistently clear in assuring rural communities that the NTA will step in and assist in cases where connectivity is threatened.  That was confirmed to the committee by the NTA itself.  That is exactly what has happened.  In response to Bus &Eacute;ireann's announcement of a small number of route changes to some Expressway routes, the NTA has published its assessment of the impact and has taken action as it deemed appropriate.  This includes extending PSO services for Athlone and Westport and better timetabling for rural transport services in Clonmel.  The NTA has said it will keep the situation under review and would welcome feedback on its proposals.  However, let us be clear - those actions by me, actions which this very committee has called for, will not resolve the issue.</p><p> Expressway is a commercial business unit run by Bus &Eacute;ireann and it is losing money.  The committee has heard that the company estimates around &euro;9 million worth of losses in 2016 with no improvement forecast.  Expressway services account for 10% of all Bus &Eacute;ireann passenger journeys in a given year.  The vast majority, 90% in fact, of Bus &Eacute;ireann passenger journeys are made on a taxpayer funded service: either a PSO service provided by the company under contract with the NTA or else a school transport service provided by the company under an agreement with the Minister for Education and Skills.  There are no funding issues with either PSO or school transport services.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is fully compensated for those services it provides.</p><p> The core issue that must be resolved is how to tackle the unsustainable losses on Expressway commercial services, which of course cannot be subsidised by the taxpayer.  Contradictory assertions have been made about what should be done to deal with these losses in Expressway.  Some committee members seem to think that I should intervene directly in internal matters of the company.  To do so would mean cutting across the role of not just the company but also trade unions in terms of agreeing work practices and terms and conditions.  I believe that the employees and the company are best placed to agree those types of issues and that external interference is unnecessary and unhelpful.  Obviously, I recognise that any such agreement will of course require flexibility and realism on both sides.</p><p> Such calls for ministerial intervention overlook the established role and expertise of the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court in assisting employers and employees in settling often very contentious disputes.  These bodies are best placed to assist the company and trade unions in reaching an acceptable agreement.  I believe we should be willing to learn the lessons of the past and recognise the benefits of allowing the industrial relations bodies to act in accordance with their statutory mandate and best professional judgment.</p><p> My view should never be mistaken for a lack of concern about the very serious financial problems that have beset Bus &Eacute;ireann or an indifference to the genuine anxieties of employees about their future.  I want the company to return to a path of viability and I wish to see the company prosper in the interests of its employees and its customers.  This can only be done by the company reversing the losses in its Expressway business and targeting those elements of its business model that are not competitive.</p><p> Negotiating with its trade unions is crucial to ensuring the company can compete effectively and return to profit in its Expressway services.  I am as impatient as any member of the committee to see a return to stability in the company's industrial relations.  A willingness to engage constructively and a spirit of compromise on both sides is critical to achieving this.  I also reject any suggestion that I, as Minister, or my Government colleagues are seeking a very low-cost employment model for Bus &Eacute;ireann.  This is not the case nor is privatisation part of the agenda.</p><p> I welcome the company's statement on Monday that it is committed to protecting basic pay rates and enhancing these as circumstances permit.  In order to compete, I consider that Bus &Eacute;ireann must continually adapt, modernise and respond to customer demand.  Some Deputies seek to blame Bus &Eacute;ireann's current problems on the reforming Public Transport Regulation Act 2009, which was brought forward by my predecessor, Mr. Noel Dempsey.  I think that shows a lack of understanding of what that Act seeks to do, which is to promote public transport and put the passenger at the heart of public transport policy.  I believe that the growth in the commercial bus market that we have witnessed shows that the customer is responding positively to these changes and that, fundamentally, more people using public transport is a good thing.  That is not to say that I am unwilling to review the effectiveness of existing legislation.  I hope to have opportunities to engage with the committee and other stakeholders on how the legislation can be strengthened to promote further the interest of passengers. </p><p> I know, and hope that the committee knows also, that different stakeholders have different roles to play as we move forward with resolving this issue.  I have taken actions which are proper to my position as Minister and which I believe will assist with the overall resolution.  However, my actions cannot substitute for the actions of others.  Those others are the employer and employees.  Their brief now is to engage in serious discussions and reach an agreement that will restore Bus &Eacute;ireann to a sustainable future.</p></speech>

That is a situation that nobody wants to see.  What steps is the Minister, as the major shareholder, taking in order to bring both sides closer to an agreement?  As I have stated on numerous occasions, I urge the Minister to take a more proactive role in this dispute in order to halt any strike action that may take place.  The Minister has stated previously that he cannot and will not get involved in this dispute.  One of the reasons he gave was the involvement of the Workplace Relations Commission.  It is claimed that should we have a prolonged period of strike action, we will face a very real possibility of Bus &Eacute;ireann having to close completely.  I put it to the Minister that should this happen, it will be too late to take action.  What we need now is the Minister's intervention in this dispute.</p></speech>

As Deputy Fitzpatrick and everybody listening knows, there are institutions and State bodies that have the expertise, ability and enthusiasm to bring these two groups together.  It would be absolutely wrong, and would play no helpful role, for me to suborn them and take their job and role, which they are paid and set up to do.</p> <p>  Deputy Fitzpatrick asked what I have done to resolve the situation.</p><p>I have done several things which should be able to help.  I have increased the amount of PSO funding.  It increased last year and it is increasing this year.  I am looking for it to increase again in the coming years.  I have consistently addressed the problems in rural Ireland that have been raised by many members of this committee.  I have consistently said that any routes which are closed will be filled in a way that ensures no area of rural Ireland lacks connectivity.  This was confirmed by the NTA here last week.  I think it successfully sets a firm foundation for the two parties to meet.  As I said in my opening statement, the review of the free travel funding is a necessary adjustment that probably should have been done some time ago.  It will make the situation more acceptable and will make it easier to reach a settlement.</p></speech>

In my view, the letter created a situation that could only lead to strike action.  If Bus &Eacute;ireann is serious about resolving this dispute, the letter must be withdrawn.  Will the Minister confirm to the committee that he supports our call to Bus &Eacute;ireann to withdraw the letter?  This committee wrote to the Minister to ask him to make such a request to the company, but we have yet to get a reply.  Will the Minister ask Bus &Eacute;ireann to withdraw the letter?</p></speech>

I am afraid I will not be able to do what the Deputy is asking.  I do not feel it would be the right thing to do.  As the Deputy knows, the WRC talks have adjourned.  The company and the unions have both stated that they wish to return to the WRC.  I see no reason that opportunity to return to the WRC to re-engage should not be taken up at the earliest possible opportunity.  I think that should be done without any preconditions on either side.</p></speech>

There are some very strong feelings involved.  It would be wrong for me to say I am on one side or the other in this dispute.  Such a statement could be misread.  I will not enter into this situation by taking sides.  This is a matter for the company and the unions.  They must resolve it by themselves without my intervention.  I do not doubt that this is what will happen sooner or later.</p></speech>

The calls for my intervention are very understandable.  The frustration felt by the Deputy is very understandable as well.  Those who are calling for me to intervene are not explaining what they think my intervention will do.  That is the difficulty I see here.  I think any such intervention would be a distraction and a signal that I am somehow going to come into this industrial relations battle with money to offer.  I do not have money to offer.  Perhaps I can ask the Deputy a question.  What would be my role in intervening?</p></speech>

Sometimes there are obstacles in disputes.  The main obstacle in this dispute is the letter.  I do not mean to keep repeating myself.  As a former businessman, I think the letter is wrong and is not achieving anything.  The Minister is a good Minister who does not want to see Bus &Eacute;ireann closing.  The letter is not achieving anything and should be withdrawn as a gesture of goodwill.  The removal of this obstacle would get the talks going.</p></speech>

I do not want our questions to overlap.  I have an observation for the Minister.  He mentioned that PSO funding has been increased.  I previously helped local communities in disputes when Expressway services were bypassing particular villages.  A solution was found that was agreeable to all sides to establish connectivity to Expressway services.  I ask the Minister to leave aside the industrial dispute for a moment.  Is he saying he will increase the PSO subsidy sufficiently to solve all the problems around the country?  The issue for Bus &Eacute;ireann, particularly in rural Ireland, is that its Expressway services cannot compete because they have to call to every town and village.  I imagine that if all these issues are to be solved, the solution will involve a drastic increase in PSO services.  The Minister spoke about a passenger-centred approach in the context of the announcement that the Athlone-Westport service is to be discontinued.  Is he saying that the people along the route will not be disadvantaged by the closure of that service?  Will a PSO service be put in to replace this service?</p></speech>

I cannot guarantee anything but that is our objective.  It is on an upward trend and I am very hopeful that it will continue as such.</p><p>We are talking about three routes being closed down and two being revised with reduced numbers.  As the Deputy will know, when that happens the NTA has committed to making an immediate assessment of whether people will be disadvantaged, how bad it is and whether the NTA needs to move in and substitute or put in more buses.  What happened the other day when the Athlone to Westport route was closed down, as the Deputy mentioned, the NTA reacted fairly quickly.  Let me read out its statement.  The Deputy will be familiar with the numbers.  The review reads:</p><blockquote>Bus &Eacute;ireann have announced a withdrawal of route 21 which currently provides 28 services per week from Westport to Athlone.  The Authority has determined that there is a public service obligation to continue to provide services between Westport and Athlone.<br /><br />The Authority is considering amending the existing PSO service 440 to provide 4 services per day in each direction from Westport to Athlone supplemented by 2 services per day in each direction on route 440A from Westport to Ireland West Airport Knock.  This would result in a doubling of the existing services.<br /><br />A more detailed assessment report will be published later with details of the route and timetables.</blockquote> <p>That is a pretty proper response.  The proof of the pudding is in the eating.  We have seen in that case, and in all other cases, an immediate response by the NTA.  Maybe it was prepared for all of these routes but I do not know.  It did say yes and provided a pretty fast replacement fleet. </p></speech>

It is disappointing that he needed to come back here, only four weeks after his last visit.  On the last day he said that he would share with us the NTA's review into the licensing system.  Perhaps the review is full of commercially sensitive information that he might need to redact.  Four weeks ago he promised that we would receive the review and we received it late yesterday evening.  The delay shows that he did not prioritise this issue.  We now realise, despite what he said at the time, that the review has more to do with procedural and compliance issues than the commercial viability of the Expressway service.</p> <p>  I have confidence in the unions, that represent the workers, and the management working together under the auspices of the WRC.  I do not have confidence in the Minister due to the level of commitment that he has shown regarding this problem since he assumed office nine months ago.  I remind people that he has been aware of this issue since then and his Department officials have been aware of the issue in excess of 12 months yet we are where we are today.</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned the PSO increase.  Has the number of passengers availing of the PSO service increased over the past number of years?  On the last occasion the Minister was here he claimed that the number of passengers using public transport had increased and that the majority of them used PSO services.  Has the PSO increased?  Incidentally, the PSO figure is less than it was in 2008.  How is that an increase?</p></speech>

I concede that members will not have had time to digest the report.  Members will have plenty of time to digest it soon.  The report could not be just produced for members.  It needed redaction, which I had warned and told members about.  It was not just a matter of producing the report.

They will give him a full idea of what has been redacted.  It would be a pity if commercially sensitive information got into the public arena.  I know I can rely on him not to put the information in the public arena when we have assisted him.  I offer the Deputy a briefing on the redactions at a time that is convenient to him so that he is fully aware of matters.  I ask him to be reasonably discreet with the information when he gets it because it has been taken out of the public arena specifically for commercially sensitive reasons.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the D&aacute;il motion.

The Deputy is well aware that 2008 was the high point and of why it fell.  The economy and the country's finances were in absolute turmoil, something on which we will not comment now.  The Deputy is well aware that during the recovery the subvention has increased.  It has been increasing for the past two years and will increase during the next two.  The Deputy should acknowledge this.</p> <p>  In his motion the Deputy addresses the issue of free travel.  As I said, I have instructed my officials to undertake a short and focused piece of work, with their colleagues in the Department of Social Protection, to analyse the funding associated with the scheme and make recommendations to the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and me.  </p> <p>  The Deputy addressed the NTA's licensing system.  The NTA already considers issues such as rural isolation and sustainable competition when considering applications from operators.  These are all included in the Deputy's motion which I am addressing and to which I have responded.  He should not tell me that I did not respond to it.  I have not responded where he requires an intervention, about which the Deputy is correct.</p> <p>  The Deputy addressed the NTA's power to approve or reject route amendments.  He is aware that it has completed a review of the legislation and submitted a report for my consideration.  The report, a copy of which he has in his hands, focuses on the process and procedure of the licensing system.  I will consider what amendments are required.</p></speech>

The Minister has answered the one question I asked.  </p> <p>  The rate of subvention has not kept in line with the numbers using the route.  It is welcome that it appears that there is an extension to the PSO service to Athlone and Westport to compensate for the removal of the commercial route.  A number of months ago, when we suggested some of these routes would never be commercially viable, although they were socially viable and required, and that they might need to transfer from Expressway to PSO provision, we were told it might need to be put out to tender.  Has the Minister confirmed that the routes do not need to be put out to tender?  When will the changes take effect?</p></speech>

I presume that before coming here today the Minister would have asked whether they needed to be put out to tender and cited it as a victory and an answer to the problem.  Surely, he should know whether they need to be put out to tender.  Surely he would have asked when it would be put into operation.</p></speech>

My lack of confidence in the Minister to date stems from the fact that he has not got involved, but he can redeem himself by establishing a forum for all stakeholders.  The unions and management cannot address the huge deficit.  We need matters of policy, legislation and the licensing regime to be addressed.  Only the Minister can do this by bringing together the NTA, his Department, the Department of Social Protection, management and the unions.  The deficit of &euro;30 million will not be addressed through the WRC.  Surely the Minister will acknowledge that he does not expect a deficit of &euro;30 million to be worked out at the WRC.</p></speech>

I am interested in an industrial dispute being sorted out by the two parties involved.  If all of the parties were to come together and discuss policy, it would be a completely different matter.  For now, it is imperative that the two parties get together to avoid a strike.  If I was to call together all interested parties in a large forum, it would make it almost impossible to solve the dispute in the time allotted.  I never said I was against speaking to various stakeholders or parties, as the Deputy knows.  I am perfectly happy to do so.  However, I will not get involved in an issue which is a matter between two parties.  The Deputy's suggestion is perfectly reasonable.  It is a perfectly reasonable request outside the heated atmosphere of an industrial dispute.  My place at a table with all of the parties involved would be inappropriate and improper as they would ask me to do things I could not do.</p></speech>

The Minister has a role to play.  He did not answer the one key point of the question as to whether he believes the &euro;30 million deficit which management states needs to be addressed can be addressed at the WRC?  If not, where does the Minister believe it can be addressed?  It must be addressed through increased PSO payments by the Department of Social Protection and how licences are issued.</p></speech>

He never was when he was a newspaper columnist.  I have scanned through the document which we received late yesterday evening.  I have not read it in detail.  One of the points made in the document on the regulatory framework, which is crucial, deals with how Bus &Eacute;ireann competes with the commercial provider.  Commercial providers have a role to play.  I am not against them.  It states:</p><blockquote>The definition of what comprises a public bus passenger service lies at the very heart of any regime to regulate same.  The experience of the authority to date has identified that the current definition has substantial shortcomings which undermined both the operation and enforcement of the regime.</blockquote> <p>When can we expect a process to be put in place whereby these shortcomings can be addressed?  Does the Minister have plans to bring forward legislation to address them in order that we can ensure competition on the routes and enforcement in a fair and equitable manner?</p></speech>

The first was the lack of subvention.  The subvention to our public transport network is the lowest in Europe.  The second was the deliberate saturation of routes.  The third was the gross underfunding of the free travel scheme whereby just 41% of the average journey fare is covered.  The fourth is the fact that Bus &Eacute;ireann's accounts show that &euro;41 million was pilfered, if one likes, from Expressway services and pumped into the PSO services because of State underfunding.  I ask the Minister to accept that this financial crisis was caused by bad policy and mismanagement.  I ask him to acknowledge the workers had no hand, act or part in creating this crisis.</p> <p>  Does the Minister accept the unions' contention that the motorway network was saturated to over-capacity?  The NTA has claimed there is enough service volume to cover reduction in frequency on the Dublin to Limerick and the Dublin to Galway routes.  If there is enough volume of service there, does it not prove that it can comfortably say that it can reduce and remove the public transport network.  That just proves the saturation policy.  Does the Minister want me to repeat what the NTA stated?</p></speech>

The NTA has repeatedly stated that it leaves no rural community behind.  However, it is talking about removing an existing service and replacing it with another that will also cost money - perhaps even more.  There is no logic to that.</p> <p>  The Minister had previously said that replacement services might not be as frequent or as comfortable as current services.  The Minister is saying to the people that they need to be prepared to accept a second-class service.  Does the Minister feel putting out such a statement is acceptable?  It is not something to be proud of to say the people need to accept a second-class service that will not be as frequent or comfortable.</p> <p>  Does the Minister accept that EU Regulation (EC) No. 1370/2007 provides enough scope for the State to provide support for Bus &Eacute;ireann if it could be established, through a review of all Bus &Eacute;ireann current commercial services, that some of its services could be deemed as socially necessary?  Since taking up office did the Minister ever call for such a review given that it could be a mechanism to save the service?</p> <p>  We are blue in the face from asking the Minister the same questions over and over again.  Is he still prepared to sit back and do nothing?  He has repeatedly refused the call for all stakeholders, including his Department, involved to sit around in negotiations to try to find a resolution.  I ask him not to give the spiel that he will not get involved in an industrial dispute.  It is not necessarily an industrial dispute.  It was forced into this situation.  The Minister was asked if representatives from his Department, the NTA, and Bus &Eacute;ireann management and unions as the main stakeholders would get involved and he repeatedly refused.</p> <p>  Today, in the jaws of an all-out strike across the public transport network on Monday, he is still refusing, knowing full well the disruption and chaos it will cause along with the worry for people living in rural communities that services will be cut.  While knowing fully that the unions had pleaded with him to get into negotiations and knowing what lies ahead on Monday, he still refuses point blank even to send officials from his Department at the 11th hour to try to prevent this disruption.</p> <p>  Given that I and others have repeatedly asked the Minister and have listened to him repeatedly refuse, if he still sits here today and says he will not call for all stakeholders to be involved, then he and the Government will be directly responsible for the chaos that will ensue across the public transport network on Monday.  The Minister has been given every opportunity to try to resolve this.  Bus &Eacute;ireann's management bulldozed ahead with its cuts on 16 January.  This week it then sent out a further inflammatory letter knowing it would fuel the situation and the Minister still sat back and did nothing.</p></speech>

It is somewhat rhetorical language that the Deputy is using, saying that I sat back and did nothing.  That is patently false.  I can see what she is saying but that is absolutely untrue.  I have been extraordinarily active in this area.  What I have not done is the one thing she has asked me to do.  That does not mean inaction - quite the opposite.

I do not accept that.  That is not necessarily true.  It is an alternative service.  The overriding principle is that there must be some service for rural communities and there must be some service for people where routes are withdrawn.</p></speech>

In Clonmel, to which the Deputy referred, the NTA determined that no action was needed at the minute except for changes to the rural transport timetable to facilitate connectivity to commercial services.  That service calls at more towns and villages than Expressway.  According to the NTA, a detailed assessment is carried out in a separate report of the Dublin-Clonmel situation because the conclusion of that report is that there are sufficient services offered by Kavanagh's route 717 which operates 98 services per week from Clonmel to Dublin via Kilkenny.  The NTA states that some amendments will be required for local links service 817 C serving Carrick-on-Suir to Grangemockler to maintain the public service obligations, PSO, and connect to JJ Kavanagh's 717 service.  One could not possibly say that Clonmel is in some way isolated as a result of those cuts.  It is not.</p></speech>

I am not waving at the Minister, I am holding up my hand.  There are five days to go before a national bus strike which may well be the prelude to a national public transport strike.  Last year, the Minister said being Minister for transport was a doddle.  The Minister came to the committee on 1 February, exactly one month ago, and I asked him what the cost to the taxpayer would be were Bus &Eacute;ireann to become insolvent.  I asked him the cost in terms of payroll taxes forgone from 2,600 workers, redundancy payments for 2,600 workers and social welfare payments for those workers.  The Minister replied that off hand he could not give me those figures but could probably get a figure worked out.  He said he would get back to me.  It is not a week or two that have passed, it is a month.  I am asking the Minister to get back to me now.  What would it cost to make Bus &Eacute;ireann insolvent which, as Mr. Hernan says, could be on the cards by May, which is in a matter of weeks?</p></speech>

He has painted the situation and said we are looking at the possibility of the insolvency of Bus &Eacute;ireann by May.  We are now in March.  It is a matter of weeks.  I am asking a straight question.  What will it cost the taxpayer for that insolvency in terms of payroll taxes forgone, redundancy payments and social welfare costs?

That should be moved up the agenda as a matter of urgency as I said at the start.  After five days, where is the urgency?  Also, Bus &Eacute;ireann should be compensated for having to go off the motorways to service towns and villages while competing with private operators.  A way must be found to do that and where there is a will, there is a way.  However, there is a lack of will here, which is the real issue.  Rather than find &euro;9 million or &euro;10 million to avert the strike and the crisis, which is peanuts in the greater scheme of things, the Minister prefers to put at risk &euro;59 million in payroll taxes from 2,500 Bus &Eacute;ireann workers, hundreds of millions in redundancy payments and hundreds of millions in social welfare payments.  He does so in order to make Bus &Eacute;ireann a low-pay company and to facilitate his privatisation agenda.</p> <p>  The Minister will become the first sole shareholder in history to watch his company head towards insolvency and over a cliff, all the while proclaiming there is nothing he can do.  Since Bus &Eacute;ireann was established in 1987, we have had many Ministers for transport.  We have had Jim Mitchell, Ray MacSharry, John Wilson, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, Charlie McCreevy, Brian Cowen, Michael Lowry, John Burton, Alan Dukes, Mary O'Rourke, Martin Cullen, Noel Dempsey, Pat Carey, Leo Varadkar and Paschal Donohoe, with Seamus Brennan having served twice.</p><p>There are some proper tulips in that group, but none of them ever brought the national bus company to the brink of insolvency.  It is happening on the watch of the current Minister, Deputy Ross.  Where is the urgency?</p><p> I do not know if the Minister considers himself to be a gambler.  Tesco gambled that the public would not support the Tesco workers if they went on strike, and have learned something in recent weeks.  Business was down by 80% in the shops where pickets were placed.  Business was down by 30% in other shops with no pickets.  There is a mood among the public of sympathy for ordinary working people who have not had pay increases for years when they stand up for their rights.  Bus drivers have not had any for eight years.  These are men and women who drive ordinary people to work, into town, to the next village, and who live in their communities.  There is a real danger that the Minister is misjudging the public mood here.  Fine Gael put out the slogan coming up to the previous election, "Keep the recovery going".  It got it completely wrong and misjudged the mood.  If the Minister thinks the public will not be with the bus drivers and against him and his Government, I suspect that he is misjudging the public mood as well.</p></speech>

A bus driver who has worked for decades for Bus &Eacute;ireann, provided the best years of his life and given good service to the company is, with many others I know, facing pay cuts of &euro;6,000, &euro;7,000, &euro;8,000 or more on the basis of the company's proposals.  How can the Minister tell me that is not a proposal for a low wage company?</p></speech>

That is why we provide a PSO levy.  Not all people live at either end of an Expressway route.  They live in the towns and villages in between and the Expressway services offer transport provision to those people in a way that many other transport providers do not.  Will the Minister address that particular issue with regard to there not being a PSO levy?  That particular aspect is not wholly commercial.  In addition to that, just under 20% of the population carries a travel pass.  Some commercial operators do not operate with the travel pass, so Bus &Eacute;ireann and the Expressway services would provide in the absence of that.</p><p>Where is the Minister's responsibility in this as a shareholder?  It was defined by the National Transport Authority, NTA, at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts that he attended a couple of years ago that, &quot;The primary function of the Government, as a single shareholder, is to manage the company.&quot;  The NTA also stated that:</p><blockquote>We simply advise the Department on what might be the appropriate levels of subsidy for public transport if we want to grow public transport in the State. [...] However, the Department manages the finances of CIE, as companies, because it is the shareholder.</blockquote> <p>I ask the Minister, as the shareholder, if there is sufficient capacity within Bus &Eacute;ireann to find savings that can help to resolve this dispute.  It looks to me as if there are only three things he can do.  He can increase fares, cut services or find savings.  Is there sufficient capacity identified within the company to provide services or to plug the gap?  Otherwise, what is being negotiated is simply something that involves cuts in the incomes of those who on the front line.</p></speech>

I do not believe it is up to me to do that, as a shareholder.  I believe it is up to me to monitor what is going on, but not to identify the issues, because that would be getting involved in the nitty-gritty of the wage negotiations.  That is a matter which will have to be resolved.  I think it is acknowledged by both sides.  I heard the union say last night that there is room for efficiencies, and the management is looking for savings elsewhere.  My view is that the company has to be run on a commercial basis, but the cuts which can be made or extra revenue which might be raised is a matter for the company.  That is why we have it there.  I have not identified specifically what can be done, and I will not be doing that.</p></speech>

That shows a lack of understanding about what the Act seeks to do, which is to promote public transport and put passengers at its heart.  The Minister asks us to take in good faith what he is saying in the statement.  He seems to have changed his opinion on the NTA.  He has left a trail behind him, showing his attitude to CIE and public transport.  He said in 2013 that:</p><blockquote>The National Transport Authority is a captive, a quick learner of the quango culture.  It was set up in 2009 to supervise Ireland&rsquo;s public transport shambles.  It went native immediately.  It has been highly politicised from Day One.  Its board is picked by the Minister.</blockquote> <p>The article continues:</p><blockquote>It serves a real purpose. It shields the Government from the political charge that it was the villain that put up public transport fares.</blockquote><p>The fares went up because the subvention was cut, which is something the Minister lauded at the time.  He was supportive of the cuts because he thought it would force a change in the governance of CIE and would bring savings.  Those savings have not materialised.  Does he believe there are savings that can materialise to avert this strike?  If not, the only thing being negotiated is cuts in incomes.</p></speech>

The Deputy is trying to draw me into the same situation as others, which is to get involved in something where it would not be helpful.

I am not asking the Minister to become involved in the industrial relations.  However, the parties must have something to negotiate.  There must be the funds to negotiate.  Other than that, what the Minister said in his opening statement about low wages and so forth is nonsense.  If the only thing that is available to negotiate within the industrial relations framework is a sizeable cut in the income of some of those who are negotiating, is it really a negotiation?  I am asking the Minister if he has identified a tolerance within the company that there is a sufficient income, because it says it is almost insolvent.  Is there sufficient tolerance within that company to have a basis of negotiation that is different from cuts for the people who drive the buses?</p></speech>

I am glad Deputy Murphy, like everybody else, realises the gravity of the situation.  The company is also saying that, unfortunately, it will be painful.  Saving this company will be very difficult.

The authority I wish to criticise is the NTA.  It has acted like a widow whose husband was only buried in the past week and who walks out the following day with a new man.  The NTA has stepped in and straight away proposed alternative replacements to the routes that Bus &Eacute;ireann proposed to abandon.  There is no doubt that the Minister's constituency would like to see the Luas extended but what would happen if the NTA told the Minister's constituents that it would give them a couple of horse-drawn trams to fill the void?  I am sure there would be uproar.  There is a proposal to abandon some major Expressway routes and there is the issue of private operators on the so-called same routes.  I ask the Minister to take two days out of his diary to travel the Expressway route on one day and travel with the private operator on the next day to the same destination, for example, on the Cork to Dublin route.  The Minister will see a big difference in the time and alterations in the route.  How can that be a like-with-like comparison?  We seem to be up against a stone wall on this issue.  That is the reason we are saying some finance should be made available.  It is not like with like in terms of routes and competition.  It is not the same.  The NTA is doing its best to defend its role, telling the Committee of Public Accounts as late as last week in response to Deputy Aylward that Bus &Eacute;ireann can alter its Expressway routes.</p></speech>

The Minister mentioned that he was not in a position to wave his cheque book.  That is fine, but at the same time he is talking to the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, to look for more money.  How can Bus &Eacute;ireann talk to the unions and talk to the NTA about routes when it does not know what Deputy Varadkar will give it down the road?  It has not approached Deputy Varadkar and said, "Perhaps if you gave us this amount of money we could compromise or deal with the workers and save some routes in the meantime".  It is a loaded comment, but I believe the Minister should get involved.</p></speech>

The question has been asked previously.  It is fine.  I will address the Deputy's questions as well as I can.</p><p>He is talking about how individual routes like the Cork-Dublin route are operated.  The like-for-like comparison of individual routes is a matter for the NTA and not for me.  I see the point the Deputy is making.  As I have said previously, if there are problems in a particular area, the NTA will move in to ensure there is connectivity in that area.  It has done this in the past.  It is perhaps a little unfair to criticise the NTA for what it has done.  It was very prompt in its response.  I do not normally congratulate semi-State bodies or State agencies too rapidly because I do not think it is a particularly necessary thing to do.  However, I should say that the NTA's response in each of these cases has been commendable.  When the closures or reductions were announced, the NTA moved in and said what it was going to do.  It should be noted that the private operator on the Clonmel-Dublin route calls to more towns and villages than the Expressway service does.</p><p> It has been suggested that Bus &Eacute;ireann is negotiating without knowing what the situation is in respect of free travel.  As this dispute is not directly linked to the free travel negotiations, it would be somewhat difficult to say how much the company is going to get.  The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, has made it fairly plain that he does not want the issue of free travel to be exclusively linked to an industrial relations problem.  We have been very active on this issue.  We will continue to regard it as a matter of urgency.  We can be optimistic that the talks between my officials and the Minister for Social Protection's officials are going ahead in a very satisfactory way.  I hope we will be able to resolve these issues reasonably soon.  I think everybody recognises that because the levels, charges, prices and fares were fixed and frozen in 2010, there is a need for reforms in this area.  We do not yet know whether those reforms will take place immediately or next year, but the talks are progressing well.  Regardless of our political differences, we all want the anomaly that needs to be remedied to be addressed.</p></speech>

I want to comment on what I have heard so far.  I am listening to this with my hat from outside of the D&aacute;il on me.  The public is listening to us as we prepare for the buses to be pulled from the road next week.  It is possible that this will have a contagion effect on other bus, DART and rail services.  I cannot imagine how angry people must feel as they listen to a highly-paid Deputy who has been appointed as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport saying that it is not his job to intervene, that he does not identify the actual positions of cuts here and there and that it would be inappropriate, unhelpful and improper for him to have anything to do with interfering in this dispute.  The Minister's comments do not make an iota of sense to individual members of society who will be standing in the lashing rain throughout the month of March as they wait for some kind of bus service, or to workers and their families who will be on the picket line and left without wages, security or certainty.  I ask the Minister to listen to what he is saying.  I know he is not lying to us, but I suggest he is failing to take responsibility for a national disaster.  He is not making an everyday decision about whether there should be a route here or an increase there.  If this strike takes place, it will be a national disaster.  The Minister needs to listen to what he is saying.  He should think about this issue from the point of view of Joe Public and indeed the workers.</p> <p>  I have given the report a cursory glance because we received it at a late stage.  I would like to ask a number of questions and make a few points.  There has been a 111% increase in capacity on the Dublin-Limerick route over recent years.  That capacity was awarded to private operators by licensing through the NTA, but the Bus &Eacute;ireann service on the route is being cut.  The NTA's comment on that cut is that a high volume of services already exists on the route.  Of course that is the case.</p></speech>

What will happen to the Dublin-Derry route if Translink services are cut as a consequence of Brexit?  There are cuts coming down the track in Northern Ireland.

We do not have much time.  I have two questions for the Minister.  I would also like to make a few points.  Have the cuts to services that have already been announced been risk assessed in terms for access for people with disabilities, who are stakeholders in all of this?  As members of the public, they have a right to use a public service.  As we have heard, it is a public good.  I asked the Minister about this in the Seanad recently.  It would be useful if he were to set out what he intends to do to on a year-by-year basis to make public transport accessible for people with disabilities in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  My understanding is that the private operator which provides the route 717 service from Clonmel to Dublin Airport, which has been mentioned by the Minister and others, does not have accessible vehicles.  An accessible fleet is used on the X7 Expressway service from Clonmel to Dublin Airport, which is being taken offline.</p><p>Both those operators are licensed as public service operators and should be operating on an even keel and making sure disabled people can participate in that.</p><p> I understand that the automated voice system alerting passengers with hearing and visual issues is in place and is not being used.  These are some of the issues that are not going to get solved in the next week or two but they are issues about the accessibility of a public service for all members of the public, young and old.</p><p> Drivers are not being trained to use the wheelchair lifts.  In professional bus driver competency training there is a module on drivers being able to assist people with disabilities.  My understanding is that the module is not being provided to drivers and it is supposed to be under the EU regulations we have taken on.  I have also mentioned the issue that in Dublin Bus and other city fleets there is long-standing provision for people with disabilities and people in wheelchairs having accessible spaces.  They are often used by other people and at the moment there is no way of preventing other people from using those spaces when people in wheelchairs need them.</p></speech>

Is it the Minister's policy to extend services after 6 p.m.?</p></speech>

Private operators do not take people with travel passes; Bus &Eacute;ireann is required to take them yet on that route, no PSO subsidy is provided.  On a fairness basis, are we seeing a situation where the losses are artificially inflated because no PSO subsidy is given but Bus &Eacute;ireann has to take people who have a free travel pass?  Would the Minister accept that the PSO model in place is outdated, needs to be looked at again and needs to provide for a modern Ireland?</p></speech>

I do not know whether it is a matter of contention but it is a fair thing to comment on.  It would not be that hard to find out but no member of my Department has done that.  It would not be up to them to do it.

This is the second in a series of meetings to discuss the issue of road safety.  Previously, we heard from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, and the Road Safety Authority.  We are joined today by representatives of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Road Victims' Association.  I am delighted to welcome Assistant Commissioner Michael Finn, who deals with roads policing, major events and emergency management in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; Chief Superintendent Aidan Reid, Garda national roads policing bureau; Superintendent Con O'Donohue, Garda national roads policing bureau; and Ms Donna Price, Mr. Leo Lieghio, Ms Gillian Treacy and Mr. John Wilson of the Irish Road Victims' Association.  The topic of discussion is very sensitive.  It is a tragic matter and I reiterate my comment at the start of the previous meeting that, as a committee, we express our sympathy to everybody in the room and everybody who might be watching the proceedings who has suffered a bereavement or other loss in respect of road safety on our roads.  It is a very sad topic and, unfortunately, it has probably knocked on every door in the country, as it were, at this stage.</p><p>Before we commence, in accordance with procedure I am required to give the following notice.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I invite the assistant commissioner, Mr. Michael Finn, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-01a.681" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Finn" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017030100002#S00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for the opportunity to address them.  My colleagues, Chief Superintendent Aidan Reid and Superintendent Con O'Donohue, are very experienced members of the Garda traffic bureau.  This is my first appearance here in my new role.  If I do not have all the answers to all the questions, I will revert to my two colleagues.</p> <p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a very important role to play in road safety, given that we are the primary enforcement agency.  Our goal is to save lives and reduce the number of families who suffer the trauma of losing a loved one.  We are committed to ensuring our roads are a safe place for all who use them regardless of where they live, the day or the time of year.  We are out there every day of the year, including Christmas Day.  Unfortunately, this is the nature of policing and road fatalities.  In our enforcement role, we are very committed to putting more people into traffic to enforce our road traffic legislation.  We are committed to making greater use of our analytics and technology in order that we can have smarter policing.  We are committed to ensuring all our activities are focused on achieving the outcomes we have set out in the Government road safety strategy to reduce the number of deaths and serious injuries on the roads.</p> <p>  As of last Friday, our collision data were on a par with 2016.  Today we are up on the same period last year by two fatalities.  On the way here this morning, we got news of another fatality.  There is some good news in that our serious injury accidents are down 30% on last year.  Last year, our fatalities increased by 16% or 18%.  It was very disappointing for us.  The previous year was a very good year for us and it was our lowest year on record.  It is disappointing to see an upward trend again.  The chart in my written submission shows there is a good news story in that we have reduced the number of fatalities and serious injuries.  We cannot be complacent.  The statistics for 2016 show the necessity for all of us to be more focused on and committed to reducing the number of fatalities on the roads.</p> <p>  Drivers and passengers of vehicles continue to be the category in which we see the greatest impact in fatalities.  Last year, 35 pedestrians died, which is 19%.  The bulk of the fatal accidents occurred in the 100 km/h and 80 km/h zones, which are our national primary routes and national regional routes.  Only approximately 4% of accidents take place on motorways.  This reinforces the significant role our road engineering plays in road safety.</p> <p>  The 16 to 35 age group are the cohort that account for most of the fatalities.  There were 79 fatalities in this age group last year.  The other cohort in which we see high numbers of fatalities are those aged 66 and over.  They accounted for 44 fatalities last year, which represents 23% of our accidents.  Pedestrians and cyclists make up a large part of that group.  As people get older, their chances of being able to survive a road accident are reduced.  It is a serious cause of concern.  We are still very much focused on our Government target of reducing fatalities to 124 and serious injuries to 330 by 2020.  It is a major challenge.  While we realise we cannot do it alone, we have a very significant role to play.  There have been very good news stories for Ireland and where we have come from.  We are joint fifth or sixth in the EU for the number of fatalities per million.  We still have a lot to do.</p> <p>  Despite the drop in our numbers, our level of enforcement has remained proportionally high over recent years.  Driving under the influence has an impact on approximately 29% to 30% of fatalities.  Of the cohort involved in those fatal accidents, approximately one third have no insurance and 15% are driving while disqualified.  This is a very serious concern when we link those three statistics together.  In 2016, we had a 9% increase in our drink-driving and our checkpoints were up 2%.</p> <p>  Our Christmas campaign was very successful in the impact it had.  We had a very positive, strong media campaign which captured the attention of the entire community, not just our own people within the organisation.  We also increased our enforcement activity for Christmas.  Early indications we had after a week or two that there was a spike in drink-driving reinforced our vigour for our Christmas campaign.  At the end of it, there had been a 34% increase in drink-driving.  While it is not a good news story, it shows the level of drink-driving.  We had improved our rate of compliance with drink-driving laws.  This evidence shows there is a serious issue which we need to tackle.  To date in 2017, the trend for driving under the influence seems to be continuing.  There has been a 14% increase this year so far.  We have not got the message out to everybody.  We will focus on the message.</p> <p>  We issue fixed charge notices, FCNs, for drink-driving and we have issued more than 5,700 since 2011.  Almost 50% of them are in the 50 to 80 mg per 100 ml blood alcohol category, followed by 31% in the over 80 mg per 100 ml category.  The 20 to 180 mg per 100 ml "specified driver" category accounts for 20%.  There is a 75% payment of these FCNs, which means our time in court is reduced significantly.  Any garda will say one of the most contentious cases is going to court to contest a drink-driving case.  To have 75% of the charges paid up front without having to go near court is a great saving for us.  It means we have more people out on the road longer rather than sitting in a court.  The FCN is a positive story for us.</p> <p>  In 2017, we will have roadside breath testing for cannabis, cocaine, opiates and benzodiazepines.  For the fist time, we will have an offence of exceeding a specified limit for the presence of cannabis, cocaine and heroin.  We will be able to take people to court.  In the past, we had to prove impairment as well as the presence of the drugs.  With technology, we can measure the amount of each of those drugs in the system.  We welcome it and look forward to being able to enforce the legislation.</p> <p>  Speed is very important to us, given that it is a factor in approximately one third of accidents.  It is very much in our focus.  Speed plays an even more significant role in fatalities among motorcyclists.  It is one of our top priorities.  I recently saw a survey that stated one in five people admitted exceeding the speed limit.  This statistic tells a story.  However, 80% of people are complying.  There is a high level of compliance.  Our GoSafe vans in the speed enforcement zones have proved very successful.  There is approximately 99% compliance with the vans.  Their presence is impacting on road safety and reducing speeds.</p><p>That is a very good news story and we will certainly be continuing that programme.  We signed a new contract with GoSafe and we will roll out and extend that programme.  The committee may not be aware that we extended the number of speed detection zones last year, going from approximately 770 to over 1,000.  That means there were 355 new speed detection zones around the country.  We still get inquiries from various communities around the country asking why they do not have such a zone.  They have proven to have a very positive impact in reducing fatalities within the zones.  When we started, 30% of fatalities occurred in those zones, but five or six years later that rate is down to 15%.  It certainly had an impact.  We will not be able to maintain that because we have extended the number of zones and it will take a while before we come to that level again as we increase our coverage across the country.  The speed detection zones and the GoSafe vans are a good news story for us on the speeding issue.<br/><br/>I was looking at some statistics on the detections for those GoSafe vans before I came here today.  If we compare the volume of traffic coming through on a daily basis with the increase in fines, there is an increase in the level of compliance with speed limits across the country.  That arises when we factor in the increased amount of traffic and the amount of detections.  It is certainly a good news story overall and we will pursue it.  There is a very high rate of compliance with regard to speed limits.  Our role is not all about detections and we are quite happy to have GoSafe vans out there and reducing the number of people caught speeding.  Our role is about getting compliance through enforcement.  We are not out to catch people, although sometimes we are accused of that.  To me, we are successful if we are catching fewer people.  It would be good news for all of us and the GoSafe vans have proved it.<br/><br/>With regard to general to general road traffic enforcement, there were fixed charge notices, FCNs, for all sorts of offences last year.  We issued over 326,000 fixed charge notices for offences relating to speed, safety belt usage, a lack of tax and so on.  Like the FCNs for drink-driving, there is a 74% payment rate for them.  When I was a young garda, every time we detected an offence relating to speed or anything else, we ended up going to court to prosecute.  The garda&iacute; spent a significant proportion of their time in court but now we have an almost 75% payment rate, our garda&iacute; will not have to spend that much time in court.  The FCN statistics are another good news story.<br/><br/>From June this year we will have a third payment option.  In the past, a person going to court could argue that a notice was not received but that excuse will no longer be valid; the day a person gets a summons for court, he or she also gets the option to pay the fine instead of going to court.  A person cannot then go to court and say he or she would have paid the fine if he or she got the opportunity.  We will now give people the opportunity to pay the fine, which will have an impact on the number of cases of people going to court and people getting off with speeding because of an argument that the fine was not received.  That loophole will also have a good impact on enforcement.  We will have online payment facilities for non-penalty point offences.  If there is a fine for not displaying tax, a person can go online and pay the fine, as people do for most utilities nowadays.  That will assist us and the motoring public.<br/><br/>Non-use of seat belts and mobile phone usage are in our category of &quot;killer offences&quot;.  Our enforcement strategy for 2017 will be very much focused on that.  Last year we had approximately 10,000 FCNs for not wearing a seat belt.  By and large, that has reduced significantly over the years.  I had a look and ten years ago the number was something like 22,000.  The level of compliance is there and even in modern cars, the alerts are there and people are more compliant.  There are people who are still out there committing these offences and, unfortunately, it has a very significant impact when somebody is involved in a collision and is not wearing their seat belt.  Our road safety campaigns have illustrated the issue only too well.  The other area I should flag as a cause of concern for us is mobile phone usage.  Despite technology and people having the facilities of hands-free kits in their car, there are still many people out there using mobile phones on a daily basis in cars.  They are probably a silent killer in road traffic accidents.  It is very hard to detect their usage after the incident but surveys carried out by the Road Safety Authority suggest the level of usage is still ongoing.  We will certainly target that in 2017.<br/><br/>Another area in which we have seen significant activity is taking a number of vehicles off the road that are either defective or where people are using them with no insurance etc.  Last year we saw an increase, with an additional 6,000 vehicles taken off the road.  We are talking about 30,000 cars seized from the public because of no insurance or something seriously defective in the car.  That level of activity will continue because those people are putting other road users at risk either with vehicles being defective or having no insurance to drive those cars.  We welcome any new legislation to help in that regard.<br/><br/>With regard to the policing plan for 2017, as I stated at the outset the killer offences of speeding, impaired driving caused by mobile phone usage and non-use of seat belts will certainly be targeted.  We are very determined to maximise our full potential in terms not just of using the traffic corps but the district personnel we have in every Garda station around the country.  We got massive buy-in at Christmas time with the extra contribution they made.  They did more checkpoints than we did in the traffic area.  That is something we need to leverage and our policing plan for 2017 is built very much around that type of engagement.  We have more people out there in every division and Garda station around the country because of the new recruitment campaign.  There are 800 new garda&iacute; on the streets and we want to engage with them, ensuring they are tuned into traffic and focused in terms of road traffic policing for 2017.  We certainly see them as having great potential and being a great asset to us.  They are young and energetic and we want to exploit that.<br/><br/>Roads policing is very much about depriving all the criminals on the road and we have had some good success.  The other day we had a checkpoint on the N7 and with the use of our automatic number plate recognition technology we were able to &quot;ping&quot; somebody passing by who we knew has an interest in drugs.  Lo and behold, we made a significant drugs seizure from that.  I suppose that is smart policing in terms of using all our resources to our benefit.  Our enforcement campaigns do not have to relate solely to drink-driving or traffic and they can be useful in a cross-section of elements.  Using technology can be of great advantage to us in that regard so it is up to us to leverage that and make more of it in future.  As I stated, we have shown with GoSafe and robot vans that we can detect more people initially, which results in more compliance.  Technology will help us and we can leverage it in that regard.  Chief Superintendent Reid will describe later his initiative with the port tunnel where we will put in cameras and use technology to detect people speeding through the tunnel.  We have the technology and capabilities so the investment in a modernisation programme for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will give us opportunities to leverage that and do more with less, which is what we are trying to achieve.<br/><br/>There are other initiatives we are involved with through the year.  We are involved in many of the European Union operations and we work with agencies such as the Road Safety Authority, the Health and Safety Authority and the Revenue Commissioners.  There are multi-agency checkpoints and it is not just about policing; there are other agencies with an interest and our working together has been very beneficial to us in the past.  Our public awareness campaign was very much about complementing the Road Safety Authority and media campaign for Christmas and it is very useful to us.  We have a big following on Twitter and Facebook and we get great feedback when we put up a car seized for driving with no insurance or tax, for example.  The public welcomes us doing that and we can use that as a message to get out there to the cohort who drive and use social media as their method of engagement.  They do not read <i>The Irish Times</i>or listen to RTE 1.  We must focus on them and consider how to engage with them through the likes of Twitter and Facebook.  That has been very beneficial for us so far.<br/><br/>We also go to schools with the Road Safety Authority's safety programme.  We have taken road shows out there.</p><p>It has had an impact on tomorrow's drivers.  If we engage with them today and get them into good practices we will reap the benefits.</p><p> I am sure the committee is interested in resources, which have been a challenge for us.  Over the past five years the numbers in the traffic corps have declined, as did the numbers in the organisation.  The numbers are in my presentation.  New graduates are coming out of Templemore however, and the Commissioner has agreed to a 10% increase in the traffic corps for 2017.  Only last week I brought a proposal to her that we would bring each of the 800 people now in training into the traffic corps for a ten-week cycle so that they get an appreciation of the importance of the role they have to play in road traffic.  We can give them the experience and tools so that when they are out doing their day-to-day work, they will be focused on traffic.  The impact of that this year will bring benefits for enforcement and getting the message out on road safety. </p><p> We are not too badly off for new cars and equipment.  Last year the investment came and we have new high-powered cars for the motorways.  That helps us to have a presence.  There are several initiatives in the pipeline for working with the driver licence and Superintendent O'Donohue will allude to that shortly.  We can do much more if we link with the agencies such as the Road Safety Authority, RSA, on the licences and the courts.  Utilising technology we can do much more, faster and better, which will increase our presence on the road. </p></speech>

We provide practical and emotional support to road victims and their bereaved families free of charge, seven days a week.  We advocate for the bereaved and injured victims, and work with all road safety stakeholders in our combined efforts to reduce road dangers.  As members of the Victims Rights Alliance, we also work to ensure the transposition and full implementation of the EU directive on victims of crime into Irish law.  IRVA is a member of the Global Alliance of NGOs for Road Safety and of the European Federation of Road Traffic Victims, both of which have UN consultative status and through them, we are also members of the United Nations Road Safety Collaboration.</p> <p>  We are regularly consulted by the World Health Organization, WHO, and we were asked to speak as a panellist at its Post Crash event, which focused on the post crash response and on justice for victims at the second high level conference on road safety in Brasilia in 2015.  Following on that, the WHO has now asked us to contribute to an e-learning module on legislative aspects of road safety and in particular to one module dedicated to the experiences and needs of those affected by road traffic injury, relative to legislation.</p> <p>  I founded IRVA with members of the Defence Forces who had lost colleagues on the roads, following the death of my son Darren who was killed in 2006 while travelling to college in Athlone, the same year that the Road Safety Authority, RSA, was launched.  It was a particularly horrific year on our roads, not just for my family but for the 365 families who had a loved one killed on the roads that year, not to mention the many more who were seriously injured, estimated at five times that number.  During that time, together with others, we were invited to address the transport committee when mandatory testing for alcohol following fatal and serious injury was included for the first time in our legislation.  Quite unbelievably, and to the horror of all of our families, we found that in nine out of ten fatal crashes, the surviving driver was not tested for alcohol or drugs.  Our families have had to live with the consequence of this failure, a grave injustice.</p> <p>  Since 2006, we have almost halved the deaths on our roads, and we commend the RSA, the Garda, the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, and all stakeholders on their efforts in helping to bring this about.  However, no life is dispensable and even one avoidable death is one too many, knowing as we do, the utter devastation caused to our families and communities.  Our lives have been destroyed forever.  There is still so much that we can and must do to save lives.</p> <p>  It is 11 years this very month since my son Darren was killed and 11 years also in September, since the RSA was established.  These were 11 years during which we have had too many more totally avoidable deaths and serious injuries, despite all of our efforts.  We are still fighting for more resources for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, for improved Garda investigations and for required changes in legislation.  We are still fighting for criminal charges, prosecutions and sentencing that reflect the seriousness of the crime committed of taking a life or affecting the quality of a life.  These are real crimes and not just misdemeanours and we feel there should be a vehicular manslaughter charge included in legislation to reflect how seriously society sees these deaths, a charge of careless driving in such circumstances being clearly inappropriate. </p> <p>  The Garda investigation forms the cornerstone for justice.  In the absence of a thorough investigation, in which there are mandatory checks of all of the known contributory causes of these fatal collisions, we will not see prosecutions which reflect the taking of our loved ones' lives.  We firmly believe that criminal court cases highlighted in the media in recent years are sending out the wrong message and that they are certainly not acting as a deterrent.  Too few of these deaths are resulting in prosecutions for the crime of taking a life or affecting the quality of a life.  Fewer than 15% result in a charge of "dangerous driving causing death", the only homicide offence.  Why?  We believe there is too much victim blaming and that there is still no routine and mandatory checking of all of the known contributory causes of these collisions.  This is vital work which must be done in all cases to determine what crimes have been committed before a file is forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, with the Garda recommendation regarding prosecution.  This must change now both in order that justice is seen to be served and to act as a deterrent.  Our road safety work and data collection must also be truly evidence-based.  Road deaths should be investigated and prosecuted like other homicides, with hearings taken out of the lower courts, and heard instead in the higher courts before a jury.  Road crime is real crime and road victims are entitled to the same information, support and protection that is afforded by our criminal justice system to other victims of crime.  Just because a death is caused by a car it is no less of a death.  These deaths and serious injuries are not accidents and terminology is vitally important.  Our legislation and road safety efforts should reflect this.</p> <p>  We are aware that there has been some discussion in recent weeks about the Minister's proposal to change the penalty for some drink-drivers.  We support these changes wholeheartedly.  The evidence is there that if the changes deter people from drink-driving, lives will be saved  Some Members of the Oireachtas may have concerns about the impact of that on rural areas but there is no proposal from the Minister to change the law as to when an offence has been committed.  I am sure no Member of the House wants to be seen to condone anyone in whatever pub in whatever part of Ireland drinking and driving and endangering others.  The same law applies to all of us.</p><p>I know the Minister's new proposal will come before this committee in the weeks ahead.  I hope that the committee will look at the proposal with an open mind and listen to the evidence to back it up instead of listening to the lobbying of vested interests.  This is something that the citizens of this State want.  I had a brief discussion with Deputy Troy at our vigil outside Leinster House.  I was encouraged to hear that his party has not yet taken a definitive decision to propose amendments to the legislation, despite media coverage to the contrary.  We appeal to the esteemed members of the committee to listen to the voices of the victims who have lived this nightmare and who have, unfortunately, experienced the injustice of our legal system which has failed to meet our needs.  Members have in their hands the power to enact legislation that will save lives.  We cannot excuse or condone drunk or otherwise impaired driving at any level, so I ask members to please think very carefully of the message they will be sending out.</p><p> I am joined by Leo Liegheo whose daughter Marsia was killed by a hit and run driver, and by Gillian Treacy whose son Ciar&aacute;n was killed by a drunk driver.  Gillian herself sustained horrific injuries in that crash.  We are joined by retired garda John Wilson.  Together we are happy to answer any questions the committee may have.</p></speech>

I will first go to Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick to ask his questions of the witnesses.</p></speech>

I thank its representatives for appearing before the committee today.  I was deeply moved to hear the families' stories.  To lose a family member as a result of a traffic accident must be traumatic, but to lose them as a result of drink-driving or dangerous driving must be heartbreaking.  I understand completely the families' frustration and I will, as they will, continue to fight for continued resources for the Garda.  I would like to show the families my complete support and I look forward to working with them in the future to ensure our roads are a safer place for all.  What measures would the families like to see implemented immediately that would make the roads a safer place?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-01a.688" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Donna Price" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017030100002#V00400"><p>Many measures must be taken.  We need to see more enforcement on the roads.  The Garda must be properly resourced for this to happen.  We were happy to hear from the assistant commissioner that the traffic corps levels are going to be increased by 10%, that 800 new garda&iacute; will be introduced and that they will take part in traffic enforcement for ten weeks once they qualify.  This is welcome news.</p> <p>  As I said in my opening statement, another measure would be to send out the right message that these are criminal offences, that they are crimes and not just misdemeanours.  Terminology is important and we cannot continue to refer to them as accidents.  They are not accidents because they are totally avoidable and preventable.  We would prefer that the terms crashes, collisions or road crimes were used.  We want to see an end to careless driving charges, especially in cases such as those seen recently in the media - and I am sure the members have heard of them - where repeat offenders with many previous convictions have killed people on the roads and they are getting away with charges of careless driving.  Clearly this is inappropriate.  Let us call them what they are.  It is vehicular manslaughter and the sentences in legislation should reflect the seriousness of the crime committed, which is the taking of a life and affecting the quality of a life.  More severe sentences are required, not because we are looking for vengeance or restitution but simply as a deterrent and for people to realise that if they are going to drink and drive, they are committing a crime and they are endangering our families on the roads.  Quite simply, we cannot condone this behaviour.</p> <p>  My opening statement also suggested that when the worst happens and a person is killed or injured, then we must ensure there is a prosecution in most cases.  We are not seeing that.  For instance, the homicide offence, which is the only one under the legislation, is for dangerous driving causing death.  We performed a quick analysis for the four year period 2009 to 2012 to find there were 99 such cases, yet in those same four years there were 799 road deaths.  What happened to the other 700 cases and why do we not read about those cases in the media?  They were not all as a result of victims' error on the road.  We are seeing many prosecutions for minor road traffic offences such as no insurance, no tax, bald tyres or perhaps exceeding the speed limit, but no mention of the fact that a death has occurred as a result of that offence.  We need to see more cases for vehicular manslaughter before the courts, not just the lesser and minor offences.</p> <p>  For that to happen we must have thorough Garda investigations.  I know the garda&iacute; carry out the investigation but they may be led down a certain route to the exclusion of all others.  We advocate for a garda investigation that will thoroughly and routinely check all the known causative factors of these crashes before the file is sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions with the Garda recommendation regarding a prosecution.  It would be a box-ticking exercise with somebody overlooking these files to ensure the tachograph chart, for instance, has been checked for the working hours for commercial drivers, that the mobile phone records have been checked, or that the tests for blood alcohol and drugs levels are checked.  These things should be done routinely.  Unfortunately, we found that until it was mandatory under legislation to test for alcohol, it had not been done with the surviving driver in 90% of cases.  We ask that these checks are part of the legislation.</p> <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na implements the law to the word.  If it is not in the legislation that these checks must be done and shall be done, then the likelihood is that they will not be done in all cases.  The result of that is our families having to live with the consequences.  Without the Garda evidence that a crime has been committed, our families are left with no prosecution and we cannot prove, for example, that the death of our loved one was as a result of a driver texting on a phone.  We cannot prove it unless that check is carried out and the evidence is submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  It is vital.  The Garda investigation forms the cornerstone for justice and this is why we want those things included in legislation.</p> <p>  We also want the legislation to be consolidated.  As we know, the Road Traffic Acts go back to the 1960s and they are a maze.  One cannot navigate a way through that legislation without legal expertise.  The Road Traffic Acts are the most challenged of legislation so it is imperative that the law is modernised and updated.  It must be clear on what crime has been committed and what will be the penalty or punishment.  These are a few of the changes we think need to be made.  I hope it answers Deputy Fitzpatrick's question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-01a.689" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1331" speakername="Peter Fitzpatrick" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017030100002#V00500"><p>I would also like to welcome the assistant commissioner and his colleagues.  I was alarmed at the number of pedestrian deaths recorded in the 50 km/h zones - the assistant commissioner stated 16 - while there were no pedestrian road deaths recorded in the 30 km/h zone.  This is very revealing and it suggests that we must look at the 50 km/h zone and, where possible, look to have those zones reduced to 30 km/h, particularly in built up areas.  I am interested to hear the assistant commissioner's views on this and perhaps he can give some insight into why there is such a large difference between the two zones.</p></speech>

More than 40 people killed in the 50 km/h zone, 16 of whom were pedestrians.  Three people were killed in the 30 km/h zone.  It is a scientific fact that the lower the speed at which a vehicle is travelling, the greater the likelihood of the person surviving an impact.  The rule of thumb is if we could lower the average speed by 1%, we would reduce the chances of injury by 2%, serious injury by 3% and death by 4%.  I will put this into context.  If we can reduce the speeds in built-up areas, the net effect is that a pedestrian, a cyclist or other vulnerable road user has a greater chance of surviving a collision.</p><p>It is a no-brainer for us.  A lower speed is good news for us.  We welcome the introduction of even lower speed limits in some of the areas.  We support lower speed limits.    </p></speech>

While I welcome this dramatic reduction in the number of road fatalities, I am concerned that the number has risen in the past couple of years.  What is the reason for the increase?  What immediate measures can be taken to ensure we halt a worrying upward trend?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-01a.693" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Finn" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017030100002#W00300"><p>As I said in my statement, we welcome the good news that Ireland has reduced its number of fatalities over the past ten years.  A lot of work was done such as new legislation on drink-driving and the introduction of GoSafe vans.  All of this increased the public perception that one would be caught if one committed an offence.  The level of compliance has brought about a change, particularly in the behaviour of road users and, primarily, motorists.  The change in behaviour has been instrumental in reducing the number of fatalities.</p> <p>  Enforcement is a key aspect.  Our role is important and, hence, we have committed to increasing the size of the traffic corps to increase the level of enforcement and address the increases in the number of road deaths we saw last year and in the two preceding years.  Without doubt, enforcement has a role to play.  That is why it is important that we increase our numbers and, now that we have the resources, we have put extra resources into the traffic corps because new recruits have been deployed to the traffic unit.  We place importance on the traffic corps due to the undeniable positive impact it has on the number of fatalities. </p></speech>

Can the witnesses tell me why the figure is so high and rising?  How does the figure compare with other types of addictions?  What measures are needed to curb drink-driving in Ireland from the point of view of the Garda?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-01a.695" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Finn" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017030100002#W00500"><p>Enforcement is probably the most important item for us.  That is our primary role.  We are the enforcement agency so we must be visible.  We upped the ante with our  Christmas campaign and utilised all of the resources that were at our disposal to make an impact.  The 34% increase at Christmas time was because we were out there and so did more.  The media side of the Christmas campaign was powerful and even inspired our own people.  We could see from an early stage in our campaign how many people were prepared to drink and drive.  There must be a deterrent.  If people do not see a deterrent then they will continue to take a chance.  A combination of factors act as a deterrent and our presence is one of them.  To me, good strong legislation and a good penalty act as a deterrent.  All of this has an impact when people are deciding whether to chance driving home.  People weigh up certain factors when trying to make a decision such as the chance or likelihood of getting caught and the penalty if one is caught.  I support any measure that will convince people of the dangers of getting caught drink-driving.  I do not just mean the immediate impact drink-driving has on other road users.  I believe one reason that drink-driving legislation is contested so vigorously is because losing a driver licence has an impact.  I recollect from the time when I was a young garda on the street that drink-driving cases were vigorously contested in court.  People value their driver licence and the potential to lose one's licence makes people reflect.</p></speech>

Drink-driving is only classified as a road traffic offence.  It is time, in 2017, that drink-driving became a crime in this country.  It is a crime in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  Imposing a fine and a disqualification is not good enough.</p> <p>  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, has found it difficult to enforce tougher legislation that deals with drink-driving.  It is time that we considered introducing mandatory prison sentences for people convicted of drink-driving.  I suggest a period of three months to five years.  Has anyone here ever heard of an individual being sent to prison for drink-driving?  The maximum sentence that can be imposed for a drink-driving offence is six months imprisonment or a fine of &euro;5,000 or both.  It is very rare to hear of an individual being jailed for drink-driving in this country.  It is merely a road traffic offence.  If an individual shoplifts and steals chocolate or a pair of underwear from a shop on Grafton Street and is convicted in the District Court then that person has committed a criminal offence and is, therefore, a criminal.  The same individual can drink five times over the legal limit and if he or she is convicted in the District Court, it will be deemed a road traffic offence.  It is time we made drink-driving a crime.  Anyone who gets behind the steering wheel of a car while under the influence of alcohol or drugs is nothing more than a criminal. </p> <p>  In terms of the despicable sentence that was handed to the criminal who killed Gillian Treacy's son Ciar&aacute;n, the presiding judge, God bless him, handed down the strongest sentence possible.  Subsequently, the Court of Appeal overturned the sentence and reduced it by a couple of years down to six years all because of a legal precedent.  It is time that dangerous driving causing death was replaced with a charge of vehicular manslaughter that carries a 15 or 20-year sentence.  The measure would focus the minds of criminals like the man who destroyed the Treacy family forever.</p> <p>  In terms of the Deputy's original question, it is time that drink-driving was reclassified as a criminal offence and that harsher penalties were introduced.  I agree with the assistant commissioner when he claimed the solution is enforcement.  In many parts of this country the fear of getting caught is almost non-existent.  I respect Deputy Michael Healy-Rae in terms of other legislation that he has been involved in or commented on.  His reluctance to impose harsher penalties on drink-drivers is unfortunate.  I am very disappointed by his actions.  </p> <p>  As recently as last Sunday I spoke to an individual in Cavan.  He is a very decent and hardworking man yet, in 2017, he sees nothing wrong with going to the pub, drinking four or five pints and driving four or five miles home in his car.  The people in rural Ireland deserve the same protections as those who live in urban Ireland.  If we want to stamp out drink-driving we must make it a criminal offence and impose proper penalties, not just fines and disqualification.  We must ensure that anyone who is convicted of drink-driving is deemed a convicted criminal in the same way as a person who commits an armed robbery or serious assault. </p></speech>

Garda resources have been mentioned.  Has the assistant commissioner received a commitment that some of the 800 new recruits will be deployed to the traffic corps?  He has said that he is happy enough with the resources available, the data, new cars and everything else.  I have been lucky that none of my family has every been connected with a road death.  I have three children and the last thing I would want to get is a knock on my front door and being informed that something has happened to any one of my children.  Has a commitment been given to increase resources?</p> <p>  I agree with Mr. Wilson that we must seriously consider introducing a zero tolerance for drink-driving.  People already know that they are over the limit if they take one or two drinks.  That is why I maintain we must have zero tolerance.  I have three children and I have tried to convince them and other people that once a person has taken a drink that he or she cannot drive.  Zero tolerance would be worth it if the policy saved one life.  I would like to know the opinions of Mr. Wilson and that of the families present to zero tolerance for drink-driving.</p></speech>

We need to work on that cohort and the message that while 20 mg is not zero, bringing down the limits has helped to change the public's attitude towards drink-driving.  It was 100 mg when I was a young garda.  The penalties and enforcement, as Mr. Wilson has said, are the real deterrents to drink-driving and are going to impact most on it.</p> <p>  I was asked about resources.  We have committed to increasing our level of resources by 10% this year.  That is the start of it.  As more people come out of the Garda College, we will continue to build the traffic corps back up to the 1,000 we had in 2007, when our force was at its peak.  We have that cohort of young people who have joined An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na since 2014.  More than 800 have completed their training.  I have a commitment from our own senior management that I can take those young men and women into the traffic corps and give each of them that experience.  That will be valuable for changing their mindset about the people they engage with and to teach that drink-driving is something that we have to get out there and enforce no matter what part of the country we are in.  Deterrent is the biggest factor.</p></speech>

I drove a taxi for 20 years, and in that time I saw the disrespect there is for the law.  I was stopped about five times to be breathalysed.  There is an impression that one is not going to get caught.  I back everything Mr. Wilson and Ms Price have said.  I have campaigned for vehicular manslaughter to be brought in since Marsia died 12 years ago.  I would also like to see the confiscation of cars, especially from repeat offenders.  I find that this would have a huge impact on people, especially young people, if they thought their car would be taken off them for drink-driving or speeding.  If there are advertisements on a television that a person will have his or her car taken, I guarantee that it will cause a cut in road deaths.</p> <p>  If one uses Google to search for drink-driving, the first thing listed is a solicitor advertising an 80% success rate in getting people off charges.  Such things should not be allowed either.  The Members of this House have the power to do something to save lives in this country and to save other families from going through what we went through.  Justice for our families is long gone now.  We will never get justice.  We are not looking for revenge.  Do Members want to wait for that knock to come on their door or a phone call to tell them that a child or family member has been killed?  In this day and age, there is no excuse whatsoever for drink-driving or driving while impaired.  The warnings are all there.</p> <p>  I know zero tolerance for drink-driving is going to be difficult to achieve, but the proposal of the Minister, Deputy Ross, is not to reduce the limit, just toughen the penalty.  I beseech the Members of this House to act on this, support the measure completely, and toughen the sentences.  The consequences are drastic.</p></speech>

An opportunity to engage like this is very productive.  We are here because before Christmas, we as a committee wanted to bring forward hearings on the issue of road safety and the worrying trend last year where we saw an increase in fatalities on our roads for the first time in a number of years.  Collectively, all the political parties, though I can only speak for my own, want to bring forward legislation that will address the number of fatalities on our roads.  I am not as emotionally involved in this debate as the witnesses evidently are.  I sympathise with the families who have been bereaved over the years.</p> <p>  As one of the contributors said, we have to ensure penalties are proportionate.  We have to ensure that sentences reflect the seriousness of the crime and that there are deterrents.  What I am getting from the presentation is that the biggest deterrent is enforcement on the roads.  That has been backed up by facts.  In December 2016, there were 34% fewer fatalities on our roads because there was a greater presence of garda&iacute; on our roads and because there was an extensive media campaign about the consequences of drink-driving.  We seem to be focusing all our attention on drink-driving, which incidentally is not the biggest contributor to deaths on our roads.  If one compares it with to December 2014, there was a 24% difference when the Garda had a greater presence on our roads.</p> <p>  I welcome that Assistant Commissioner Finn has been appointed to his role.  It was left void for a long time and that in itself gave an indication of the commitment to road safety.  The most senior position in this area in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was left void, with nobody in a leadership role, and there was nobody at the management level that Mr. Finn speaks about to fight to secure the additional resources.  We want to welcome and acknowledge that.  The strength of the force is still 400.  Will Mr. Finn explain to me the difference between the traffic corps and roads policing?  He spoke about the number of people in the traffic corps and about roads policing.  For my benefit and perhaps that of others, will Mr. Finn explain the difference?</p></speech>

We are looking at calling the old traffic corps "roads policing".  We did not want the traffic corps to be out there for a sole purpose and not seeing other opportunities.  I mentioned the M7 recently with regard to drugs.  If we are there and we are policing, whether as a traffic corps member or whatever, if a car comes along and it pings garda&iacute; and they know it is a drug thing, they have to pull it over.  That is a bit of semantics on the names, but we are talking about the same thing.  Roads policing is about being on the road, enforcing traffic rules, and that applies to everybody.</p></speech>

That is positive because it will enable them to fill in voids or cover holiday leave in future.  When does Mr. Finn envisage that the traffic corps will be back at full strength?</p></speech>

At the moment, somewhere between 800 and 900 get into the organisation each year.  If we can continue or expand that, it would help us accelerate the numbers we bring into the traffic corps.  We are operating around that 10% figure.  It is what we have focused on with regard to resources that we are going to put into the traffic corps.  If we can get more people in or other factors come into play, we would certainly be open to it and I would welcome getting more people into the traffic corps.  I will be there at the management table looking for more.</p></speech>

It saves members of the traffic corps from going into court where the person who has been caught is fighting the case.  It gives Mr. Finn an opportunity to have more of his force out policing the roads.</p><p>I have a question about someone who is caught over the limit.  No one for a moment is condoning the behaviour of anyone caught over the limit.  What is the turnaround time from when they are caught?  What is the timescale for someone caught this evening?  It could not be me because I do not do it, but if I was caught this evening, how long would it take for me to lose my licence by going through the courts system?</p></speech>

Before I address that question, I wish to comment on the categories.  The rate is approximately 75% for the payment of fixed charge notices.  It is 82% for those with a blood alcohol concentration, BAC, of between 50 mg and 80 mg per 100 ml.  The figure is 75% for the people with a BAC of between 80 mg and 100 mg.  There is a greater level of payment among those in the category between 50 mg and 80 mg.  However, even at the higher BAC level, there is still a 75% payment rate for those who get disqualified &ndash; 75% still pay up.</p> <p>  Deputy Troy asked about the time for a case to get through the court.  It varies.  I would have to come back to the committee with an exact answer.</p></speech>

It depends on how busy the court is and whether the person is charged at the time.  Deputy Troy used the example of someone who was arrested today.  Let us suppose a driver is taken to a station and the evidential breath testing instrument is used.  Then, let us suppose we get back a reading straight away.  A garda can charge the driver and bring him before the court.  In that case it could be dealt with within a month or six weeks, given an adjournment and time for the defendant to get a defence in place.</p> <p>  Let us suppose the driver gave a blood or urine sample that has to go for analysis.  It would come back from the medical bureau in a couple of weeks.  Under that process, the driver is issued with a summons.  The court date depends on how busy the court is and the associated scheduling.  It could be six to nine months.  A small percentage could go outside that timeframe.  With a summons, it can take six to nine months and with a charge, the timeframe is probably within six to eight weeks.</p></speech>

Let us consider the same scenario except that the driver is issued with a fixed charge.  If the evidential breath testing results come back, the case of the driver will be checked to see whether the driver qualifies for a fixed charge.  The fixed charge will issue within approximately six weeks.  The driver will then have 28 days to pay.  In that case, we know the driver is amenable for the crime &ndash; it is a crime.  The driver is made amenable and gets a penalty probably within six to eight weeks, regardless of whether he or she falls into the penalty point category or the disqualification category.  That case would be dealt with completely under the fixed charge system.</p></speech>

There is a major focus on the 38% figure from last year.  There was a level of alcohol in their systems.  Let us break down the number of pedestrians, passengers and people who were disqualified but who were driving when they should not have been.  Let us include the number of people with no insurance who clearly have no concept of law.  Then, let us compare the number of people who have a BAC between the 50 mg and 80 mg with those with a BAC over 80 mg.  Can the assistant commissioner quantify the figures?</p> <p>  The figures the Minister quoted last week on the "Drivetime" programme were based on the Road Safety Authority analysis from 2008 to 2012.  New legislation came in dealing with penalty points and the fixed charge notices only came in during 2012.  Since then, there has been a downward trajectory in the number of fatalities on our roads.  Does that match the particular focus at the moment in respect of fatalities with a given alcohol level in their system?</p></speech>

Between 2012 and 2015 the number was 879 for the category of specified drivers who get a three-month disqualification and pay a &euro;200 fine.

Alternatively, they might be novice drivers or young people.  They all fall in to that category.  A total of 879 fell into that category.  In the same period, the number for the next category, a BAC of between 50 mg and 80 mg, we had 2,245.  The number for the third category, which is a BAC of over 80 mg, is 1,380.  Of the three categories under which drivers do not get a disqualification, the 50 mg to 80 mg category had the largest number of the fixed charged notices.  These cases do not go to court.  These drivers are in the fixed charged notice category.</p></speech>

I raised this question with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality.  I asked about the number of prosecutions under the fixed charge notice system.  Our data table does not correspond with the table provided by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at all.  I want to clarify that we are referring to the same legislation.</p> <p>  With effect from 27 October 2011, certain offences contrary to sections 4 and 5 of the Road Traffic Act 2010, including driving or attempting to drive or being in charge of a vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant, may be dealt with by way of a fixed penalty notice in lieu of the commencement of criminal proceedings for persons deemed suitable by the regulations.  I have to hand a data table showing the number of fixed penalty notices issued to persons arrested having been recorded as having in excess of 50 mg but less than 80 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood for the period 2011 to date.  In 2011, when these laws were commenced, seven people were prosecuted.  In 2012, a total of 111 people were prosecuted.  In 2013, a total of 68 people were prosecuted.  In 2014, a total of 47 people were prosecuted.  In 2015, a total of 62 people were prosecuted.  In 2016, a total of 69 people were prosecuted.  In 2017, only one person had been prosecuted up to two weeks ago.  I asked the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality about it.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, indicated that people were not showing respect for this legislation.  I asked the T&aacute;naiste to set out the number of repeat offenders but she could not come back to me with an answer.</p><p>She said she would come back to me, but she has not.  That is the argument we had the last day at this committee.  Where are the figures being verified?</p></speech>

Around 75% of people are prepared to paid their fines when caught for drink-driving rather than appear in court.  Apart from the financial aspect, we have so many people prepared to take the chance to drive while impaired on our roads, endangering all of our families.  Very few of them are going to court.  They take the fine and continue to drink-drive.  What we have seen in the five-year period between 2012 and 2016 is that 40,000 have taken that risk and have been done for driving while intoxicated.  It is an appalling vista to have that level of disregard for the law and for our safety and that of our families.  That is why it is so important to get away from the fixed charge penalty notice and to send out the message that drink-driving is quite simply not acceptable, that one will lose one's licence and will have to engage with solicitors to go to court to be represented.  That is how serious this offence is.  It is an endangerment offence and that is why it needs to be taken out of the District Court and into the higher level courts because of the devastation that it is causing.</p> <p>  We simply cannot condone people drink-driving, drug-driving, texting and driving or any form of impaired driving on our roads.  It is simply unacceptable.  We have to tackle it at source.  While fixed charge penalty notices are well and good and bring revenue into the coffers, they are not stopping that endangerment on the roads.  That is where we rely on our legislators to amend the law to make it a crime.  People will then take notice because people do not want to have a criminal record, lose their licence or lose their jobs.  Quite simply, one can be a repeat offender for drink-driving and be in and out of the District Court with hundreds of offences, yet one will not lose one's job.  It is not seen in the same light as another criminal offence.</p></speech>

People are not just statistics.  It is the duty of this Government and any government to protect its citizens.  How in God's name can people with so many previous convictions, especially motoring convictions, still be allowed to walk the streets and go out and kill other people?  My daughter's killer knocked my daughter out of her runners to the height of the traffic lights and was only charged with careless driving.  The garda&iacute; told us that she showed great remorse.  Two weeks later she nearly killed another 18-year old girl in Belfast.  That was after showing remorse.  This remorse thing has been used so many times in court.  The judges and the justice system are just accepting it.  Repeat offenders should be taken off the roads.  Either their cars should be confiscated or preferably they should be locked up and not be walking the streets.  The Government at that time and at present is responsible for so many deaths.  It is the Government's duty to protect these people but it is not doing it.  It is protecting the criminal.  These offences should be taken out of the Road Traffic Acts and made into criminal offences.</p></speech>

I now have two analysts working in our traffic department full time to make sure that what we do targets the right locations at the right times using the data we share with the Road Safety Authority and the data from our own figures.  That helps to make sure that when we are out there, we are doing the right thing in the right place.  In the past, we were not as scientific in terms of how we did our business but now we can be.  We have hotspots and mapping in order that when our resources go out every day to every district, we know where the hotspots are and what times and locations are the most likely to see drink-driving based on our evidence.  With a combination of better resources and better technology, I think we will have better outcomes.  That is what we are focusing on.</p></speech>

If a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is convicted in the District Court or any court for theft or fraud, he or she will be dismissed from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na having notched up a criminal conviction.  If a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is convicted of drink-driving, he or she will not be sacked from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na unless he or she is on probation.

If an individual is before the court for the first time or 101st time for drink-driving or driving while intoxicated, the maximum conviction is six months imprisonment and a &euro;5,000 fine.  That is a fact.  Drink-driving is not classified or regarded as a crime in this country.  To reiterate, if an individual is convicted of stealing a pair of underwear from a shop in Grafton Street, he or she would have a criminal conviction.  As Ms Price has correctly stated, all drink-driving cases are heard in the District Court.</p></speech>

We are having these hearings in order to interact and engage with one another.  As I stated at the outset, we have a duty and responsibility to ensure sentences should reflect the seriousness of the crime and penalties should be proportionate.  To be fair, there is a big difference in somebody who adheres to the law, has a few pints one night, takes a taxi home and gets up the next morning with a residual amount of alcohol in his or her system.  Someone like this should be dealt with differently from a person who leaves a public house having drunk a serious amount of alcohol before getting behind the wheel of a car.</p> <p>  I am conscious that we are focusing much of our effort on one particular issue when speed is still the largest contributing factor to deaths on our road.  We brought forward legislation in this committee that was supported across all the political parties relating to introduction of random drug testing on roads.  I would be interested to know when that will commence.  With regard to the use of mobile phones, I had to pull in the car on a small regional road as a driver of an articulated lorry was coming along with one hand on the wheel of the vehicle and the other with his phone to his ear.  I could not believe it.  There are laws in place to prevent that happening and people speeding but they continue to do both.</p> <p>  My colleague, Deputy Fitzmaurice, was right in saying it is about ensuring we have the greatest amount of enforcement on our roads.  For me it is about ensuring we do not clog our court system by giving people the opportunity to come in and fight legislation.  The witness correctly pointed out some of this exists since 1960 and perhaps there is a job of work to be done in consolidating the law, leaving it fit for purpose so lawyers cannot have a field day in trying to defend the indefensible.  People caught breaking the law severely should not be left on the road for six or nine months.  Perhaps the penalty for somebody disqualified from driving but who is caught driving a car is not sufficient.  A number of issues must addressed and fleshed out further.</p></speech>

Research indicates that people at 40 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood are twice as likely to be involved in a collision.  The legal limit for the majority of drivers is 50 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood.  At the 80 mg level, people are six times as likely to be involved in a collision.  In research from 2008 to 2012, based on culpable drivers and alcohol factors, between the zero level and 80 mg level, we estimate seven to eight people were being killed every year with those sorts of levels.  No matter what the level, there is an impact.</p></speech>

It is surprising that 4% of fatalities are on motorways.  One might think because a car is travelling at 120 km/h, there would be many more accidents.  Although 4% still equates to a large number of deaths, why are there comparatively few incidents on a motorway?  Is it because people feel there is a far better Garda presence on motorways to stop speeding?  Do people who consume alcohol know there is a far better chance of being caught on a motorway rather than in a rural village?  The people in rural villages have one or two extra glasses or wine or bottles of beer and may think there is a greater chance of them not being caught.</p> <p>  I keep going back to this and the Chairman knows it; if people drink, they should not drive.  The bottom line is we should go for zero tolerance.  There is the idea of going for a 20 mg level but people who drink can be stubborn.  I have done a bit of bar work in my time and trying to get keys from someone who has consumed alcohol can be very hard.  Not too many people would take on a person trying to get into a car with a set of keys.  I know Mr. Wilson stated it is not really a criminal offence but the punishment must suit the crime.  There are three people here who have lost loved ones and no matter what happens, nobody is going to replace them.  I remember years ago my daughter had meningitis and, touch wood, she survived.  As a parent, I am always in fear of the knock on the door.  I would not wish it on anyone.  The advertisement years ago had a garda coming to a house.</p> <p>  We talk about speeding and everything else but with alcohol, a person has the choice of drinking or not.  I am involved with sport and many people go out.  For example, there might be a designated driver in a group of four or five.  We should encourage that more.  The punishment must suit the crime.  Until we go with zero tolerance, we will have a serious problem on the roads.  There could be many knocks on doors.</p></speech>

If that person hit a car and killed the person driving it, that death would not be any less than if that person was hit after hours.  There is no excuse, be it morning time or night-time.  My crash happened at 8.30 in the evening.  I did not in my wildest dreams expect to meet somebody who was out of their mind from drink and for that person to be injure me very badly and kill my son.

I want to reply to Deputy Troy's concern for those caught the next morning with residual alcohol in their system, and I want to allay his fears.  The proposal is not to change the blood alcohol level at which it is an offence to drive, which is 50 mg.  For any reading below 50 mg, it is not a crime or an offence to drive and people with a reading below that level will not be prosecuted.  The Deputy should also bear in mind that before a prosecution takes place and the level of alcohol present in one's system is decided, the reading on the machine is reduced by 17.5% in order to be sure to be sure that a person is over the limit before he or she is prosecuted.  Anybody driving with alcohol in their system up to or around 50 mg gets off with it.  We have cases where families have lost a loved one, where their only child has been killed by a person who was driving at the limit of 50 mg after that allowance of 17.5% was taken into account, and that is completely unacceptable.  Even if we are leaving the legislation as it stands,  families are losing their loved ones because somebody has chosen to drive and may still be on that limit.  We have to send out the right message from here.  I believe zero tolerance is right.  I agree with Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick.  We will get there eventually because this has to be the case, but all we are seeking to do now is to send out the right message - and to have in place a stronger deterrent - to people that if they do take a chance and drink drive, they will lose their licence.  That has to be the case because given that the level of enforcement is much lower there is little chance of being caught and people are taking chances.</p> <p>  I do not agree regarding the speed issue.  The assistant commissioner said earlier that the compliance level is better now.  I drove here today with my speedometer at 80 km/h and the other cars on the road were flying past me.  I was the only motorist driving at the speed limit in Lucan coming into town this morning, and that is not acceptable.</p></speech>

I want to ask a few questions and there will be time later for further questions.  All the members of this committee agreed that we would have sessions on road safety because, as was pointed out by Deputy Troy, we are extremely concerned about the increase in the number of road fatalities last year.  This relates to a cultural mindset.  In the 1970s, more than 600 people were dying on our roads each year and that was kind of accepted.  Even though we know the figure now is far too high, it is accepted that there will be some road fatalities.  A cultural change is needed to shift that mindset because every road death is one too many.  There are just over 20 people in the room and that is the number of people since 1 January alone who have lost their lives on our roads, not to mention the number of people who have been seriously injured.  This is a very worthwhile exercise but the outcome of it is what is  important.  It is probably very dangerous to focus on one particular area over another.  As a committee, we are trying to get an all-encompassing approach and to explore everything that can be done.  My view is that not enough is being done across the board on this matter.</p> <p>  I have a few questions for the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I note the number of members in the Garda traffic corps in the south region.  The figure represents just under 20% of the current total membership of the corps.  As I recall from a meeting at which representatives of the Road Safety Authority in attendance three or four weeks ago, the number of road fatalities in the Munster area is much higher than elsewhere.  I asked if there is a correlation between the number of road fatalities that occur and the number of Garda traffic corps members deployed in an area.  Does the southern region comprise the six counties of Munster or is any particular county excluded?</p></speech>

There are five Garda divisions in it.  Cork has three divisions and Kerry and Limerick make up the other two divisions.  The  number in the traffic corps would have been proportionately down to 10% or we started off with around a figure of 10%  in each region.  For example, when I was in Cork we had 60 people in the traffic corps and the total number of garda&iacute; was 600 or more.  That was our yardstick when we were increasing the number of staff in the traffic corps, namely, that it would be approximately 10% of the total number.</p></speech>

I have raised with the Department, the Minister and the RSA the use of technology to prevent the crime form happening in the first instance.  If we have an agreed blood alcohol limit in legislation, the use of an alcolock device will ensure that a vehicle cannot be activated by a person who is over that limit.  That would perform a service for the general public and for person who is not sure if he or she is over the limit or it would remove the possibility of he or she losing his or her licence if he or she cannot activate his or her vehicle.  An argument could be made that because speed contributes as much to road fatalities, if not more, than people who drive over the blood alcohol limit, that a person who drives at speed should also lose his or her licence.  Where do we draw the line in terms of what is and is not an appropriate response?</p> <p>  There is technology that can limit the speed at which a car can be driven.  Limiting the speed at which a vehicle can be driven to 120 km/h, which is the motorway speed limit, will not prevent a person from driving at an inappropriate speed in a 80 km/h zone or on a country road incorporating a 50 km/h zone or in a built up area, given that 25 out of 40 road deaths last year involved non-motorists in 50 km/h zones.  Global positioning system, GPS, technology could also be used to enforce the law in that if one drove over the speed limit in a 50 km/h zone, one could be caught by virtue of one's GPS information.  That would represent a massive leap forward.  It would change the game completely in terms of the figures we are dealing with, but I do not see any urgency about this in the Department.  Would the witnesses view the use of such technology in this respect as representing major progress and would they be in agreement with its use?  Ms Price spoke about adhering to the speed limit in a 80 km/h zone.  We have all had that experience.  When one sticks to the speed limit, one can be guaranteed that one will be overtaken and some people even have the audacity to toot their horns as they pass because they one are in a hurry and one is in their way.  It will lengthen journey times, but are people willing to make that little sacrifice?  I would be in interested to hearing the witnesses' views on that.</p></speech>

There are already limiters in place on buses and trucks and the drivers of those vehicles are prohibited from driving over a set speed limit.  What can we not do this in respect of motorways?  The maximum speed at which anyone should drive on a motorway is 120 km/h.  The technology exists to do as I am outlining.  Likewise, if one is not wearing one's seat belt, one will hear a beep noise in the car and that beep noise will continue until one puts it on.</p><p> We have other technology.  For example, my satnav system will recognise that I am in a 80 km/h zone.  Why can it not make the connection or keep pinging until my speed goes under 80 km/h?  This type of technology exists and we should be looking at it.  These things influence people's behaviour.  Likewise, it is possible to put limiters on the sides of motorcycle engines to limit speed capacity for young people or learners.  We would welcome that.  We have a technology group that includes a representative of the Road Safety Authority.  Superintendent O'Donohue is on the group.  The group is considering these technology developments.  Likewise, alco-meters can go into cars to stop us from making ill-informed decisions.  If people did not have alcohol consumed, they would be more savvy but the alcohol does affect our common sense.</p></speech>

These devices can be installed in the same way as they are installed in trucks.  I know because I come from a trucking background.  Insurance could be given at the same price for everyone.

Obviously, we work with all stakeholders.  We have been working for several years with the RSA, the Health and Safety Authority and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We would welcome being involved in anything like that.</p> <p>  We are coming from a different perspective.  We are emotionally involved.  We have experienced the absolute devastation.  Having experienced that and knowing how shattering it is for our families, we are compelled to do something about it.  These are avoidable deaths.  Deputy Fitzpatrick commented on how it was bad enough to lose a child through a serious illness.  Losing a child is the end of the world for families.  To lose a child in a situation like this, where the crashes are avoidable, is senseless.  We are compelled into action and into doing something about it.  That is why we do what we do.</p> <p>  Our families ask us why we do this.  They say it will never bring our loved ones back.  That is precisely the answer.  The members of the committee and the Members of the Oireachtas have it in their power to do something to change that situation and to help to save lives.  That is a great gift.  They have been given this trust by the electorate.  They are here to represent the needs of the electorate.</p> <p>  I understand what Deputy Troy said about not being emotionally involved.  We would never wish Members to be emotionally involved.  They do not want that knock on the door and we would not wish it on our worst enemies.  However, we want the committee to examine the scientific evidence and the facts.  The Road Safety Authority and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will provide the facts to the committee.  I appeal to the committee to make its decision based on that evidence.  I appeal to the committee to avoid listening to the vested interests.  I hope we have allayed the fears of the committee about people being caught the next morning.  There is a difference between someone who has ten pints and someone who has two.  The allowance for that is already in the legislation because we do not prosecute with a blood alcohol concentration of under 50 mg per 100 ml, except for novice drivers.  As I said, to determine whether an offence has been committed, an allowance of 17.5% exists.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can make allowance for this on the reading from the intoxilyser machines.</p></speech>

The fine is still &euro;80.  I believe that must change.  A graded system should be introduced whereby if an individual is doing 150 km/h in a 120 km/h zone, there should be a &euro;300 or &euro;400 fixed charge notice and six penalty points.</p></speech>

If a driver is doing 30 km/h over a 50 km/h limit, it is the same as doing 30 km/h over a 120 km/h limit.  The fine is &euro;80 and the driver is issued three penalty points.  If the driver goes to court and is convicted, the driver is issued five penalty points.  If a garda stops a driver for excessive speeding, he may also prosecute or pursue the driver for dangerous driving.  That can be added on.</p> <p>  Safety camera vans can detect people driving at a higher speed and provide the information.  For example, GoSafe, the private operator, provides that information and we can see whether we can pursue a prosecution for the additional offence.  For speeding by itself, the fine is &euro;80.</p></speech>

Believe it or not, it is not easy to prove dangerous driving against someone who is caught speeding.  There should be a specific speeding charge.</p> <p>  In the case of a graded system, consideration should be given to increasing the fines dramatically and the imposition of penalty points for speeding instead of the flat fee or penalty that exists at the moment.  If someone was facing a &euro;500 fine plus the imposition of ten penalty points on the licence for a single offence, it would concentrate the mind.</p> <p>  There is an epidemic of mobile telephone use at the moment, as committee members will appreciate.  Deputy Troy referred to the driver of the lorry on the mobile telephone.  I believe we are going to have to give An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na power to seize mobile telephones at the side of the road and have them examined to prove that an individual was using the telephone.  Moreover, there should be a major increase in the financial penalties for mobile telephone use as well as the imposition of penalty points.  I am also in favour of bringing in an automatic disqualification for mobile telephone use.  I regard it as being that serious.</p></speech>

I wish to congratulate Michael Finn who serves in Cork on his elevation to assistant commissioner and wish him all the best.  Rural Ireland is not bandit country.  In the past few days, an old age pensioner had the misfortune to be murdered in Ballysaggart, which is just over the road from me.  As the Garda was able to do its job, that means the force is on the ground and there is a Garda presence in rural Ireland.  I commend the force on what it is able to do even with such limited resources.</p> <p>  Everyone has been touched, directly or indirectly, by drunk drivers who cause fatalities on the roads.  We must acknowledge there has been a phenomenal increase in traffic on the roads in the past number of years, especially in the past two years compared with four or five years ago.  That is borne out by statistics.  It was mentioned that 3% of accidents are due to the condition of the road and the condition of the roads is not keeping pace with the volume of traffic.  Most cars that go for the NCT fail it.  If a car ends up in a crash, the technical people who investigate the crash sites are able to determine whether there were vehicle problems as well.  Do the Garda statistics show up whether faulty vehicles were involved in crashes?  </p> <p>  A campaign by the Road Safety Authority on driver fatigue, where drivers who were feeling tired were told to pull in, was a very good campaign that should be run again.  </p> <p>  I am aware of two fatalities on the motorway I use because people accessed the motorway from the wrong way.  It is back to the RSA and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, in regard to road design.  Deaths occur on the roads for many reasons.  I thank the witnesses for coming before us today.</p></speech>

A motorcyclist does not have the shell of a vehicle to protect him or her.  I am concerned about the central reservation, which are literally steel poles with connecting wires and when a motorcyclist is dismounted in this area, they effectively come in contact with razor blades.  Similarly, signposts and telecommunications poles are involved in many fatalities.  Can we do something better in regard to the engineering on that front?  Is there a way to try to reduce risk to motorcyclists?  The central reservation area is fine for a car, as it stops a car crossing over onto the oncoming vehicles but it has a different impact on motorcyclists.  I do not want to come across the type of stuff members of the Garda come across in the line of their work but is the central reservation area an issue for motorcyclists?</p></speech>

Motorcyclists are a problem for us, especially as there seems to be a culture whereby enthusiasts go out for a spin on a Sunday afternoon.  The attraction of the motorcycle is speed and we are working with the Road Safety Authority to see how we can target and educate that cohort on the dangers and risks.  As the Chairman said, the motorcyclist does not have the shell of the motor car if one has an accident when on a motorbike.  The motorcyclist is very vulnerable.  Last weekend I saw a statistic where we had a fatality and the motorcyclist was not wearing a helmet.  We must educate people.  They are even more vulnerable when on a motorcycle.</p></speech>

We have been approached by a number of approved driving instructors who have raised their concerns with the Road Safety Authority on learner drivers arriving to do their driving test unaccompanied and perhaps failing their test and leaving the centre unaccompanied.  Obviously the Road Safety Authority cannot do anything about it because they are not involved in enforcement, but it is the duty of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

For years the use of a trailer was part of the licence.  People had a licence for years and were well used to twisting and turning their trailers.  New rules were introduced and if one was on one side of a date, the rules of the old licence still applied but otherwise the new rules applied.  We sometimes make laws that push people outside the system.  Some people never had the opportunity of an education and are not able to read or write.  I am very critical of the RSA and the way it conducts its business by touch screen technology.  Would the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na try to come in behind my proposal of a practical system in some place like Mondello Park, where they could do all the practical exercises with the car and trailer?  The people I am talking about are bamboozled by this new system, and although they had a licence in the past it is pushing them outside the law.</p> <p>  This is totally wrong and should not be the spirt of the way things are done.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na need to move with the RSA and try to get something done on that.</p> <p>  I question the way the GoSafe vans are located and parked on the hard shoulder.

Road safety and driver training should be core subjects on the second level curriculum in our schools.  Every second level student should have an opportunity to leave secondary school having obtained a full driving licence.  That subject should also carry the same points as French, Irish, German and any other subject with a view to going on to third level education.  It will encourage all students to participate and it would cut out an awful lot of the youthful bravado we see with guys trying to impress girls, for example.  If driver training and road safety was a core subject on the second level curriculum it would go a long way to doing that.  It is about time it happened.  Young people should be able to obtain driving licences at the very earliest convenience.  It might cost an awful lot of money to put in place but in the long run society will benefit.</p></speech>

What impact do GoSafe vans have on road safety?  When people see them, they put their foot on the brake so it is a deterrent for speeding, but what impact do they have on saving people's lives?  Does the Garda have any say in their locations?  If so, why?  I come from Dundalk and most people in the area know where the vans will be on a particular day.  They are a deterrent but what impact do they have on safety?  Do they save one life or two lives?  They have cut back on speeding.  What opinion do the witnesses have of the GoSafe vans?</p></speech>

They are certainly having a massive impact in the zones where they are present.  Fatalities halved in the first 700 zones because people knew they were there.  The Deputy is dead right.  People knew they were there and they complied.  Should we have more?  I would love to see more.  In other countries they have fixed cameras so it is not hit and miss.  The camera is there all the time and that is a massive deterrent to people.  It influences behaviour because if people think they will be caught and get penalty points, they will behave.  My colleague is probably more <i>au fait</i>with its nuances because he was there from the very start of the programme so I will let him in to speak about it.</p></speech>

No other factor is taken into account in deciding where GoSafe vans go other than the collisions.  We identify the cluster of collisions on the road, we identify a stretch of road that is 2 km, 3 km, or 5 km long and then with GoSafe we select a site to carry out the enforcement.  It is the history of fatal and serious injury collisions that determine where they go.  We then deploy the vans there based on the times of the day and the days of the week when the collisions occurred.  We match it up.</p> <p>  GoSafe has key performance indicators it has to achieve and we give them some latitude in terms of time.  It cannot give exactly 15% of its time to a particular location so we will say we want between 12% and 18% of its time.  We give them some latitude either side of 15%.  It stays between the lines all the time in terms of the days of the week and the times of the day.  It is very much strategic in terms of enforcement.  It has reduced the deaths by 50% in the zones.  In some years we are talking about saving 22, 26 or 28 lives a year.  That is the figure we are looking at for recent years based on the halving of deaths, or less than that, in some of the zones.</p></speech>

I am not sure what we really think about them.  They are in areas where fatal collisions have occurred and they have changed driver behaviour in those areas in that when drivers are coming up to the speed van, they slow down, and when they leave the area they speed up again.  In that given spot, the collisions have decreased but outside of that area, on country roads, the collisions have increased.  That is because driver behaviour has not really changed.  A Garda presence on the road is vital.  Garda&iacute; can make this cost-effective if they are out there in numbers.  The number of people speeding is outrageous.  I experienced it this morning.  The number of people on their phones is outrageous.  Every time a person goes to his or her car, he or she is surrounded by people texting and driving, regardless of the speeds.  Some of them do it at 70 mph.  The Garda could be raking in the money.  If they can keep it in the traffic corps, that is well and good.  We need to get garda&iacute; on the road.  People need to see a Garda presence.  It is only then that they will not take chances with their lives and with the lives of our families.  That is very important.  The GoSafe vans are outside contractors.  I think the contract is for 6,000 hours a year.</p></speech>

The likelihood of encountering them is minuscule.  I rarely encounter one on my journey up and back to Dublin.  If they are there, we know where they will be, as the Deputy said.  People modify their driving behaviour in that little space.  I am not sure it is right.</p></speech>

I could not agree more with what two of the previous speakers said - one being Ms Price who lives in my constituency - about the need for a Garda presence on our roads.  That is critically important.  I am delighted that an assistant commissioner now has responsibility for the traffic corps.  I encourage him at every opportunity to fight to ensure the number of people working in this area is increased.  Education is a key factor.  That point was proven in December 2016 with the very good media campaign highlighting the dangers on our road.  As a consequence of that, coupled with the Garda presence on our roads, there was a very significant reduction in the number of road fatalities.</p> <p>  It has been suggested that an app can be downloaded on one's mobile phone that will monitor one's driving patterns.  That should be examined in greater detail.  It would help influence policy and help correct the driving pattern of motorists.  A person who always adheres to the law in terms of driving within the speed limit, the non-use of a mobile phone, wearing a seat belt, stopping at stop signs and all of that, could be rewarded with a cheaper insurance premium.  That is a measure that the Road Safety Authority might examine and that our committee will examine.  Someone will be appearing before the committee in the next few weeks or months with a proposal.  We will be working with the RSA on that.</p> <p>  We did not have much discussion about vulnerable road users, namely, pedestrians and cyclists.  I nearly knocked down a pedestrian before Christmas because he was walking on a country road, dressed in black from head to toe.  It was the luck of God that I copped him in time and swerved out to avoid him.  I have suggested previously that we should examine introducing a penalty for such behaviour as that person was acting irresponsibly.  Not alone could his life have been lost but I could have pulled out in front of another car and caused a much more serious accident and a number of lives could have been lost.  I would welcome the assistant commissioner's opinion on that.</p> <p>  In terms of proposal regarding a required distance to be observed in overtaking cyclists, I believe it is 1.5 m in rural areas and a reduced distance in urban areas.  What is the assistant commissioner's view on the practicalities of implementing that legislation?  It is unimplementable in some areas because of the width of roads.  There is also the issue of the behaviour of cyclists.  I met a cyclist on a Dublinbike cycling up the wrong way on Kildare Street on my way to Leinster House today.  What measures are in place to police that behaviour?</p> <p>  We have had a very good interaction with the witnesses, albeit there was a difference of opinion in one area.  Mr. Wilson spoke of the introduction of a gradient system of penalty points being a good system and a good suggestion for addressing the speed issue.  The only gradient system we are currently discussing is in regard to the blood alcohol level, which we have been debating for two and a half hours.  That is the only area where there has been an element of disagreement.  I thank the witnesses for giving of their time.  As one of them said, they are acting in a voluntary capacity.  They have engaged very honestly and truthfully and I hope we on this side have done likewise.  I look forward to engaging with the representatives of the association and with the Garda in working towards reducing the number of road fatalities because we want to halt and reverse the shocking upward trajectory of 2016 and to make sure that our roads are a much safer place in 2017.</p></speech>

That is an area we should explore.  Such technology exists and we should use it to help save lives on our roads.  I would support and encourage any proposal in that regard.</p> <p>  Regarding vulnerable road users, I know exactly what the Deputy spoke about in terms of pedestrians walking on the roads at night time.  I would have to argue that there is an element of irresponsibility if one is dressed totally in black.  Collisions and near misses occur, just like the one the Deputy described, because people do not take simple precautions.  The RSA has done a great deal of work on educating the public about road safety.  It even gives us yellow visibility vests to give it to people we come across who not wearing high visibility clothing and our members have done a good deal of that.  I can see the logic and merit in what the Deputy has said.  He asked whether we should consider introducing an offence where a person behaves recklessly in contributing to being a danger on the road by being out in the dark dressed in black where they cannot be seen by motorists on the road.  Such people put themselves, and other road users, at risk because a motorist may have to swerve to avoid them.  I can see the logic in the Deputy's proposal in that respect.</p></speech>

We have brought in a fixed charge notice that can apply to cyclists, of which my colleague, Chief Superintendent Aidan Reid has reminded me.  He is very disappointed to hear that a person was cycling up Kildare Street the wrong way.  We will pursue such offenders as we now have fixed charge notice for that.</p> <p>  The legislation being considered on motorists observing a minimum distance when passing cyclists will be problematic in terms of its enforcement in some areas.  It will be hard to adhere to the 1.5 m distance.  Not everyone will understand how to measure that.  Motorists would nearly need a tape to measure if they are maintaining a 1.5 distance and if they are stopped in traffic a cyclist can move in beside them.  There must be two-way responsibility.  Cyclists must accept that they cannot move out in the path of motorists.  A motorist may be complying with the law but the cyclist may not be playing his or her part in terms of compliance.  Enforcing the measure will be challenging in some ways.  As a yardstick, yes it is a good measure.  If the message we deliver from this debate is to tell motorists to stay out on the road, away from cyclists, that is a good thing.  Cyclists, because of potholes and other works on roads, can deviate and motorists need to be mindful of that. </p> <p>  I concur with the Deputy regarding having a variation in the awarding of penalty points.  It does not seem logical that the same penalty points would be awarded regardless of whether one is 2 km/h or 22 km/h over the speed limit.  Maybe that is an area we should examine. </p></speech>

Perhaps it is time to consider introducing a registration plate for bicycles.  Cyclists are not easily tracked down.  They break red lights, almost run over people and head off on their merry way and there is no way of tracking them down.  There is an argument for putting registration plates on pedal cycles.  I am just throwing out that proposal for discussion.</p></speech>

We are not talking about isolated cases but about cyclists who break the law on a fairly regular basis.  They treat red lights as being there just to add colour and they totally disregard them.  If there was some form of identification on bicycles, the offenders could be tracked down and punished.  It is currently very difficult to track them.

The problem with that case was that it did not even get to a judge and jury.  Initially, the Garda and the Director of Public Prosecutions accepted a guilty plea on careless driving.  Clearly, that is not satisfactory where a life has been taken by someone with that driving history.  That is why we want these crimes treated differently.  They should be treated as vehicular manslaughter &ndash; let us call it what it is.</p></speech>

People have gone to jail for driving while disqualified.  A certain cohort will probably ignore the law regardless - they are totally reckless.  Imprisonment is probably the only solution for these people.  There has been considerable debate about publishing the list of disqualified drivers.  There is certainly merit in that.  The committee could talk to our colleagues in the Revenue Commissioners about this approach.  The chairperson of the Policing Authority worked there previously.  She has commented on those who have been named and shamed in that context and how there has been a certain level of compliance as a result.  It certainly assisted in that regard.</p></speech>

I imagine they have been in constant contact with the Minister.  We need to push from both ends.  I am a firm believer that everyone deserves one chance in life.  However, when a person makes one mistake, he should not be able to make two mistakes.  On leaving the committee today, we need to do something like that.

We have to look at cases where a defendant accepts a guilty plea on a lesser charge, thereby tying the hands of the judge.  Our families would prefer that the case goes to a judge and jury.  The hearing should take place and the jury should decide on guilt or innocence.  In the particular case in question, the driver fled the scene and had to be extradited.  Yet, the judge had to allow a reduction for the guilty plea and for remorse.<br/><br/>An apology means so much to our families.  As we have said, we are not looking for vengeance.  However, we want a strong message to go out that we are not going to accept impaired driving on our roads.  It is horrifying.  I have before me the figures from the Road Safety Authority for the five years in question.  Over 150 people per week were arrested for drink-driving.  These are only the people who are caught.  I have never been breathalysed and I am in my 50s.  There is such a small likelihood of being caught.  Over the five years, in excess of 40,000 people have been caught drink-driving and endangering others.  That is an appalling vista.  It is something we must tackle.<br/><br/>Deputy Troy referred to tiered penalties.  Can he indicate what we can do to reduce the level of carnage on the roads?  Does the Deputy condone this level of law-breaking?  How does he believe we can put a stop to it?  Does he believe the <i>status quo</i>is okay and that we can continue to live with 40,000 people breaking the law in every five-year period?  I reckon the figure is ten times greater if we include those who have taken chances and not been caught.  What do we do in that situation?<br/><br/>Reference was made to vulnerable road users.  People come to us after a serious crash has taken place.  A loved one has been killed.  Our experience in many cases is that vulnerable road users are dead and gone and so there is no prosecution.  In too many cases, the vulnerable road user is blamed for his or her own death.  This is why I believe it is too easy for the other party, the surviving driver, to say she did not see the deceased driver, the deceased pedestrian stepped out in front of the car or she did not see the deceased in the car mirrors.<br/><br/>This is why we call for mandatory checking when the investigation is taking place.  If all of the known contributory causes of crashes are investigated and if the other driver is then seen to be a careful driver, then we can blame the pedestrian.  Otherwise, we have to be extremely cautious.  It is simply unfair.  The families concerned have to live with the consequences of a loved one being blamed for his or her own death.  The families have no justice as a result.  Also, it is sending out the wrong message to the effect that the driver need not be careful or look out for vulnerable road users.  After all, it is in the law.  Everyone knows they must drive and keep a safe distance such that they can see clearly.  We have a duty to look out for vulnerable road users.  It is right to have a distance for overtaking cyclists.  All of us have seen the horrific clips on the cyclist Twitter accounts of lorries overtaking cyclists and whizzing past them as though they are ants on the road.  They are people and have the same right to be on the road as the lorry driver.  If it is not safe to overtake, then the driver simply has to bide time, wait until it is safe and give the cyclist the necessary distance.</p></speech>

Let us suppose a driver comes around the bend in a car at night and it is foggy and a pedestrian is wearing black clothes.  It is reckless on the part of the person wearing the black clothes.  Let us be clear about that.  If it goes to court, the driver of the car always goes down and there is a big insurance pay-out.  However, let us be clear on this point: there should be some responsibility on the person walking the road and that person should not be in black clothes.</p></speech>

Obviously, we all have a responsibility to keep ourselves safe on the roads.  I am suggesting that where the cyclist, pedestrian or vulnerable road users is killed, we should not automatically blame that person for his or her death unless or until we have established all the factors involved.  Therefore, if the driver was texting and did not see the vulnerable road user and then killed him or her, at least we have the evidence.</p> <p>  I have an issue with the question of drunk pedestrians.  The Road Safety Authority broadcasted an advertisement that we have all seen.  I have raised this with the Road Safety Authority.  The claim was that 66%, two thirds, of pedestrians killed had alcohol in their systems.  That is victim-blaming.  Let us consider the figures.  Over 200 were killed during the period in question, but there was only blood alcohol levels data for 40 of those.  Of those 40 odd, two thirds had alcohol in their systems.  We cannot continue to perpetuate that notion.  It is so hurtful to our families, who have suffered an injustice.</p></speech>

At the moment, if an individual is banned from driving for 20 years in County Monaghan, he can drive legally several yards up the road in Northern Ireland.  There needs to be a Europe-wide ban.  If an individual is disqualified in France or Germany, he should be automatically disqualified in Ireland.</p></speech>

It may assist the committee if you have further information, especially on the discussion on the cohort with a blood alcohol concentration of between 50mg and 80mg.
