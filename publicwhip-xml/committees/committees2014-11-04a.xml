    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-04a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Dillon" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014110400004#E00200"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to address it today on the subject of the new Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 with particular reference to the issues relating to commonages.  As the committee will be aware, Ireland has submitted its draft rural development programme, RDP to the European Commission on 3 July this year.  The draft RDP was developed over a period of some 18 months and was based on extensive stakeholder consultation, a number of preparatory analyses and a process of independent <i>ex ante </i>evaluation.  In total, the proposed schemes included in our draft RDP amount to some &euro;4 billion of EU and national Exchequer support for rural Ireland and the agri-food sector.  This financial commitment will be a key support in enhancing the competitiveness of the agri-food sector, achieving more sustainable management of natural resources and ensuring a more balanced development of rural areas.  The draft RDP includes a substantial new agri-environment scheme, GLAS, and a number of other targeted environmental measures, continued strong support for areas of natural constraint, formerly known as disadvantaged areas, significant support for on-farm capital investment,  a range of knowledge transfer measures, support for collaborative farming and targeted support for the beef sector via the highly innovative beef data and genomics programme.<br/>The next step is for the draft RDP to be formally agreed with the European Commission.  We have recently received the Commission&rsquo;s official observations on our draft RDP and these are now being addressed as a matter of priority within the Department.  Given the fact that the Commission is dealing with the workload of agreeing a total of 118 draft RDPs, it is difficult to predict when our draft will be formally adopted.  However, we are in ongoing contact with our colleagues in the Commission with a view to expediting the process as much as possible.<br/>On commonage land, as the implementation of the new Common Agricultural Policy has progressed, the Department has been addressing a number of issues relating to commonage land in the context of both the new RDP and GLAS and the new basic payment scheme.  <br/>It is useful to set out at this point some of the background to commonage farming in Ireland.  Commonage lands form an important part of the farming enterprises of many farmers, particularly along the west coast.  They also form an important part of the local environment from the point of view of bio-diversity, wildlife and amenities.  The farming of commonage lands has a long tradition in Ireland.  It is by its very nature a complex area.  There are issues about the legal right to claim and there have always been disputes about grazing of the commonages.  In the vast majority of cases, however, commonage shareholders work well together on a co-operative basis. <br/>Each year, approximately 4.7 million hectares of eligible land is declared by applicants under the direct aid and agri-environment schemes.  Of that area, in excess of 330,000 hectares of commonage lands are declared, representing 7% of the total area declared.  In 2012, almost 15,000 applicants declared commonage lands, equivalent to 11% of scheme applicants.<br/>Commonage lands in Ireland are mainly situated along the western coast, in particular, in Donegal, Mayo, Galway and Kerry.  The areas of commonage lands in these counties comprise almost 71% of the total commonage land declared.  In Mayo, it is 84,000 hectares; in Kerry, 54,000 hectares; in Donegal, 51,000 hectares; and in Galway, 45,000 hectares.  Commonage lands include both upland and lowland grazing habitats.  These lands have been used mainly for the maintenance of sheep flocks, with some cattle and pony grazing in certain areas. <br/><b></b>In terms of under-grazing, the experience to date since the single farm payment was introduced in 2005 is that there is a growing problem of commonage land being abandoned by farmers.  This is not good for the environment, as these areas lose the specific characteristics as natural habitats for flora and fauna.  In addition, the creeping ineligibility of these lands under the single payment scheme and other direct payment schemes poses a significant risk to the State in view of the risk of financial corrections being imposed by the European Commission. <br/>There has also emerged a need to replace the now outdated commonage grazing de-stocking plans, which were drawn up in the late 1990s to deal with the then over-grazing problem arising from the level of sheep maintained on the hills to maximise farmers&rsquo; payments under the coupled ewe premium scheme.  While over-grazing is still an issue in some known areas, the main problem now facing us is the under-grazing of commonages.  A variety of reasons have led to a problem with under-grazing.  These are the introduction of decoupled payments in the single payment scheme in 2005, the age profile of farmers with commonage lands, low market returns, resulting in reduced livestock numbers, more attractive returns from off-farm income during the Celtic Tiger era and a requirement to destock in certain areas for environmental reasons.<br/>At present, commonage lands in Ireland can benefit from aid payments under the following direct aid and agri-environment schemes.  The single payment scheme, the disadvantaged areas scheme, the grassland sheep scheme, GSS, rural environment protection scheme, REPS or the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS.  In many cases, farmers are benefitting from four payments for the same area of commonage lands &ndash; SPS, DAS, the grassland sheep scheme, REPS or AEOS. The funding for these schemes comes from Pillar 1, full funding, or Pillar 2, partial funding, of the CAP.  It is a primary requirement of the EU regulations governing these schemes that the lands benefitting from aid are maintained in food agricultural and environmental condition, GAEC. <br/>Under the reformed CAP regime, which was agreed during the Irish Presidency of the EU, it was decided that direct payments should be more focused on active farmers.  In that regard, it will be necessary for all farmers who apply for aid under the basic payment scheme to have an agricultural activity on each land parcel they claim aid on.  In the case of marginal land, including commonages, this can only be achieved by grazing the land.  Member states are obliged to set their own requirements for the maintenance of such lands.<br/>Currently, discussions are taking places with the Commission regarding the setting of a relatively modest requirement under the Pillar 1 schemes and the areas of natural constraints Scheme for the maintaining of marginal land.  The grazing requirement, which must be met by all applicants under the basic scheme, is fixed at one ewe per one and a half hectares.  A lower level will be set for commonages where it is necessary from an environmental viewpoint, for example, on blanket bogs.  In order to provide flexibility for farmers who benefit from payments for commonage lands on which they claim aid but do not graze, applicants have until December 2015 to obtain the animals to meet the grazing requirement.  It is important to note that the optimum management of commonages will not be achieved unless the farmers actually managing these lands are given a role.  They have the knowledge of the best methods for their areas and the Department acknowledges this point.<br/>On GLAS and commonages, payments under GLAS can only be made in respect of actions going beyond the baseline requirements under the basic payment scheme under Pillar 1 of the CAP.  In simple terms, this means that a farmer cannot be paid twice for the same commitment under both schemes.  Farmers are required under the basic payment scheme to maintain the land in good agricultural and environmental condition and commonage land is no exception to this requirement.  So, in order to secure funding for hill farmers under GLAS, the challenge is to design a scheme which manifestly goes beyond the baseline.  We also have to ensure that the commitments outlined are measurable and controllable, as this is critical to securing approval.  <br/>The key characteristic of commonage land is that it is farmed in common and the actions undertaken under GLAS will have to reflect that.  We cannot have multiple and varying plans submitted for the commonage.  We need a single plan, drawn up by a single advisor, that sets out clearly what the objectives are over a five year period and what those participating in the plan will do, individually and together, to achieve those objectives.  On this point, we clearly need to have sufficient people working together to achieve the best results for these commonages, in the interests of both the farming community and the environment.  <br/>Originally, we were seeking a 80% participation but that has since been reduced to 50%, and the Minister has further explained how  this will work in practice.  In the first place, the 50% requirement is based on active farmers only, that is those actually grazing the commonage.  The example we have been using to illustrate this is that if there are 20 shareholders on a commonage and 15 are claiming shares under the single payment scheme, but only 10 of those are actively grazing the land at present, the 50% requirement to trigger priority access to GLAS is just five farmers.  This makes it much easier for farmers to achieve the threshold required but where real difficulties are still encountered, the Commonage Implementation Committee will intervene.  The Minister has clarified that no genuine applicant will be locked out of GLAS because of an inability to achieve the 50% participation requirement.  <br/>The Department recognises that hill farmers have genuine concerns about these new proposals and we have attempted to address these concerns in the various public meetings that were held around the country in September and October.  <br/>We welcome this opportunity to address any questions members of the committee may have for us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-04a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014110400004#E00300"><p>I thank the officials for coming here today.  A number of serious issues were raised.  Mr. Dillon mentioned that the Department has received observations on the draft RDP.</p> <p>Might it be possible for the members of the committee to be given a copy of those observations so we can have some sense of what is going on, or what is in mind at EU level?  Mr. Dillon said the Department cannot give us a projected date for when it is likely that this will be completed.  Perhaps he can give us two indications.  How long does he think it will take the Department to prepare the response?  In broad terms, are we talking about a fortnight, a month or six weeks?  How long after that will it take to get agreement from the EU so we can have some sense of what is happening?  Is it likely to take a month, two months, six months or eight months?</p><p> Even though we all use the English word "commonage", I have to say I do not like it because it seems to imply that the land in question is commonly owned.  Most land in Ireland, including commonage areas, is not commonly owned.  It is not "common" as we might have understood that to mean when they used to play cricket on common areas in village centres in Britain.  In other words, we are not talking about a common area in public ownership.  In most places, the coim&iacute;n&iacute;, or the commonages as they are called in English, are areas of undivided ownership.  If a husband and wife own a piece of land, is it a commonage?  If they have an undivided share each, is that a commonage?  If two people are joint owners, is that a commonage?  If a hill is owned outright, is it being considered a commonage even though it is not a commonage?  It is important for us to understand what is being called a commonage.  To my knowledge, one never sees the word "commonage" in the folios.  One sees references to "undivided share, one fiftieth" and that kind of thing.  It is important for us to get a clear understanding of what the officials are talking about.</p><p> I have seen it all in my time.  I have seen the fetish about over-grazing and I have seen the prescriptions to deal with over-grazing.  When I served as Minister, I brought the late Michael O'Toole to the Department to meet representatives of the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  Mr. O'Toole, who was a soil scientist by profession, had worked for Teagasc for many years.  He was also a hill sheep farmer.  He had been in charge of the hill sheep station that was run by Teagasc and previously by the Agricultural Institute.  He spent five hours warning the officials that if they continued to pursue the prescriptions they were pursuing, they were going to get an under-grazing problem.  He said that this problem would not be caused by the farmers, but by the prescription farming that was being prescribed.  Needless to say, his warnings fell on deaf ears.  The officials carried on regardless and took virtually all the sheep off the mountains in the Maamturks and other areas.</p><p> Now that we have moved on from over-grazing to the latest fetish of under-grazing, which we are being told is happening on a massive scale, I think this committee is entitled to information from the Department on the areas that are allegedly under-grazed.  I would like to compare those areas with the areas where the two Departments put in the prescriptions and forced the farmers to take away the stock.  If my guess is right, the vast amount of under-grazing that the officials are talking about was not caused by farmers who were unwilling to farm the hills or too old to do so - it was caused by the Department's own prescriptions.  It would be very unfair to penalise farmers for the outcome of things we had warned about.  The idea that farmers are not farming the land - that one will not get enough farmers in all the commonages to put up enough stock to keep them fully grazed - is not my experience.  When they come in to see me every week, they ask whether it might be possible for them to put more sheep on the hill.  I would be interested to hear Deputy Kyne's experience of this in Connemara.  The farmers want to know when the stocking restrictions, which they never wanted, will be lifted.  They wanted sheep.  Regardless of the amount of money that was given to them, many farmers were very aggrieved about the sheep being taken away in such numbers, particularly in more recent years.  The officials need to stop talking in generalities about under-grazing and start giving us the facts.  It is important for this Oireachtas committee, the members of which represent the people, to be given that information.</p><p> I do not know who came up with the idea under Pillar 1 that a farmer will not get a single farm payment if he or she does not have stock on the commonage area that he or she submits.  I will set out a very simple case involving a large commonage area of 300 ha, or 750 acres.  If just 30 farmers - this would be quite a small number - in that commonage are farming the lowland, there will be 10 ha per farmer.  If we presume that the real stocking level is one ewe per acre - I am talking about a good grass hill, as one would not get such a level on a boggy hill - that is 2.5 ewes per hectare.  If the 30 of them have to put their sheep on the hill, there will be 30 flocks of 25 sheep up there.  Of course, there are 750-acre commonages with 100 owners who are submitting area aid forms.  If the officials do not believe such commonages exist, I can give them examples.  I have seen a commonage of 245 acres with 200 owners.  The officials can understand how this would affect such a commonage.</p><p> My example relates to farmers with 25 ewes each.  If the number of farmers in this case was to increase to 60, they would have 12 ewes each over 750 acres.  The idea of a farmer chasing around the mountain after 12 sheep that are spread randomly over 750 acres, with another 30 doing the same thing, is farcical.  The case I set out involved 30 farmers and 300 ha.  This equates to 10 ha and 25 ewes each.  If the 30 active farmers could come to an arrangement whereby ten of them could put the sheep up on the hill, and the other farmers would allow them to graze their share for free grass without charge, each guy would get 75 ewes.  Chasing around the hill would become a somewhat useful exercise in such circumstances.  There would be the exact same number of ewes on the hill, which would be fully stocked.  That is basically the way the thing works at the moment.  It is not the case that any one of the shares is not being actively farmed.  There is a gentlemen's or ladies' agreement between the farmers about who puts up the sheep on all of this land.  The idea that it is not kept in good agricultural environmental condition is nonsense.  The idea that some other arrangement is reached is equally nonsensical.</p><p> I was at a meeting at which somebody suggested that a farmer who is not farming the mountain can claim the single farm payment and lease it to another farmer.  That is not going to work because as of now, one gets the single payment when it is given and one lets the other guy graze it.  Everybody is happy.  The thing is fully stocked and maintained.  Why would the person who is getting free use of it, in effect, suddenly start paying a lot of money for it?  I do not think that is practical.  The upshot of this is that if it is enforced in an area like Connemara, the single farm payments of over half the farmers will be destroyed.  That is a simple fact.  The Department knows from its own statistics that there are twice as many farmers with cattle only as there are with sheep only or with both cattle and sheep.  We know that the cattle do not go to the top of the mountain.  We were told at the meeting in Maam Cross that one will have to graze all the land as an active farmer.  One will not be covered by putting a few cattle in the lower part of it for a few days each year.  In light of what happened with LIPIS, I firmly believe this will be enforced to the letter of the law.  I can see GPS-sensitive ear tags being put on the sheep five years from now to make sure they are roaming the whole range.</p> <p>They stated that one would have to use all the commonage.  Allowing that it is a mountain, cattle cannot go to the top of the mountain.  Ergo, where there is a cattle-only farm, the Department knows immediately to throw the farmer out of the scheme and not allow him or her claim on his or her commonage.</p><p> This is one of the most extraordinary and frightening developments in hill farming in a long time.  I am sorry that I have taken a while here but I have been working with hill farmers since I went to Connemara in 1974.  As somebody who was sheep farmers' co-operative manager in his early days, I am aggrieved at the way the farmers are being treated.</p><p> On Pillar 2, just as we did centrally with the commonage framework plans, my belief is that if one wants to get farmers in hill areas into the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, the minimum requirement is that the State commissions and pays for the plan in consultation with the farmers on each commonage.  Let us say all of us are farmers in a commonage, we all have different advisers, we all must agree one adviser and we have to pay for it.  If I pay for it because I want to get into GLAS, the Chairman might say he was not interested in getting into GLAS.  When I have the plan ready, he might say then that he wants to go into it and he will use my handy plan because he must use it.  I believe, therefore, that step number one in this is that there should be one plan, like the commonage framework plan but which would be a GLAS plan developed for the commonages, and if I go to my planner, he or she would buy into that plan.</p><p> The second detail we need to know is the extra ideas the Department has.  The officials stated that good agricultural and environmental condition, GAEC, applies in terms of single farm payment.  One of the questions that is left unanswered, therefore, is the nature of the prescription under the GLAS scheme.  What will a farmer have to do over and above GAEC, in other words, graze it correctly?  If there are physical changes to the commonage involved, any one shareholder, active or inactive, can stop it.  One cannot change anything on a commonage physically without the permission of all.  If one ever tried to lock-split a commonage - the Land Commission in the Department will give the officials the lowdown on this - one could not do it without 100% agreement.</p><p> On this round, it is stated that if there are 20 shareholders on a commonage, and 15 are claiming shares under the single payment scheme, but only ten of those are actively grazing the land, the 50% requirement to trigger priority access to GLAS is just five farmers.  It was stated earlier in this regard, however, that if there are 20 shareholders on a commonage and only ten of those are actively grazing the land at present, there can only be ten farmers claiming the commonage for the single farm payment by the end of 2015.  What farmers will be forced to do and what I would do is to go to Maam Cross, buy ten cast ewes and let them off on the mountain.  They would disappear to the original mountain, but so be it.  I would have them up on the hill to meet the Department's requirements.  If I have a small enough share, I can put ten up and let them go wild.  What about it?  Those sheep will return home.  This provision shows the total misunderstanding.  How will we get all these ewes into place?  How will we get them there?  If I am in a commonage and I have not been putting sheep up on the hill, and if I decide I want to put sheep on the hill and none of my neighbours is willing to sell me the sheep, how will I get sheep up there?  If I go to Maam Cross mart and buy ewes, they will head off across the mountain a distance of ten or 20 miles back to where they came from but I will be able to show in my census that I put them up there and I can leave the Department officials to try find them.  This is totally misguided.  To put it frankly, we need to think this one out again.  This is a much bigger disaster than the Department appreciates.</p></speech>

Much of what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v states is what I have been hearing as well at meetings throughout the country.  I understand representatives of the Department attended meetings in the west.  I was not at those meetings but what I know, from the farmers to whom I have spoken since, as I was in the west last week, is that there is total dissatisfaction.  These farmers could not get any straight answers and they are very concerned about what is coming down the track.  All of us here, as public representatives, feel the same way about this.  As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v stated, this could turn into a nightmare if it is not done right.</p><p>  On GLAS on the hill and how to draw down the payments, the plan is determined by the buy-in from those who have access to and use of the commonage.  One could end up in a situation where one is obliged to maintain the commonage, I assume in its entirety, in good agricultural and environmental condition.  I refer to a vast amount of hectares with only a few farmers.  In a commonage of 20 farmers, for example, as Mr. Dillon stated, there may be ten active and ten non-active, with the five farmers buying into it responsible for the good agricultural and environmental condition of the commonage.  Mr. Dillon should clarify how the Department proposes to determine that.</p><p>  Mr. Dillon also spoke of a single plan for a commonage.  Is this workable?  The onus is back on the active farmer to bring forward the plan and get everyone else who is an active farmer to buy into the same plan.  It is determined by everyone being supportive of each other, and that may not be the case.  If Mr. Dillon is familiar with rural areas and those who share commonages, it is difficult to get shareholders to agree.  If that does not happen, who will be at a loss?</p><p>  Mr. Dillon also stated that no one will be locked out of GLAS if there is not a 50% take-up.  If any percentage under 50% is prepared to buy into and work this, their application should be verified and they should be allowed to draw down their entitlements.</p><p>  Who appoints the commonage implementation committee?  Is it the Department or does it include Department officials?  I would be concerned to know who it is.  If there is a big disagreement here between active farmers on commonages who have been present at the Department's meeting and are not satisfied with the officials who dealt with those meetings, and if those officials are the ones who will adjudicate afterwards, I would be concerned about it.</p><p>  We have a short space of time to get this right.  The Department needs to listen to those on the ground who have been active farmers in commonages all their lives.  Those are the best ones to know what is happening there.  I hope that will be the case.</p></speech>

I will not go back over everything that has been outlined by Deputies &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Martin Ferris, except to state that I agree with them.  We need clarity on the practicalities of how the commonage plans will work.</p><p>  My one question relates to the commonage implementation committee.  I note that the hill farmers' action group met that committee a number of weeks ago.  They believed they had achieved some agreement on changes to take place in relation to the commonages and they since have come to the conclusion that those changes have not been acted on within the Department.  What recommendations did the commonage implementation committee make to the Department and has the Department taken them on board?</p></speech>

Mr. Dillon said the Department had recently received official observations about the draft scheme from the Commission.  Will the programme have to be changed much?  Will it require amendment and will it be open to public discussion?  Will this slow down the entire process?  GLAS needs to be put in place as soon as possible.  I acknowledge discussions must still take place, but the timescale is important for most farmers.  I will leave the commonage issue to those who are more knowledgeable.</p></speech>

However, the programme is much wider than that.  I am not sure whether it is the Department's intention to focus on one or two issues and deflect attention from others.  The issues of major concern are commonage and GLAS, if they are implemented as proposed.  While these might be laudable objectives on paper that will deal with issues such as fires on hills due to a lack of grazing and so on and address commonage plans, they are unworkable.  A sledgehammer is being taken to crack a nut.  Farmers will be punished because of the way policy was implemented by the Department in previous years.  The Department requested in conjunction with NPWS a cutback on hill grazing and to remedy this, the commonage plan is one of the policy objectives it is bringing forward, which in my view and that of farmers and other committee members is not workable and not practicable at all.  As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, who lives beside a commonage in Connemara, has outlined, linking the single farm payment to the commonage area will not work in the manner proposed.</p><p>  There are farmers on one commonage in my county and 15 different planners are working with them.  They all draw down the single farm payments.  Some are engaged in AEOS while others are on the verge of leaving the REPS.  How will farmers decide which of the 15 planners to employ?  It is crazy beyond belief and it will not work.  Too much of the onus is being put on farmers and easier and more workable methods could be taken into consideration.  It is also a little harsh on farmers.  They are being told a policy is being introduced because officials do not think they can manage themselves and they will stipulate clearly what farmers can do.  The objectives may be laudable but practicality does not come with them.</p><p>  When one applies for area aid, one must also apply for GLAS in 2015.  What will happen to farmers who are engaged in a five year programme under AEOS?  Do they have to give up AEOS and apply for GLAS?</p></speech>

I am concerned about the tone of the debate regarding GLAS and commonages.  Farmers have been destocked and badly treated over the years and many have been unable to restock commonages with sheep.  It is important that they be given an opportunity to at least participate in GLAS and not be barred from it.  It is also important that a plan for each commonage be agreed with the Department and the planners but that one planner rather than a number of planners implements it.  Each farmer could employ a planner to implement the plan.  Farmers should be not be disallowed from GLAS.  The scheme is an important support for farmers in these areas and they have looked after commonages through the years, long before destocking took place.  They managed the commonages in an environmentally friendly way.  It is vitally important they be given an opportunity to do that.  I look forward to the reply.</p></speech>

I have a few questions regarding GLAS, which I have raised with the Minister previously.  I appreciate the officials have received replies from the Commission regarding issues.  I am a former REPS planner and there is a great deal of concern among farmers and planners about the deadline and the scale of what is required to complete the process of preparing complete commonage plans and individual plans for farmers.  There is a perception that many planners, where they have a choice, will deal with every non-commonage farmer before even considering a commonage farmer because they are anxious to get work done.  They have lists of existing clients or other clients who may be interested and they will deal with everyone bar the commonage farmers first.  One of the aims traditionally was to include Natura lands to give options to farmers to participate in schemes on them.  If all the other farmers draw up plans and the commonage farmers are left to the end, that defeats the purpose of providing funding for Natura lands.</p><p>  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and others about the Department controlling the commonage plan either by choosing an adviser or going to tender to select an organisation to deal with this.  It is probably late in the day to do this now but asking a large number of farmers to pick one person to do the job poses huge difficulties in the context of payments under the plan and controlling it.</p><p>  Approximately 50% of farmers have more than one commonage area in their single payment scheme application.  Five or six townlands have to be dealt with on some forms.  On the basis that they have their individual plan and are party to five or six other commonage plans which they must pay for, set up and attend meetings about, it is a minefield in respect of how this will be addressed.</p><p>  I ask that consideration be given before GLAS opens to allow farmers to express an interest that they wish to participate in the scheme and that the deadline be extended to the end of 2015 to enable commonage farmers to prepare plans because there will be a time lag.  This will also give the Department time to examine the allocation of individual commonages to one planner or organisation.</p><p>  I understand farmers who are in AEOS 1, 2 or 3 have the option to transfer to GLAS.  Will the officials clarify whether there is an option or a requirement?  I spoke to a planner yesterday who said it was a requirement that they transfer to the scheme.  Can they be counted in terms of the 50%?  They are in an environmental programme and, therefore, they should be counted.  In most cases in my experience, farmers who were in REPS 1 transferred to REPS 2 and 3 and so on and, under various schemes, they transferred where they could.</p> <p>The GLAS scheme is an important programme for commonages and it is important the programme is workable.  Will the officials comment on that?</p><p> Before we discuss undergrazing, overgrazing and forage, may I clarify if we are dealing with the single payment and the reduction in forage areas?</p></speech>

This happened this year in Castledaly.  I know that Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v would have tabled a question on that.  Other Members would have been involved in other commonages, such as Keelderry last year.  There is a concern about the consequences of this.  Obviously there is a penalty for farmers, which is one part, and it is serious for the farmers, but there is also the impact of the reduction from 95% to 45%, which is effectively half the available land for grazing.  In theory this means that the number of animals put to the commonage has to be halved.  If one is halving the number of animals that are to be allowed on the commonage, it will have the effect of causing more undergrazing and more ineligible areas.  Most of the commonages in the country are designated special areas of conservation and special protection areas.  The requirements under the EU directives on birds and habitats is that we have to maintain these commonages in proper health and status for the reasons they were designated, for example, the habitat for bird species.  If one reduces the number of animals by virtue of reducing the forage area, one is impacting on the status of the commonages.  Do the officials believe, as has been suggested by others, that this could lead to Ireland being in breach of EU directives on birds and habitats?  This must be given serious consideration in the run=up to the next single payment session.<br/>Dr. David Scallan, who presented a paper recently on preventing the loss of valuable agricultural and environmental habitats, states:<blockquote>Effectively, current eligibility rules for agricultural payments are forcing many farmers to remove environmentally valuable farmed habitats or abandon high nature value farmland.  As a result, farm habitats that host lots of wildlife (in particular some excellent woodcock and pheasant habitat) and provide shelter whilst allowing grazing for farm animals are at risk of being cleared for fear of financial penalties.  This will result in a loss of biodiversity, farm productivity and landscape variety, all key characteristics of rural Ireland that European legislation is supposed to protect or enhance.</blockquote>This is serious.  He also states:<blockquote>In very simple terms, whole swathes of land, particularly in the west of Ireland, are being red-lined as ineligible for payments.  The signal from the Commission therefore appears to be that biodiverse landscapes need to be eliminated or farmers will suffer severe multi-annual cuts to their single payment.  This feeds the perception that the only solution will be to bulldoze, burn ... or remove any tree, bush, gorse or other species, which does not conform to the Commission approach, which might be perceived as aiming to homogenise land use and farming practices across the European Union.</blockquote>This is Dr. Scallan's view of the impact of removing scrub and the reduction of forage areas.  It is his view that due to the size of the commonages and the impact of the decisions that have been made by the Department, an appropriate assessment would be required due to the likelihood of a significant effect of the designated sites, in particular in light of the precautionary principle.  I would appreciate if the officials could comment on these points.</p></speech>

May I clarify that for the good agricultural and environmental condition, GAEC, there is a requirement of one ewe per 1.5 hectares for the basic payments scheme.  If one is not going into GLAS, no plan is needed.  That is a proposed requirement in the draft at present.  The single plan comes into play for the purposes of the Pillar 2 GLAS payment.</p><p>  There are locally led environment schemes which are also part of it, for example, in the Burren and others areas that may come forward.  There are 160 participants in the Burren environment scheme, getting an average of &euro;7,500 each, and that is done by mutual agreement.  That is a further development.  It will be specific and will require detailed plans and approvals.</p><p>  The key point for applications to GLAS is that there will be a need, especially in light of the deeper and wider impacts that Deputy Kyne identified, for the Department to nominate someone and for that person or company to work with the existing planners.  It will take some pooling to make it happen.  The question being posed is that where a person with a basic payment scheme requirement does not intend to put his or her animals onto the commonage and that person makes an application under GLAS, is there some way of getting around that whereby he or she could nominate or allocate that stock number in order that the plan works and he or she keeps the entitlement?  That appears to be the sort of line being pursued.  I am trying to put in context the line of questioning that has come forward.</p></speech>

We fully appreciate the difficulties with regard to commonages.  They are far more complex than private land.  There are difficulties because people must have collective activity and management.  It means that people have to work together and get along.  The difficulty I see is that we have a problem with massive undergrazing on our commonages.  It is not just down to Government policy on destocking and the problem of overgrazing that we had in the past.  We have a situation where the number of sheep on the commonages has reduced dramatically.  That is down to decoupling and the age profile of the people involved.  What we need and what we are looking for is a greater level of activity on the commonages.  We know it cannot be done overnight.  We know it is not a short-term fix.  It has to be done over time, but the reason I say the<i>status quo </i>cannot continue is because we are facing massive fines from the European Union, if we leave the commonages the way they area.  It is as simple as that.<br/>If the EU auditors see the amount of scrub and undergrazing on our commonages, they will immediately put forward a flat rate disallowance on the country.  If we can put in place a credible plan which will show a way of bringing the commonages back into good agricultural and environmental condition, we will have a situation, where I believe we would buy time and credibility with the Commission, which would allow us to get the commonages back to the way they were.<br/>Certain things are happening with regard to farming on commonages with the introduction of the new CAP, the new basic payment and the higher level of payment on convergences, which will allow a greater level of activity to take place.  I know it needs time and it is a long-term process, but we must recognise the reality.  The reality is that many of our commonages are undergrazed.  It is as simple as that.<br/>Deputy Kyne asked about the situation with regard to the commonage implementation committee.  That is an advisory committee and not a policy committee.  It is chaired by an independent chairman, Mr. Joe Healy, and has representatives from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and also from the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  The purpose of the commonage implementation committee is to solve problems.  People who have problems with reaching agreement on commonage plans can go to the commonage implementation committee and they help put in place a plan which is acceptable to all.  That is the role of the commonage implementation committee.</p> <p>The issue of commonages was mentioned where inspectors would go out and say an area was not 95% eligible, rather it was 45% eligible.  That does not mean the number of animals allowed would be halved.  The problem is that the inspectors are not finding animals on them.  There is a problem of undergrazing.  I would be delighted if the number of animals on commonages could be doubled because we would able to improve the grazing and deal with the problem of scrub.  We should not mix the concepts of scrub and habitat.  Habitats are protected.  If anyone has established a habitat, they can declare that under the single farm payment scheme and it will be maintained.  What we are seeing here is scrub encroachment.<br/>We will accept lower stocking where there are special areas of conservation or special protection areas.  We do that for the disadvantaged areas scheme where we allow for lower of numbers of animals in certain areas and, from that point of view, we are more than happy to respect the environmental considerations.  As was said, if the area is one of blanket bog, there should be lower numbers of animals on it.  The ideal we are trying to bring in is that there would be a minimum grazing requirement such that people would have one ewe per 1.5 hectares to attract the basic payment.  It is not a huge requirement.  Only 23 animals are required on the average farm size of 32 hectares.  We cannot maintain the <i>status quo</i>.  As a public official, I must point out that there is a danger of there being a major disallowance if we keep going the way we are going with regard to the commonages.</p></speech>

We put to them the difficulty of farmers coming together and agreeing on one adviser and one plan.  We would all agree there can only be one plan for each commonage because everyone must be working towards a common purpose.  We wanted to make it as non-prescriptive as possible in order that the farmers and their advisers would have as much scope as possible as to what measures they would introduce by way of improving the agri-environmental status of the commonage.  That is reason we did not want to impose plans on the farmers.  We offered to get involved in linking farmers with advisers for the purpose of doing this, but both Teagasc and the ACA said they could look after this themselves.</p><p>  We also asked them about the timeline and if it was possible to do this, as alluded to by Deputy Kyne, and they said that while the timeline would be tight, they believed it could be done.  We are mindful of the fact that all these commonages will all have to be walked and that a good deal of work will need to be done.  We may need to revisit the timeline in terms of lodging the plan, but if we are to accept a farmer into GLAS and start making payments to the farmer from the start of a contract date, that means the farmer has entered into agri-environmental commitments.  We must have something against which to be able to measure those commitments.  We cannot simply take a farmer into the scheme on the basis of signing a commitment to join a plan.  We must have something of the detail that is in the plan.  The idea was that we would not be prescriptive as to what measures would go in and that the adviser in conjunction with the farmers who wanted to join would be able to agree on the optimum level of stocking that would be appropriate for that particular commonage.  They would know the current level among all the shareholders and the optimum level, and then they could take a stepped approach to get from the current level to the optimum level.  That was the planning behind it and the reason we were using this model.</p><p>  At all times our philosophy was that we did not want to impose upon the farmers and the advisers what particular model they should use because it was pointed out to us several times that the people who know what is best for the commonage in terms of how to improve it are the farmers and they could get together with their own advisers in terms of how to improve it.  Stocking is one element but there are other collective actions that can be introduced as part of the plan to make it better from an agri-environmental point of view.</p><p>  The rate payment proposed under GLAS was &euro;120 per hectare per annum.  A fair chunk of that payment was arrived at by virtue of the fact the farmer would be paying the adviser to do that.  The point has been made about how this will be worked out if several farmers are involved and if it will not be the case that the advisers will go after the easier ones, but there is a flip side to that.  If there are a large number of shareholders involved and they and a few planners get together, they will note that the cost they have to charge each farmer will go down the more commonage shareholders there are.</p></speech>

Dr. Smyth made a few references to scrub land.  One of the problems is that there have been limitations attached to burning scrub land.  Is that aspect part of what will be necessary?  In our report last year we referenced specifically inaction with regard to burning.  It is an environmental measure and not one that is damaging.  Deputy Kyne asked whether the use of a bulldozer or the traditional way is the best way, and I argue that the traditional way, which kept the commonages in good condition, is the way to manage them.</p></speech>

Eight meetings on the commonages were held.  The meeting at Maam Cross was especially fractious but many of the meetings went well from that point of view.  The same issues came up and one of the issues, as was correctly mentioned by the Chairman, was that of burning.  The National Parks and Wildlife service deals with the burning area.  The question was raised as to whether it is possible to increase the window in terms of the dates, and that is an issue we have taken up with the National Parks Wildlife Service.  I agree with the Chairman that there is a role there for controlled burning as part of commonage management plans, and it is something we have raised with the National Parks and Wildlife Service.</p></speech>

I have long experience of dealing with farmers and all they have ever told me is that they want to put sheep on the hill and they were allowed to do so.  Let us resolve this once and for all.  Can Dr. Smyth give me and Deputy Kyne the maps of the areas in Connemara that he believes are undergrazed?  If he gives us those, we will be able to compare those with the commonage framework plans and we will know the cause of the problem once and for all.  That is what is called evidence-based decision-making.  I would want to see the evidence before I would believe there is great deal of that land that has been abandoned by farmers.  If we want to ensure there is adequate grazing of the commonage, it is much more likely we would do it in a systematic and better way if a smaller number of farmers were putting a larger number of sheep on the hills.  If we force people to put small numbers of sheep on the hills, they will not be able to provide the care for the area that would be provided if there were a big flock of sheep on the mountain.</p><p>  I will cite a typical example.  I am sure Deputy Kyne knows Oorid in Recess.  If one checks this commonage in the Land Registry, one will note it comprises 1,753 acres.  There are 80 farmers with a stake in it, which works out at approximately 22 acres a head.  Dr. Smyth can work out the number of sheep involved.  If it is set out in acres, 1.5 hectares would work out at 2.5 and there would be another 1.25.</p> <p>That is 3.75.  Each one is 20 acres.  If I divide that by four, I need something like 5 to 7 sheep over 1,753 acres, if they all take up the option to avail of the grant.  That is not management, it is chaos.  It is not workable.  </p><p> I cannot understand why the Department of Agriculture does not say it wants x number of sheep on a designated hill, for example 500 ewes on a hill, or if it is a very good hill there might be a ewe to the acre.  Presumably the number of ewes will relate to the quality of the land.  Blanket bog would take fewer ewes.  Say the Department decides it wants 500 ewes on a piece of land.  Why can't it tell the farmers that it wants there to be 500 ewes there collectively and it does not care which farmer technically owns the ewes?  Then we would get a very well-managed situation where a smaller number will look after the flock well, and will manage the sheep across the range.  If the Department is forcing people with five or 10 sheep up onto the hill just to keep their area-based payment, they are not going to be able to manage them over the range.  How can five to 10 ewes be managed over that kind of range?  It is not practical.  </p><p> I am appalled at the continued total lack of understanding of the reality of this.   I was trying to explain it in Maam Cross.  The next problem, of course, is that if we have under-grazing, for example if there were only 200 ewes on the land, it will take a long time to breed up.  A farmer will only get 70 lambs out of 100 ewes and only half of those will be female, so that is 35, and of the 100 ewes, 10 will die every year on average, so no we only have 25.  Even keeping all of the ewe lambs, which are the profitable ones to sell, the flock can only be increased by 25 ewes per hundred per annum.  That is all that can be done.  If a farmer wants to go from 100 to 200 it is going to take at least four years.  There is a problem here.</p><p> Do we know how many hill farmers are on the commonage implementation committee?  These are people who have real experience on hills.  </p><p> Did the farming organisations not warn the Department that this would be chaos in the mountains before the rural development programme went in and all of this was drawn up?  In fairness to the IFA they have been vociferous in places like Connemara, saying that this is unworkable.</p></speech>

Can the witnesses give us some information about the deadlines?  It was opening on 1 December but there was some talk it might be January.  When would be the closing deadline?  Is there any certainty on that?<br/>With regard to the Department not having control of the commonage, it was said that Teagasc and the ACA felt they could look after it.  Since then I have seen comments from Teagasc people that they are not going to get involved at all.  I am concerned about that.  It was said the Department might have to go back to them.  Is it going to go and see if Teagasc is still of that view?  If this is the case, there needs to be Department involvement and control in relation to the commonage plans.  In regard to those who are currently in AEOS1, 2 and 3, do they count towards the 50%?  <br/>I agree with Dr. Smyth that we cannot keep the <i>status quo</i>in regard to under-grazing but the point I am making is that if we are reducing the forage area, we are effectively saying that commonage can take less stock.  On land where farmers were allowed to put 20 livestock units, if the forage area is reduced by half, they would only able to put on 10 livestock units.  This means that the Department is exacerbating the under-grazing situation.  What it should be doing is maintaining the forage areas but ensuring that there is a minimum stocking and that the farmers have to prove that they have the stock.  If the forage area is reduced, that impacts upon the level of stock that the farmers can put on the farm.  It could have serious consequences for habitat status and could cause a greater level of scrubbing up.  This could reduce the habitat potential of the commonages and cause infringements of both habitat and birds directives.</p></speech>

If the five of us are in a commonage, and four of us decide to go into GLAS next year, and Deputy Kyne is in AEOS and has two years to run, if he wants subsequently to get into GLAS then he has to actually leave AEOS and join GLAS with two years to run on his scheme.

I would rather we moved on.  There are more high-level concerns than speculating over rare events or scenarios.  Dr. Smyth clarified the situation with regard to late entry to the scheme and the commonage implementation committee.  Deputy Kyne asked a question about the continual reduction with regard to scrub.  I honestly feel that if the auditors came over here and said "Hold on" and the Department said that it was trying to reinstate good vegetation management but was having difficulties with the National Parks and Wildlife Service concerning rules about burning, which is an effective tool for vegetation management, the auditors would tell us to get our act together.</p></speech>

The encroachment of scrub is also an issue.  I can understand the point the Deputy makes about the need to maintain the forage area so that the payments can be maintained, but the inspectors are required to comply with the EU regulations.  If the land is abandoned or there is scrub encroachment, the system must reflect that, and the land parcel identification system must reflect the state of the land.  That is where the problem lies and the Deputy is right to state we do need more sheep on the hills.  On that point the issue is activity.</p></speech>

Although we had no commonage framework plans to destock where I come from, there has been a significant reduction.  One of the things that has not been mentioned, and is probably not a phenomenon that worries people to the same degree in the west of Ireland, is dog-worrying.  It is a serious issue.  There are people in the Visitors Gallery who will empathise with that.  It has been one of the problems that has deterred people.  This relates less to recreational users but just loose dogs causing serious problems.  That and some problems with vegetation management but one is as important as the other.  There were no destocking framework plans in the hills in Wicklow and there has been a significant reduction for other reasons.  We must address them all.  If there is an overlap where there has been significant reduction or land abandonment on commonages where there were commonage framework plans for destocking, they must be reversed very quickly.  If members are satisfied that the officials have got a fairly good flavour of what the key points are for us, we can move on.  I could open this up again, but-----</p></speech>

I have seen problems with what they see as effective land abandonment and the growth of forage.  They have never told me in all that time that we have a problem with the habitats and birds directives.  As I said, habitats can be protected under the single payments scheme.  One simply puts it down as a habitat and it will be respected as such.  The difficulty I have here is that scrub is not biodiversity.</p></speech>

Can they confirm further that sheep would be the required animal on mountains going up to 2,000 feet, so that it will not suffice to throw cattle on the low land?  That is a very important point.  Have they done a calculation as to the loss of income that will occur on the commonage areas in the counties of Galway, Mayo, etc., due to the fact that if certain farmers continue not to stock the commonage because it makes it unviable, it would effectively double their single farm payment or they are not going to get the lift that the witnesses are talking about?  It will become a mirage, like many things are becoming in the hills, and they will lose also the areas of natural constraint, ANC, payment and they will be locked out of REPS, which they would have been getting.  Have they done a calculation on the net loss in the hill areas of this collective suite of measures?  It seems to me that they are not for turning.</p></speech>

I outlined for consideration before I went back to the original questions the question of a basic payment scheme requirement of one per 1.5 hectares where somebody involved in a GLAS commonage plan nominates somebody else to take care of his or her requirement on the commonage according to a system whereby the commonage is held in an enhanced position beyond GAEC.  By this system, the farmer would still have met his or her responsibly.  I do not know whether that will fly with Europe but that is basically the key point if it is the case that somebody has to be active.  It comes back to the signing of an agreement, which is rather different from somebody claiming somebody else&rsquo;s entitlement saying he had a certain number of sheep on the commonage while his neighbour did not, and that he is going to continue in this regard.  Signing makes people sit down and agree with one another.  It will be difficult but I do not foresee any easy solution.</p><p>  We cannot continue on this any longer as it is 4.05 p.m. and we must deal with organic farming.  I ask members to remain here for ten minutes. I thank Dr. Smyth, whom I understand has to leave.</p></speech>

Council Regulation No. 2092/91 provided a legal definition of organic farming through production rules, defined control and labelling requirements and introduced a regime for importing organic products.  This legislation was substantially revised with the adoption of Council Regulation No. 834 in June 2007, and the Commission implementing regulation, No. 889/2008, which defined the detailed technical rules of organic production.  The regulation  linked the organic control system to the official food and feed controls provided in Regulation No. 882/2004 and made obligatory the accreditation of private certifying bodies.  Organic aquaculture was added to the list of organic products in 2010.<br/>When adopting Council Regulation No. 834/2007, the EU Council identified a series of issues, regarding in particular the scope of the legislation, the prohibition of the use of GMOs and the functioning of the internal market and control system.  The Commission was required to submit a report on these issues to the European Parliament and the Council after having reviewed the experience gained from the application of Regulation No. 834/2007.  This report was submitted to the Council and Parliament in 2012.<br/>The Council, under the Irish Presidency in 2013, adopted conclusions on the report at its meeting on agriculture and fisheries on 13 and 14<b></b>May 2013<b></b>on the basis of the Commission's report.  These included a call to develop the organic farming sector at an ambitious level by reviewing the current legal framework, with a view to improving its usability while providing for a period of stability and certainty, and aiming at further clarification and simplification and addressing the current outstanding issues requiring further development.<br/>In 2013, the EU Commission initiated an impact assessment of the organic sector that included a wide-ranging consultation process.  The Commission concluded in the impact assessment that the current regulations are not sufficiently fit for purpose to allow the sector to develop.  It chose to overhaul radically the current regulations with the objective of removing obstacles to the sustainable development of the sector, further strengthening the Single Market by guaranteeing fair competition for producers, protecting the integrity of organic products and improving consumer confidence in the production system.<br/>Three possible legislative policy options were identified.  First, the improved <i>status quo </i>option notably includes clarifications in the scope of the legislation and simplifications in the labelling rules and addresses some gaps in the legislation.  Second, the market-driven option aims at providing the conditions to respond dynamically to further market developments thanks to a more product-oriented scheme with flexible production rules.  Third, the principle-driven option aims at re-focusing organic farming on its principles.  Production rules are to be strengthened, the control system is to be fully risk based, and import rules are to be overhauled.  The preferred option is the principle-driven model, which entailed a complete overhaul of the existing regulation and culminated in the regulatory proposal currently under discussion and the subject of our meeting here today.The proposal must also be aligned to the Lisbon treaty, which requires the agreement of the co-legislators &ndash; the Council and EU Parliament &ndash; to the allocation of delegated powers to the Commission.<br/>The EU Commission introduced the proposal to the Council in early 2014 under the Greek and Italian presidencies.  The proposal completed its first reading on 15 October.  The EU Parliament, as co-legislator, will begin discussions on the proposal in January.<br/>The discussions are difficult, with many contentious issues arising, and progress is slow.  While there are many elements in this proposal that are welcomed, every member state, without exception, has issues of concern.  Some key issues have emerged about which we share concerns.  These include a series of issues of a political and technical nature.  Among them are a Lisbon treaty alignment exercise, involving the transfer of decision-making powers to the Commission via the delegated Acts; the scope of the proposal, which involves determining what organic products are included in the regulation and, just as important, what is left out; the transfer of organic controls to the new official controls regulation, currently under discussion by the EU Council; and the introduction of a risk-based control regime and the removal of the requirement of an annual inspection by the control bodies.</p> <p>Other factors include harmonisation of residue sampling, analysis and action and establishing a minimum threshold for pesticide residues above which the product cannot be sold as organic and introducing the possibility for member states to pay compensation.<br/>In terms of mixed holdings, we are concerned at the removal of the current flexibility whereby a farm can produce organic and non-organic produce in the same holding.  We are also concerned about the proposed<b></b>severe restriction in the reduction of the conversion period as well as the proposals to include within the control regime all retailers who sell organic products and to exclude the possibility to label in-conversion products as organic.  The proposals to remove or severely restrict flexibility to allow member states to provide, under very exceptional circumstance, for the introduction of non-organic breeding stock, seeds and propagation material onto organic farms are of concern.  Difficulties also arise with regard to the proposed expansion of the import regime to organic imports fully in compliance with the EU organic standards.<br/>The Commission  is holding firm but the Italian Presidency is preparing a compromise text.I welcome any questions committee members may have for us.</p></speech>

The eastern European countries in particular seem to have serious concerns about this  because organic farming is seen there as a way to achieve higher-value production.  The issues of mixed use, conversion and labelling are causing most concern.   The issue of genetically modified organisms did not come up much at the aforementioned meeting.</p><p>  Our ambition is to get to 5% organic farming from our current 1%, which is a five-fold increase.  One would have to say that some of the issues identified here are not going to speed up that process; if anything, they will slow it down.</p></speech>

Labelling, in particular, is very important and the role of retailers as well as producers must be considered in all of this.</p><p>  Mr. Dillon made reference to the transfer of organic controls to the new official controls regulations - what will that mean in practice?  Will it be another bureaucratic quango which will only be a hindrance to the achievement of targets?  Will the imports regime be developed in parallel with the development of the labelling regime or will we end up with a situation similar to that which pertains to products being labelled as Irish which were only given a light dusting of something here?  </p><p>  This is a very complex and technical area and it will be interesting to see what proposals emerge from the Italian Presidency.</p></speech>

The flexibility to take in additional breeding stock is recognised as a key measure for those organic farmers who want to grow.  If we take away that derogation, we are restricting them severely because of the limited availability of breeding stock.  Partial conversion is also a serious issue, as is the transfer of control to the European control body.  At the moment, control is vested in the certifying control bodies, with the Department carrying out a small number of inspections but the proposal here is to take control away from those bodies.  They are serious issues of concern.</p><p>  It is important to understand, however, that there is a long way to go with this process.  It will be quite slow.  There has been a lot of change in the Commission and the process has taken a lot longer than was originally envisaged.  At the recent meetings, at both official and Council level, several member states have indicated that they are not happy with the proposals as they stand.  A lot of work has yet to be done.</p></speech>

In that context, I suggest that we draft a political contribution on this matter.  The officials have outlined the key concerns in the document before us and if members feel we should add to that, we can do so and then send it on to the European Parliament, the Commission, the Irish MEPs and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p>  While it is not for everybody, organic farming has a role to play but we have no hope of getting beyond 1% or 2% of total share if we tie ourselves up in too many impractical restrictions before we even get any momentum behind it.</p></speech>

This new paragraph provides for an expanded research exemption in contrast to the exemption currently obtaining under paragraph (<i>g</i>) of section 42.  The change that the Bill provides for is to ensure that acts such as clinical trials, tests, experiments etc. done for the purpose of obtaining a marketing authorisation not only for generic drugs but also for new and innovative drugs in any State will not be regarded as an infringement of a patent.  The current exemption that applies under section 42(<i>g</i>) of the Act provides for a narrower research exemption in respect of acts done to obtain a marketing authorisation for a generic drug in the EU and EEA<i>.</i><br/>Amendment No. 3 is a technical drafting amendment resulting from the new formatting and numbering of section 42 of this Bill.  The amended section 42 will have two subsections instead of the original single section proposed which will, therefore, become subsection (1).<br/>Amendment No. 4 is also a technical drafting amendment that facilitates the later amendment No. 9.  It provides for the insertion of a new paragraph (c) into section 2 of the Bill.  Amendment No. 5 is a technical drafting amendment reflecting the renumbering of section 42 of the Act of 1992 into subsections (1) and (2).<br/>Amendments 8 and 9 are related with the latter inserting a new paragraph (c) into section 2 of the Bill, which will have the effect of inserting a new subsection (2) into section 42 of the 1992 Patents Act.  This new provision contains stand-alone definitions for &quot;medicinal product for human use&quot;, &quot;substance&quot; and &quot;veterinary medicinal product&quot;.  For reasons of legal certainty, the linking of the references to medicinal product for human use and veterinary medicinal product to the EU directives on the Community codes relating to medicinal products for human use and for veterinary medicinal products are being discontinued and replicated as stand-alone definitions in Irish law.  In that way, any future question arising as to the interpretation of these definitions in the context of Irish law will rest solely with the Irish courts.  As the EU definition can change, it is important we have in place our own clear definition.<br/>Amendment No. 8 proposes the deletion of the references to medicinal product for human use and veterinary medicinal product which were those as defined in the EU directives on the Community codes relating to medicinal products for human use and for veterinary medicinal products.  Amendment No. 9 inserts a stand-alone definition for these terms, as well as a definition for &quot;substance&quot;, rather than defining these terms by reference to the directives.  In the event of a legal action, the Irish courts will be the appropriate body to interpret these terms.  The scope of material covered by the definitions reliably reflects the scope under the directives.</p></speech>

The TTIP negotiations are creating many worries among people in the context of intellectual property.  Recently, the US Chamber of Commerce lodged an objection with the European Commission regarding the Government's plan to introduce plain packaging of tobacco products.  The Commission was also warned that this would have an impact on the economy as it would be seen to damage significantly the concept of intellectual property rights.  The US Chamber of Commerce said it would damage intra-EU trade if Ireland set a dangerous precedent and damaged intellectual property rights by adopting plain packaging.<br/>British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and a number of other large tobacco firms, which make their money selling a product that kills one in two users, took the Australian Government to court in Australia on the issue of intellectual property rights and plain packaging.  They did not win in Australia but they are now taking the government to court in Hong Kong, which has a trade agreement with Australia.  Property rights are important but they cannot be the only right that is important.  It is critical that governments have the right to legislate and create policy that affects people's health and welfare.<br/>The text of the amendment is copied from the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation legislation, which reads &quot;And whereas in the achievement of the winding up of IBRC the common good may require permanent or temporary interference with the rights, including the property rights, of persons&quot;.  This sets a precedent for the use of a provision to ensure certain rights are more important than these property rights.  That is why I ask the Minister of State to include the amendment.</p></speech>

I understand its intent and I know what he is trying to achieve.  We believe it is provided for but I will go through that.  His proposal is to include a new so-called common good provision in the Patents Act 1992 to allow for the possibility of interference with intellectual property rights enjoyed by individuals or corporate entities in pursuance of the common good.</p><p>  Patents are but one form of intellectual property rights, which term includes also copyright, trademarks, industrial designs, etc.  The Constitution specifically recognises the importance of property, with Article 43 acknowledging the natural right to private ownership of external goods and "the State guarantees to pass no law attempting to abolish" this right of private ownership.  As the Deputy said, however, in recognition of the principles of social justice, the Constitution provides that the State may, as occasion requires, delimit by law the exercise of such rights in the exercise of the common good.</p><p>  At national, European and international level, intellectual property rights enjoy protection set down under well-established and respected principles.  We have legislative acts at domestic level on trade marks, copyright, patents, industrial designs and so on.  Equally, there is harmonisation at EU level in the area of trade mark and industrial design law and we have signed up to commitments to respect intellectual property rights.</p> <p>At international level, the State is party to a number of international treaties and conventions that sign us up to a certain level of IP protection.  These include the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, dating from 1883, and the 1994 Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, known as the TRIPs agreement.  The TRIPs agreement introduced intellectual property into the international trading system and remains the most comprehensive international agreement on intellectual property to date.</p><p> Whether at national, European or international level, IP protections are not, of themselves, absolute rights and states are permitted to apply derogations that allow for the suspension of part of the legal obligation which can operate to restrict some rights under certain circumstances, such as in the pursuit of broader compelling public policy reasons or for greater public interest considerations.  Section 42 of the Patents Act 1992, which is itself being amended by the Bill, already limits the rights of patent holders in certain restrictive circumstances.  Circumstances permitted include acts done privately for non-commercial purposes and acts done for experimental purposes on or into a patented invention.</p><p> I recognise Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's amendment reflects the good faith intention to allow for the limitation by the State of intellectual property rights to achieve objectives for the common good.  It is the case that there exists under the Constitution, and specifically in intellectual property legislation, the provisions to allow the State, if necessary and in particular circumstances, to delimit intellectual property rights.  It would be wholly inappropriate and undesirable, however, to provide for the limitation of intellectual property rights on a blanket basis in a provision of the Patents Act.  Existing provisions are set out that allow for the delimitation of rights in certain expressed circumstances in a manner the State can support without conflict with domestic, European or international obligations.  As drafted, Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's amendment goes beyond what is permitted and for this reason I cannot support his amendment.  Given the rationale I have outlined, I hope Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n can agree to withdraw his amendment.</p><p> If the Deputy wishes I will provide him with a full briefing document prior to Report Stage.  We feel it is quite well covered and that we can achieve the Deputy wants.  We understand what he is trying to do but we believe it is already permitted under law and in the Constitution.  The Department is very clear about what can be done and what the TRIPs agreement allows.</p></speech>

I welcome Ms Laura Burke, who is the director general of the agency; Mr. Dara Lynott, who is the deputy director general of the agency's office of climate, licensing and resource use; Mr. Gerard O'Leary, who is the director of the agency's office of environmental enforcement; and Dr. Ann McGarry, who is the director of the agency's office of radiological protection.<br/>I wish to draw their attention to the fact that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also wish to advise them that their opening statement and any other documentation they have submitted to the committee may be published on the committee's website after this meeting.</p> <p> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to him or her identifiable.</p><p> Before the delegates from the Environmental Protection Agency addresses the committee, I wish to draw Ms Burke's attention to a number of issues I would like her to address.  How has the agency's merger with the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland worked out and what benefits have accrued from it?  Has the agency adopted any new approach to radiological protection or does it intend to?  How does the agency assess the benefits and risks before issuing licences or permits in relation to GMOs?  How does the agency envisage its future role in the protection of water resources and how does it envisage its dealings and relationship with Uisce &Eacute;ireann in this regard?  Can Ms Burke comment specifically on the recent report on climate change and the need for urgent action?  Can she comment on the agency's current research programme into the environmental impact of fracking?  Has Ms Burke any views on the potential impact and risk, if any, to Ireland of the proposed Hinkley Point nuclear power plant in Britain?  Lastly, she might also comment on the agency's policy of enforcement and how it decides on and pursues prosecutions.  I call on the Environmental Protection Agency to deliver its opening statement.</p></speech>

Then I can touch on the wide range of issues the Vice Chairman raised.<br/>First, I thank the committee for the opportunity to attend this joint Oireachtas committee meeting.  As the Vice Chairman stated, I am joined by colleagues from the EPA to assist in the work of the committee today.<br/>The Environmental Protection Agency's mission is to protect and improve the environment as a valuable asset for the people of Ireland and to protect our people and the environment from the harmful effects of radiation and pollution.  The ultimate objective is a clean, healthy and well-protected environment supporting a sustainable society and economy.<br/>The EPA performs a wide range of statutory functions for the protection of the environment.  In May 2011, an independent external review of the agency was completed and presented to the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Mr. Hogan.  The report of the review group stated that the EPA overall has provided considerable benefit for Ireland's environment for the health and well-being of its people and that the environmental expertise within the EPA is a significant national resource.  I take this opportunity to recognise the contribution of the staff of the agency in delivering on our objectives.<br/>We have already provided the committee with an opening statement and I will now give a brief overview of the Environmental Protection Agency's role, duties and responsibilities, and information on the monitoring and enforcement of licences at industrial facilities.<br/>First, on the merger of the EPA and the RPII, as part of the Government's public sector reform plan, a decision was made in October 2012 to merge the EPA and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.  Legislation was passed in 2014 to give effect to the merger and the EPA's newly established Office of Radiological Protection commenced operation on 1 August this year.  The merger was completed on time and on budget.  With regard to the benefits of the merger, I suppose the first point to recognise is that we are only a couple of months in to the merger.  Dr. Ann McGarry is here, and she can discuss further particular radiological protection issues.  To date, we have merged the administrative functions of the radiological protection institute and the EPA so that we now have one corporate resources function, and we are investigating opportunities for technical and scientific synergies of the two organisations, and now, I suppose, the Office of Radiological Protection and other offices, for example, in areas such as our monitoring programmes and emergency response.  We will be progressing these in the coming months.<br/>On licensing and enforcement, the EPA has a key role in licensing facilities with the potential for significant environmental pollution to ensure that their emissions do not endanger human health or harm the environment.  In 2013, we issued 176 licences and over 700 technical amendments.  We also carried out over 1,300 industrial and waste site visits, 240 urban wastewater site visits and 55 drinking water site visits.  Ten prosecutions were heard in the district court and two in the higher courts in 2013.<br/>With regard to domestic wastewater treatment systems, the national compliance rate for year one inspections was 52%.  The most common reasons for failure of an inspection related to operation-maintenance and-or de-sludging issues.<br/>On sustainable use of resources, in 2013 the national waste prevention programme, led by the EPA, continued to deliver substantive results in preventing and minimising waste though EPA's <i>BeGreen</i>resource efficiency programmes.  The 2013 results from the <i>BeGreen</i>programmes, such as Green Business, Green Hospitality and Green Healthcare, identified economic savings in excess of &euro;7 million, with further potential savings of &euro;7 million from an investment by the EPA of circa &euro;1.2 million.  A major new project, Smarter Farming, was initiated in 2012 in collaboration with the Irish Farmers' Association.<br/>On climate change, greenhouse gas projections released by the EPA in 2014 indicate that Ireland faces considerable challenges in moving to a low carbon economy.  Under the best case scenario, greenhouse gas emissions will remain relatively static up to 2020.  As a result, emissions in 2020 will be 5% to 12% below 2005 levels and will not meet the 20% reduction target.<br/>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, synthesise report, which has just been released,  indicates, as the executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, stated, that there is no more room for debate about whether climate change is happening or not.  It is happening.  The influence is clear, it is human activity and action needs to be taken urgently.  The EPA runs a significant communications programme to highlight climate change issues with public issues.  In fact, we are privileged to have one of the authors of the IPCC report in the Mansion House in Dublin tomorrow night looking at adaptation and the adaptation issues associated with climate change.  We would be delighted if any of the members of the committee could come and here at first hand what the IPCC is saying with regard to climate change and climate change adaptation.<br/>On clean air, the EPA's report on air quality in 2013 found that air quality in Ireland continues to be good and compares favourably with other EU member states.  In 2013, the EPA in conjunction with the HSE, Met &Eacute;ireann and Department of the Environment Community and Local Government, launched an air quality index for health, which is available on the EPA website.<br/>On water quality, clean, healthy and well-protected water is essential to maintain viable and vibrant communities across all areas of Ireland, urban and rural.  The EPA's drinking water report for 2012 shows that public water supplies have improved year on year since the EPA created a remedial action list in 2008.  The EPA issued 16 directions this year, with five of these relating to supplies in Roscommon.  The EPA has also reiterated the need for Irish Water to develop a national lead strategy which has regard to advice previously published by the EPA on lead.  I will talk a little more about Uisce &Eacute;ireann in a moment.  With regard to bathing water quality, in 2013, 97% of bathing water complied with the EU mandatory standards.<br/>On research, following public consultation in 2013, a 24-month research programme on fracking is underway.  The research programme has been designed to produce the scientific basis, which will assist regulators &ndash; both North and South &ndash; in making an informed decision about whether it is environmentally safe to allow fracking.  No fracking will take place as part of this research.<br/>With regard to our annual accounts, since the EPA was established in 1993, the Comptroller and Auditor General's office has issued a clean audit report in respect of each year's financial statements.  The Environmental Protection Agency's 2013 accounts were signed off by the Comptroller and Auditor General on 30 September this year.  The total budget available to the EPA in 2013 was &euro;59.5 million.<br/>The EPA has key roles in environmental regulation, provision of knowledge and advocacy for the environment.  The economic recession continues to result in cuts right across the public sector, including the EPA.  Our staff and financial resources are reduced; meanwhile, we face new challenges and have taken on new responsibilities.  However, we will continue to deliver the valuable societal outcomes for which we are recognised.</p> <p> The Vice Chairman specifically asked for our response on Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  The first thing to clarify is that the EPA has no role in water charges or economic regulation of Irish Water.  The EPA is the quality regulator with regard to drinking water and urban wastewater.  I wish to put water and water quality into context.  The EPA has published a drinking water report every year since its establishment more than 20 years ago.  In 2007 the EPA was appointed as a regulator for drinking water and in effect regulated the 34 local authorities.  At this time the EPA identified E. coli as a key priority.  To address this we targeted a national programme of installation of chlorine monitors in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the local authorities.  There has been a 92% reduction in E. coli detection as a result.</p><p> The EPA also identified drinking water schemes across the country requiring investment which resulted in the remedial action list I mentioned earlier.  The number of schemes on the list has reduced year-on-year although more investment is needed in this area.  The primary role of the EPA is to ensure that drinking water supplied by Irish Water to its customers is clean and wholesome, and meets the standards set out in the European Union regulations.</p><p> Drinking water priorities include reducing the number of boil notices affecting 23,000 people, which is unacceptable, as we have stated previously.  We also need to upgrade drinking water schemes.  There are 126 schemes on the remedial action list and although that is reduced from 339 in 2008 we still need the remaining ones to be addressed.  Other priorities are the elimination of lead pipes and the introduction of water safety plans.  Seven water safety plans have been completed with a further 45 in preparation.</p><p> The EPA has published urban wastewater reports since its establishment.  In 2007 a licensing regime for wastewater discharges controlled by the local authorities was introduced as a result of a European court judgment against Ireland.  The EPA is the licensing authority for urban wastewater discharges and has issued 370 licenses and 520 certificates of authorisation.  We have consistently highlighted the need for further investment in wastewater infrastructure to protect our rivers and beaches, and the economic activities that depend on clean water.  Some 94% of Ireland's urban wastewater receives secondary treatment which is three times more than a decade ago.  Some 71% of secondary treatment plants met main effluent quality and sampling standards in 2013, a 2% improvement on the previous year.  However, raw sewage is still discharged from 44 areas in Ireland.</p><p> As I mentioned, the EPA is the quality regulator for Irish Water.  We also recognise that Irish Water was only established in January of this year whereas the infrastructural investment and operational issues I have highlighted existed for many years prior to this.  In addition, a PricewaterhouseCoopers report identified an historical underinvestment of &euro;5 billion in drinking water and urban wastewater.  Irish Water needs to develop a pathway to the satisfaction of the EPA towards the achievement of compliance with national and European legislation on water, in particular the 1998 drinking water directive and the 1991 urban wastewater treatment directive, and both short-term and longer-term actions are needed.</p><p> We also recognise that it is a period of transition in moving from 34 local authorities responsible for water to one utility.  Ultimately, we see the benefit of having a single body looking at national issues - for example, as we stated earlier having a national approach to lead in water.</p><p> We have had extensive engagement with Irish Water and the Commission for Energy Regulation in order to ensure appropriate treatment of all drinking water supplies and urban wastewater.  We will be reporting on the performance of Irish Water through our urban wastewater and drinking water reports in future.  For example, the EPA collates data from more than 200,000 drinking water samples to determine compliance with regulations.  So we have reported in the past and we will report in future on that.</p><p> I hope I have already answered the Vice Chairman's question on fracking and the research we are doing there.  We would be happy to answer in more detail if he wishes.  I might ask Mr. O'Leary to talk about the enforcement approach with regard to prosecutions and Dr. McGarry on Hinkley Point.</p></speech>

We get intelligence from three sectors.  We do our own audits, and gather water samples and air samples.  The director general has outlined the numbers - 1,300 in total in 2013.  We also collect information from residents and have a form on our website allowing people to report incidents to us online and we will investigate them.  The licences demand a lot of the licensee in terms of monitoring and providing information to us.  If there is an incident at the plant, for example, a breakdown of equipment or the breach of an emission limit value, they also have to report that to us.  It is an offence not to report incidents to the EPA.</p><p>  We carry out about 800 audits and inspections between industrial and waste activities.  We risk-rank those.  All our A sites in terms of industry and waste would receive more attention than the lower risk sites.  We also have a national programme looking across the 800, collecting the intelligence from local communities, information we get from our audits and inspections, allowing us to come up with an EPA priority list.  Already this year we have ten on our list.  It is a dynamic list and as things improve they come off the list.  Out of 800, ten are currently on our dynamic list and they are taking up about 15% of the resources allocated to us.</p><p>  The director general has outlined the number of prosecutions.  We had ten last year and we have had more this year.  There are 156 outstanding in terms of court dates.</p><p>  We have published two reports this year on the enforcement area.  We did a focus on enforcement report looking back over three years.  In the past two weeks we did a specific report on just air emissions because not all sectors would have to deal with air quality.  We would have targeted the air quality areas.  In both reports we have named and shamed companies either that we prosecuted or that consumed a lot of our time.</p><p>  In terms of our overall enforcement approach, we want consistency across the sector and we want to implement the polluter pays principle.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-04a.173" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ann McGarry" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014110400005#J00300"><p>I know the committee had correspondence last year with the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland regarding Hinkley Point.  We advised that we had undertaken a series of investigations of the plants due to be built in the UK in coming years.  That work was published in a report last year.  Our investigation showed that the two EPRs that are planned to be built at Hinkley Point are unlikely to have any radiological impact in Ireland.  Once they are operational we do not expect to see any consequence here, either in the terrestrial environment or in the marine environment.</p><p>  As in the case of all other nuclear installations in the UK that have been of concern of us over the year, our main concern is with the potential for an accident at the site.  We looked at five different accident scenarios that could occur at Hinkley Point.  I stress that the likelihood of occurrence of these accidents is very rare and they range from one in 50,000 to one in 33 million per year.  So they are extremely unlikely accidents.  However, in the event of one of those unlikely accidents occurring, we found that food control measures would probably need to be introduced in Ireland.  The extent of the contamination released from the accident would not be such that there would be immediate health impacts in Ireland, but there would be measurable levels radioactivity and for that reason food-protective measures would need to be implemented so that the food on sale in Ireland would be safe to eat.</p> <p>Our estimate is that it is very unlikely that there could be an accident at this site but if there were, food control measures would need to be implemented.</p></speech>

We have issued about 540 permits over the course of that period of 20 years.  These have been issued in the main to academic institutions.  On the question of how we assess risk, the legislation allows for four levels of risk, going from contained use, which is the vast majority of the facilities we regulate - these are activities within labs in academic institutions - right up to field trials.  Currently we have only one activity under an active permit which is the Teagasc research into the prevention of potato blight.  We are aided by EPA staff who are experts in this area and by a genetically modified organism advisory committee which helps us with difficult cases.  We present dossiers from Europe to the committee for its opinion and to which we have regard when making our decisions.  Over recent years we have noted a change in the pharmaceutical industry in Ireland which would have relied on chemical synthesis 20 years ago but quite a number of companies, including a new facility which opened in the old Dell factory in Limerick, use bio-synthesis, using mostly genetically modified organisms.</p><p>  I am happy to answer any other questions in that area.</p></speech>

This is not a new problem and the EPA has highlighted it in previous drinking water reports.  Our 2012 drinking water report highlighted that 50,000 people had been put on boil water notices during the course of the year.  Just because it is not a new issue does not mean it is acceptable.  It is a priority issue for the EPA which we have highlighted to ensure all people on public water supplies have access to clean and wholesome water.  The majority of the people affected are in Roscommon.  Mr. Gerard O'Leary can talk more about the raw sewage and the boil water notices.</p></speech>

There are no boil water notices in Tipperary.  We published a list and reports on drinking water and urban wastewater which we hope to update in the next couple of weeks.  Not to diminish the problem, the locations are mostly in coastal areas.  I was asked about this previously and I wish to be clear that in those cases there is no treatment of sewage - the toilet is flushed and everything goes in - and many of these areas are popular bathing areas.</p><p>  In last year's drinking water report we highlighted in particular the issue of boil water notices in Roscommon.  Whereas boil water notices are not new, of the 23,000 we estimate that, of today, 21,000 are in County Roscommon.</p></speech>

The report on climate change issued last Sunday was very stark.  I agree there is no doubt that there is a serious global problem and we are part of it.  We have not had sight of the sectoral plans which state our ambition, or so we have been told.  I presume the EPA will review them when they are issued.  Ireland will miss the 2020 targets and we will be required to meet targets by 2030.  Has the EPA a systematic plan for achieving the 2030 targets rather than waiting until 2028 and realising there is a problem that needs to be resolved quickly?  It will be necessary to change behaviours as well as investing in public transport to deal with emissions and retrofitting our homes to save energy.</p><p>  What is the EPA view on the Government's approach to the negotiations on agriculture?  It seems the Government's obligation for reaching the target will be reduced.  Will the 2030 targets be achievable if issues in the other sectors are dealt with?</p><p>  I refer to two large wastewater treatment plants in Kildare which are of a high standard.  They are worked very efficiently and the water is, by and large, from the Dublin region.  The availability of water is on a knife edge and this could be improved if leakage were significantly addressed.  Dublin appears to be one of the worst areas for leakages in the system.</p><p>  I presume the EPA examines the quality of water going into these plants and that it examines the water quality in the river catchments to ensure the least level of intervention so that nothing is put in the water that may have a negative impact on public health.  Does the EPA consider the issue of fluoride to be an environmental or health issue?  Has the EPA a function in the use of fluoride in water?</p><p>  Senator Mary Ann O'Brien has asked me to raise an issue on her behalf as she was unable to remain at the meeting.  It is a concern of mine also and it is how the EPA licenses industrial processes.  My experience is somewhat limited but I have the impression that the EPA works with the offender in many cases in an effort to nudge the offender towards compliance.</p><p>  It may have been the case that some plants preceded the establishment of the EPA.  Senator O'Brien has asked me to raise the matter of the Aughinish Alumina factory in Askeaton, County Limerick.  The Haulbowline issue is similar where 500,000 tonnes of hazardous waste was removed and the bill was &euro;40 million.  It is estimated that there is a potential of 25 million tonnes of hazardous waste in Aughinish but there is no financial bond in place.  The factory is located beside the Shannon and there could be major health, environmental and financial consequences for the State if a bond is not in place to cover that cost.  Why would the EPA continue to grant licences in that scenario?</p> <p>What kinds of protections does the agency put in place?  In Kildare, we watched a mountain of waste grow until it went on fire.  Remediation cost a small fortune.  When one can predict an environmental and health hazard, why would one continue to grant the licence without at least addressing the potential damage financially, bearing in mind the experience of Haulbowline in Cork?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-04a.187" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Laura Burke" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014110400007#L00200"><p>There is a wide range of questions.  I will deal with some and my colleagues will deal with enforcement.</p><p>  On climate change, it is envisaged in the current draft climate change Bill that the EPA will be secretariat to an expert advisory body that will be established and consist of numerous representatives, including from the EPA, Teagasc, the ESRI and SEAI.  Other members are to include those nominated by the Minister.  The responsibility of the body, with input from the EPA, will be to review the sectoral plans, including sectoral plans for mitigation and adaptation.  I agree absolutely that there needs to be a systematic plan for how to get to 2030.  As I said at the outset, we are not on track for our 2020 target.  It is estimated that we will be from 5% to 12% below 2005 levels, as compared to the 20% target that we have signed up to.  The EPA has estimated that emissions are projected to increase between 2020 and 2030, so they will be approximately 1% to 7% above the levels of 2005 in 2030.  They are definitely going the wrong way.</p><p>  Our role involves the provision of national greenhouse gas inventories, which we do annually, and greenhouse gas projections, which can feed into a systemic approach to meeting targets, rather than a last-minute one.  We also have a role in the implementation of the EU emissions trading scheme.  We have a role in research to assist Ireland in compliance in respect of both mitigation and adaptation.</p><p>  With regard to plans for 2030, all sectors should play their part.  Some, such as the energy sector, have more opportunities than others, but all have an opportunity to play their part.  Teagasc, for example, had prepared marginal abatement cost curves for the agriculture sector.  They identified carbon emission reductions of 1 million tonnes through efficiencies, etc.  Therefore, there is a role although we need to recognise that Ireland's emissions profile is different from that in other countries.  There are still steps the agriculture sector could take, and a sectoral plan would be needed in that area in addition to every other area.</p><p>  The national targets with regard to 2030 have not been set so, although there is a commitment to achieve a 40% reduction EU-wide, its impact on Ireland or other countries has not yet been agreed.</p><p>  With regard to water, the cleaner the water going into a plant, the less intervention that is needed.  My colleague, Dr. Gerard O'Leary, might talk about water safety plans and having safe and secure water sources.  If one protects the water source, it ultimately protects the consumer.</p><p>  On fluoride, the EPA has no role in applying the current legislation on the requirement to fluoridate public water supplies, and we have no policy remit in this area.  It is a health issue.  We do have a role in monitoring drinking water quality parameters.  That includes fluoride levels, which must be less that 0.8 mg per litre.  The Irish standard is more stringent than the EU drinking water standard, which is 0.5 mg per litre.  We have seen that out of approximately 932 supplies, approximately 24 failed to meet the fluoride parameter value in 2012.  However, no supplies exceeded the EU drinking water directive standard of 0.5 mg per litre.  I speak with regard to our monitoring role.</p><p>  On the licensing of industrial processes - Mr. Dara Lynott might elaborate on this - we take our licensing role very seriously.  This is effectively why the agency was set up 20 years ago.  It is being reviewed by numerous bodies, and the reviews include the independent review of the EPA.  The National Economic &amp;amp; Social Council, among other bodies, is also carrying out a review.  Independent research has highlighted the benefit and strict requirements that the EPA imposes on all licensees to ensure they do not cause damage to the environment or harm human health.  As part of our licensing process, it is open to anybody to make a submission with regard to the licence and potential licensee.  All submissions are available on the EPA website, as is all documentation.  We hold oral hearings as and when necessary also.  We certainly do not work with the offender in any shape or form.  We have had circumstances - Kerdiffstown is an example - in which facilities were up and running prior to the establishment of the EPA or its becoming the licensing authority.</p><p>  Even before the EPA existed and was given responsibility for licensing landfills, the site in Kerdiffstown, to which Deputy Catherine Murphy referred, had almost 2 million tonnes of waste that had been illegally deposited there.  It was a legacy facility that already existed and needed to be addressed.  The Waste Management Act 1996 assigned responsibility to the EPA for introducing a licensing regime for the approximately 100 landfills in operation across the country.  We did license the facility to bring it into a regulatory regime because it was not in one at that stage.  From the commencement of licensing, the EPA pursued the licensee with all its powers to make it compliant with its environmental responsibilities, including through civil and criminal legal action.  There is currently a criminal prosecution in the courts with regard to the facility, as the Deputy may be aware.  The company went into liquidation and abandoned the site and the EPA is now ensuring a resolution to the matter and that the site does not represent a health and safety or environmental risk.  We have been working actively with the local community with regard to it.  A site investigation was completed to identify the appropriate remediation option.  We are working with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to make progress with remediation for the site.  It was a legacy site in existence long before the EPA.</p><p>  Mr. Gerard O'Leary will talk about water and Aughinish Alumina.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-04a.188" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerard O'Leary" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014110400007#L00300"><p>Every year since 2007, when we published our drinking water report, we have talked about a sustainable model for safe and secure drinking water.  We developed it on foot of what we saw unravelling in Galway city with the cryptosporidium incident.  The local authority was effectively blending treated water with raw water.  As long as the water in the Corrib was fine, blending was going to be acceptable.  We assess drinking water quality against 48 standards, one of which involves fluoride.  They are all set out in EU legislation and implemented in national legislation.  The problem we envisage is that there are dangers in the catchment that have to be managed.  Incidents can occur in the catchment that are dynamic and the quality of raw water can change.  When there were flooding incidents, we saw that plants were overwhelmed.  Therefore, the security aspect, which we have really been driving, is such that the water needs to be safe tomorrow morning and the week afterwards.</p> <p>As such, the system needs to be robust enough and procedures need to be put in place at treatment plants to handle changes in water quality.  For example, there were restrictions in Dublin last year because the chemistry of the raw water changed.  The scientists in Dublin City Council had to adapt to treat it.  Our model is to ensure that drinking water complies with 48 safety standards and, more importantly, its supply is secure.  The latter point has been neglected, although we have been driving it.  We have a number of water safety plans in place.  We would like to see every area have a safe and secure supply of drinking water.  Post its incident, Galway City Council was one of the first local authorities to have a water safety plan.</p><p> At the start of this year, we had &euro;8.3 million set aside in various instruments for our industrial activities.  We have built up that fund across all licensed activities to &euro;77 million, but we need to do more, for example, various forms of security bonds, secured accounts and parental company guarantees.  Following a public consultation process last year, we produced guidance this year on how companies can establish the risks.  There are two types of risk.  First, activity at a site may lead to an accident.  Second, there is the inevitable closure cost.  The figure of 25 million tonnes relating to the Aughinish Alumina plant stems from that process.  Now and then, we need to adjust financial instruments so as to ensure that risks are clearly monetised.  In recent weeks, we published a consultation document on the various types of instrument that we require for financial provision.  Of paramount importance is that, when something happens, money must be available.  When money was previously set aside in receiverships, it seemed to go to the receivers or the banks.  In this regard, we are following up a case in the Supreme Court.</p><p> We have financial provisions across our activities and are building on same.  Last week, we discussed matters with the European Commission and identified that this was not just a challenge in Ireland, but across the EU.  We are reviewing all of our activities, including at the Aughinish plant, with a view to strengthening the financial instruments so that the inevitable cost of cleaning up sites can be met.</p></speech>

I appreciated their presentation.  I wish to ask about a variety of issues.  Can the EPA update me on the Greyhound facility in Clondalkin?  The EPA has needed to involve itself in that site a number of times.  As a Deputy for the area, I am curious about how matters stand.</p><p>  I will ask a related, albeit more general, question.  I will not necessarily pin anything to Greyhound, but suppose a company refused to change its ways after the EPA found it lacking.  Could the company be closed down or would that be a decision for the courts?  I would be interested in knowing the procedure.</p><p>  I found the number of local authority inspections by the EPA as set out on page 11 of the delegation's submission interesting.  Some 52% of the authorities passed the first round and further ones passed the next tranche of inspections.  Overall, 24% failed.  Which local authorities were they?  As to the sorts of examination conducted, do they only relate to water, including wastewater, or are there other aspects?  I would be grateful if the witnesses elucidated the situation.</p><p>  Can the EPA comment on whether it regards fracking as safe?  What impact would fracking have on our climate change targets, which we will not achieve anyway judging by what the witnesses have stated?</p><p>  To return to my question on local authorities, raw sewage was being discharged in 44 areas.  Were any of those in Dublin?  Are there adequate sewage and wastewater treatment facilities in the greater Dublin area?</p></speech>

I will address some of the broader ones and ask my colleagues to address the more detailed ones.</p><p>  Regarding companies that refuse to change their ways, the EPA uses a broad range of enforcement tools: education and guidance; civil sanctions; criminal sanctions; and revocation of licences.  We have revoked licences, but that is the ultimate sanction.  Having made such a decision, it can be challenged in the courts, but the legislation gives the EPA the power to suspend or revoke licences.</p><p>  Page 11 of the document refers specifically to the septic tank inspection regime, not to the broader local authority inspection regime.  Mr. O'Leary can discuss septic tanks and our broader supervisory and inspectorate role in respect of local authorities' environmental responsibilities.</p><p>  The purpose of conducting our research on fracking at a local level is to assess whether it can be operated without causing environmental damage.  I am also conscious that, if fracking was to operate in Ireland, the EPA would be the regulatory authority and anyone fracking would need to be licensed by us.  As such, we cannot pre-empt any decision that we might make.  I will ask Mr. Lynott to discuss our research into fracking in more detail, but Mr. O'Leary might first discuss the issues relating to Clondalkin, septic tanks and raw sewage in Dublin.</p></speech>

The first year of the plan finished in July of this year.  We have been analysing the data.  Therefore, it is the first time that we have published the figures that are there.  We had an interim report, which we released last January, because we wanted to ensure that the thousand inspections would be completed.  Again, we did it on a risk basis.  There are different parts of the country where there would have been bigger impacts, in terms of ground water and surface water.  We set a minimum level, in the first instance, so local authorities could do more on that.  This is not going to be a once-a-year inspections regime.  Septic tanks inspections are here to stay.  However, they are part of a wider campaign to protect our water resources.  There are river basin management plans.  They are going to be revised.  Inspections that will be done on waste-water treatment plants and on agriculture septic tanks, which would be a pressure on the environment, would form part of that.</p><p>  With regard to the question on local authorities, the agency has a supervisory role over the performance by local authorities of their statutory duties.  It extends beyond the areas of waste water and drinking water - which are obviously now within the remit of Irish Water - and water quality.  Local authorities would have a huge role in the area of waste management.  They would permit a lot of sites while our agency would licence the larger activities.  If I can draw the committee's attention to page 11 of the document, one of the things we have tried to do is the development of the "See it? Say it!" app.  This allows a member of the public to download the app.  They can take a simple photograph which will automatically be sent to a call centre, that we have set up, that transmits it to the local authority.  We are hoping to have some development in that area later on this year.  For instance, that would get recorded as part of the Fix Your Street campaign - which again covers more than just the environmental aspect. </p><p>  We do a lot of work to help local authorities to carry out their functions.  For example, a lot of our guidance, which would be applicable to all activities, would also be applicable to their permitted activities.  Also, in the Focus on Environmental Enforcement in Ireland 2009 -2012 report which I referred to earlier, we tried to cover local authority activities.  For example, on waste, they probably deal with more complaints than we would because litter would be a huge issue that has a local dimension.  We have a function.  Also, if a function is not being carried out by a local authority, a member of the public has recourse to our agency.  We will start what we call a section 63 process.  We will ask the local authority for a report.  We may then instruct them to undertake actions.  </p><p>  On water quality, Deputy Murphy mentioned the supply issue.  In terms of drinking water, quality is a huge issue, for example, in the western part of the country.  The bigger challenge in Dublin is capacity.  It is on a knife edge.  We saw it last year with the Ballymore Eustace plant.  When the chemistry of the water changed, the plant was still able to deal with it and produce water.  However, although production did not stop, it was not at a sufficient rate.  Huge numbers of people were inconvenienced from the point of view supply.  The quantity is on a knife edge. </p><p>  We will be publishing a report in the next number of weeks on the Ringsend sewerage treatment plant.  In terms of compliance with the EU directive, it is not complying.  Last time round, it was very close to achieving compliance.  There is a huge capacity issue there.  Again, it is on a knife-edge from the point of view of treatment.  While there is a big plant there, there is also a huge load getting into the area.  It is borderline in terms of compliance.  We will have an updated report in the next number of weeks and I will be happy to furnish it to the committee.</p></speech>

Therefore, we initiated our research into this area by commissioning a desktop study for approximately &euro;5,000 to give us an overview of fracking and where it is at in the world.  That laid out a number of areas that we needed to look into.  From that, we have set up a significant research fund of about &euro;1.5 million that is being funded by the EPA and a number of other agencies in Ireland and the North of Ireland.  The main focus of that research is on hydrogeology and the geology of the shales that underlie Leitrim, Sligo, up through the North, and continue on into Scotland.  We do not have a lot of ground water wells, bore hole wells, that would give us the kind of information we would require to determine whether there would be an impact.  The research would suggest that the main impacts will arise from the construction of the wells and from the storage and transportation of water, sand and chemicals associated with fracking.  To help us with the research, we set out terms of reference which we finalised this year after receiving approximately 1,200 submissions on what they should be.  The terms of reference were finalised by an inter-agency group set up by a number of Government Departments, North and South.  The research has been commissioned following a tender process and Camp Dresser &amp;amp; McKee, CDM, have got that research.  It has just begun and it will take about 18 months to complete.  There is a commitment that there will be no licensing of any sort of fracking in Ireland until that research is concluded.  I presume we will know about it the next time we come back to this committee.</p></speech>

I welcome the representatives from the EPA here today.  I invited the EPA here a number of months ago to discuss a number of the issues with which we are dealing today.  I welcome its report.  Would the EPA agree with me that the confidence of the public in its role as the protectors of the environment is paramount to the success of the organisation?  On the number of inspections and visits, is a visit classed as an inspection or is there a difference between them?  In the well-put-together presentation that was furnished, the agency indicated it had carried out 1,370 visits and that there were 12 prosecutions as a result of that.  My rough mathematical calculations put that at 0.009% of visits resulting in prosecutions.  To me, that either means the people with whom the EPA are dealing, mainly those in industry, are highly compliant or else there is something wrong in the system.</p><p>  On the concern of the public in many counties across this country, can the director give his view as to whether the EPA has the public confidence of the people in Kildare, Limerick and Cork, as already alluded to, in Tipperary, as I will allude to, and in Co. Laois with which I will deal in greater detail in a moment?  Could the director also clarify who carries out the inspections for the EPA?  Does the EPA carried them out itself or are they farmed out to private consultants?  If they are farmed out - I understand that they are -  how are these people selected?  What expertise do they have and what is the reporting mechanism to the EPA?  Is it a fact that only one in three facilities are monitored on an ongoing basis and some are only monitored once a year?</p> <p>Is it also a fact that advance warning is given to industries before the EPA goes into the premises to inspect?  If that is the case, how much advance warning do they get?</p><p> On septic tanks, I am reading from a press release issued by former Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Mr. Phil Hogan, on 1 July 2013 which indicates that there are 497,000 septic tanks in the country, of which 446,000 were registered at that point and I note from the report that 987 inspections were carried out.  That is roughly 2%.  If we continue like this, it will take 50 years to carry out inspections of all septic tanks in the country.  Can the witnesses respond to that and can they further indicate to me whether the people doing the inspections are EPA staff or staff from the local authorities who have been trained to do this work?</p><p> On prosecutions, the witnesses indicated that a number of cases have gone to the High and Supreme Courts.  Are these on licence issues or other issues?  Can the witnesses tell us what companies are involved?  It is referred to in page 9 of their report.</p><p> There was an independent review on air quality.  Who carried out that review and how independent was it?</p><p> Will the witnesses update the committee on the ongoing complaint about the Enva waste recycling plant in Portlaoise, into which the Minister called for an investigation earlier this year amid ongoing concerns over unlicensed, unregulated and potentially hazardous open vent emissions from the plant, which is situated in a built-up residential area and commercial district in the middle of Portlaoise?  Will the witnesses also tell the committee what has been done to bring this company to heel regarding the problems it is causing within that community?</p><p> What is the EPA's overall budget and how much of it is spent on inspection and prosecution?  Related to that, how many industry locations are visited by the EPA on each year?</p></speech>

I will answer some of them and my colleague, Mr. O'Leary, the director of enforcement, will answer others.  With regard to the confidence of the public in the EPA, the confidence of the public and the engagement of the public in environmental matters is something we have highlighted throughout the history of the EPA.  With only about 300 staff there is only so much we can achieve in the protection of the environment, but we must engage with Departments, other organisations, and members of the public for everyone to realise the importance of the quality of the environment for the public and for people's health and well-being.  An independent external review of the EPA, which we highlight in the briefing document, found that overall the EPA has provided considerable benefit for Ireland's environment and for the health and well-being of its people.  There were also other reviews, including an independent research review of the EPA licensing regime, which found that the reduction in industrial emissions because of EPA licensing was significant, and a National Economic and Social Council review, which highlighted the fact that the industrialisation of Ireland had not resulted in environmental pollution, largely because of the work of the EPA in licensing and enforcement of facilities.</p></speech>

I cannot remember the names of the other people involved, but they are all on the EPA website.  It was a wide range of people, and they sought submissions from members of the public and other organisations on their views of the EPA.  They received around 180 submissions and they brought in a number of people, including representatives of the Irish Environmental Network and the Environmental Forum from Limerick, to get their direct, oral feedback on the performance of the EPA.  There was very wide consultation.  It was independent, it was external and overall the findings with regard to the EPA were extremely positive.</p><p>  We can advise on the number of inspections and visits.  With regard to who does the inspections for the EPA, the EPA does the inspections itself for urban wastewater treatment facilities and industrial facilities.  We have contracted out the auditing of some functions related to waste electrical goods, usually to shops, businesses and facilities like that.  Their compliance with those regulations and some external air monitoring is also contracted out.  We can give more detail on that in a moment.</p><p>  On septic tanks and the inspections of septic tanks, it has clearly been assigned to the local authorities and the inspections are a local authority function.  The EPA's role is to set out an inspection plan for the country and then it is up to the local authorities to do those inspections.</p><p>  On Enva, we take all complaints to the EPA very seriously.  We have done a full assessment with regard to Enva and can give more details on that.  We have also done some ambient monitoring in the locality because there was concern that the air quality was being compromised.  Ambient monitoring has demonstrated that all the air quality guidelines are being met in the locality.</p></speech>

The budget of the EPA, as I said in my opening statement, is &euro;59.5 million.  The vast majority of that is spent on staff, because we employed 323 pre-August 2014 and now employ 360 after the merger.  Another &euro;8 million is spent on funding research.  We also have &euro;2 million for the environment fund for the office of environmental enforcement.  Approximately &euro;2 million is allocated for our national waste prevention programme, to which I also referred in my opening statement.  The largest proportion of our budget is on staff and on overheads, for example, on things like IT systems to facilitate more efficient operation.  In the context of public sector reform, we try to ensure as much of our work as possible is done electronically, including electronic engagement with our licensees and others.  IT development is a key part of our work in that regard.</p><p>  I might ask Mr. O'Leary to talk about Enva-----</p></speech>

As for salaries and pensions, approximately &euro;22 million of the EPA's budget is spent on salaries and pensions and out of that, our staff - including our approximately 80 staff members in enforcement - are paid.  Information management and technology is approximately &euro;6 million.  Programme expenditure, which includes, for example, the Water Framework Directive, is &euro;15 million and as I stated earlier, &euro;2 million is for the work of the office of environmental enforcement, national waste prevention and our research programme.</p></speech>

This charge on an annual basis is in the region of &euro;7 million to &euro;8 million, which represents an 80% payback of the time and expense spent in this regard.  The &euro;2 million we get from the environmental enforcement fund may be added to that, which brings it up to approximately &euro;10 million.  It would take a bit longer to get an exact figure right down to a task but in general, &euro;7 million to &euro;8 million is charged on enforcement charges for licence enforcement.  In the past, we have estimated that approximately &euro;2 million is spent on drinking water enforcement and we also get &euro;2 million that is specifically funded from the environment fund on that.  Approximately &euro;10 million to &euro;12 million goes to enforcement but getting an exact figure would require a bit more calculation.</p></speech>

Is it just beginning or what is its current status?  Has the EPA been in contact with Irish Water on the national strategy?  While I had a question on fracking, most of it has been answered except in respect of Mr. Lynott's statement that &euro;1.5 million has been allocated from the EPA's own funding for fracking research.  While this is a lot of money, it is necessary because fracking is such a contentious issue.  However, it is not an unknown issue, particularly in America, Poland and elsewhere.  Is it necessary for the EPA to reinvent the wheel because the type of rock to be found in Ireland and in particular near Enniskillen is widespread?  Obviously, the EPA does not need to bore a hole for every investigation and I presume this has been taken into consideration.</p><p>  To change the subject, I refer to wastewater discharge and the lack of treatments.  Members have heard the debate on that, on water and on what should have been done.  I am aware that two cases are before the courts at present and while I will not mention them, are other cases imminent?  When the EPA first inspected the domestic wastewater treatment facilities, there was a failure rate of 38%, which is very high.  It improved on the second inspection on foot of money being put into them.  However, the failure rate remains at approximately 24%, which means a great number of wastewater treatment facilities still are failing and obviously money is required for this.  I did some research on the PricewaterhouseCoopers report mentioned by Ms Burke and note it stated there was an underinvestment in water of &euro;5 billion.  This money must be found somewhere and this is an issue that members are discussing and have been discussing for some time.</p><p>  On climate change, I believe Deputy Catherine Murphy mentioned the new report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the recommendations therein.  Ms Burke has just stated that Ireland will find it difficult to meet its 2020 target and that its emissions have remained static, perhaps from 2008 onwards.  As the joint committee will be dealing with the climate change Bill, the EPA should provide the members with five specific recommendations as to what they should be doing.  As Ireland is a country with high agricultural outputs, what must we do and seek in this regard?  Another scenario is if we were obliged to import food from countries that are not as environmentally-friendly as Ireland.  This must also be taken into consideration in the context of any climate change facility or discussions that take place.  I will not comment further on this because obviously members will be having discussions on it later.</p><p>  On the national radon control strategy, the EPA has undertaken to conduct research to underpin the strategy.  What is the current status of that research and when does the EPA hope to have it published?  The merger of the EPA and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, went very well, even though some thought the world was going to fall in when the merger was originally proposed.  I had a note about the new app, "See it? Say it!", on which Mr. O'Leary reported.  I seek a comment regarding the EU directive that has been transposed to Irish law on water pricing and the full price recovery of the cost of water.  It is an EU directive, Ireland is bound in law to do it and is late in implementing it.  How long will it be before Ireland is fined?  Just as someone asked Mr. O'Leary when will his patience run out, when will the patience of the European Union run out if we do not transpose the aforementioned directive into law?</p><p>  On the water, I compliment Ms Laura Burke on using the correct terminology in her statement of "Uisce &Eacute;ireann".  She is one of the few to have done so.  I hear it being referred to all the time as Irish Water but in the legislation, it is Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  I keep repeating that point but only Ms Burke and I appear to be doing it at present.  Nevertheless, I ask her to e-mail the figures she gave in response to the question on Irish Water, as I do not believe they are contained in her own presentation.

Consequently, I do not wish to comment further or to try to have a discussion through the joint committee, as the Senator can imagine.</p><p>  On the issue of fracking, we of course have no intention of reinventing the wheel.  A huge amount of research has been carried out, at European level as well, with regard to fracking and what we need to do in the context of the research we are doing is to localise it.  That is the reason that when Mr. Dara Lynott was talking about the work we are doing, it is very much about looking at how it would have an impact on an Irish situation.  We are spending a significant amount of money on this research.  There is a benefit from North-South engagement on this, in that it is being co-funded as it has an impact on both jurisdictions.  However, the research is needed in order that we can make considered decisions with regard to fracking and whether it is something that should happen within Ireland.</p><p>  On urban wastewater discharges and cases before the courts, I might just ask Mr. O'Leary to elaborate on that.  On the domestic wastewater treatment systems and the overall failure rate of 24%, because this is a risk-based approach in which we target areas of highest risk, it is unsurprising in a way that one will get that level of failure.  We are deliberately looking for inspections in areas in which we believe there may be more of a risk.  Again, Mr. O'Leary might talk a little more about that.  As for climate change and recommendations, the key is to have sectoral action plans because it is an issue about which we need each sector to play its part.  Some sectors will be able to do more than others and one sector we certainly have highlighted is the energy sector and electricity production.  There is a need, both nationally and internationally, to move to zero fossil carbon energy.  This is a sector that makes a large contribution to emissions in Ireland at approximately 21%.  There are technologies that are known and have been proven to reduce emissions in this sector.</p> <p>It is also a sector that can assist other sectors, for example, low-fossil electricity production can help the residential and transport sector as well.  It is a prime sector, if one is looking for a key area for action, and this is something the EPA has highlighted previously.</p><p> The merger itself went well.  It is now at a stage of integration and ensuring that we get the best efficiencies and opportunities out of the combined forces of the EPA and the RPII.  That is why we say that we have done this bit but ask are there other opportunities, for example, as I stated, in the monitoring area.  It has been a success because of the attitude and the engagement of staff, and leadership from the RPII as well as the EPA.  Everybody engaged proactively in ensuring that this would work.</p><p> On the EU directive on water pricing, I was asked how long will it be until the EU Commission loses patience.  I suppose I cannot answer that one.  We must wait and see.  The EU's patience wears thin faster than did previously, when matters were quite long-drawn out.  There is a process for faster infringement nowadays that we are aware of.</p><p> I might ask Dr. Ann McGarry to speak about the national radon control strategy and Mr. Gerard O'Leary might speak more about the cases before the courts.</p></speech>

As the committee will be aware, the strategy was launched early this year by the then Minister, Commissioner Hogan.</p><p>  One part of the research that we are undertaking is to update the national survey.  The national survey was undertaken in the 1990s and we are undertaking a further piece of research to ensure that we have the up-to-date baseline information on radon levels and the number of houses likely to be above the reference level at the start.  It would be our intention, as the strategy develops and we role it out, that at regular intervals we would repeat this work to see whether the work is being effective.  As the committee will be aware, the overall aim of the national radon control strategy is to reduce the number of deaths from radon in Ireland.</p><p>  Other work that has been undertaken is on the research on the effectiveness of passive radon sumps and radon barriers together.  Only yesterday we held the second meeting of the inter-agency group that oversees the implementation of the control strategy.  We agreed that this is important work that needs to begin now and it will begin in the next number of months.</p><p>  We also discussed at our meeting yesterday the issue of radon awareness.  The RPII, now the Office of Radiological Protection within EPA, has for many years undertaken work to improve the awareness of radon among members of the public.  What we need now is to review the work that has been done to date with a view to having a national radon awareness campaign.  It was agreed at the group yesterday that we should begin that now.</p><p>  There will be a report to Government on the implementation of the strategy in April 2015.  A lot of the detail of what is going on at present will be included in that report.  We agreed that it is important that we have a report to the public as well and that will form part of the work.</p></speech>

In terms of the broader environment, we removed lead from paint in the 1950s, then we got lead removed from petrol in the 1970s and since then there has been an overall drive to reduce the exposure to lead.</p><p>  In the late 1980s, the European Commission would have flagged a progressive reduction in lead in drinking water.  We published guidance in 2009 as to how local authorities would identify lead in their areas.  When that information became available in terms of the mains, some local authorities were progressive in terms of the removal of lead while others were not.  The current standard, which came into play in December 2013, 10 mcg/l, is challenging.  The overall approach to lead mains is to remove them.  In terms of court cases, we have one local authority and also Uisce &Eacute;ireann in court in regard to lead removal because we surveyed direction on the local authority and the lead was not removed.</p><p>  In terms of wastewater, we have two cases before the courts - Clifden and Killybegs.  On our overall approach in taking those cases, because there are considerable challenges in terms of many wastewater treatment plants, Clifden in County Galway is a designated bathing water area and in successive reports we identified E. coli.  Whereas they have primary treatment, it is the obvious case in point.  The directive dates back to 1991.  Therefore, it was flagged when various urban areas required treatment.  The case of Clifden required secondary treatment, and possibly further, by 2005.  The second case we have before the courts is Killybegs.  The treatment there, because of its size, dated back to 2000.  In the case of Killybegs, there was no treatment.  We have one other case, a drinking water case, before the courts but there is currently no more in terms of urban wastewater.</p></speech>

A lot of questions have been asked.<br/>In the presentation by the director general, one item that strikes me as of great concern is that there are 162 urban wastewater treatment plants operating without licence.  I understand these unlicensed plants were not built in the past year and some of them have been functioning nearly for decades.  What I would like to know I can guess, but maybe they could spell it out.  Is it because of resources on the part of EPA that it cannot process the licences or is it down to the chilling fact that these wastewater treatment plants are not up to scratch and are in desperate need of investment, which, I suppose, brings us into the debate of the <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>of Uisce &Eacute;ireann, which, as the Senator clarified, is the title to be given to it?<br/>Of the 162 wastewater treatment plants, how many of these wastewater treatment plants are in the charge of local authorities, how many are in industry and how many are public-private partnerships?  How many of these wastewater treatment plants are discharging into special areas of conservation, SACs, natural heritage areas, NHAs, or other environmentally designated areas?  It is happening in my county.  Raw sewage is going into designated shellfish areas and special areas of conservation.  Mr. O'Leary mentioned Donegal and Galway.  The same can be said of Mayo.  We are building our reputation on tourism - above all, of course, there is the people - and this is going into our waters and to our fish.  The scale of it, and how long this has been going on, is of considerable concern.  How many of those wastewater treatment plants pertain to my county, which is Mayo?<br/>In terms of Irish Water, how many of these wastewater treatment plants are on the capital investment programme that has been laid out for the next two years?  Have many of these been addressed and is that why the EPA hopes that they will be licensed by the end of the year?  How many of these wastewater treatment plants are under warning and how long have these licences being pending?  It is my understanding that some of them are pending for many years and it is a holding mechanism for them to be allowed to operate at a substandard level.  I would appreciate clarification on that.<br/>How many, where there are wastewater discharge licences, are not meeting the EPA's conditions on the level of discharge and the quality of treatment that is required for sewage?</p> <p>Does the EPA require all wastewater treatment plants to have tertiary treatment as a minimum?  Is that the EPA's aspiration?  Ms Burke mentioned how many prosecutions are pending in the District Courts and in higher courts.  How many local authorities are under warning from the EPA to get their act in order?  That deals with the wastewater treatment plants.</p><p> The last time Dr. McGarry appeared before the committee it was for a presentation from the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.  It was very reassuring to have a body such as the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland protecting the public health interest.  I was very impressed that day to hear of its activities.</p><p> One concern that prevails with the public relating to the monitoring of air quality for anything in the air that might be bad for us is non-ionising radiation.  I know responsibility for that did not come under the remit of the RPII.  The equivalent agencies in other countries looked at it, particularly from the point of view of electromagnetic field emissions from 400 kV power lines.  Has the EPA studied this in any way?  The EPA is not being asked to license these power lines.  Can I, as an ordinary member of the public who does not particularly know anything about this, take assurance that it is not identified as an environmental risk from the EPA's point of view and consequently not a public health risk?</p><p> On climate change, the witnesses spoke about the need for zero fossil carbon emissions from the electricity sector.  We have a big challenge in delivering infrastructure across the board.  We have just spoken about the funding issue for wastewater treatment plants.  There is considerable resistance to wind energy as part of this.  It has been suggested that wind energy is a fraud because we need to import concrete and do all sorts of things meaning that wind energy is not the solution.  I must temper my comments by saying that if I go to an area where people are opposed to wind turbines, they want biomass.  If I go to an area where it is proposed to build a biomass wood-burning power plant, they favour wind energy.</p><p> Will the witnesses comment on the viability of wind energy and its desirability or otherwise in achieving our zero fossil carbon emission targets?  How critical is it in that regard?  What else could be suggested?  What priority should be given to wind energy?  Is the Government policy of giving priority to wind energy, as it does with the REFIT scheme, the way we should be going?  With all issues of public health and concern over the direction we are taking, everything should be on the table for debate.  I would appreciate hearing the views of the witnesses representing an independent expert body on the matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-04a.250" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Laura Burke" time="15:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014110400013#R00200"><p>I will start with the non-ionising radiation question and then we can talk about the water side of things.  As recently as July of this year the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government commissioned the national institute for public health in the Netherlands, RIVM, to prepare a report that synthesises existing research on non-ionising radiation with a particular focus on the health effects of electric and magnetic fields arising from high-voltage power lines and also electromagnetic fields from base stations for mobile communications.  It will also assess the management of electromagnetic fields related to issues in other jurisdictions - how other countries address the matter.  The countries chosen are France, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom.  The goal, as I understand it, is to have a final report that includes balanced scientific information on the health effects and on how other countries deal with the issue.  I understand the report will be completed in the first quarter of next year and will lead on to the question of whether there should be a different approach in Ireland.  As the Deputy rightly said, the EPA has no current role in this regard.  Whether we have such a role in the future will depend partly on the outcome of this report.  The EPA is represented on the group's steering committee.  That is the situation at the moment, but I know there is active work by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in that area.</p><p>  With regard to climate and zero fossil carbon energy, the first thing to say is that the EPA is not an expert on wind energy.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland has done a considerable amount of research in this area and would be the expert body.  We agree with the Deputy that everything should be on the table.  Wind energy, hydro, wave and biomass all need to be considered and assessed.  We made a submission to the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on the Green Paper on energy.  I would be more than happy to supply a copy of that submission to this committee if it was of interest.</p></speech>

The EPA's role with regard to climate change is not in the area of assessing wind energy or the percentage of wind energy in the system.  I do not want to start talking about something in which we do not have expertise because it would not be appropriate.</p><p>  I will ask Mr. Lynott to talk about the licensing of wastewater treatment plants and Mr. O'Leary can talk about the work we have been doing on enforcement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-04a.253" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dara Lynott" time="15:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014110400013#R00500"><p>The driver for the licensing of wastewater treatment plants was the fact that Ireland lost a case in the European Court of Justice for implementation of the dangerous substances directives.  Under the waste control of dangerous substances going into the environment, discharges must be licensed.  Part of the negotiation to close out that case, which is closed out, was putting into force legislation that would provide for the licensing of more than 1,000 wastewater treatment plants.  The timeframe that was set by the Commission was to have everything licensed by the end of 2015.  A precondition of that was that the smallest discharges should be licensed first.</p><p>  The statistics are presented on page 5 of our submission.  To date we have issued 70 licences and 520 of certificates of authorisations, which are for the smallest ones.  A further 162 remain to be licensed, which we anticipate licensing by the end of next year.  The lack of resources has been an issue in the past four or five years but in the past year we got sanction from the Department for a number of temporary staff to ensure we meet that target of licensing everything by the end of 2015.</p><p>  Is there any reason those 162 are left?  No, there is not.  We prioritised, for example, the 42 discharges that are untreated and they are all licensed.  We targeted all the discharges that were near shellfish, for example, on the Mayo coast.  We looked at the impact on the shellfish grounds.  We worked with the Marine Institute on that.  We require within our licences that the shellfish should be tested for viruses to determine if there is any connection between the discharge and the shellfish grounds.  If there is, we have a requirement with our licences to put in ultraviolet treatment that would knock out anything that might infect the shellfish.</p><p>  Historically, certain discharges go into groundwater or near special areas of conservation.  These are not new things.  The agency was given in one fell swoop under legislation 1,000 facilities to license in 2007 and we are working through those.  The habitats directive requires that an appropriate assessment be done for each of those discharges that is next to or near a special area of conservation.  A particular priority for us was rivers that have margaritifera, mussels that need to be protected under European law.</p><p>  Irish Water has to provide us with the information.  All the licences transferred from local authorities to Irish Water on 1 January.  We are working Irish Water to give us the information when we need it in order that we can license in the most efficient way possible.</p> <p>The appropriate assessments are still being carried out for some of those facilities but we have worked out a scheme with Irish Water to get the information at set periods of time.</p></speech>

We have made a submission to Irish Water to say that certain priorities must be achieved within the capital programme, such as dealing with untreated discharges, UV treatment in shellfish areas as well as a priority to meet EU requirements.  The PwC report has shown that there has been chronic under-investment in this area for the past number of years.  Whether Irish Water will get all the funds it needs to do everything required to comply with all legislation, is doubtful.  We are pushing for certain priorities and our priority as an agency is to have everything licensed by 2015.  We act without fear or favour as to which ones are licensed under environmental law.</p></speech>

I referred earlier to 44 areas across the country which did not have water treatment.  We are about to publish a report on urban wastewater but to be helpful to the committee I refer to the appendices to the report.  Two towns in County Mayo, Belmullet and Killala, have no treatment.  The others we have deemed to have failed are Balla, Belcarra, Foxford, Geesala and Louisburgh.  Castlebar has nutrient reduction along with secondary treatment and this indicates that it has passed.  I note Swinford.  Westport has nutrient removal along with secondary treatment and it has passed.</p></speech>

I asked him the reason and he said it was a question of resources.  He talked about the organisation and that it has a deadline of the end of 2015 for licensing these plants.  I am pretty familiar with our wastewater treatment plants in Mayo.  The critical problem is there has been no investment in wastewater treatment plants.  That is the bottom line.  The local authorities had no funding from the Department to invest in the plants.</p></speech>

I have some questions for the director general of the agency.  Shortly after her appointment she stated in an interview with The Irish Times that in her opinion the EPA should not be racing to prosecute business for non-compliance with environmental licences and regulations.  Was this her personal opinion at that time?  Did it perhaps come from her experience in her previous life with her involvement with IBEC and Indaver?  Is this the policy being adopted by the EPA?  In my view, the fact that the director general has made such a statement gives the message to big business that it can continue to pollute without the possibility or even the fear of prosecution.  She stated in that interview that she wants to move away from the idea of the EPA being a watchdog and an enforcer.  In my view the main role of the EPA is to protect the environment and by extension, its role is to protect human and animal health and to safeguard communities against possible polluters.  As she said then, economic recovery is certainly important but in my view, human health must take precedence.  If big business and big companies perceive that regulation is light-touch or a less than enthusiastic approach to prosecuting people, this sends the wrong message about how we deal with them in this country.</p><p>  The review group was referenced in a number of previous contributions and it seems to have been glossed over.  Even though the review group lauded much of the work of the EPA and was mainly positive in its findings, as the director general said, the same review group also asked that alleged maladministration or complaints against the EPA be investigated by a separate environmental court or an environmental ombudsman.  I ask if the director general thinks this is a necessary step and if she would be in favour of the establishment of an ombudsman to investigate allegations against the EPA.</p><p>  The review group noted its concerns that section 15 of the Act grants the EPA immunity from prosecution.  Has this section been invoked previously?  Why is this provision necessary?  I stated in the Seanad that we have confidence in the work being carried out by the EPA but if this work is carried out properly and effectively there should be no need for this immunity from prosecution.</p><p>  Are the previous statements by the director general her personal opinions or do they reflect the policy being actively pursued by the EPA?   </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-04a.261" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Laura Burke" time="15:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014110400014#S00800"><p>I will clarify what I said at the time.  I said that the EPA has a very important role in regulation but we also have a role - which we talked about it earlier in the meeting - with regard to encouraging behavioural change and encouraging people in their homes, businesses and communities to be resource-efficient and to protect the environment.  To be very clear, we have roles in regulation, in knowledge of the environment and in advocacy.  Specifically our advocacy role is set out very clearly in our statement of strategy and it is that we aim to influence positive behavioural change by supporting businesses, communities and householders to be more resource-efficient.  With regard to regulation we look at the full range of enforcement tools - I talked about this earlier - including education and advice, warnings, civil sanctions, criminal sanctions and licence revocation.  We have used and we will continue to use all of those tools, as appropriate.  We are not, we have never been and we will not be in the future, a light-touch regulator and this will be highlighted by the number of reviews and independent assessments of the EPA.</p><p>  In our statement of strategy we note that a clean, healthy and well-protected environment lies at the heart of economic recovery.  We stated that we will continue to carry out our core functions of environmental regulation, enforcement, monitoring, assessment, research and reporting, in an exemplary manner, but we will also work with others to build awareness and to achieve the behavioural change needed in our homes and communities and at policy level, to enable us to become a low carbon resource-efficient economy and society.  As clearly highlighted by Senator Keane earlier, Ireland depends on its clean, green image for economic recovery.  Two areas highlighted are agriculture and tourism.  We cannot have a situation where Ireland is aiming to be portrayed or where we portray ourselves that we are clean and green but we are unable to demonstrate it.  Whether that is the case in the agricultural sector or whether it is a case of raw sewage being discharged into waters, it does not marry; we cannot say we are clean and green unless this can be demonstrated.</p> <p> With regard to the review group and two particular recommendations, both the review and a follow-up on implementation are available on the EPA website.  It was published earlier this year.  As regards the EPA's absolute statutory immunity, recommendation 7.6.3 of the review group was that the EPA's absolute statutory immunity should be revised, particularly with regard to damages.  This is something for the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to assess.  The update states that a number of other State agencies currently have statutory immunity, including the Health and Safety Authority and the National Asset Management Agency.  In the case of the latter, it was provided for under legislation as recently as 2009.  The Department has highlighted that it is particularly important to examine the potential impact of any change in this provision on the ability of the EPA effectively to discharge its statutory functions.  It is up to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, legislators and the Office of the Attorney General to examine the implications.</p><p> With regard to the Ombudsman, recommendation 7.6.4 of the review identified that the EPA should be subject to the Ombudsman's jurisdiction in respect of alleged maladministration, and appropriate resources should be made available to the Office of the Ombudsman.  The EPA has no objection to falling within the remit of the Ombudsman.  In that context, it is stated in the update that the EPA review group recommended that it should do so in respect of issues of maladministration only.  In drafting the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government engaged extensively with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Office of the Attorney General on this issue to achieve an acceptable legislative wording to enable administrative procedures to fall within the legislation, but excluding the quasi-judicial function of the EPA.  A satisfactory form of wording was not finalised so the EPA remains exempt for the purpose of the Act.  However, we have no objection to falling within that Act.</p></speech>

With regard to the licensing of companies, there are some companies in my area and one knows that one would only have to give them the standard and they would keep to that standard, even if they never received a visit.  They would want to be absolutely compliant and would stake their reputations on it.  There are some very good examples.  Often, however, that gives a skewed impression in terms of the others who are non-compliant.</p><p>  To refer back to the experience with Kerdiffstown, the EPA had responsibility from 1996.  The mountain of waste grew from then every year.  Kildare is a very flat landscape and it ended up with a mountain where there was none before, and it was a mountain of waste.  Much of it happened under the EPA's watch and it was only when it went on fire, which was a major emergency, that a remediation process was seriously put in place.  There were complaints for a long time about it.  However, that happened and it is over and done with, although there was a very large bill at the end of it which is being picked up by the taxpayer.  How do we ensure something similar does not happen somewhere else?</p><p>  That brings me to the Aughinish Alumina plant.  The evidence shows that once companies that are non-compliant have stripped every penny out of something, they will wish to disappear and leave the trail of destruction behind them.  That is the reason there must be bonds in place, so at least it will not be necessary to fall back on the public purse to remediate a site.  Why was there a continuation of the issuing of licences where a known risk was involved and where there would have to be a remediation process for the end-of-life of the facility?  Why was the taxpayer not protected, for example, by a bond being in place to make it absolutely certain that the individual or the company would not cut and run?  That is what happens when there are non-compliant companies.  There is an ongoing problem in this case and it is located beside a major water course, the largest river in the country.</p><p>  The witnesses speak about changing behaviour.  Sometimes sanctions and laws change behaviour.  Certainly, bonds change behaviour.  One often finds that companies will want their bonds back or they will not want to be exposed to being obliged to pay a charge to stay in place.  Having gone through the experience with Kerdiffstown, for example, why is it that an industry is allowed to be licensed where there is a known risk, without a bond being in place to ensure that where there are environmental and health risks and the working through of the end-of-life of the facility is not guaranteed there is at least money there for that?  I am not referring to the health risks.</p></speech>

With regard to Kerdiffstown, there were both civil and criminal sanctions.  There were a number of High Court injunctions against the company.  There is currently a Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, case outstanding and open, so we must be conscious of what we say specifically about that case.  However, Dara Lynott can talk about the licensing and bonds issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-04a.266" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dara Lynott" time="16:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014110400015#T00500"><p>The history of Kerdiffstown is that there was landfilling there since the 1960s.  Obviously, legislation was introduced in 1996 but the agency did not issue a licence until a number of years after that, by which time it received an application that was suitable for us to issue a licence.  That licence required the building of a modern landfill cell at the site.  The business model presented to the agency was that the operator would go into the historical waste, recycle what it could and put what it could not recycle into the new landfill cell.  The new landfill cell was built, a bond was put in place and it demonstrated to the agency that the cell was to be used.  The cell was never used until near the end.</p><p>  We quickly realised that the storage of waste was becoming a problem in that site.  The agency reviewed the licence to restrict the storage of waste on the site.  Within a year of that we realised that the storage of waste was continuing there and we then prepared a dual case, one to the High Court and one to the DPP.  The nature of these cases is quite complex.  It took over a year to prepare them.  The agency successfully brought the case to the High Court.  The High Court sided with the EPA and demanded that the company cease the deposition of all waste on site.  Within a number of months of that successful High Court case the company went into liquidation and abandoned the site.  Subsequently, there was vandalism at the site and the fire started.  The DPP case is ongoing.  The latest date we have is that it will come to court in October 2015.</p><p>  There is quite a strong case of regulation, but the agency can only implement the powers that it has and it exercised all power available to it in respect of Kerdiffstown.</p><p>  With regard to Aughinish Alumina, again that site has been licensed since 1996 or 1997, which is quite a long time.  There have been a significant number of inspections and audits at that site.</p> <p> The financial provision that the agency accepted in 1996-97 was a parental guarantee by the owner of the site at the time.  There have been a reviews of that licence in the meantime to facilitate not only new legislation under the mining waste directive and other legislation such as the industrial emissions directive but also a major expansion of the facility to include a repository for red mud.  The red mud has been the subject of considerable debate as to whether it is hazardous or non-hazardous.  In February 2013, the European Commission wrote that, in its view, the red mud was a non-hazardous material.  That is not to say that hazardous materials are not dealt with at the site in question.  It deals with salt cake which, by reason of its pH, has hazardous properties.  The Commission looked into and reviewed the licensing of the facility by the Environmental Protection Agency under all applicable European Union legislation, namely, the integrated pollution, prevention and control, IPPC, directive and industrial emissions directive as well as requirements under the habitats directive and the environmental impact assessment directive, and found that the agency has licensed the facility appropriately.  As with every bond or financial provision that is put in place, however, things change.  When a facility expands, the financial provision must also expand.  The EPA is in negotiations with Aughinish Alumina to provide, to the fullest extent, for the financial provision that is necessary.</p></speech>

If I had been given answers to my questions the first time around, I would not need to ask them again.  As to whether I will be brief, that will depend on how long it takes the witnesses to answer my questions.  I have here a photograph of the tailing pond at an Aughinish Alumina site.  If anyone wishes to argue that this pond does not have a detrimental environmental impact, I do not know what to say.  I will not pursue the matter as we have been given some detail on it.</p><p>  Will the witnesses clarify whether the visits to which the report refers are the same as inspections?  Are inspections notified in advance of the attendance of EPA staff on sites?  Is it correct that the 1,370 visits or inspections carried out by the EPA resulted in only 13 prosecutions?  What proportion of monitoring activity is done by private consultants each year in the various areas to which the witnesses referred, primarily, electrical items, waste, air monitoring and septic tanks?</p><p>  On septic tanks, will the witnesses clarify-----</p></speech>

We did not have an opportunity to do so earlier.  Mr. O'Leary will respond to his questions on visits, inspections, advance notice, etc.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-04a.274" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerard O'Leary" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014110400016#U00800"><p>The majority of our inspections are unannounced.  While there may be reasons to have announced visits on occasion, the vast majority of inspections are unannounced.</p><p>  Senator Landy asked a question on the 1,374 inspections.  This figure is broken down into 844 inspections in the area of industry and waste and 530 monitoring visits, which are specifically for taking water samples. I would be pleased to provide a written response to the Senator's question if it would help create a better understanding of the issue.  The definition of inspection varies across Europe.  In terms of the industrial emissions directive, from memory, a site visit is deemed to be an on-site visit and requires that activities take place once every three years.  As we indicated, we rank sites by risk.  I would love to be able to have the plan with which we start each year implemented in full but we have priorities.  Approximately 40% of our activities are unscheduled, for example, we must respond if a fire breaks out at the Kerdiffstown site.  We must be able to adjust to complaints and so forth.</p><p>  As I indicated, we have drawn up ten priority sites on the basis of intelligence and complaints and these sites consume 14% of our time.  If I do not respond specifically to Senator Landy's questions on any matter, I will be pleased to provide him with a written response.</p><p>  In terms of air emissions, we published a report on this issue only two weeks ago.  The key pages list all of the inspections we carried out.  In 2013, for example, there were 114 air emissions inspections.  The trend in other countries has been to cease the practice of carrying out spot checks and establish instead controls by way of continuous monitors.  This is highly specialised work which is contracted out.  For the most part, however, inspections are done by our staff, whether taking water samples or making site visits for audits.  The inspections are graded depending on risk.  Again, I would be happy to provide this information in writing.</p></speech>

I understand from the EPA's initial analysis of the 2013 figures that the failure rate of septic tanks is 48%.  This means that every second septic tank does not meet the regulations.</p><p>  According to the circular provided on the EPA's website, the purpose of which is to inform owners of septic tanks what they can expect from the inspection regime, inspectors will carry out a visual inspection of the domestic wastewater treatment system .  I presume this will involve removing the cover, examining the tank and making a decision on that basis.</p></speech>

The Environmental Protection Agency sets the overall plan in terms of the framework, which does not relate only to inspections.  The overall approach has been to try to promote compliance with the septic tank regulations.  For example, a major issue arises in respect of private wells, many of which are contaminated with E. coli.  We encourage local authorities to spend as much time on citizen engagement as on inspections to encourage people not to view the septic tank as an enemy but a facility that owners and their neighbours need to protect.  If a septic tank is leaking, the effluent may enter a private well.  The issue is as much about citizen engagement as inspection.</p><p>  From speaking to officials in local authorities, one of the issues on the shopping lists of people buying a house is to check whether the septic tank has been inspected.  Over time, I hope a combination of education and inspections will improve the position.</p></speech>

At that rate, it will take 500 years to inspect them all, by which time a great deal of damage will have been done.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-04a.295" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Michelle Murphy" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014110400002#A00300"><p>I am the research and policy analyst of Social Justice Ireland and we are a member of the Better Europe Alliance.  I am joined by Alice-Mary Higgins from National Women's Council of Ireland and Michael Ewing from the Environmental Pillar.  I will give the introductory presentation and I and my colleagues will be happy to elaborate on any points in the question and answer session.</p><p>  The alliance welcomes the opportunity to make a submission to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs on the 2014 country specific recommendations, CSRs, for Ireland.  We believe this committee is in a unique position to monitor both the quality and the progress of the implementation of the CSRs in Ireland at a ministerial an departmental level.</p> <p>In future, however, the committee could also have a valuable role in ensuring that future CSRs are more comprehensive in reflecting Ireland's delivery of the Europe 2020 strategy, as this is the first year in which Ireland actually has received country-specific recommendations.  In this presentation, the alliance will focus on four specific CSRs that are of particular relevance to its members.  These are the recommendations on macroeconomic goals, health, employment and unemployment and on low-work-intensity households.  Fiscal and economic considerations have dominated the first CSRs that Ireland received from the European Commission in June.  These were evident in the macroeconomic objectives outlined in the first recommendation.  However, while the third and fourth recommendations have the potential to make improved social and environmental outcomes, it is essential that any fiscal measure flowing from the first recommendation does not impede investment in these areas and takes into account the social and environmental impact and balance of the European semester process and the Europe 2020 strategy itself.</p><p> The first recommendation outlines approaches to the achievement of commitments and annual targets in respect of budget deficits and debt outlined in the fiscal treaty and the Irish stability programme.  It calls on the Government to enhance the credibility of the fiscal adjustment strategy.  The alliance believes strongly that this must include enhancing the social, environmental and public credibility of that strategy through the reduction of poverty and social exclusion and through meeting environmental targets.  The alliance is alarmed by the proposal to make the Government expenditure ceilings more binding by limiting the scope for discretionary changes, as this will inhibit any investment in respect of child care or employment, as well as the balance of the Europe 2020 strategy itself with regard to the social, economic and environmental policy positions.  While we support the principle of greater public transparency, limiting investment will prevent Ireland from addressing core issues such as poverty and inequality, unemployment, long-term care, social housing, pensions and environmental degradation.  We agree with the proposal to broaden the tax base, which is necessary to fund social and public services and in particular, we support the need for taxation measures to avoid negative environmental harm.  The alliance also calls for all expenditure and taxation measures to be submitted to a process of poverty, inequality, gender and environmental impact assessments, on which my colleagues are happy to elaborate further during the question and answer session.</p><p> The focus of the second recommendation on health is on cost-effectiveness.  While the alliance agrees with proposals to address the costs of medicine and to ensure access to more generic medicines, it is essential that the focus on cost-effectiveness and savings in the area of health does not result in making health services less accessible or effective.  The objective of improving health outcomes, particularly among disadvantaged socioeconomic groups, must be central to health sector reform.  As for the third recommendation on employment and unemployment, we agree with the proposal to increase the level of support provided by Intreo, as well as on the need for a seamless referral system between Intreo and the education and training boards.  However, without adequate and sufficient investment, these systems will not function correctly and neither will they meet the needs of those who are long-term unemployed and the imposition of restrictive expenditure ceilings would limit such investment.  Second, a strong emphasis on the live register and those in receipt of jobseeker payments actually results in the exclusion of many groups and individuals who are disproportionately represented in low-work-intensity households, in particular those in receipt of the one-parent family payment and the disability allowance.</p><p> On the fourth recommendation on low-work-intensity households, we support the principle that any withdrawal of benefits and supplementary payments, as people in receipt of social welfare payments return to paid employment, must be managed through a tapered approach.  However, the alliance believes that firm measures are needed to address the issue of insecure employment and low-paid work.  This recommendation does not deal with the structural inequalities that act as a barrier to full social and economic participation for many people.  We strongly support the recommendation to promote accessible and affordable child care of quality but to achieve this goal it is necessary to have active public investment to provide the quality child care places needed across all parts of Ireland.  As I noted previously, the imposition of expenditure ceilings would limit investment in this area.</p><p> The alliance would like to comment on some items that are missing from the country-specific recommendations.  Overall, the non-integration of sustainability into the European semester process is of concern to the alliance.  We also are concerned that particular areas were not included in the CSRs.  These include climate change and resource efficiency, poverty reduction and the reduction of social exclusion, pensions, improved access to quality housing, gender mainstreaming, health and long-term care.  It is very important that the European semester process is genuinely focused on delivering a balanced and coherent approach between economic, social and environmental policies.  The alliance hopes that future recommendations might support long-term strategic thinking and a more balanced approach in respect of social, economic and environmental policies.  We also hope that the implementation of the CSRs in 2014 would be managed in a positive, inclusive and constructive manner, reflecting our concerns and insights.</p><p> Finally, we wish to reiterate the unique position of this committee in monitoring the implementation and delivery of CSRs in Ireland, as well as the valuable role it can play in ensuring that future CSRs are more comprehensive in reflecting Ireland's delivery of the Europe 2020 strategy.</p></speech>

As it has made a presentation to the Government in this regard, what feedback, if any, has it received from it?  While I did not catch it all, Ms Murphy earlier mentioned a process of examination in respect of poverty, inequality, gender issues and environmental impact.  By whom precisely does Ms Murphy suggest such examination be carried out?  Presumably the examiners would report back to the Government with their own recommendations.</p><p>  As for the CSRs themselves, this process is ongoing.  When members were discussing CSRs this time last year, it was the first time for them because of the European semester process and because on foot of exiting from the bailout, they were unsure of the process that would take place.  The Government will be learning from this as to what decisions will be made next year.  What would the alliance like to see in the context of the Government's role?  How do the witnesses think the Government can learn from the present CSRs?  One of Ms Murphy's first points pertained to the first recommendation regarding balanced budgets.  There are rules and even treaties that have been supported, such as the stability treaty in 2012 that was voted on by the Irish Government with regard to setting targets.  Consequently, these targets are binding and were supported at the time, in part because of the troika and the bailout, but also because people thought that balanced budgets were right and proper and would not lead to the excessive spending that happened in the past.  Ms Murphy might comment on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-04a.299" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014110400003#B00400"><p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their presentation.  It represents that part of society which makes a major contribution to the well-being of society in general.  It identifies deficiencies - as they have done and have correctly pointed out - and plans for the future by highlighting and flagging the issues that will turn up in the future.  In particular, I wish to refer to what is missing.  I have mentioned this point previously but I remember speaking at a meeting 15 years ago on the availability of quality housing.  Although the availability of quality housing was not an issue in Ireland 15 years ago, those of us were watching the system and what was happening came to the conclusion that a serious problem was arising.  It now is evident that the problem is here and is with us and how to resolve it remains the issue.  Hopefully, measures are in hand to deal with that in the short term in the first instance and second, in the medium to long term.  It requires fairly urgent and remedial action, which hopefully is being taken into account.  I wish to reject the suggestion from some quarters - it did not come from the presentation heard today - to the effect that this is a new issue that only appeared in the past two or three years.  This is not so, as it has been in the melting pot for the past ten to 12 to 14 years and clearly was there for all who wished to see.  However, it was difficult to explain to those who did not wish to see.  This always is the case, as the Chairman and I well know from past experience in these areas.</p><p>  I refer to climate change being an issue.</p> <p>Climate change is likely to become a more emotive issue in this country.  In that regard we must recognise the need to achieve a balance because every so often conclusions are reached without taking into account the entire situation presenting to us.  I agree we have to respond to issues to do with climate change, leaving aside the question of global warming, which is an unfortunate reference that has crept into the debate over the years, but in this country we must do that in a variety of ways.  I was appalled to hear someone commenting recently that this country's approach to the issue was contradictory.  That is not true.  We have vital economic interests that must be protected if we do not want our economy to go down the drain, and none of us wants to see that happen.  We must find alternative sources of electricity generation as a matter of urgency.  It is not possible to separate those two issues.  It is not possible, nor is it preferable, to talk about one at the expense of the other.  We must recognise the extent to which we will replace traditional generation methods with new methods that are carbon neutral or carbon friendly and address the problem.<br/>The agriculture area in particular is deemed to be a demon, and some suggest that the way to deal with that is to scale down and discontinue the operation.  That is not correct and anyone coming to that conclusion is seriously misleading themselves and everyone else.  Everything that grows requires carbon in the process, and the resulting emissions are the issue we must address.<br/>In ten to 15 years our cars will be powered by electricity.  Otherwise, we will be unable to meet the challenges of the future in regard to climate change.  That is a welcome development which we must recognise, but how we generate the electricity is the critical factor.  That must be done through means other than fossil fuels.  There is no point in pretending we will find some other means to do that.  There are no other means to do it.  That has been discussed <i>ad infinitum</i>heretofore.<br/>I would have been strongly supportive in a former environment, and I continue to be strongly supportive, of ensuring social justice prevails and that we all recognise the need for social justice and having social justice as a pillar of our society to resolve many issues before they become problems.  In that regard, we have had a debate in this country on the taxation of multinational corporations in recent years.  Changes have taken place to which we all agreed but we also need to recognise that the remedies proposed for us by those from outside are not necessarily remedies that are readily acceptable or that will necessarily address the problem in the way we would like it addressed.  We need to keep that in mind with regard to taxation levels generally.<br/>The debate taking place is that there are those who can afford to pay tax.  Everyone recognises that up to 52% of their salary disappears in taxation one way or the other, given the various forms of taxation.  We have been behind the European average to some extent in this regard, and the witness stated correctly that we need to be careful how we cross the bridge and move to the area of achieving the same levels as other European countries because they are in somewhat different circumstances to ours to a large extent.  They do not all have the same open economy we have, however, and they are not always necessarily affected by the challenges from outside.<br/>We also need to keep in mind that the people on the average industrial wage consider themselves highly taxed at present.  The people on &euro;35,000 to &euro;40,000 consider themselves under a great deal of pressure from taxation from all avenues and rightly believe that they will be challenged economically into the future.  In terms of a resolution that would impact on them to a great extent, which in theory might sound great, they are not exactly the rich.  They are the people who are the backbone of our society and our economy, and we need to keep that in mind.<br/>My last point is on taxation generally.  Forty-five per cent of all income tax is paid by 8% of the tax-paying public.  As that is increased to 50% the figure is 10% of the tax-paying public, and so on.  The group of people who will be affected are at two levels, namely, the average industrial wage level and the next level up.  It is the people at those two levels who feel somewhat under threat on the basis that they are at work and believe they are entitled to be rewarded for that work.  They fully accept they should pay a fair share of tax but they are concerned the total burden of taxation will be thrust upon them.  We recognise that 39% of our total workforce do not pay tax simply because they are not on the wage level that requires taxation.  It is sad that that is the case but we have to work ourselves gradually into a position where we can afford to pay for the things we would like to pay for and that we would normally have expected to be able to pay for in the normal course of events.</p></speech>

I apologise for unavoidably missing their initial presentations but I will read their written submission and look forward to hearing their responses later.  The speakers are an important part of any debate we have on this issue.  Any debate about economics, the future of Europe and so forth needs to be tempered with a focus on building society and on the reality of people's lives.  We need not talk constantly about abstract figures but the real impact on people.  In that sense, I welcome the speakers' input to the debate.</p><p>  I will raise a few issues which are important to put on record.  Not to do so would be negligent because that is what we are elected here to do.  On the question of energy, I agree with the basic thesis of my colleague, Deputy Durkan, who is a very experienced parliamentarian and who is very competent, that we have a national interest around agriculture and that involves the lives of people and families.  The entire infrastructure of rural Ireland is at issue.  For example, in the county in the constituency I represent-----</p></speech>

We have to work on the green energy agenda.  It has to be central, and we have to sustain that.  We have made great progress on developing a culture of recycling in this country, and that has resulted in great progress being made in that area.  I remember when it first came on the agenda in local government, of which I was a member years ago, it was almost a foreign concept for consumers.  That is no longer the case.  People have adapted to the different bins very well and to the entire recycling process, but we also need to move on the green energy agenda.</p><p>  In the light of scientific development and progress, we will have to keep the question of nuclear energy under review.</p> <p>I do not say we must opt for nuclear energy, as such, but science has overtaken a number of the difficulties that surrounded it in the past.  The methods for dealing with nuclear waste, for example, have improved.  We cannot put nuclear energy off the agenda if we accept the problem that exists with climate change.  The UN has left us in no doubt about that.  Anecdotal and experiential evidence of climate change exists and that behoves us to examine recycling, energy and conservation and to keep green energy on the agenda.  It further behoves us to look fairly and squarely at nuclear energy as an option, if it could be done safely and the waste issue were to be addressed.  Considerable progress has been made on waste.  I do not wish to misquote the former Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, but if I understood him correctly, he said he had no issue with importing energy from countries that use nuclear energy.  We must examine the issue.  I do not say we have to develop nuclear energy but we must not shy from examining it.  The old arguments no longer hold.</p><p> I agree with the basic thesis presented that we should broaden the tax base.  I would be the first within my parliamentary party and elsewhere to be critical of many aspects of Irish Water, the delivery of services and related issues.  No one can deny, however, that the basic objective of Irish Water and the property tax is to broaden the tax base.  There are those who like to parade themselves as champions of social justice, a more equitable and broader tax base, based on taxes other than of the traditional industrial worker and lower paid civil servants who paid everything in the past, but if one wants to champion that cause, one cannot logically do so and not be in favour of broadening the tax base.  One cannot logically be against the property tax and water charges, willy-nilly, and then support the proposition that we should have a broader tax base and more equity.  That is not sustainable.  There is much hypocrisy on the issue.</p><p> I welcome the proposal in the submission that we should broaden the tax base.  That is precisely what the Government is doing, albeit in a flawed fashion on occasion, and with a need for improvement and the introduction of more consumer-friendly aspects.  The purpose of the property tax and water charges is to broaden the tax base.  The aim is to take the burden off the backs that traditionally bore the brunt of tax such as industrial workers and lower paid civil servants.  There is no equivocation on the matter.  One cannot parade oneself on the issue as some seem to do, namely, as a champion of equity, social progress and an egalitarian society where the poor are to the fore.  I refer to people in certain political organisations and groups who then say they are against all forms of taxation that would broaden the tax base.  That is not a sustainable or honest approach.  The two things are incompatible.  One would not need a degree in logic to see the positions are mutually incompatible.  If one works on the assumption that there is no magic source of money; it is incompatible with social justice to say one should not broaden the tax base.</p><p> I say well done to the witnesses in that regard.  In their response, could they say that what we are doing with property tax and water charges, flawed and all as they are in their implementation, is the correct economic strategy to look after the poorer sections of society?  It behoves people such as they to give leadership in that regard.</p></speech>

None of us can avoid the issue.  One cannot be on both sides of the argument.</p><p>  I missed the presentation, but if I understood the document correctly, I agree with the stated need for job activation.  We should not treat jobseeker&rsquo;s payments as a paternalistic welfare payment to keep the poor at bay and to keep them fed and leave them in perpetual unemployment.  There should be job activation, support, training and education.  I am a great believer in that, but a person should be supported when, through human frailty or lack of opportunity due to geography or other factors, he or she cannot get a foot on any ladder.  There is no suggestion to the contrary, but where we can introduce job activation measures and training, we should do so and such an approach should be aggressively pursued.  I commend the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, who has prioritised such an approach to social welfare.  We must deliver more.  I would welcome the comments of witnesses in that regard.</p><p>  The experience of Finland and all empirical evidence to date suggests the Youth Guarantee is the greatest vehicle for tackling potential long-term unemployment, social deprivation and generational unemployment.  For that reason the Youth Guarantee should be implemented.  We are a bit tardy about it.  I understand &euro;6 billion is available.  I would welcome a comment on the implementation of the Youth Guarantee, where we stand in regard to it, whether we are making sufficient progress and what more could be done.</p><p>  Child care was cited as an issue.  I accept the point.  That is the reason we must broaden the tax net and be straight up about such matters.  I am a teacher by profession, and from observation and basic savvy, what is needed in child care is to extend the early childhood year to two years.  There is no better piece of social engineering to create equality of opportunity, a fairer society and to rebuild a society that has been torn by recession and austerity that arose from a situation of boom and bust.  We should introduce a second year of early childhood education.  Many of the people who are posturing on the new forms of taxation aimed at bringing equity and broadness to the tax net should address such a question.  If one takes a dysfunctional or difficult family, or even the average family, nothing is better for a family than for children to be able to avail of a few hours in a supported environment with qualified people for education and socialisation.  It gives the parents a break and provides them with opportunities for work, to train for a job that they might not otherwise have, to engage in job activation and to make applications for jobs.  Thankfully, more job opportunities are coming on stream than was previously the case.</p><p>  Do the witnesses agree that the greatest piece of social engineering in terms of child care would be a second year of free child care?  I have argued for its implementation in every forum available.  Do the witnesses also agree with my point on the Youth Guarantee and job activation?  Do they further agree with what I said on broadening the tax base and that it is hypocritical to be in favour of social egalitarianism, equality of opportunity and fairness and yet to be against measures to broaden the tax net?</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for the document.  I will speak in broad terms and the witnesses can respond accordingly.</p><p>  My first point relates to the macroeconomic scenario.  Even based on today&rsquo;s figures we are looking at a somewhat better picture than we were even a month ago in terms of the 4.7% growth rate in the economy, which the Commission commented on today.  It seemed to be surprised at the extent to which the Irish economy has grown.  The growth rate far exceeds the growth rate of our European partners.  That, in itself, presents a certain difficulty in the sense that we are somewhat limited by the extent by which we can grow, given the weakness within the general European economy.</p> <p>It does indicate that we may have more room for manoeuvre than we would have had a year ago in terms of some of the things that we could and should consider.  I believe we should have spent more time in the last budget reversing the cuts that we made in previous years, rather than focusing on reducing rates of tax, but that is just a personal view.</p></speech>

We stand at a moment, going forward into the next budget, where we have more room for manoeuvre and it is important that the voices represented by the witnesses be heard very strongly in terms of what type of tax reform is important.  Would they share the views of TASC, for example, in regard to some of the proposals that they put forward?  Social Justice Ireland has a number of specific recommendations.  Are there two or three specific measures that we should be pursuing in the context of economic policy over the next 12 to 18 months?  I am thinking of the universal social charge as a possible issue.<br/>In relation to the macro-economic goals themselves, I agree that all changes need to be challenged looking at the complex issues of reducing poverty and social exclusion.  There is an issue as to how the budgetary process works, and a number of people would like to see that process changed.  This idea that people walk in with a briefcase, or it is announced in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>or <i>The Sunday Business Post </i>a couple of days before the budget itself is announced, is a very poor way to do business.  At this point in the year, we should be starting to look at next year's budget and engaging with all groupings about how the budgetary process should work.  Do the witnesses have any thoughts on how we as a committee and the parliamentary system overall should be facilitating social inclusion and engaging with economic groups as part of the budgetary process?<br/>One of the specific issues relates to low work-intensity households.  The recession has brought a lot of the issues around youth unemployment into sharp focus.  In some ways, it seems to be masking more structural issues in the Irish economy.  In 2012, I think, the OECD produced a report stating that Ireland had the second-highest rate of households in which no member was actively participating in the labour market.  Since that report was published, I believe we have risen to the highest rate.  This is not a situation that arose yesterday or the day before.  While I agree with my colleague about the importance of the Youth Guarantee, I believe we have a more fundamental problem with labour market activation, particularly for groups such as people with disabilities, women, or older people who are facing discrimination.  Do the witnesses have any specific views on how that deep structural problem can be tackled?<br/>In regard to climate change, we have a more immediate problem in fuel poverty.  Looking at the statistics that were published in the last pre-budget submission by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the amount of money that the average family on social welfare or a low income has to pay just to stay warm has increased by a headline figure of, I believe, about 40% over the last years.  People have a right to be warm, and there are measures that we have to take in the shorter term to enable people to be warm in their homes.  How could some of the current welfare measures be improved and how do we get to groups that are not currently being assisted through these types of measures?  <br/>There is an issue around women's pension entitlements, particularly for older women, and their capacity to take of themselves in older age.  How can that be tackled for women who find themselves unable to get pension benefits in older age?  <br/>In terms of low work-intensity households, the partnerships are undergoing a process of reform at the moment.  Do the witnesses have any views on that?  The partnerships have contributed enormously to overall social inclusion issues and to work participation, particularly in some of the black-spot communities that I am aware of in Dublin and other parts of the country.  I would not like to see that process in any way dissipated because the partnerships are fundamental to tackling social inclusion issues.<br/>Access to finance is one of the main issues for low-income households.  I am sure the witnesses are aware that the Central Bank recently commented on the need for people to have a 20% deposit to apply for a mortgage, and that they will only be able to borrow two-and-a-half or three times their income.  We do not have a rental system that facilitates people living long-term in social rental, and we certainly do not have nearly enough social housing to tackle the shortage, even with the Government's expanded programme.  How do the witnesses foresee people being able to access housing in the future, and do they believe that the current financial system is adequate, particularly for the needs of people on lower incomes?  We have a certain level of access to borrowing through the credit unions, but do we have a banking system that is adequate to the needs of people on lower incomes?<br/>The issue of mortgage arrears was raised in the Country-Specific Recommendations themselves.  It was not specifically mentioned by the witnesses.  Given the wide range of groups that they represent, would they have any comments on how the issue of mortgage arrears is panning out, particularly for people who might have been very high-risk borrowers at the time they took out mortgage finance, and who may now be experiencing poverty?<br/>I fully agree with the second year of early childhood education, but there is a need to distinguish between affordable childcare and early childhood education.  Early childhood education-----</p></speech>

It is very important that we do not use the two terms synonymously.  Child care is not the same as early childhood education.  They can be, but are not necessarily, the same thing.  Children require early childhood education whether or not their mothers are participating in the workforce.  It is important that discourse reflects the need for an element of choice as well as enabling people to work.</p><p>  In regard to the decision to restore &euro;5 per month on child benefit, do the witnesses favour that over direct provision of, say, State-sponsored childcare or of services to children such as school meals through the school or early education systems?  Or is there rooms for both strategies - general payments that are not selective versus selective provision of resources targeted at children who need them?</p></speech>

She has presented a very wide-ranging list of comments.</p> <p>I would just raise one issue of my own.  The Commission is sailing close to the wind in relation to some of the recommendations it is making and may actually be overstepping its mark, particularly in the first recommendation, where it suggests that government expenditure ceilings should be more binding by limiting the statutory scope for discretionary changes.  I noted in the witnesses' presentation that they are extremely alarmed by this.  I share that alarm, because we have already put in place very rigorous criteria in the form of the fiscal compact treaty, an intergovernmental treaty signed by 25 of the then 27 member states.  These criteria are more than enough to enable governments to plan and to keep government expenditure in check.  I do not see the need for additional criteria.  It is interesting to note that some European countries are now looking for a relaxation of the fiscal compact criteria.  For instance, the Italian Prime Minister, Mr. Matteo Renzi, suggests that capital expenditure be included as part of the criteria and France is also examining the fiscal compact criteria.  I wonder if the witnesses would agree with me that when it comes to this particular recommendation, the Commission is being overly critical of the Irish State and excessive in its requirements of us.  It does not reflect the changing economic environment that we are now entering in the European sphere.  Would the witnesses care to comment on whether all of these recommendations are fully current?  There is quite a range of comments.</p><p> Deputy Kyne has asked me to express his apologies.  He had to attend the agriculture committee as well, but will note from the written record the witnesses' responses to his comments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-04a.316" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Alice-Mary Higgins" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014110400007#F00300"><p>I will take a stab at responding to this wide variety of issues.</p><p>  First, we thank the Deputies and the Senator for engaging genuinely and strongly with our presentation and our submission.  While as individual organisations we may have very strong and specific views on some of the questions that have been raised, we may not be in a position to state that this is the view of the Better Europe Alliance.  The nature of our evolving coalition is broad.  We are covering a number of issues but we are not covering all issues as yet, though we would be very happy to respond as individual organisations to the representatives on any of these issues.</p><p>  To address some of the first questions from Deputy Kyne - and it also links into Deputy Hannigan's point - we agree that the fiscal compact criteria should be sufficient in themselves.  We were very clear in our submission that we do not think it is appropriate to seek further binding ceilings on expenditure.  Our concern in that regard relates not just to the changing economic and macroeconomic context, but also to the balance within the semester process as a whole.  The semester process as a whole is delivering our commitments in terms of fiscal stability but is also delivering our commitments in terms of smart, sustainable, inclusive growth under the Europe 2020 strategy.  We are concerned that proposals such as that would compromise the ability to deliver the kind of smart, sustainable, inclusive development that is the ultimate overall goal.  That may address some of Deputy Kyne's questions about what kind of proofing or processes are in place.</p><p>  The important thing is that we have binding targets, which we must meet, but the way in which we meet them should be tested to ensure that a short-term target is never allowed to undermine long-term social sustainability or environmental and other targets.  When we talk about practical tools such as the social impact assessments, environmental impact, a stronger application of the regulatory processes we have, and gender mainstreaming - which is pushed strongly from a European level - these are tools to ensure that any measures deriving from the first recommendation on fiscal targets are put through the filter to ensure that they are not taking us a step backwards on the other track of the semester process, which is, of course, Europe 2020.  Those tools are available to Departments and it is important that there is also a coordinated approach to employing them.</p><p>  I very much welcome, although it is somewhat outside the scope of our alliance, Deputy Heydon's comments on budgetary process.  Similarly, there is scope for a much wider use of tools and debate within economic decision-making.</p><p>  In terms of some of the specifics of child care, for example, we regard child care investment as an example of medium-term investment.  It is an investment in safe, sustainable and inclusive growth.  It is not simply expenditure, it is investment, because it has a huge delivery in terms of increasing participation in the workforce.  That is an example of where short-term targets around debt should not be allowed to undermine long-term delivery of something that is a priority across Europe and particularly in Ireland.  I may be straying into the views of the National Women's Council, so I apologise if that is the case, but the question of child benefit is important in responding to the increased costs to inflation and to the large cutbacks in the area of child benefit.  In general in Ireland we should not pit one measure that supports children and families against another measure that supports children and families.  We have a collective job to do as a nation to move forward on that.  I also agree that a year of early childhood education is extremely important.  It is an essential step and an affordable, manageable, costed step that could be taken.  However, I would also agree that early childhood education is important developmentally for children and for families and is not simply an employment measure.  For example, in terms of child care we must also look at out-of-hours care.  It is also important - and this is something that may be missing from the current corporate social responsibilities, CSRs, which we hope will be more reflected in the next ones - to recognise that care, be it elder care or care for children, makes an economic and social contribution, which is separate from the facilitation of employment but which has contribution and value in itself.</p><p>  I will pass some of the environmental issues over to my colleague and also some taxation issues.  However, in terms of taxation we must look to the idea of progressivity.  When we talk about widening the tax base, progressivity must be a core within that.  For example, when we look at the proportion of people who are paying a large percentage of the income tax, they have a larger percentage of the income.  We also know from a gender perspective that a significant number of women, 50%, are earning &euro;20,000 or less in Ireland, so the reality is that we have a huge population on a low income.  We would like to see the employment targets within the semester process linked more strongly to the quality of employment because we have seen the depletion of wages, which has greatly affected women in particular but all sectors of society and most sectors of employment.  That is the quality dimension within employment, to ensure that our achievement of the employment targets is also contributing to the achievement of our poverty reduction targets.</p><p>  I might ask some of my colleagues to answer some of the other questions.  I would like to signal to members that we are discussing the issue of taxation as an alliance.  We will be having an event to look at the intersection between environmental taxation and the issues of social equity and inclusion.</p></speech>

Clearly, this is in the headlines and is a major issue globally.  Deputy Durkan raised the issue of social justice in this regard.  I totally agree with him that the matters of energy and climate are very closely allied to social justice issues at a global level.  It means caring about the social justice issues affecting people in all Continents, including Africa, Asia and America.  We have to take into account all peoples' social and human rights.  In responding to climate issues, we must take account everybody's human rights and social justice issues concerning all societies.<br/>We have a very serious problem to deal with in terms of the climate.  We must reach a target of zero emissions by the end of this century.  We need to<b></b>have an 80% reduction by 2050.  These are radical challenge for us.  They must be met if we are to survive as a species; that is a fact of science and not really an emotive issue.<br/>Regarding the contradictions in Ireland with regard to agriculture and climate, there is an issue to be resolved.  We have to work it out between ourselves.  It is not reasonable for people to say we are feeding the world because we are not.  We are feeding people from middle-class homes in India and China and other places with our agriculture.  It is a perfectly legitimate thing to be doing but it is not legitimate to say we are growing stuff to feed the world because what we are doing may have implications in the longer term for the well-being of a lot of people in other countries in terms of emissions.  That said, there is room for us to discuss how we should deal with that.  We should be talking right now about how we deal with agricultural emissions in regard to forestry and peatlands and carbon capture in those two areas.  It is not a clear-cut issue but a very complicated one.<br/>My father is a farmer and his father before him was a farmer.  I live in a farming community in north Roscommon and know exactly the position in the farming community on this but we do have to deal with the issue.  It is not a question of just saying we are special because everybody is special.  The coal miners in Poland are special, as are the car manufacturers in Germany.  Carbon and climate change are very real and difficult issues we have to deal with as a species on the planet.<br/>Fuel poverty is clearly a major issue for many people and needs to be dealt with in a way that also allows for a reduction in carbon emissions.  That means looking after insulation and proper housing for people in fuel poverty.  A measure needs to be implemented to allow those people to have decent housing that enables them to live comfortably without having to spend vast sums heating inadequate housing.  That is the direction to go.<br/>I believe I have more or less covered everything.  I welcome the support for green energy.  This is a direction to go in.  Nuclear energy needs to be debated.  There are issues concerning nuclear energy for Ireland in that it takes roughly 20 years to develop a nuclear power plant.  In 20 years' time, we will need to be already solving the problem.  An issue arises regarding fuel supply in terms of nuclear energy.  There is a limited amount of fuel on the planet.  I refer only to electricity but there are other forms of heating we need to talk about.  There is a lot of scope for local energy production, which creates local employment, particularly in rural areas, through timber and biomass production for home and community heating.  There are many steps that can be taken in this regard.<br/>Broadening the tax base in this area in terms of reducing pollution is one of the areas that we, as an alliance, agree we need to talk about a little more.  We need to talk about how it should be done and look after the interests of the socially excluded and marginalised.  Making the polluter pay is an essential step, and it is a legal requirement in Europe in any case.  It is something we should be doing regularly and our tax base should reflect it.<br/>At present, we have a number of arrangements for subsidising activities that are environmentally damaging, and damaging to the climate.  We need to examine how to change this.</p></speech>

I refer to the burning of peat in power stations, in particular.  It is an extremely inefficient way of producing heat.  If we were to flood our peatlands rather than burn them, we would actually reduce our national carbon emissions by approximately 20%.  That is an obvious example of how one actually resolves the issue to some degree in respect of the farmers' emissions.</p></speech>

The problem with alliances, as we know, is that they cover an amorphous mass of views and seem to contain within them the view that suits everybody's particular menu.  Of course, the view that suits everyone's menu suits none.</p><p>  There are two or three points I wish to make.  The first concerns our economy's dependency on food production and the carbon emissions caused by food production.  Balance in this regard comes from forestry, grass and various other growing processes.  The percentage of any economy in any country that is dependent entirely on fossil fuels is the issue we need to address.  We can do so.  The way we can replace the fossil fuel economy in Ireland is by replacing production methods associated with fossil fuels.</p><p>  I am not a supporter of the nuclear industry, about which my colleague has spoken.  I do not support it because I believe the residue is impossible to deal and has never been dealt with.</p></speech>

This is true but they are carbon neutral.  They exude the carbon they have absorbed in the first place; that is all.  There is an equal balance.  I spent a good number of years on a committee that dealt with this subject and have a reasonable knowledge of it.  Some of the statements I hear from time to time on dealing with this issue are totally wide of the mark.  The truest method of achieving a balance is to use the ordinary block of wood, the unromantic block of wood that is cut and popped into the grate.  There is only one process, namely, the one involving a saw.  That is truly ecologically balanced in every sense of the word because there is no other industrial process involved.  That is the secret.  Many of the other processes have an industrial element.  It can be a quite severe industrial process and contribute very considerably to carbon emissions.</p> <p> Senator Aideen Hayden made a very valid point in regard to child care provision.  Both partners in a household should not be forced into the workplace as a consequence of the economic situation.  In other words, there should be some measure of choice for families.  The reality is that we can spend all the money we like trying to intervene at different levels to correct a particular social deficit or injustice, but the outcome is not necessarily what we plan in all instances.  This particular issue goes back to the individualisation of the taxation system and a host of other factors.</p><p> It is becoming common practice in recent times to have these discussions in a context where the argument is made that Parliament should be responsible for the allocation of funds.  In fact, the Executive is where the executive decisions are taken.  Nobody has ever gone forward on the basis of his or her allegiance to a committee.  Nobody can seek election on the basis that if he or she is a member of a particular Oireachtas committee, he or she will do X, Y and Z.  It does not work that way.  Article 17 of the Constitution identifies the role of the Executive and the chief executive in the determination of how and where money is spent and the obligation to carry a message from the chief executive, who is the Taoiseach in this country and would be the Prime Minister in most other countries.</p><p> There has been growing support in recent years for the notion that politicians should not be the only people dealing with these types of issues.  The view is that there should be some higher sanctum or organisation overseeing matters.  That type of system is actually in place across Europe in so far as several jurisdictions have been operating a list system for many years.  We do not have a list system because our system of proportional representation takes account of all the whims of the electorate in order of preference.  It is the most scientific system internationally with the exception of the Australian system.  We do not have to dig into it on a regular basis in order to re-turn the wheel.  I have pointed out on many occasions that in many European countries, particularly in recent decades, a type of consensus politics has developed and we see essentially a single government dominating for up to 30 years.  All that happens after an election is that one party opts out.  It is like Lanigan's Ball, with one stepping out and another stepping in, but the result is a continuation of virtually the same regime.  I have studied this at great length and am not trying to make a political point here.  When there is no significant change in governance, people can get frustrated and start to wonder whether they should have a different system.  However, it is not the system that is wrong; it is simply the fact that we have become accustomed to taking the easy way out and failing to address the issues that continue to present on a daily basis.</p><p> I was a member of the convention which drew up the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.  There were many theories put forward by various participants in the course of our work .  I was of the view, for example, that housing should be included as a right.  I was told eventually by the powers that be - including people representing socialist-orientated governments, I should clarify - that it was not possible to do so because the availability of the required finance could become an issue.  I tried to put forward a remedy to address that, but such a provision has not yet been accepted anywhere, so far as I am aware.  Another issue that arose was the right to employment.  I would have liked to see that included, but it was not possible to do so because of the financial or fiscal exigencies within which we had to work.</p><p> There is a general view now that the right to water is a fundamental human right.  It is an emotive issue.  I agree that access to water is a fundamental right, but the idea goes back to a time when people had to go to the river and take it out in a bucket.  Fortunately, we have moved on from there and households now have access to water in a convenient and reliable way.  The danger in this discussion is that the issues can become confused and clouded in a situation where we have alliances, some of which are in favour of a particular issue and some of which are opposed.  Some groups have very good reasons for holding the views they do, even where one might disagree with them.  The bottom line is that we must work within our capabilities and implement improvements where possible.  Most of all, we must have regard to what is likely to happen in future, encompassing such considerations as climate change, housing issues, social issues and so on.  If we do not do that, we are failing in the fundamental requirement to plan for the future.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-04a.338" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Michelle Murphy" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014110400009#H00300"><p>Thank you, Chairman.  I will try to address some of the issues.  In terms of being part of an alliance, there certainly is a range of opinions.  It is like being part of a coalition and there is a lot of negotiation to be done.  We have only been in existence for three months.</p><p>  Deputy Kyne asked about feedback to Government.  We met with officials from the Department of the Taoiseach today and the intention is to have a regular engagement with them, which should be very productive.  We would like to meet with this committee on an ongoing basis, including for discussion on next year's country-specific recommendations and perhaps the annual growth survey.  We are all learning from this process.  In terms of the impact assessment, we would see the Department of the Taoiseach as having overall responsibility, given its responsibility for the national reform programme, for ensuring the various Departments implement what is set out in the assessment.</p><p>  We absolutely agree with Deputy Durkan's view on the housing issue.  The problem in regard to social housing did not just appear overnight.  It has been 20 years in the making and will require investment to address it, which goes back to Senator Hayden's point regarding the cost of rental accommodation.  We have a paper on mortgage arrears in which we make the case that while there is a recommendation on mortgage arrears, there are no details on how that goal is to be achieved.  If the issue is to be tackled through negotiated solutions such as restructuring, it is very important that households which find themselves in difficulties are facilitated to remain in their homes.  Any increased reliance on home repossessions will push those families into an extremely challenging housing market, further exacerbating the problem.</p><p>  Mr. Ewing has dealt with the climate change issue.  In terms of broadening the tax base, the debate in Ireland is very narrow and focused solely on income tax.  We are far too reliant on income tax and PRSI.  We must examine how to broaden the base by examining issues such as property and environmental taxation.  In order to provide the services we need, we must be able to fund them.  We need to have a rational discussion about these issues which involves all of society.</p><p>  As Deputy Durkan observed, issues around water supply and water charges have become distorted.  An important consideration is ensuring that those who are most vulnerable and those at the bottom are protected.  Senator Hayden referred to fuel poverty, which has become a real  issue.  Any water charging structure must not push people into water poverty.  This is a discussion the Government must have.</p><p>  The Youth Guarantee is an excellent vehicle for funding, but of the &euro;6 billion that is allocated as a whole, there is &euro;648 million in total for Ireland.  A pilot scheme is in place but we have been a little slow to implement it.  We hope, in particular, that it will benefit young people who have left school early and are quite far removed from the labour market.</p><p>  In terms of the budgetary process, two years ago the finance committee brought in groups to discuss how we might have a participatory budgetary process.  It is an excellent idea which would involve discussing proposals before they are implemented and trying to determine what impacts they might or might not have.  A change implemented in one Department will often impact another.  In the case of changes to medical card provision, for instance, there also will be an impact on people in terms of social welfare.</p></speech>

In relation to rights, there is not an acceptance of progressive realisation in relation to rights such that one can have rights to a home and job but it is acknowledged that they would be realised progressively as the economy and society are in a position to realise them.</p></speech>

As the committee knows, we have agreed, subject to scheduling arrangements, that I attend this committee regularly to update it and discuss developments occurring at the ECOFIN Council.  The departmental officials also provide written briefings each month to the committee.  I see this as a positive opportunity to engage and discuss the issues before finance ministers across the EU.</p><p>  This is the second last ECOFIN Council under the Italian Presidency, with Latvia taking over the Presidency from 1 January 2015.  Much has been achieved and progressed under the Italian Presidency and I am confident that much will be achieved by the Latvian Presidency next year.  The new Commission took office on 1 November and this marks an opportunity for renewed drive and commitment to work even harder on restoring our economies, getting our young people back to work and creating a better society for all.  There are many challenges ahead for the new Commission and Ireland will work steadfastly in assisting its work.</p><p>  In its invitation, the committee asked if I would also provide a brief overview of the proceedings of the October meeting so I will address that item first.  That meeting took place in Luxembourg on 14 October.  As members recall, 14 October was also budget day here in Ireland and because I was presenting the budget to the D&aacute;il, I was unable to attend the ECOFIN meeting.  In my absence, I was ably represented by His Excellency Ambassador Declan Kelleher.  The ECOFIN agenda was dominated by two main areas: supports for investment and taxation.</p><p>  Turning first to investment, the Commission and the European Investment Bank, EIB, presented a joint note on promoting investment.  This follows on from the informal ECOFIN meeting in September, when a task force was established.  This task force will allow member states, the Commission and the EIB jointly identify viable investments of European significance that are not being realised currently for economic, regulatory or other reasons.  It is intended that the task force will deliver its final report by the end of December.  The October Council discussed measures to support investment as part of the EU's response in promoting competitiveness and growth, and Council conclusions were agreed and published after the meeting.</p><p>  Looking forward, I am confident there will be opportunities for investment in Ireland arising out of this task force, and the Department is engaging actively with it to ensure this is the case.  Ireland's engagement with the EIB is very positive and funding for Ireland has increased steadily in recent years.  The positive engagement between Ireland and the bank was aptly demonstrated last Friday when President Werner Hoyer of the EIB travelled to Ireland, along with Minister Sch&auml;uble and Kreditanstalt f&uuml;r Wiederaufbau, KfW, bank, to sign the loan for the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI.  The EIB and Ireland are strongly committed to working together to enhance the bank's activity in the country, and this commitment is clearly beginning to bear fruit.</p><p>  There was also a brief discussion on a presentation by the Commission on the importance of research and innovation as sources of renewed growth.  The Commission outlined proposals on how to better exploit the potential of research and innovation as drivers of economic growth.  The discussion will continue at the Competitiveness Council in December where it is hoped to adopt conclusions.  Ireland fully supports the proposals of the Commission and recognises its importance to growth in the economy.</p><p>  There was also an item on the agenda relating to banking union and the contribution to the single resolution fund.  The Commission updated the Council on the preparations for implementing legislation on contributions by banks to resolution funds established under new EU rules.  Banks will have to make annual contributions to resolution funds established under the bank recovery and resolution directive and under the regulation on the single resolution mechanism.  Contributions will be calculated on the basis of the banks' liabilities, excluding own funds and covered deposits, and adjusted for risk.  Work on this area has largely been completed.</p><p>  In respect of taxation, the Council agreed to a draft directive extending the mandatory automatic exchange of information between tax administrations, thereby enabling them to better combat tax evasion and to improve the efficiency of tax collection.</p> <p>The proposal brings interest, dividends and other income, as well as account balances and sales proceeds from financial assets, within the scope of the automatic exchange of information.  It thus amends the directive on administrative co-operation in the field of direct taxation.  It is aimed at remedying situations where a taxpayer seeks to hide capital or assets on which tax is due.  Unreported and untaxed income is considerably reducing potential national tax revenues, and cross-border tax fraud and tax evasion have become a major focus of concern both within the EU and at global level.  The automatic exchange of information is an important means for strengthening the efficiency and effectiveness of tax collection, and the new directive thereby sets out to meet that challenge.</p><p> Only last week I travelled to Berlin and signed the multilateral competent authority agreement, which demonstrates Ireland's firm commitment to automatic exchange of information.  It is another example of how Ireland supports the automatic exchange of information between tax authorities as an important tool in the fight against tax fraud and evasion and we look forward to its implementation at EU and global level.</p><p> Finally, in respect of energy taxation, the Council debated a proposal to restructure the taxation of energy products and electricity in line with EU policy objectives regarding energy and climate change.  The Commission's proposal amends the existing energy taxation directive in order to promote energy efficiency and the consumption of more environmentally friendly products.  Noting the divergent positions of member states on the key issues covered by the proposal, it was decided to return to the issue again at another meeting.</p><p>I hope the committee found that brief overview of last month's meeting helpful.  I will now turn to the November ECOFIN, which will take place on Friday.  I will be happy to take questions and observations from members after I have outlined the key issues that are likely to arise at Friday's meeting.  The agenda that has been issued is still very much a draft and there can be changes between now and the meeting in respect of content and the order of the discussion.  As always, work is continuing at the level of officials and, therefore, there can also be more substantial changes in how the discussions will evolve.</p><p> The agenda in its current format will begin by considering an item on the revision of VAT and GNI own resources balances 1995 to 2013.  This item relates to the EU budget and flows from a draft amending budget tabled by the Commission on 17 October, which mainly provides for an adjustment of member states' EU budget contributions on foot of the annual technical rebalancing payments in respect of macro-economic, VAT and customs duty revisions undertaken for all member states.  These rebalancing payments are called up automatically every year on 1 December in accordance with EU own resource legislation.  It is anticipated that a general discussion will take place with the Commission taking the lead.  While recognising that all member states are expected to abide by the budgetary rules in addressing any immediate political issue, we will be constructive in working with colleagues to seek a pragmatic solution that could be accommodated within the own resource legal framework.</p><p> The agenda will then move onto the "legislative deliberations", which will take place in public session.  Based on the draft agenda, three items are scheduled for discussion, all of which are related to taxation - the parent subsidiaries directive, the financial transaction tax, FTT, and the standard VAT return.  The parent subsidiaries directive was introduced to avoid double taxation of certain companies in the Single Market.  At Friday's meeting, Ministers will aim to reach a political agreement on the basis of an overall Presidency compromise text for a common minimum anti-abuse provision, which will be examined and discussed thoroughly.</p><p> On the issue of the FTT, Ministers will be provided with an update by the Commission on the state of play with regard to the work on the tax.  In 2013, some 11 member states agreed to work towards the introduction of such a tax through enhanced co-operation.  The ECOFIN last discussed this issue in May this year, when ten of the Ministers issued a joint statement reaffirming their commitment to introducing the tax and committed to reaching agreement by the end of the year on the initial application phase of the FTT by 1 January 2016.  The Presidency took note of this joint statement by the Ministers of the ten participating countries and confirmed that all relevant issues would continue to be examined by national experts.  It noted the intention of participating countries to work on a progressive implementation of the tax, focusing initially on the taxation of shares and certain derivatives.  However, progress to date by the participating member states has been slow and there are still many open issues around the scope of the tax and the distribution of revenues among member states.</p><p> The VAT proposal aims to introduce a standard VAT return throughout the EU with the aim of reducing burdens on business.  The current VAT directive has been identified as burdensome for SMEs.  This proposal was last discussed by Ministers at the Slovenia November meeting last year.  At Friday's ECOFIN, Ministers will be invited to give their views on the future handling of the proposal and to agree a draft set of conclusions.  However, progress has been slower than hoped since last November, and questions are being raised as to whether the costs involved may outweigh the benefits.  We will discuss these issues at the meeting and, hopefully, make headway.  In general, I am strongly supportive of the concept of measures that make life easier for business.  However, like many other member states, we are mindful of proposals that might not lead to savings and could lead to additional administrative burdens for business and, therefore, we will be keeping a careful watch on how this proposal develops.</p><p> I refer to non-legislative activities based on the draft agenda before us.  Two items are scheduled for discussion.  These are Council conclusions on EU statistics and on the preparation of the 20th conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, in Lima.  The Council conclusions on EU statistics are a regular item at this time of year and Ministers will be asked to adopt Council conclusions on the annual statistical package.  As the work on this item was progressed and prepared by officials, it is not envisaged that a detailed discussion will be required on this issue.</p><p> At the meeting, Ministers will be asked to adopt Council conclusions on climate finance ahead of the UNFCCC conference in Lima in December.  The Council will consider a set of draft conclusions which reflect the common EU position for the Lima discussions.  The conclusions outline the parameters of the EU's engagement in international climate finance.  Work is under way at international level to develop commonly agreed frameworks for measuring, reporting and verifying climate finance flows.  The conclusions have been prepared by officials and, therefore, a long discussion is not expected at ECOFIN.</p><p> I hope that the committee has found the brief summary of the outcome of last month's ECOFIN informative and that the outline I have given on this month's agenda gives a good insight into the current issues before the Council.  I thank members for their attention and I will be happy to respond to questions or observations that they may have.</p></speech>

I would like to put a few questions regarding the Irish position on some of the issues on the agenda.  I do not know much about the parent subsidiaries directive.  Is it acceptable to Ireland as drafted or is the Minister proposing amendments to it?</p></speech>

This will limit the benefit of the directive, which seeks to ensure there is no double taxation when companies pay dividends to their subsidiaries.</p> <p>They need to be genuine business transactions.  Ireland's position, which we have already stated, is that we have strong anti-avoidance rules in domestic law.  We support the proposal because we do not believe it will affect us.  Our policy is such that we agree with what is happening in any event.  We already have the rules in domestic legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-04a.377" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/993" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="19:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014110400005#D00200"><p>Let me move on to the financial transaction tax, FTT, which is also one of the legislative measures on the agenda on Friday.  As the Minister indicated, ten or 11 member states signalled initially their intention to go ahead under the enhanced co-operation mechanism.  They include France, Germany, Italy and Spain.  The Minister's stated position is that Ireland will remain outside the FTT arrangement, for now at least, primarily because of the United Kingdom's decision to remain out of it and the fear that we might be put at a competitive disadvantage given the mobile nature of financial services, particularly regarding investment.  Does this remain the Irish position?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-04a.378" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="19:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014110400005#D00300"><p>The discussion will involve a state-of-play report on discussions regarding the FTT proposal.  As I said in my speech, there were originally 11 participants.  One has now dropped out and the number is reduced to ten.  However, progress on the FTT proposal remains slow, with many open issues to be resolved.  Ireland is not one of the countries intending to implement the FTT.  We believe an FTT must be implemented at global level to be effective, although we could accept an FTT if agreement were reached across the 28 European Union members.  With the United Kingdom not participating in the FTT, it would be very difficult for Ireland to participate.  As the Deputy knows, there are 30,000 people working in the financial services industry in Dublin.  If there were an FTT in Dublin that did not apply in the City of London, there would be a migration of business from Dublin to London without any doubt.</p><p>  The conversations among the participating members are now about taxing shares and certain derivatives.  We already have stamp duty of 1% on share transactions.  Therefore, in effect, we have a stronger FTT than any that is now being discussed among the ten participating members.  The United Kingdom is in a similar position.  It has 0.5% stamp duty on share transactions.  When I last talked to some colleagues about it, it was suggested that stamp duty of approximately 0.1% or 0.2% should apply to share transactions in Europe.  That was a French proposal, if I recall correctly.  I do not believe the position has moved very much beyond that.</p><p>  With all the talk, discussion and positioning, and with our having been regarded as not participating, it must be borne in mind that historically we have had a stronger FTT than what is envisaged by the ten participating members, with the exception that they intend to apply the share stamp duty-type levy to some derivatives also.  As yet, however, I do not have a specific list of what derivatives they have in mind.  Moreover, it is fair to say that Europe very often moves on the level of principle by introducing a measure at a very low level, and then it builds on it.  Some of the leading champions of an FTT might envisage introducing stamp duty on shares and derivatives at a very low level with a view to increasing it subsequently.  We will keep watching this.  If it suits us, we will join.  If it does not, we will not.  At present, it would not be in our interest, particularly for the Irish financial services industry, especially that in Dublin, which has 30,000 employees.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-04a.379" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/993" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="19:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014110400005#D00400"><p>My instinct would be to agree with the Minister but I must ask whether there is evidence to back up that assertion.  The Minister outlined what is clearly the Government's belief.  Has the potential impact of the FTT on Ireland been examined independently?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-04a.380" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="19:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014110400005#D00500"><p>It is the strong advice from the industry and those who promote Ireland, particularly Dublin, as a location for financial services industries.  These things move on very tight margins.  One should consider the proximity of London.  The Deputy is very well aware, because we discussed this previously, that for hundreds of years the United Kingdom and Ireland have had a single labour market.  Certainly since the Act of Union in 1800, we have had a single labour market.  Part of the settlement in 2002 was that the free travel arrangements, which only became part of the European Union more recently, were the norm between Ireland and Great Britain.  Therefore, the common labour market idea maintained.  There are obviously variations on that depending on the skill set of workers.  However, in the case of financial services, it is certainly one labour market.  For salary increases, people can move out of Dublin to London.  It is less than an hour by flight.  Mr. Willie Walsh was with me last week in a different context and told me six flights per day are being put on from Dublin Airport to London City Airport.  One can go into the City in approximately 50 minutes.  One can see the propensity for movement and the migration of industry.  The financial services industry, like many other modern industries, is very mobile and based principally on the ability of the workforce.  The key ingredient in financial services is the ability of the employees.  They do not really have a raw material.  It is a very mobile industry.</p><p>  For the sake of completeness, I must outline that the current stamp duty on shares results in a yield of &euro;250 million per annum.  An FTT of 0.1%, which is the latest that has been proposed, would actually result in a loss of revenue to the Exchequer.</p></speech>

This committee scrutinises ECOFIN meetings, but the two go together, and the Eurogroup meeting always precedes the ECOFIN meeting.  The Eurogroup meets on Thursday afternoon.  Greece will probably be the main item on the agenda.  The meeting may run late, depending on whether there is agreement.  The following morning, there is usually a series of meetings at which people meet within their party groups.  We, being in the European People's Party, meet at approximately 7.30 a.m., Brussels time.  The ECOFIN meeting is at 9 a.m.</p></speech>

As usual, however, there is a huge turnover of finance Ministers.  At the upcoming meeting, there will be many new finance Ministers I need to greet and introduce myself to so as to establish some kind of relationship.  One of the current difficulties, which I mentioned before, is that there are 18 Eurogroup countries.  I was a participant for three years last March and I am the second most senior Minister there now.</p> <p>I am on my seventh Greek finance Minister.  I am not making a joke.  I am just saying it is very hard to build working relationships when there is such a turnover of Ministers.  The other factor is that, because the political side keeps changing, the Commission gets stronger.  The Commission is made up of the permanent people there and they are the people with the experience and the continuing flow of information.  It is one of the concerns I have about the European bureaucracy.  It is the fault of the member states for not having greater longevity for the terms of office of their individual Ministers.  There seems to be a practice in Europe to move people very quickly from Governments.  It is not because they are fired; they have just moved on to another Ministry.  Two years would be considered quite a significant period in an individual Ministry.  Then it moves on.</p></speech>

I note that in the October meeting, ECOFIN discussed the issue around the bank, banking union and the bank recapitalisation.  Developing on what he has already discussed with Deputy McGrath, what are the Minister's thoughts on the process that would be involved in terms of Ireland getting to the point of making an application for retroactive recapitalisation - the process involved in the European context?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-04a.393" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="20:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014110400006#E00300"><p>The European Stability Mechanism, ESM is a new institution.  Its primary function is to act as a backstop to protect the euro currency in the event of another currency crisis across the Union.  In addition to that, as a result of discussions at Eurogroup and ECOFIN level, an additional set of powers was attached.  Those powers were to do with the recapitalisation of banks.  The European Stability Mechanism was empowered to recapitalise banks directly.  The significance of doing this directly is when the European funds recapitalised the Irish banks, it was done through the sovereign.  The money was assigned to the sovereign Government.  The same was true in Greece and Portugal.  What is in question here - the "directly" - is that a bank would be directly recapitalised.  Of course, the whole methodology of resolution has changed in Europe.  The policy has done a 360&deg; turn, or a 180&deg; turn, or whatever is the opposite point on the circle.</p></speech>

I wish to deal specifically with the Irish situation, our banks being in a sound position, and the possibility of retroactive recapitalisation.  If that were to become an option, what is the process the Minister sees developing in Europe?  Guidelines have been put in place for current recapitalisation but not retroactive recapitalisation. Were Ireland to consider making such an application, given views that have been expressed and the fact that Europe has not put in place a mechanism, that is, guidelines, in terms of retroactive recapitalisation, how does the Minister anticipate this evolving in order that Ireland can be in a position to consider making such an application?</p></speech>

In the interests of briefing the committee, I wish to give the context.  The policy has changed dramatically in Europe.  When the Irish, Portuguese and Greek banks got into trouble, the process was bail out, where taxpayers' money bailed out the banks.  Now it is bail in, where the assets of the banks are systematically rolled in on a waterfall - on a hierarchy - starting with shareholders and ending up with certain kinds of corporate depositors.  It is only beyond that that there is a resolution fund that gets rolled in, and it is beyond that again-----</p></speech>

I wish to move on to the issue of revision of VAT and gross national income, GNI, own resources balances from 1995 to 2013.  Will this particular proposal have an impact on Ireland's contribution to the EU budget?  What is the update on that?</p></speech>

I will read the briefing note to the Deputy.  I think that is the best thing to do.</p><p>  The UK has requested that this item be added to the ECOFIN agenda.  This follows Prime Minister Cameron's statement to Parliament that the UK will not pay a  &euro;2.1 billion balancing payment due on 1 December.  ECOFIN Ministers now have an opportunity to discuss this issue and any proposal the Presidency may bring.  A draft amending budget was tabled by the Commission on 17 October.  The main part of this proposal provides for an adjustment to member states' EU budget contributions on foot of the annual technical re-balancing payments in respect of macroeconomic VAT and custom duty revisions undertaken for all member states.  These re-balancing payments are called up automatically every year on 1 December in accordance with EU resource legislation.  The UK has expressed its objection to the perceived magnitude and short notice for the 2014 balancing payment.  It has requested the Commission to defer the formal request for the 1 December balancing payment and has asked it to investigate a possible phased payment approach.  Ireland's position is that all member states must abide by the budgetary rules which they have agreed.  In relation to this year's re-balancing exercise, we note this is a sensitive budgetary matter for certain countries, in particular the UK, particularly in relation to the timing as well as the magnitude of the proposed balancing statements.  While recognising that all member states are expected to abide by the budgetary rules in terms of addressing any major political issue, we will be constructive in working with colleagues to seek a pragmatic solution which can be accommodated within the own resources legal framework.</p><p>  What that means, in simple language, before I have conversations with the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. George Osborne, is that my position is that every country should pay the legal amount.  I do not think there is any necessity that it should be paid on 1 December.  I would be quite open to a discussion about later payments and phased payments if that meets the needs of participating countries.  In our own case, there was an adjustment for Ireland as well.  An extra &euro;6.5 million is required.  I intend that we will pay that by 1 December.</p></speech>

The additional amount in respect of Ireland is small enough and we will pay it on the date because we are familiar with the rules and their basis.

We were one of the first countries in Europe to do it and our bill is &euro;6.5 million, while that of the UK is &pound;1.7 billion or &euro;2 billion.  With regard to the UK's position, I noted what David Cameron stated, and I am sure as Prime Minister he chose his words very carefully.  He made a point about the time.  The Minister's suggestion is to compromise and allow an expanded timeframe for the UK to pay it, but pay it nonetheless.  Does the Minister see any attempt to open up how the calculation of European contributions are made with regard to gross national income, GNI?  Prime Minister Cameron has made this point and has suggested countries which do better than expected are penalised.  From the Minister's point of view and an Irish point of view, is this a debate he would like to see closed down?</p></speech>

I have had no contact from the British authorities on this issue.  It is Tuesday evening and we will be there on Friday.  I met George Osborne last Wednesday in Berlin and spoke to him for a little while.  He did not raise the issue with me.  I assume that on Thursday night or Friday morning we will have some level of contact.  The purpose of what we are doing here is briefing the committee and I want to brief it on the Irish position.</p><p>  I have another note which states the figures are based on the GNI calculations by member states and are based on an agreement reached after many years of discussion.  The process of calculation involved a negotiation but is now agreed.  It is also a matter of law.</p></speech>

My point is while the British stated they definitely would not pay it within the timeframe, they also opened a wider debate on how it is calculated.  I appreciate it was reached through negotiation.  The reason I ask is that I questioned the Minister previously on how our EU contributions are calculated and the fact that they are based on GNI.  I appreciate this is better than calculating them on GDP but a big issue is raised with regard to us making an additional contribution based on redomiciled plcs here.  In 2011, our contribution to European budget was &euro;45 million, in 2010 it was &euro;40 million and in 2009 it was &euro;15 million as a result of redomiciled plcs.  If the debate were opened up, we do not know where it would end.  Is the Irish position that the debate is settled in terms of how the calculation is done and we do not want to open it up, as Prime Minister Cameron has suggested it should be because it penalises those countries which are doing better?</p></speech>

I am relying on newspaper reports on the UK position.  They seem to state the first objection was to the amount.  It then seemed to move from this and timing was the issue, and then the issue was that the question of calculation might be opened.  I do not know whether this is background briefing or a policy position.  I do not want to comment on the UK position until I receive formal communication setting out its position.  The Irish position is we are being asked to pay an extra &euro;6.5 million.  In accordance with law, we are obliged to pay it.  We will obey the law and we will pay it.  We will not ask the Commission to reopen the method of calculation.  If it is raised as an issue, we will oppose reopening the method of calculation.</p></speech>

Obviously this is in a wider context.  Yesterday, Angela Merkel made a statement on Britain's demands on the free movement of persons and the referendum which will take place.  This is why it is not just a case of financial consideration.  There is also the implication of how the British people will vote in the referendum and the impact it will have on our own fortunes.  It will be interesting to watch how the negotiations progress.  Does the Minister expect a conclusion at ECOFIN on this matter?</p></speech>

I had a look at it today and growth forecast goes from 0.8% to 1.7% in 2016.  The trend is in the right direction.  It is positive.  Obviously one hopes it will be better.  The factors driving the Irish economy are fairly well known.  Ours is an export-led model and the UK and US are growing quite strongly.</p> <p>The US is at 3.5% while the UK is approaching 3% and they are big export markets for us.  As well as that, our position in the business cycle is that we are coming out of a very deep recession.  Spare capacity in an economy when that economy begins to grow is always a significant factor in growth.  If one has spare capacity, one does not have to pay extra to create capacity.  One has labour resources available, that is, people who want to go back to work.  One has liquidity sources seeking investment opportunities.  One also has underperforming industries that can expand.  We are in a lucky position at the moment in that there is a coincidence of events.  In terms of domestic policy, as the Deputy knows, we have dealt with the domestic economy sector by sector and in each budget-----</p></speech>

I just wanted to look at the figures because I know time will be against me here.</p><p>  I have raised the issue of retroactive recapitalisation umpteen times with the Minister and we will probably have the same debate about it now.  I was involved in negotiations at St. Andrews and have been on the fringes of other negotiations and I know how a lot of this works.  I know there are both informal and formal contacts.  As I listened to the Minister talk about side meetings and so forth, I was thinking about sending one's children to school.  One does not wait until 1 September to decide which school one's children will attend.  The application process opened today or will open within the next 48 hours, but it seems to me that the Minister is telling this committee that none of this work has begun yet.  No informal contact has begun and the Minister has not spoken to anyone to ask how this process would work.  It is not as if they were waiting on anything.  There is no new information available as a result of the doors opening today.  This reinforces my conviction that the Government has given up hope on this issue.  Can the Minister say anything to this committee to suggest there has been work ongoing to determine how this process will work?  Is there some type of documentation or analysis done within the Department so that if we get positive signals - the right type of wink and nod from our friends in Brussels - an application will be ready to be processed?  Is any of this happening or is this just a game of drag-this-out?</p></speech>

While there are legal provisions being put in place this week, the actual opening of the ESM for business is on 8 December.  It is only after that date that action can be taken.  Of course we are doing evaluation work, as we always do in the Department, but it is a matter of judgment on when and how to proceed.  As I have said to Deputy Doherty before, the situation is significantly different now from what it was in June of 2012.  Banks in Ireland now have a value.  After the stress tests, AIB is more valuable again and the shareholding the State has in Bank of Ireland is quite valuable.  One issue is that of value and the second issue is who we want to run the banks in Ireland.  Do we really want people who run a fund in Brussels-----</p></speech>

AIB would still have a board, however, which would run the bank.  I suggest the Minister's analogy, while it sounds very good, does not stack up in practice.  Perhaps the ESM would have more experience in running banks than the Minister would have or perhaps not, but that issue is not relevant.</p></speech>

That person was on national television recently.  The Minister should not try to throw such an accusation at me.  I am not trying scrape the bottom of the barrel here.  This is the reality.

That decline has been in both public and private investment, which is central to why we are seeing a continuation of the crisis and why it has been as deep as it is in this country in particular.  The wording of the statement from ECOFIN with regard to public investment suggests that ECOFIN is washing its hands of it.  It "shares the concern" about the decline in public investment.  The decline in public investment in Europe is significant and is happening at a time when public investment in other developed capitalist countries has generally increased as a percentage of GDP.  That is not an accident.  It is a policy choice.  It is a choice by the European Commission and by right-wing governments to pursue austerity policies which, by definition, include a decline in public investment.  More than that, it is written into law with the likes of the six-pack, the two-pack, the fiscal stability treaty and so forth.  Does the Minister agree that unless we move away from those policies of austerity, we are not going to be able to deal with the decline in public investment?  Instead of what is relatively small beer in terms of the European Investment Bank, what is needed is a significant European investment programme.</p></speech>

In terms of the big countries, namely, France and Italy, and particularly France which has a left-wing Government, they do not seem, so far, to be achieving the great heights that Deputy Murphy would like to see when left-wing people are in power.</p><p>  Be that as it may, to answer the Deputy's question, there is a task force examining the potential for investment.  It will report to the December meeting.  It was sparked by the declaration by the new President of the Commission, Mr. Juncker, that a &euro;300 billion fund should be invested across Europe, particularly in necessary infrastructure.  That is a significant sum and is the first amount of money that has been placed on the table officially by the Commission.  The President of the Heads of State and Government, the former Prime Minister of Poland, has put a figure of &euro;700 billion on the table.  I presume, therefore, the minimum is &euro;300 billion and whether it will work up from that will be a matter for the Heads of State and Government.  What needs to be done is to develop projects that will give a real rate of return.  I believe that part of the package of investment should also deal with structural failings and weaknesses in some of the European economies as well as some regulatory issues.  It should not just be a case of countries saying they have shovel-ready projects and then they are given a bundle of money to spend as they see fit.  The object of this key investment will be to get real growth going in some of the European economies where there is no growth at present.</p></speech>

Let me move on.  Private investment has also collapsed, more so in this country than elsewhere in Europe.  It comes at a time when there are large cash mountains in Europe created by major corporations.  There was an article recently in the <i>Financial Times</i>about a survey by Standard &amp;amp; Poor's saying that the top 2,000 listed corporations had a mountain of cash of &euro;4.5 trillion between them.  The problem in terms of private investment and big business is not access to cash.  It is a choice, based on profit, not to invest at this stage.  What does the Minister suggest to do about that?  Does it not point to a fundamental problem about private ownership of this wealth and the need for major public investment?</p></speech>

It would be nice if we acknowledged that we have the highest growth rates in Europe today, at 4.6% according to the Europeans.  We think they are higher than that ourselves.

In terms of the financial transaction tax, FTT, am I correct in quoting the Minister as saying the Government decided not to go along with it on strong advice from the industry?  Does that mean the Minister literally asked the IFSC and the Clearing House Group if they thought we should introduce the financial transaction tax, and they said "no", that it would be a bad idea?  Does the Minister think he could ask any industry, in this country or anywhere else, if they would like to pay more tax and if they thought that would be a good idea?  What answer does the Minister think he would get?  He did not apply a similar test to the water charges, by asking people if they would like to pay them, because the answer he would get would clearly be "no".  Further to the question Deputy McGrath asked, what is the basis in actual research upon which the Minister has decided the Government should not participate in the FTT, even if the UK is not participating?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-04a.475" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="20:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014110400009#H01600"><p>I always consult widely, and when foreign direct investment is concerned the starting point is the IDA.  We also consult other Departments that would have an interest.  The Clearing House Group would, of course, advise.  I also have my own views and I know how it works between Dublin and London.  I know the common labour market causes the migration of the essential ingredient of financial services, which is the experts who work in the industry.  There is no doubt at all that a financial transaction tax of magnitude, which applied in Dublin but not in London, would cause a loss in Dublin.  That is self-evident.  One does not need to consult very widely to know that.</p><p>  I have a note that might be of benefit to the Deputy to outline the other difficulties of financial transaction tax.  The ex-territorial impact of the tax could be a problem, as could the cascade effect, whereby one transaction can result in multiple charges.  Further potential problems include the costs incurred by member states not participating in a financial transaction tax in the administration of the FTT, and the possibility of relocation of activities to non-participating member states, which I have mentioned already in respect of the Dublin-London situation.  It might affect transactions in Government bonds, especially in the secondary market or repo market.</p><p>  Our concerns are widely shared among other member states.  We already have a stamp duty that is the equivalent of a financial transaction tax.  It should be remembered that there are 28 countries in the European Union, and only ten of them are currently contemplating an FTT.  They have been doing so for two years and I think they are as far away from agreement now as they were when they started because of the difficulties and the lack of common agreement on how it would affect individual countries.  It would be an idea that one could go with if it were done globally through the G20.  It might be acceptable if it were done right across the EU, but if it is done by a small group of countries to the detriment of others, then it is not a good idea and I am not going to participate.</p></speech>

In terms of the current stages of discussion, is the Minister aware of how they are discussing collecting it?  Are they talking about a central collection agency for the ten countries?</p><p>  The UK tried to take a legal challenge against enhanced co-operation being used for the FTT, and it was shot down by the European Court of Justice.  If the UK potentially considers a new legal challenge, what would be the Irish Government's attitude?  Would it consider participating alongside the UK in a legal challenge  against an FTT pursued by a minority of countries within the EU?</p></speech>

The countries that use enhanced co-operation to make an advancement in any area of policy where there is not unanimity are quite entitled to do so.  We will not get involved in a legal challenge which is fundamentally challenging their right to move forward in this way.  To get back to Deputy Murphy's original point on whether I think it will happen, it probably will happen as a minimalist issue at the end of the day.  As I said, a 0.1% stamp duty on share transactions and some derivatives falls short of what we have ourselves already.  I do not see any reason for joining in on that.</p></speech>

The proposals include a fund to combat climate change and a fund for subsidising poorer countries in the Third World, if it is acceptable to use that term.  A range of proposals have been made.  I would imagine that, in times of recession, the countries that collect would be likely to keep the FTT within their own exchequers.</p></speech>

There are a few things on which I would like to get the Minister's thoughts.  When we look at the agreed document, paragraph 11 is to do with the European Investment Bank, EIB, and potential projects, this task force that is being set up.  The chapter says that the Council "agrees with the need to focus on key sectors with EU-added value" to boost competitiveness and growth, noticeably in research and innovation, digital economy, energy and transport infrastructure, social infrastructure, environment and so on.</p> <p>I ask the Minister if, in real terms, opportunities are being explored for Ireland here?  Does he see new projects coming online because of this?  Is the Government exploring whether or not the circa &euro;15 billion that is needed for the water infrastructure might fall within this and whether this might be an additional source of funding for some serious infrastructural upgrades? </p></speech>

Investment is usually for infrastructure projects when it is done by governments.  One can divide infrastructure into social and economic infrastructure.  The European Investment Bank, EIB, is already very heavily involved in both.  For example, it is funding bundles of schools through a public private partnership, PPP.  It is funding the provision of Garda barracks and courthouses.  It is heavily involved in the funding of health centres.  All those are within the general parameters of social infrastructure.  It is also involved in the roads programme.  That is the key area of investment for European Investment Bank funds over the past few years.  If the Juncker proposal comes to fruition, which I hope it will, we will have quite a number of projects that could be activated.  We could immediately start asking the National Roads Authority to complete the roads programme because while much work was done in the provision of motorways throughout the country, the roads network is not yet completed.</p></speech>

Of course there will also be pan-European projects.  One of the major European projects which must be funded is a European energy network to match the roads network across Europe, because the dependency of Europe on outside sources of energy and the ineffectiveness of the distribution systems is one of the big weaknesses in the European economy.</p></speech>

For example, the proposal to solve Dublin's water problem by creating a giant reservoir somewhere west of Dublin, perhaps in the Bord na M&oacute;na properties west of Dublin, fed by a pipeline from the Shannon, is the kind of project that would be suitable under circumstances for European Investment Bank funding.  This proposal has frequently been discussed but has not been advanced very much and I do not know of any departmental work on that yet.</p></speech>

Could we as a committee write to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly and ask him about this, because this would be quite useful, if the Minister is unaware whether Deputy Kelly, his Department or Irish Water is pushing Irish Water projects.  It seems ECOFIN has opened the door to that.</p></speech>

It is also involved with PPPs as an extension to the public capital programme and is in contact with the other Departments, including the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Another issue that is worth investigating is the need for investment at the ports, if the model is export-led growth.  Certainly the four or five key ports require investment.  If one asks, apart from social infrastructure, what elements of infrastructure could bring extra growth to a country, the key areas are water, energy and the ports.  I would welcome the committee doing some work on that and making some proposals and we would take them seriously.  At the end of the day we all live in the same country.</p></speech>

It seems to accept that the bank is not working very well and this is referred to throughout the document.  Among other issues, the paragraph 10 discusses concrete measures to boost investment.  Specifically, it discusses the EIB and bottlenecks.  Does the Minister know of anything that might come out of this that might make it easier for Irish industry to access this money, through PPPs or other mechanisms?  Is there anything that the Irish Government has requested to be changed or improved to help funding in Ireland?</p></speech>

In 2014 it will be approximately &euro;600 million and I think it envisages it going up to &euro;800 million.  That is a very significant input.  It provided funds to both AIB and Bank of Ireland.  It was around &euro;250 million for SMEs but while the country lacked confidence there was a demand-side problem with investment and SMEs simply did not avail of the facilities.</p></speech>

The EIB is putting about &euro;400 million into the strategic investment bank fund, which we announced last Friday, and the fund available for 2015 is &euro;800 million.  We intend to carry that forward each year for five years so there would be a total of about &euro;4 billion available.</p></speech>

It has various programmes and we are accessing those programmes now more fruitfully than in the past.  It has projects, for example, where instead of the 50% matching requirement in city regeneration one can get up to 60% where a third-level college is being used as the driver and we are looking at the potential of that in certain cities as well.  I just want to give the figures.  EIB funding has steadily increased year-on-year since 2011.  Funding approvals in 2011 were &euro;525 million-----</p></speech>

I do not need another answer.  The question was whether there are any changes to the mechanisms as per what Ireland signed up to in October.</p><p>  If I could move on to the bank resolution contributions, the amount and the formula are under negotiations and it will be some formula that has a flat-rate contribution and then a risk-assessed contribution, which will be relative to the size of the banks.  On the basis that Ireland's banks are probably small by eurozone standards is there a risk that Irish banks will have to pay relatively more than their European counterparts because of this combination of a flat rate and a marginal rate?  Is there a risk that the Irish banks will pay more for no additional insurance by paying into the fund in the way this has been worked through?</p></speech>

A summary outcome of the discussion shows that member states were evenly divided and had an exchange of views on whether work on the long-running energy tax file should continue or whether the proposal should be withdrawn and reconsidered.  That is how the situation stands.  The proposal was originally presented in 2011.  Some elements continued to present problems for member states.  Trying to bring the EU climate and energy policies into line from a tax perspective is quite difficult.  We can provide a detailed note if the Deputy wants more information.</p></speech>

I have a final question, as I am being encouraged by the Chair to finish.  Regarding this week's ECOFIN meeting on the financial transactions tax, my understanding is that the tax would apply to high-frequency trading more than it would to low-frequency trading, for example, derivative markets.  I also understand from speaking with the financial services industry in Ireland, which is based chiefly in the IFSC, that they mainly handle low-frequency transactions.  They do not handle, for example, marginal trading, but fairly calm asset management and so forth.</p><p>  We have received strong briefings from the Department of Finance, but I do not share its view on this matter.  We are missing a codified, rather than seemingly anecdotal, analysis.  I am not saying that the Department's briefings were wrong, but I do not accept that it has got this matter right.  Perhaps it has.  Will the Department provide us with documentation that outlines a formal position and real numbers instead of just anecdotal evidence?  It is a ridiculous position.  If no analysis is possible without an agreement, one cannot take such a hostile position.  One cannot have it both ways and be opposed to something only to tell the Parliament when it asks for the analysis supporting that stance that none is possible because one does not know what will happen.</p></speech>

The position she outlined was an overtly hostile one.  In our back-and-forth discussions with the Department, it has asserted that, although it is strongly opposed to a financial transaction tax because it believes that many jobs will migrate to the City of London, it cannot support that view because it does not know what the proposal is.  One cannot hold both positions.</p><p>  Perhaps it is just a case of some scenario modelling.  We know the broad parameters.  Could the committee receive a codified analysis that went beyond anecdotes?  I am not saying that the Department is wrong, only that we have not been given the codified case for its position.  The Minister might consider whether one could be developed.</p></speech>

To be blunt, though, if the EU settled on a kind of stamp duty of 0.1%, it would make no difference to us beyond a reduction in our Exchequer flow from more than &euro;200 million to approximately &euro;25 million.  I would oppose it in that context not because it would damage us, but because it would remove some of our tax base.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-04a.524" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1107" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="20:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014110400011#K01800"><p>That brings me to the second part of this issue.  If what the Minister is saying is correct - I have no reason to believe that it is not - and for the same reason that he believes a damaging version of the tax is worth considering, is it also not worth considering that there may be a competitive advantage to be had?  The Minister's remarks illustrate my point perfectly, in that a particular version of the tax could benefit financial services in Ireland whereas a different version could disadvantage it, leading to a migration of jobs from the IFSC to the City of London.  In this light, could the Minister ask the Department to engage in scenario modelling for us to review?</p></speech>

The only other country that has such a tax is the UK at 0.5%.  The French have been pushing to introduce it at 0.1% and are participating in the financial transaction tax talks.  However, the proposals are going nowhere at the moment.  This is the position.</p></speech>

Could we see a codified analysis of the types of tax that would benefit and adversely affect Ireland?</p></speech>

Before we begin, I ask members, witnesses and persons in the Visitors Gallery to ensure their mobile telephones are switched off for the duration of the meeting as they cause interference, even in silent mode, with the recording equipment.  This is particularly important today as the meeting is being streamed live.</p><p>  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person or body outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p> <p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they will be entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br/>We have the privilege of having the Nigerian ambassador to Ireland, Ambassador Ketebu in attendance to make a presentation to us.  She is accompanied by Mr. Umar Ahmed Abba.  They are both very welcome.  This is the ambassador's first visit to the committee and we look forward to her dissertation.  Ireland has long-established and strong links with Nigeria, and we hope to build on those at this meeting.  We will concentrate specifically on the Ebola outbreak, trade between Ireland and Nigeria and an update on Boko Haram.The format for the meeting is that the ambassador will make an opening statement followed by questions from the members of the joint committee.  The normal procedure is that we hear our guest's submission first, members then have an opportunity to raise questions and our guest then has an opportunity to reply.  The ambassador has the floor.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-04a.571" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H. E. Dr. Bolere Elizabeth Ketebu" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014110400003#B00200"><p>Thank you.  I wish to observe the protocol of this meeting and to express my appreciation for the honour and privilege given to me by the Chairman and members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade to brief the committee on recent developments in Nigeria, bordering on the activities of Boko Haram insurgents, the outbreak of Ebola and trade between Nigeria and Ireland.  This briefing session, organised by the committee, demonstrates clearly the concern of the Government and people of Ireland with regard to these challenges confronting Nigeria and it presents an opportunity for me to thank the numerous individuals, groups, associations and institutions in Ireland who have sent letters to the embassy condemning the activities of Boko Haram insurgents, especially the abduction of more than 270 schoolgirls in Chibok in Borno state and the indiscriminate killing of innocent people in the north east and central part of Nigeria.</p><p>  The terrorist group Boko Haram is also known as Jama-atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati wal-Jihad, which means "people committed to the propagation of Prophet Muhammad's teachings and Jihad".  This sect in Nigeria claims to be propagating Islam.  The group prohibits and seeks to destroy educational institutions specifically and it is also strongly opposed to all democratic ideals and principles.</p><p>  As the members may be aware Boko Haram has within the past three years widened its campaign by launching vicious attacks against defenceless and innocent citizens, schools, government buildings, places of worship, villages, towns and marketplaces, resulting in the killing and maiming of hundreds, including the abduction of more than 200 Chibok girls.  It has also displaced thousands of families, particularly in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa states in north-eastern Nigeria.  This terrorist group has succeeded in disrupting social life and has crippled economic activities in these areas.  Regrettably, the sect has refused to date to release the schoolgirls abducted in Chibok, but some of the girls have managed to escape and have since returned home.  The others still remain in captivity, however, despite all the efforts that have been made by the Nigerian Government to secure their release.  Those efforts are now being complemented by technical and other support from the international community.</p> <p>It is pertinent to note members of Boko Haram are known to be hiding in the Sambisa forest, which is a vast mountainous area.  The Nigerian armed forces do not wish to launch an all-out military attack on the sect in this location so as not to endanger the lives of the abducted girls.  Nevertheless, the federal government has continued to pursue a multi-track approach to the crisis, including negotiation and collaboration with neighbouring countries, namely, Chad, Cameroon, Niger and the Republic of Benin.</p><p> On 13 October 2014 the foreign and defence Ministers of the member states of the Lake Chad Basin Commission, including Chad, Cameroon, Niger and Nigeria, met in Abuja to assess the security situation in the area.  They prepared a common resolution for the attention of the United Nations Security Council and the African Union to facilitate the establishment of a legal framework for full-scale military operations against Boko Haram.  The Ministers also agreed to share intelligence in the battle against insurgency and underscored the need for greater co-operation and collaboration among governments in the region to reinforce operational and intelligence capabilities.  Member states further resolved to intensify efforts to co-ordinate the work of the multinational joint task force in the Lake Chad basin and welcomed pledges by member states and the Republic of Benin to deploy troops along common borders.  This deployment will enhance security and facilitate the interception of weapons being trafficked in the region.  Rather than intimidating the Nigerian government, terrorist acts will only help strengthen its resolve to develop appropriate national strategies and collaborate even more closely with the international community in the fight against this menace.</p><p> The outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever started in Guinea in March 2014.  Subsequently, the outbreak spread to Liberia and Sierra Leone.  More than 9,000 people have become infected in the pandemic and more than 4,500 people have died in the three countries.  The number of infections is still increasing every month according to the world health organisation.  Nigeria became the fourth west African country involved in the Ebola outbreak when a dual US-Liberian citizen, Patrick Sawyer, who was infected with Ebola arrived in Lagos after flying from Liberia via Togo on 20 July 2014.  He died five days later, and eight people who came into direct contact with him were later diagnosed with Ebola.  In total eight people died from the infection in Nigeria, including two medical doctors and a nurse, out of 20 confirmed Ebola cases.</p><p> On 8 August 2014 the World Health Organisation declared Ebola in west Africa a public health emergency of international concern.  Following this declaration the Nigerian President, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, declared the outbreak of Ebola a national emergency in Nigeria and approved more than US$11 million to help contain it.  The President further called on Nigerians to report any suspected Ebola cases to the nearest medical authorities.  The public was further urged not to spread false information about Ebola which could lead to mass hysteria.  In an effort to contain the spread of the Ebola virus, port health services in Nigeria began a contact tracing process to limit the spread of the disease and created an emergency operations centre to co-ordinate and oversee the national response.</p> <p>The group worked with the airport and airlines to trace potential cases and decontaminated the airport as well as areas inhabited by people who might have come into contact with the virus.  Entry and exit screening was also established at ports in Nigeria.</p><p> Health officials used a variety of resources, including telephone records and flight manifests, to track down almost 900 persons who might have been exposed to the virus via Sawyer or the people with whom he had contact.  That group was monitored for symptoms for 21 days, with those under observation required to check in with health officials twice daily to provide health updates.  As soon as people developed symptoms suggestive of Ebola, they were isolated in Ebola treatment facilities.  Without waiting to see whether a suspected case tested positive, Nigeria's contact tracing team tracked down virtually everyone who had had contact with the patient since the onset of symptoms.  During this contact tracing process, officials made a staggering 18,500 face-to-face visits.  Aside from the contact tracing, Nigeria ensured a highly organised, methodical and informed response to the outbreak.  This was crucial.  Officials who were part of the emergency operations centre had resources with which to work and some had experience containing other viral diseases, like polio.</p><p> All 19 confirmed cases were traced back to Sawyer and no cases have arisen since, marking a successful containment of the virus.  Since 8 September 2014, Nigeria has not recorded a single case of Ebola.  After the mandatory 42 days - two incubation periods of the disease - without any reported infection, health authorities there issued a statement to the effect that the country was free from the deadly virus.  On 20 October, the World Health Organization, WHO, officially declared Nigeria free of Ebola infections, describing the outcome the triumphant result of "world-class epidemiological detective work".</p><p> Now that the WHO has certified Nigeria as Ebola free, our Government has urged the international community not to discriminate and stigmatise Nigerians abroad over the Ebola virus pandemic, as there is no justifiable basis for doing so.  The Nigerian Government has given an assurance that the country will remain fully vigilant to prevent the re-entry of the virus and will co-operate fully with other concerned nations to stop its spread in west Africa in particular.</p><p> Trade between Ireland and Nigeria has increased in recent years as new partnerships in various areas, including construction, information technology, consultancy services and a host of others, have been established between Irish and Nigerian businesses.  This development is being facilitated by the embassy in collaboration with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  As members are aware, the fourth Africa-Ireland Economic Forum, AIEF, concluded on 30 October.  It was a major success and Nigeria had a large delegation of participants, representing an increase of more than 400% since last year.  They found suitable business partners in Ireland and we hope to see further ties.</p><p> The embassy also organised an Invest Nigeria event at the Radisson Blu Royal Hotel on 31 October 2014 to facilitate the establishment of business partnerships and promote trade between Ireland and Nigeria.</p> <p>The turnout from both sides was impressive.  The embassy hopes to build on this modest achievement to further deepen ties between Ireland and Nigeria in terms of business relations.  Trade between the two countries could be further enhanced by enabling visa policies and direct links.</p><p> As I conclude my statement, I again express my appreciation for the support and solidarity Nigeria continues to enjoy from the Government and people of Ireland.  I am sure the Federal Government of Nigeria will continue to strive to effectively contain the Boko Haram insurgency, secure the release of the schoolgirls and continue to assist our neighbours in containing the spread of the Ebola virus disease.</p></speech>

I grew up in a rural community.  Of all the countries in Africa, we would have been more aware of Nigeria because of the history of missionaries travelling to Nigeria from my county of Cavan.  There is a long friendship between our countries.</p><p>  The ambassador has understandably painted a very grim picture of the terrible suffering and terror imposed by the Boko Haram group on defenceless and innocent people.  It is an issue that colleagues in Seanad &Eacute;ireann have raised and we have discussed it in this committee.  I and other colleagues have raised the issue in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, expressing our concern.  The ambassador used the term "defenceless people" about the abduction of schoolgirls and the holding of those young innocent people in captivity.  It is a desperate situation.</p><p>  The ambassador said that the efforts of her Government are complemented by technical support from the international community.  Can the international community do anything more to assist in bringing this terrible suffering to an end?  Can we, as a Parliament and as a concerned country, do anything further on the international stage to highlight to an even greater extent the terrible suffering inflicted on so many innocent people?</p><p>  The ambassador also referred to the trafficking of weapons, presumably from neighbouring countries.  I ask her to elaborate on that.  She also mentioned that she is seeking the preparation of a common resolution for the attention of the United Nations Security Council.  What does she hope to achieve if the preparation of such a resolution was successful?</p><p>  The Ebola virus outbreak is of major concern to the entire global community.  The ambassador's figures differ slightly from the figures in the briefing given by the Department.  I am not criticising either; it just shows the difficulty in compiling an accurate and up-to-date assessment of the number of people who have been afflicted by this virus.  Speaking about two weeks ago a senior official in the World Health Organization stated that the virus - the disease - was winning the game.  If substantial progress was not made within the following six weeks, which would be up to the end of November, he painted a very grim picture of how the disease would spread even more quickly throughout the world.  We all welcome that Nigeria has been declared free of the Ebola virus.  What does the international community need to do to assist in the efforts to contain the virus in west Africa and elsewhere?</p></speech>

I hope she has a pleasant experience in Ireland.  She will have plenty of her fellow nationals to engage with given that about 40,000 Nigerians live in Ireland, an issue to which I will return.  I congratulate her on her appointment.  Having read her profile, I recognise she is no mean person to deal with.  As she has been a parliamentarian, she will know a lot about how we are going to engage.  After the warm welcome, I will get down to the nitty-gritty.</p><p>  We received presentations from a number of the NGOs, including M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, on the Ebola issue.  Some of us visited Sierra Leone prior to the Ebola outbreak.  We understand how weak the state apparatus, relating to hospitals, nurses, doctors and medical facilities, in Sierra Leone was, as it was a post-war country.  Leaving that aside, given that the virus as identified in Nigeria was the very same virus that was spreading in Sierra Leone, I was very dismissive of the statement at the time and my concern was how it would travel within Nigeria.  I congratulate Nigeria on having achieved the World Health Organization status of being free of the Ebola virus.</p><p>  The reason I was sceptical of the figures coming from Nigeria was that we had the scenario of these 300 girls and boys, and everybody being slaughtered in and around an area, with no apparent sign of these children being rescued.  The logic of that was that if the Nigerian establishment - military, police and security forces - cannot locate all these people and there is such a war-driven climate in northern Nigeria, how could it possibly control the Ebola virus if it had broken out in that region?  I congratulate Nigeria; it did a wonderful job on the Ebola virus issue.</p><p>  I have considerable interaction with the new communities - the new arrivals to our country.  We are very happy to have given Irish citizenship to 60,000 non-Irish from 120 countries.  There are 40,000 Nigerians in Ireland, many of whom came initially as "asylum seekers".  As a representative of the Nigerian Government, does the ambassador see any reason that any Nigerian man, woman or child should seek asylum from Nigeria in Ireland today?  Many of the 40,000 Nigerians here are becoming very respected and welcomed into the Irish citizenship role.  As there are 406 Irish people in Nigeria, the ambassador can see the comparison.</p><p>  I argued with the ambassador's predecessor on this point.  Forty years ago I was in Kano near the border with Niger and in Maiduguri near Cameroon.  I know the area, but not very well given that it was so long ago.  Does the ambassador see any blame being attached to successive Nigerian governments?  With an income of $50 billion per annum in oil revenue, it would be alleged that the distribution of this wealth has been unequal and that the north of Nigeria has been sadly neglected.  The huge rates of unemployment among young people are leading to the attraction of Boko Haram or whatever to escape into a different lifestyle.</p><p>  Nigeria is very successful.  We spoke recently at the Africa forum so we are enthusiastic about doing business with the foremost country in Africa at this stage with 5.5% annual growth, which is phenomenal.  There are arguments that corruption in Nigeria is militating against successful business deals being done.  I draw attention to recent newspaper reports of corrupt practices in the oil company, Afren plc.</p> <p>Is the ambassador in a position provide assurances that steps have been taken to address these issues of corruption?  The fact that expatriates travelling to Nigeria to work in the oilfields are being afforded protection by armed security personnel indicates they may be vulnerable to the criminal act of kidnapping.  Will the ambassador provide her opinion on that matter?</p><p> There are mixed messages in the media with regard to the President of Nigeria and his wife.  When the children were kidnapped by Boko Haram, a number of delegations travelled to meet the President.  Apparently, his wife was very dismissive of some of the women who were members of those delegations on the grounds that they were not the mothers of the children in question and this resulted in negative publicity.  There have also been disturbing reports that Nigerian troops operating in the north of the country are ill-disciplined.  It is alleged that some have run away from the conflict with Boko Haram, while other reports indicate these troops are engaging in massive human rights abuses in the region.  Will the ambassador indicate whether she believes these reports to be true or whether they are a form of propaganda on the part of the western media?  I congratulate Nigeria on the role it is playing in Africa, particularly in the context of providing troops for African Union peacekeeping missions in areas of conflict.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-04a.579" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1136" speakername="David Norris" time="12:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014110400008#G00200"><p>I welcome the ambassador, Dr. Ketebu.  Through her, I wish to extend my congratulations to Nigeria on the very effective way it has fought against the spread of the Ebola virus.  I note that, like me, she is a member of the Anglican Church.  I am a regular attendee at St. Patrick's Cathedral and a former member of its board and synod.  I am not sure what a Knight of the Anglican Church is but I congratulate her on holding that position.</p><p>  Many of the questions I wanted to ask have been posed by my colleagues.  I will, therefore, concentrate on a particular issue about which I am greatly disturbed and which is also a matter of some concern to the international community, namely, the treatment of gay people in Nigeria and the introduction of a number of recent laws.  The Associated Press published a report on 5 January 2014 in which it was stated: "First the police targeted the gay men, then tortured them into naming dozens of others who now are being hunted down, human rights activists said Tuesday, warning that such persecution will rise under a new Nigerian law."  Other reports indicate that a man received 20 lashes in a northern Nigerian sharia court after being convicted of committing a homosexual act.  In the context of the Bill passed by the Nigerian Parliament and recently signed into law by President Goodluck Jonathan, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is on record as stating, "Rarely have I seen a piece of legislation that in so few paragraphs directly violates so many basic, universal human rights".  Will the ambassador comment on the mistreatment of gay people throughout Africa and on the completely incorrect contention that homosexuality is a western vice?  It is, in fact, the intervention in respect of it that is western.  I refer here to the British colonial laws, namely, the relevant Acts of 1861 and 1885, and the intervention of certain American evangelical churches which are using this as an instrument to become involved in political life in Nigeria.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-04a.580" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1118" speakername="Michael Mullins" time="12:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014110400008#G00300"><p>I also welcome the ambassador and her colleague.  I wish the ambassador well in her challenging assignment in Dublin.  I have no doubt her presence here will strengthen the relationship between Ireland and Nigeria, especially in the context of our economic links.  I hope we can assist her country in many ways into the future.  I welcome the update the ambassador provided on her country's successful fight against Ebola and I acknowledge the recognition it has received from the World Health Organization in respect of the good work being done in this regard.  I hope Nigeria succeeds in keeping Ebola outside of its borders.</p> <p> With regard to the awful situation of the children abducted by Boko Haram, during the course of the ambassador's presentation she stated that a number of the children have managed to escape.  How many of the 270 children abducted have managed to escape?  I ask her to estimate or indicate the numerical strength of the Boko Haram insurgents.</p><p> I support much of what Senator Norris said about the human rights violations and in particular the Nigerian Government's attitude to homosexuals.  I would be very concerned about the signing of the Same Sex Marriage (Prohibition) Act 2013.  The issue of same sex marriage is a live issue in our own country and many people would have grave concerns about the passing of the legislation which prescribes penalties of ten to 14 years in prison for people who are caught in gay relationships.  This is particularly regrettable.  I refer to other issues such as the death penalty and the use of torture and evictions.  This follows on from what Deputy Eric Byrne said about the number of the ambassador's fellow countrymen who have arrived in this country claiming refugee status.  </p><p> Deputy Byrne referred to Nigeria's economic difficulties and that &euro;50 billion is earned annually from oil.  Agriculture was traditionally the backbone of the Nigerian economy and I know that sector has been in serious decline for many years.  I understand that the President of Nigeria has a programme to modernise agriculture.  I ask the ambassador to give the committee a flavour of this programme.  The supply of electricity is another major issue for the country.  We are dealing with some issues in this country with regard to alternative forms of energy in parts of the country where we need to boost our electricity supply.  I am interested to hear what is being done in Nigeria to improve the generation of electricity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-04a.582" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H. E. Dr. Bolere Elizabeth Ketebu" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014110400009#H00200"><p>Let me start with what I think Ireland can do to assist in the fight against Boko Haram.  I believe that Ireland has a lot to offer in the area of technical assistance, in particular, to the military agencies and to the joint regional task force team.  The Sambisa forest where Boko Haram has been identified as preying from is a forest line that cuts across the countries in that area such as, Chad, Benin Republic and Niger.  Ireland could help by building capacity in intelligence gathering and in strategy in order to fight Boko Haram insurgents.</p><p>  I suggest that Ireland could provide material and military assistance, maybe some weapons or other military equipment to fight insurgency, based on the history and the known capacity of Ireland.  The regional team could benefit significantly from such assistance.  Today the problem is in Nigeria and before it was in Chad and who knows where it will spread to, considering that ISIS is moving from country to country.  The provision of assistance on a regional basis would be very helpful. </p> <p> If the UN resolution goes through with the UN Security Council it will bring into the fold more countries along the axis which may be giving immediate and remote assistance to Boko Haram insurgents.  As we have seen, this group has succeeded in indoctrinating young people.  Most of its evil activities, especially the bomb explosions, are carried out by suicide bombers.  No rational thinking young person can afford to get himself or herself involved in suicide bombing in public places.  They bomb mosques, churches, markets, schools and motor parks.  Their target is not any particular group of persons or religion.  In the mosques there are Muslims, in the churches there are Christians, in the markets there are both Muslims and Christians, young and old.  It is difficult to identify the ideology the group is pursuing short of saying that based on what one can see physically, without knowing what their motivation is, it looks like it is a political tool, knowing that this group abhors all forms of democratic principles.  Bringing the UN resolutions through can bring more countries into the fold, to pool their resources in terms of technical assistance and material support to enable us to contain the Boko Haram insurgency.</p><p> On the issue of international community efforts to contain Ebola and that the figures we have given are not consistent with other figures, according to Nigeria&rsquo;s medical records we have had 20 cases and have lost seven people.  This is on record.  Whether the figures tally or not, the important point is that Nigeria is Ebola-free and this has been confirmed by the WHO.  The strategy that was put in place obviously worked well for a country as large as Nigeria to have been able to contain the Ebola epidemic within such a short time.  Although the doctors who had the primary contact with the patients paid the supreme price, it was a price that was worth all the effort and attention.</p><p> Many Nigerian asylum seekers would have come at different stages and from various places and every case should be treated on its merits.  We do not know who they are and there are particular religious and socio-cultural situations in a country as large as Nigeria.  No single strategy can be applied to all Nigerians because they come from different places.  For example, those who come from specific states in the north eastern part of Nigeria no longer have a homeland.</p><p> Regarding unequal distribution of Nigerian resources between the north and the south, before the Boko Haram insurgency we had the Niger Delta crisis, when the Niger Delta states asked for resource control.  Now that we have issues in the north, the first strategy the Government applied was to build almajiri schools.  The almajiris are young men in particular of Muslim faith who are sent to live with Islamic leaders or clerics for training, leaving their families and parents.</p> <p>Over time, they have built a critical mass of young male children who have no exposure to western education.  They are always in motion, never settled in one place.</p><p> The Government introduced almajiri schools to enable these young children and men to acquire western education and skills.  In addition, during this period, there are other programmes, especially in agriculture, that have been instituted in these north eastern states to address the issue of the mass population of young unemployed people.  These are long-term strategies, and to contain the immediate problem of the violence instituted by Boko Haram, the military task force has been deployed.  It has nothing to do with unequal distribution of wealth because wealth distribution in Nigeria is tied to resource production, population and other diverse parameters.  Boko Haram and the insurgents in the north have not alluded to the fact that wealth is not equally distributed to them.  The problem is that Boko Haram abhors western education and any form of democracy.  It has nothing to do with wealth distribution.</p><p> On corruption, we already have an agency, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC.  All the Government can do is establish and strengthen the anti-corruption institutions which enable legislation.  People involved in fraudulent economic acts, be they foreigners or Nigerians, will find the laws and institutions are there.  There is no gainsaying the fact that the EFCC has been trying and convicting people, Nigerians and foreigners.  There is no better assurance that this.  People who come to do business or work in Nigeria should take the opportunity to go through the laws and know that once they are caught, foreigners receive no preferential treatment.  The laws are there.</p><p> Regarding Nigerian troops being disciplined and not achieving results, these Nigerian troops are also doing very well in peace-keeping activities for the Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS, and the African Union, AU.  This means the Nigerian troops, as a bunch, are very effective and successful.  If one or two people in that bunch are caught in acts of indiscipline or acts that are unmilitary according to the ethics of their service, there are laws to take care of them.  Since the action against the Boko Haram insurgency, the military has been trying some of its own people.  It court martials some and prosecutes and convicts others.  As a team, the Nigerian military has continued to prove itself to be worthy military ambassadors of Nigeria in ECOWAS, AU and within the country.  It may not be fair to judge the whole Nigerian military based on the acts of a few.  Such incidents happen everywhere.</p> <p>All they need to do is to identify the culprits and make them face the full wrath of the law.</p><p> On the issue of gay people, the current law in Nigeria is against gay marriages and gay activities.  Our country has its own peculiar religious and cultural beliefs and rites.  That is what makes us Nigerian and that is the current law.  For those who wish to practise their gay habits it is in their own interests to practise where there is no law against gay people.  However, the law as it stands today in Nigeria is a reflection of our own peculiar religious and cultural conditions and situations.</p><p> We do not have concrete figures on the numerical strength of Boko Haram for the reason that one Boko Haram insurgent who has volunteered to be a suicide bomber can cause as much havoc as more than 100 or 200 troops.  In other words, whether they are many or few, we have not yet seen a massive troop of Boko Haram persons causing havoc or moving but one sees the effect on more than thousands of persons created by just one insane Boko Haram insurgent who in order to commit havoc has strictly targeted public places where people gather.  At present we do not have an accurate estimate of the numerical strength of Boko Haram, based on the fact that they are operating from a forest that crosses more than five or six countries in west Africa, along the Chad Basin axis.</p><p> In terms of modernisation in agriculture, for the first time the Government has introduced information technology in the management of the distribution of implements, chemicals and materials used in farming.  Nigerian farmers today use solar-powered mobile phones by which means they receive alerts on current international market values for export products such as cocoa seeds and cashew nuts.  They receive alerts on the distribution of fertilisers in Nigeria.  In the past they had to take their products to the middle men and women to reach the international market.  Because they did not have access to the prevailing prices in the international market the farmers relied solely on what the middle men or women told them.  </p><p> The fertiliser supplies used to go through three or four hands resulting in unrealistic price mark-up.  For example, with regard to the distribution of cassava seedlings, the use of biotechnology has resulted in cassava seedlings or stems that are pest-resistant to specific pests.  Through the use of mobile phones, ICT and biotechnology, farmers can access the latest information on the current market value for their products and the availability of whatever materials or products they are looking for.</p> <p>I think there is a huge opportunity for Irish and Nigerian trade relations in the area of agriculture to develop.  My concern relates to the dairy market in Ireland.  As a result of the fact that there are no direct air links between Ireland and Nigeria, dairy products have to be transported through various points before reaching their final destination.  In terms of cargo, Nigeria receives agricultural products - flour, etc. - direct from South Africa on a daily basis.  These products arrive fresh for distribution.  This happens because there are direct air links.  It cannot happen where produce is transported through airports in other countries and is delayed en route.  There is a need to move agricultural products within the shortest possible timeframe in order to maintain their nutritional value and viability.  That is why I referred to the necessity for direct air links.  We stand to benefit a great deal from such links.  As a result of the summit that was held, local governments in my country now wish to send some of their citizens to Ireland on farm attachments of durations of perhaps two weeks, one month or three months.  When these people return home, they could then establish farms and would have working relationships or partnerships with their counterparts in Ireland.  In terms of modernisation, this would benefit us a great deal.</p><p> Last but not least, I come to the matter of electricity.  The Government of Nigeria recognises that the country cannot meet all of its own energy needs.  As a result, it privatised power generation in the past month or two.  It is now proceeding to privatise power transmission.  There are international partnerships in the area of power generation and we are looking at establishing such partnerships in respect of transmission and distribution.  We believe that with our public private partnership strategy in these areas, Nigeria will meet the challenges relating to energy in the near future.</p></speech>

If different entities are involved, then it can work very well.  If the same people gain control of generation and transmission systems, however, it can give rise to problems.</p><p>  The ambassador made a number of interesting comments in respect of Boko Haram.  I am of the view that Nigeria will eventually come to grips with this problem, particularly as what is happening will reflect badly on its human rights record.  We fully recognise the degree to which some elements relating to this issue may fall outside the control of the Government of Nigeria.  However, as Members of Parliament, we have all have dealt with refugees from Nigeria and many other locations across the globe.  I am sympathetic to the plight of these people, particularly those gay and lesbian individuals who have been forced to leave their home countries.</p> <p>They are sometimes asked why they left.  I would have thought the answer was obvious - when they could not guarantee their own safety.  I cannot understand how people question that.</p><p> Boko Haram's attitude to women and girls is particularly tragic.   Dr. Ketebu recognises that.  It is an issue that requires ongoing action and attention, not only from the Government in Nigeria but those of other countries too, for various reasons.  The fact one group in society sees it as its policy to ensure half the population - because 50% at least are women - should be refused education or have their education curtailed and be deemed to be part and parcel of a war trophy is particularly reprehensible.  The witnesses know that and are trying to do something about it.  It may be difficult but this needs to be dealt with.  Otherwise, in years to come, people will ask why no one did anything about it.</p><p> I thank Dr. Ketebu and Mr. Abba for coming before the committee today.  Their presentation was very interesting.  We will use it to give general information to our people and we hope it has been of some benefit to the witnesses too.</p></speech>

The committee will convey our sympathy to Deputy Fitzpatrick on his sad loss.  Deputy Troy has also sent his apologies that he is unable to attend the meeting.<br/>I remind members, witnesses and people in the Visitors Gallery to ensure their mobile telephones are switched off for the duration of the meeting as they interfere with the broadcasting of the proceedings.<br/>This meeting will hear an update on child protection services and the child care law reporting project.  Child protection and child care present a range of complex issues and it is important that this committee on health and children focuses on these issues as a matter of public interest.  The Child Care Law Reporting Project is an independent project to report on child care proceedings, to provide information on the operation of the Irish child care system and to promote transparency and accountability.  Dr. Carol Coulter's interim report was published last week and has been circulated to members of the committee.  This meeting is an important opportunity for us to receive an update on the project and to discuss the implementation of child care policy with a number of leading experts in the field.  In this regard, I welcome three eminent experts on child protection, Dr. Carol Coulter, director of the Child Care Law Reporting Project, Dr. Helen Buckley, associate professor at the School of Social Work and Social Policy in Trinity College Dublin, and Ms Ceili O'Callaghan, guardian <i>ad litem</i>and independent child protection consultant, and thank them for attending the meeting this evening.</p> <p> I apologise as I have a meeting to attend at 6.30 p.m.  With the committee's permission, I will ask Deputy Regina Doherty to take the Chair as the Vice Chairman is unavailable.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> I advise the witnesses that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and witnesses are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> I invite Dr. Carol Coulter to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>

I have been director of the Child Care Law Reporting Project since it was established in 2012.  We attend child care proceedings in court, namely the District Court, and then prepare them for publication on the website.  In a sense, this is the reporting aspect, or the public accountability and transparency aspect, of our work.  In addition, we collect data on the cases.  These are analysed and published in annual reports.  There have been two interim reports so far and there will be a third drawing together the data over three years.  I have full copies of the interim reports for every member.  They are also available on the website.<br/>We do not seek information from sources beyond the court proceedings.  A lot goes on at the social worker level, which my colleagues will speak about, and we provide a bird's eye or worm's eye of what happens when the process reaches the court.  We have 179 case reports on the website.  They range from very lengthy and complex cases, where sex abuse or non-accidental injury to a child is alleged, to much more mundane - perhaps that is not the right word - cases that involve the neglect of a child or children.<br/>It is a combination of circumstances that leads to the family coming before the courts.  We collect data not only in these cases, on which we report, but also on those that are mentioned perhaps rather briefly or cases many of whose details resemble those of other cases.  In the latter case, we do not feel it is necessary to publish the whole thing.  However, we fill in forms that allow us to collect data on families, proceedings, whether families are legally represented, the numbers and ages of the children, whether they have special needs, and the kind of care they are going into.  That forms the statistical part of the interim report, which the members have.  Those who wish to look a little more deeply into this will look at the evidence in the case reports, how it is contested, the role of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>, the intervention of the judge and what the judges might say during the case, in addition to the judge's decision.<br/>Our findings so far have shown up a number of problems with the existing system, including wide variations in the amount and quality of the support given to vulnerable families before court proceedings are initiated.  There is a lack of timely access to and co-ordination between the various services that vulnerable families need.  For example, people can fall between the cracks of the HSE's child and family service, now Tusla, or the Child and Family Agency, and the Department of Education and Skills when trying to gain access to various kinds of supports.  There are variations around the country in the thresholds regarding which orders are sought by the HSE and also granted by judges.  Some judges are much more ready to grant an order that is sought while others will interrogate it much more carefully.<br/>There are different types of orders used in different areas and there are different standards in the evidence presented to court.  Particularly outside Dublin, there is a problem owing to insufficient time being devoted to cases, and that can lead to frequent adjournments if the cases are very contested.  There are cases spread out over many months and repeated renewals of interim care orders while the family is being investigated.  That leads to a worsening of relations between families and the Child and Family Agency.  My colleague Ms Ceili O'Callaghan will be able to elaborate on that in more detail.  What I describe can lead to the whole process becoming extremely adversarial and stressful for everybody.<br/>The main reason the Child and Family Agency seeks an order is neglect of the child.  That can be linked to problems the parents have.  The overwhelming problem, which is the one that is most common, is poverty.  It is important that this be recognised at the outset.  Poverty on its own, however, does not lead to families having to face child care proceedings.  Very often, there might be a cognitive or mental disability on the part of the parent, or drug or alcohol abuse.  Social isolation is very often a feature of families who are vulnerable in this way.  Approximately 70% of the parents are single parents parenting alone.  Some 10% or so are cohabiting and only 11% involved married families.  With regard to the remaining 10%, parents were missing completely in that children had been trafficked or otherwise, or they just did not feature in the proceedings at all.<br/>We found disproportionate numbers of parents from ethnic minorities, including Travellers.  We know from international research that people from ethnic minorities tend to be over-represented among the poor and marginalised in various ways.  It should not come as such a surprise but it certainly poses challenges for the child care system that I am not sure we have sufficiently paid attention to as a country.<br/>Almost one third of the children have special needs, most commonly psychological problems.  Although I say that, I have not carried out any investigation.  What we are talking about is evidence of some kind of special need being mentioned in court.  It could just be the need for educational support, or it could be a psychological problem.  Understandably, the problem could have arisen from emotional neglect.  Abuse, including emotional, physical and sexual, is sometimes a feature.<br/>The legislation provides for four types of orders.  Emergency care orders last for only eight days, after which the child must be returned or an interim care order must be sought.  Interim care orders are issued where there is reasonable cause to believe the child's health, development or welfare is at risk and a care order is being prepared.  They are a kind of holding operation until a decision is made about a care order.  A care order applies up to when a child is 18, but there is a phrase in the legislation that refers to an order applying to the age of 18 or for such time as the court might decide.  In some courts, that has been used to have short-term full care orders for six months or a year.  In this case, the HSE will work with the family trying to get things back on track.  This mechanism is very commonly used in some of the Munster cities and towns.  It works fairly well in some of those cities and towns because it means people are not back before the courts all the time.  There is a particular period in which there are jobs to be done by the family, and sometimes by the Child and Family Agency with the children.  Otherwise interim care orders must be renewed every 28 days.  That requires the Child and Family Agency's social worker, the Child and Family Agency's lawyers, the parents and their lawyers, the guardian <i>ad litem</i>and usually the lawyers of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>to go to court every 28 days to demonstrate that the conditions still exist for maintaining the order.<br/>During this time, parental access to the child is usually supervised.  Supervised access is horrendous, in my opinion, although there are social work specialists here who might have different views.  Evidence of what happens during supervised access is used in court as part of the ongoing examination of family circumstances.  I do not know any parent who could imagine what it would be like to be having meetings with one's children under such conditions.  It is very difficult to imagine relations being spontaneous and natural.<br/>The largest category of applications through the District Court is for the extension of interim care orders.  They comprise approximately one third of all applications.  In some parts of the country, they comprise much more.  Three quarters of applications in Clonmel, Drogheda and Dundalk and two thirds of all applications in Dublin were for extensions of existing interim care orders.  Reviews of existing care orders accounted for 10% of all hearings but half of all the hearings in Cork.</p> <p>In Cork they have short-term full-care orders which come back for review and get examined by the judge or mentioned in court, and that explains that distinction.  While this can be a very adversarial process it is important to stress that only a minority of cases are contested by parents because about two thirds of the parents acknowledge that they need help.  In that one third category only a small minority of cases are rejected by the court, that is, 4%, and in 7% of cases the order was either modified or withdrawn by the Child and Family Agency.</p><p> We have published statistics we got from the Courts Service which show that some District Court areas process many more applications than others.  Some of the figures I have given in the presentation are on the website.  I have been asked why this is the case and I honestly cannot explain it but there are probably various reasons.  It is undoubtedly true that different levels of deprivation probably operate in different towns and the Courts Service has no national template for recording applications.  There may be discrepancies in the Courts Service's figures.  However, that does not account for all of the differences.  Where there is a high level of family support services the incidence of child care orders is likely to reduce.  The importance of family support services cannot be overemphasised.  Even when we play all of this in, the CFA's statistics show that Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Louth, along with four out of the seven Dublin areas, have a higher proportion of children in care than the national average.  There are differences around agency practice as well,  The wide variations in the thresholds mean that circumstances which might lead to a child being taken into care in one part of the country will not lead to that in another because of different attitudes on the part of some social work teams and some judges to, for example, cannabis use which would not be regarded as serious in many parts of Dublin but would be regarded as very serious in some rural towns.  Certainly, there is a lack of consistency and the crucial question which is whether the child is suffering neglect or is at risk is not then the focus.  The focus is on the parental behaviour but it should be on whether the child is vulnerable in those circumstances.</p><p> The amount of time available is another factor.  In Dublin, two judges sit five days a week.  A third judge sits two or three days a week dealing with only child care cases and they get very careful attention which is important.  The judges involved have been doing it for a few years and have developed a very high level of expertise.  However, other District Court judges, and this is through no fault of theirs, deal with civil District Court matters, criminal matters, road traffic accidents, bail applications and child care and family law.  There might be one family law day in a town in a month where there would often be 60, 70 or 80 family law cases on the list, including domestic violence, maintenance applications and so on with the child care applications shoehorned somewhere into the list.  It is impossible for them to be heard adequately if there is any kind of contest or difficulty about them.  Many of them go through with consent and with renewals but it makes it much more difficult outside of Dublin for the cases to be heard properly.</p><p> I am not making final recommendations at this stage because there is another year's research to follow before we produce final recommendations, but we have said there are certain things that could be at least looked at immediately.  A special family court is essential where there is a dedicated cohort of judges who can specialise in that area and devote a period of time to it.  It is not desirable that judges should only hear family law cases and be cut off from the rest of law, both for their sake and the sake of the development of family law, and we would get very few to agree to do that because it is very stressful.  I have yet to meet a judge who is not relieved sometimes to have a little stint dealing with criminal and other cases because of the nature of the cases they are hearing.  Similar to having, for example, a commercial division of the High Court, we could have a division of these courts.  The Department of Justice and Equality is already looking at this because it features in the programme for Government.  Other services such as mediation should be available to a family court in order that people can be diverted from court proceedings.</p><p> There are certain legal principles that need to be embedded in a reformed Child Care Act, and the role of mediation needs to be explored further.  I do not think that mediation would really have a role in a decision about making or not making an order.  That is a very straightforward and important decision because we are interfering with constitutional parental rights and it is only right that the court should make such an order.  However, there are other ancillary issues that arise around access, assessments, foster placements and so on that could be dealt with much better through mediation.  Much more help should be available for social workers to obtain a little more legal knowledge in order that they understand the kinds of thresholds that are required when they go to court and to have support in that respect.</p><p> I reiterate that poverty is a major cause of what is defined as neglect.  We need to address child poverty and provide early intervention for the families who need it by way of the types of programmes that exist in a rather patchy way but are often the first to disappear when there is pressure on resources.  I refer to programmes such as the community mothers scheme and so on, which only require a relatively small amount of investment and yet produce many positive outcomes for families, and they need to receive adequate resourcing and support.</p></speech>

I will provide some data to show it is already under considerable strain and I will propose some alternative strategies that might relieve the pressure that is threatening its effectiveness.  I have appeared before this committee previously and made oral and written submissions in 2012, outlining my response to the heads of Bill of the Children First legislation.  My main concern then was the impact that the proposed legislation would have on the capacity of services to respond to the demands likely to be made of it.  I expressed this in the knowledge that the majority of cases referred to the services were already considered to be below the threshold for receipt of services.  I am sure the members are aware that the cases that my colleagues are discussing, namely, those cases that go through the courts, are a small minority of the referrals made to the Child and Family Agency each year, many of which concern situations that could be ameliorated if intervention were available.  I am glad to note that following the report issued by this committee, the Children First Bill 2014 has significantly modified the reporting requirements that were proposed and it has strengthened inter-agency responsibilities which is very advantageous but I continue to have concerns about the capacity of the service.</p><p>  I am sure the committee is aware of recent statistics indicating that in the third quarter of 2014 almost 9,500 children were awaiting allocation of a social worker by the Child and Family Agency and 3,000 of these children were regarded as being at risk.  The volume of non-allocated cases and those on waiting lists has been steadily increasing year on year.  It is not getting any better.  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, recently made a statement to the effect that all children on waiting lists are reviewed, but I am sure the members will agree that the potential for accurate risk assessment in such pressurised circumstances is extremely compromised.  It is unrealistic to assume that all of the urgent cases are receiving a response.</p><p>  Based on calculations presented by the agency, at this point more than 200 social workers, on top of those it already employs, would be required to make any impression on current waiting lists, and the increase that would be triggered when the Children First legislation is implemented is likely to multiply this figure such that it will become out of all proportion to what which currently exists.</p> <p>However, even if the resources were available and the agency was able to recruit adequate and suitably qualified numbers of staff, the question must be asked as to whether we really want a massive and all-encompassing statutory child protection service.  Experience in other countries has indicated that expanding statutory social work services to meet existing child protection demands has resulted in congested systems which are a nightmare to administer and which ultimately become unsafe.  I have used the analogy before with this committee of a crammed casualty department where patients have bypassed primary care services in the community to go straight to hospital, making it very difficult for staff to discern those who are most acutely ill.  We know from research that most families are fearful of the child protection service - my colleague, Dr. Coulter, has reinforced this point - finding it to be hostile, stigmatising and intimidating.  Do we want a situation where more and more families are dragged into this system to be either eliminated or left on waiting lists?  A more far-reaching solution is required to meet the needs of vulnerable children and free up the services to deal with the most pressing cases.</p><p> I must add that I am well aware of the new community-based prevention and partnership initiatives being established by the Child and Family Agency and I commend the developments being undertaken.  I hope that they will be adequately resourced and I believe they will provide an excellent service to those families who are able to avail of them.  However, the passage through the cluttered child protection system that is required before many of them reach that point is likely to pose obstacles.</p><p> At a very  basic level, we need better statistical information with regard to who is referring children to the agency, what the principal issues are and precisely what type of intervention is required.  There is no interrogation of existing data to enlighten policy makers.  Dr. Coulter has been able to determine some very significant patterns in respect of children going through the courts but we have insufficient data about vulnerable children in the community.  I am aware that the agency is developing an information project but this is not expected to come on stream until 2017.  In the meantime, we can merely try to estimate the source of early problems in families.  On the basis of patterns in other jurisdictions, however, we can approximate that most child welfare issues are identified by teachers and child health practitioners.  We know that large numbers of adults with children use domestic violence, addiction and mental health services.  It stands to reason that locating social work posts dedicated to child welfare at these sites, particularly schools, is likely to more effective than automatically diverting families to the already overstretched agency.  A concerted effort to make adult services more aware of the impact of parental issues on children and the co-location of child and family welfare social workers in those services would make sense.  Said social workers could then provide both triage and early intervention so that the needs of children would be met and only appropriate cases would be referred on to the Child and Family Agency.  What is required, essentially, is a more robust whole-of-government response.</p><p> I note that among the provisions in the Children First Bill is one to establish a statutory interdepartmental group.  I am disappointed, however, that the lifetime of this group may be limited to the period during which Children First legislation will be implemented.  Establishing it on a permanent basis would promote the likelihood of a more forceful engagement.  The planned review of the Child Care Act also presents an opportunity to include health and education among the sectors statutorily obliged to promote the welfare of children.  At the very least, I would propose the setting up of a fully-staffed child protection and welfare unit in the HSE, which has 70,000 practitioners that are likely to interface with vulnerable children either directly or through their parents.  As this committee heard recently, there is currently one post dedicated to child protection in the HSE and that person's role primarily relates to the implementation of the Children First legislation rather than the development of child protection and welfare responses.  I am sure members will agree that this utterly inadequate for an organisation with such constant engagement with children who are exposed to parental drug and alcohol use as well as mental health and disability.  Dr. Coulter has illustrated the prevalence of these problems in families going through the court system.</p><p> I would also propose the establishment of a similar child protection unit in the Department of Education and, ultimately, the creation of social work posts attached to schools, either singly or in groups.  Members will be interested to know that evidence from international research on accessible services such as those to which I refer shows them to be extremely effective, with a high take up by service users because of their less stigmatising nature.</p><p> I reiterate the point that, on the basis of recent trends and literally short of a miracle, the Child and Family Agency will not be able to cope with the demands being made of it.  Importantly, on the basis of evidence from elsewhere, expanding the agency will not improve matters significantly and may in fact make them considerably worse.  The only viable solution is to reduce the pressure on the agency.  One proposal in this regard is the provision of early intervention, including social work services, to children and families in the sites where their difficulties emerge.  Other radical solutions may also be effective and I urge the committee to give the matter serious consideration.</p></speech>

I wish to highlight three primary issues, namely, the adversarial nature of court proceedings and the impact of this on children and their families; the lack of evidence-based child protection assessments put forward by social workers who take the lead role in this regard; and the outsourcing of assessments to private providers by the Child and Family Agency.</p><p>  When an interim care order is granted by the District Court, it is accepted that in most cases a thorough and comprehensive assessment of the child's circumstances will be undertaken, prior to possible reunification with his or her family.  During this time, the child is placed in the care of alternative carers.  In general terms, it is accepted that the required assessments can take between 12 to 16 weeks to complete.  This is known at the outset of proceedings.  At a minimum, a social work assessment involves an examination of parental capacity.  More often than not, the assistance of a psychologist is required in order to gauge cognitive functioning.  In addition, psychological assessments of the children involved and, quite possibly, attachment assessments are required.  It is quite a lengthy process.</p><p>  While assessments are ongoing and as Dr. Coulter noted, the court can grant an interim care order for 28 days unless parental consent is forthcoming.  In my experience, this adds significant stress to parents who are already in difficult circumstances and can result in an unnecessarily fraught and adversarial relationship between families and the assessing professionals.  Children learn from their parents, social workers or guardians that the matter is re-entered on a monthly basis.  This causes uncertainty for children who need to develop a sense of security in respect of their foster carers.  It can also cause unnecessary anxiety and hope on the part of those who simply want to return home every month.  Many parents are vulnerable adults in their own right.  In my opinion, the adversarial nature of proceedings can be compounded for a parent with a learning difficulty who requires the support of an advocate.  For both parents and children, the hope or stress involved is unnecessary when assessments are outstanding and it is unlikely that reunification will occur in the absence of completed assessments.</p><p>  Current delays in the assessment process relate to the Child and Family Agency's inability to identify the professional input required, whether from a psychologist or some other suitably qualified individual.  In many cases, parties put forward their proposed independent professional whom the agency then funds.  This process can often delay proceedings by a number of months.  A possible solution might come in the form of consensus.  Once the Child and Family Agency has met the grounds for an interim care order, a mediated meeting between parties could be scheduled in order that agreement might be reached in the context of the assessments required and an agreed timeframe for same.  Agreement could also be reached on whether the parents are willing to consent to the order the court is going to make.  This would provide clarity for families in terms of where they stand, what they are specifically being asked to do and what is expected of them.  Each month I witness the lack of clarity for families and I am aware that they become confused.  Many parents hope each month that their children will be returned to them, despite the fact that everyone involved knows that the assessments are outstanding and that it will be at least a further three months before the court can make its decision.</p><p>  An extended timeframe would allow time for professionals to engage in multidisciplinary assessments.  At present and more often than not, the Child and Family Agency outsources assessments to private providers.  In my opinion this is not solely based on lack of resources - in view of the fact that the agency funds private assessments, I suggest that there is a false economy involved here - it primarily relates to a lack of multidisciplinary teams that are either accessible to or to be found within child protection teams.  A multidisciplinary evidence-based assessment conducted by a social worker should ideally involve the input of a psychologist in circumstances where parental capacity is an issue.  In addition, the skills of a public health nurse or child psychologist - if developmental delay is a concern - should also be available.  The list of the potential professionals required is endless.</p><p>  I am of the view that the Child and Family Agency is currently insufficiently prepared for the key task of carrying out comprehensive evidence-based assessments.  Social workers who are expected to take the lead role in these assessments require specialist training in evidence-based assessments of families, including in respect of child development.  Social workers are not proficient in carrying out evidence-based assessments because, in my opinion, their training lends to a more lateral approach.  Specialist legal training is required in order to ensure that they fully understand both the legal framework within which they work and the thresholds which they are expected to meet - or not - in court.</p> <p>There is no doubt that court work is a specialist area.  Currently, within the CFA it forms part of every social worker's caseload, including newly qualified social workers with no experience in the field of child protection.  It would not take a lot to put in place specialist teams.  The committee has already heard from my colleagues of the low number of cases about which we are speaking in the grand scheme of things.  A specialist team would alleviate a lot of the issues I am raising.  <br/>The extended timeframe suggested in regard to mediated agreements could be reviewed through monthly meetings attended by parents.  Obviously, all parties have liberty to re-enter.  If necessary, a court agreed chair could be nominated to mediate the ongoing progress of the case.  The primary advantages of this proposal are a decrease in stress levels for children and their families, which is paramount, a decrease in unmet expectations, which is evident on a monthly basis, a removal of adversarial proceedings for many families and an overall reduction in costs.  By way of explanation, in one case before the court where there are two parents separately represented and a guardian <i>ad litem</i>appointed there would be four separate legal teams every 28 days.  At times, this would include the use of counsel.  As matters progress, independent assessments are often commissioned and in many cases second opinions are sought.  I suggest that current child care legislation needs to be reviewed to consider the advantages of longer orders or mediated agreements by consensus.  It is also recommended that the Child and Family Agency provide the essential training required to carry out evidenced-based assessments in conjunction with access to full multidisciplinary teams.Also, social workers must be provided with adequate legal training to ensure they are equipped with a full understanding of the legal thresholds which are relevant to their work.</p></speech>

I would like first to address the contribution made by Dr. Coulter.  I have looked at the second interim report.  One of the striking messages from the findings thus far, bearing in mind the final report has yet to be presented, is the inconsistencies in the system.  There is little consistency either in preparation, presentation or the decisions made and outcomes.  The situation across the State in regard to the matters reported on is varied.</p><p>  I note from Dr. Coulter's report a categorisation of what is viewed as the most prevalent or strongest underlying issue, with the result that some of the information is a little skewed in terms even of the HSE's acknowledged position with regard to neglect.  Reference is made on page 4 of the report to cognitive disability-mental illness and drug and alcohol abuse.  Many, if not all, of the situations reported on would have one underlying factor.  Perhaps Dr. Coulter will comment on the need for a more scientific approach, such as multi-categorised assessments in terms of court observations rather than cognitive ability, mental illness and drug and alcohol abuse, some of which can be multi-present.  Neglect is a consequence across all areas.  According to HSE data in this regard 28.6% of the cases relate to children in care yet according to the data compiled in the context of Dr. Coulter's report neglect arises in only 12.6% of cases.  Perhaps when responding Dr. Coulter will comment on whether a more multifaceted methodology would be more informative in this regard.  I am not questioning the value of what has been researched and presented.  It is hugely important and I welcome it.  However, I wonder if a little tweaking might give us a clearer picture of the multidimensional reality of many of the cases that present.</p><p>  I welcome Dr. Buckley back to the committee.  She has posed to the committee a very difficult question to answer.  We all agree with her on the need for more social workers within Tusla and the Child and Family Agency.  Dr. Buckley made the keen observation that there is a point where this can tip, by which I was taken.  Prior to this meeting I had read her pre-circulated submission and was taken by the case she makes.  There is an optimum position, which is quite difficult to measure.  Dr. Buckley is correct that with the advent of the Children First legislation will, presumably, come a significant rise in reporting and as a result a greater caseload with which to cope.  Perhaps Dr. Buckley would advise on how one can measure the right point for which to pitch in this regard.  I agree with her - as I am sure will the committee - that this is not about a fire brigade reaction in response to the problem but rather an address and elimination of the problem at its genesis.  This is, of course, rooted in poverty, marginalisation and social exclusion.  Dr. Buckley's closing commentary that the provision of early intervention and services, including social work service to children and families for whom difficulties emerge, is necessary.  I agree with her that this is exactly what needs to be done.  All the Tuslas in the world will not properly address, eliminate or eradicate the core causes.</p><p>  I would like finally to comment on and thank Ms O'Callaghan for her contribution.  I am surprised to hear that only a year into the process assessments are being outsourced to private providers.  State agencies appear to fall into bad habits quickly.  In regard to Ms O'Callaghan's statement that more often than not this is the case, perhaps she would elaborate further.  I would have hoped for more from the Child and Family Agency despite the difficulties for it in terms under-resourcing in the current year, etc.  Can Ms O'Callaghan offer any additional information in this regard?  It is an issue about which I would like to question the agency.   </p><p>  Ms O'Callaghan statement that social workers are not proficient in carrying out evidenced-based assessments is a very important point.  Some social workers might take offence at that, or maybe not.  Nevertheless, Ms O'Callaghan makes the distinction between specific roles.  I would welcome further elaboration from Ms O'Callaghan in terms of her paper, which I have read and very much welcome.</p></speech>

In particular, I thank Dr. Buckley because her national review panel report has proved invaluable to this committee.  In terms of the child care law reporting project, when the reports come out we learn from them each year.  For us it is good to have the evidence which means we understand more and can shape our own thinking.  For example, we need to have a court dedicated to family but not solely.  Therefore, it is importance for us to listen and hear information.<br/>It was interesting for me to hear about the work of guardian <i>ad litem</i>cases which is where I shall start.  Last week when Dr. Coulter launched the report she said that some courts appointed guardian <i>ad litem</i>cases but only 20% of the time.  Also, in these cases there was no evidence of the judge speaking directly to the child.  Two years ago we voted on a children's amendment which is still before the Supreme Court awaiting adjudication.  At that time we clearly said that children should have a voice in issues that affect them.  All too often I have heard about cases of where the child is the last person to be spoken to, yet we have heard from a series of Ministers that legal fees are a huge and significant issue.  I welcome the views of the delegation because we keep hearing that the legal fees are the problem.  I have no doubt there is a duplication in the payment of legal fees.  Can the delegation advise when such fees are appropriate?  I have seen cases where a guardian <i>ad litem</i>is appointed to a child but not in other cases.  Dr. Coulter told us in her report on the child care law reporting project that where one lives is a factor, which means it is a geographical lottery.  What are we doing about the matter?<br/>Turning to the issue of early intervention, I understand Dr. Buckley's concerns that we might have a rise in the number of reports due to the Children First legislation.  One side of me says that is something is happening we need to know.  If we knew there was a serious heart issue or Ebola virus scare we would not say to people to stay at home and wait until we have services in place.  Therefore, we must equip the services.  I have listened to what was said and agree that we do not have enough social workers.  Equally, we cannot put all the investment into such recruitment but not have the services.  That is why I pursued the question about the HSE with the Minister for Health ten days ago and emphasised to him it was all of the HSE that needs to be taken into consideration.  He took on board what I said but we must wait and see whether something happens.<br/>This committee must push further the idea that child protection is not just an issue for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Child and Family Agency.  Child protection is part of all the different Departments where children have a role.  The Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health play the primary strong roles.  The committee needs to push that understanding of child protection.<br/>I raised the role of social workers in the Seanad a short while ago with the Minister for Health.  I have heard there is a difficulty accessing other services in the health services or agency.  Ms O'Callaghan clearly told us about the psychological assessments and so on.  People try to access these services.  I have been given the example of the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, which takes a child into care.  When people try to access CAMHS the attitude is almost that a person can pay privately because CAMHS works in the community and cannot be accessed.  This is one State body speaking to another.  Social workers regularly complain to me that when they try to access CAMHS they are told the child is their responsibility rather than the State services.  Social workers also tell me there is a problem accessing social services for parents.  Social workers are told they do not understand, yet Dr. Coulter's report to us today mentioned the lack of services in terms of addiction, mental health issues and physical health issues.  That proves there is clearly a role for other services.<br/>I would like to ask about ethnic minorities and their vulnerability, which was mentioned.  I want to understand the issue more.  I think I understand the problem but want to be absolutely sure we understand the issue.  I am very pleased the term &quot;Traveller&quot; has been included as an ethnic minority, which is what I believe is correct.  How do we assist Travellers? <br/>Direct provision is another issue.  To be clear, children are distinguished as either being in the care of the State or cared for by the State.  Children in direct provision are being cared for by the State so are not in the care of the State.  Therefore, they cannot be inspected by HIQA, while they will say somebody has been seconded from the HSE into the Reception and Integration Agency to look after all those concerns.  If I was in a direct provision centre and was told somebody from the Department of Justice and Equality had been seconded to the agency it would mean nothing to me.  As a result, I would not report a concern.  I am fearful there is a lot more happening in direct provision centres than we realise and more than we could imagine.  If I was in a centre I do not know if I would have the courage to report something.  Does anyone know what happens in these centres?  How can we ensure people get the interventions and supports they seek?<br/>Those are all my questions because I want to leave space for my colleagues.  I have taken note of the Child Care Act amendments that have been suggested and we will take them on board.</p></speech>

I have a question on Dr. Coulter's report on records and refer to paragraph 19 which states:  &quot;The Courts Service has no national template for recording applications, and there may be double counting&quot;.  Has there been any engagement with the Courts Services about putting a template in place to show a clear record of cases?  Perhaps Dr. Coulter has covered this area in her response.<br/>Paragraph 22 refers to cases being adjourned repeatedly.  Dr. Coulter said this is due to different judges sitting on different days.  That means when a case is adjourned there might be a different judge adjudicating on the next occasion.  Has the Courts Services been consulted on ways to improve this situation?  This problem is not new and has gone on for years.  <br/>I have done a small bit of court work and I have not done too much in regard to care orders.  From my small experience of the matter, there are constant adjournments particularly with family law because different judges preside.  If the judge who heard the case initially is not sitting on a particular day the case will be adjourned again.  Has the Courts Services been contacted about improving this situation?  We are talking about making some long-term changes.  Are there immediate changes that can be put in place?  There is nothing worse than a case going on <i>ad infinitum</i>and parties having to go in and out of court with no long-term solution available.</p></speech>

Agreed.</p></speech>

I only read them this afternoon so shall now go back through them again.  I wish to mention a couple of aspects, some of which have been covered.</p><p>  Ms O'Callaghan mentioned that there is a need to carry out comprehensive, evidence-based assessments, in liaison with a full multi-disciplinary team and to consider the advantages of longer orders.  I understand the need for stability for the child.  I believe cases need to be dealt with speedily, which would benefit the child and the family.</p> <p>Is there a worry it could drag on for a long time if it does not have a specific timeframe?</p><p> We spoke about training.  Is this on-the-job training or off-site training?  What type of costs would be involved in that?</p><p> Dr. Buckley mentioned the allocation of social workers and that there are 9,500 children awaiting the allocation of a social worker, 3,000 of whom are regarded as at risk.  She said that in such pressurised circumstances they would be extremely compromised, that it is unrealistic to assume that all of the most urgent cases are receiving a response and that, according to her calculation, we would need 200 more social workers.  What are our chances of getting them?  </p><p> There are funding issues.  Money was allocated in the budget but from what I gather from previous meetings, the money allocated in the budget will not be enough even for the agency to stand still.  What implications will that have for accessing the 200 more social workers we need to deal with the problem?  </p><p> A viable solution for the agency was mentioned.  One proposal was the provision of early intervention and services, including social work services, to children and families in the sites where difficulties emerge.  Should services be outsourced and if so, to whom would they be accountable?  Who would administer those local services?  </p><p> The inconsistencies throughout the country struck me.  In almost every aspect, things are  done differently.  Dr. Coulter stated that in Cork, almost half of all hearings were reviews of existing orders and that care orders are made for relatively short periods of time - typically six months.  What is the identifiable reason for this?  Is it a matter for the judge or the particular court?  What system is best and how do we measure it?  It was stated on a couple of occasions that we do not have national templates or databases, so how do we measure this?  </p><p> Two of the presentations mentioned child poverty and I refer to UNICEF's report last week where Ireland came 37th out of 41 countries.  That is something on which we need to work and of which we should be ashamed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-04a.618" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Helen Buckley" time="18:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014110400008#G00200"><p>I will start with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's question about measuring the tipping point, which was a very good question.  To refer back to my submission, I said the data produced by the Child and Family Agency is very poor.  All we really know is how many children are referred to the service and how many are screened out at the other end.  It does not give very accurate figures on the causes. My colleague, Dr. Coulter, has probably been the first person to shine a light on what the most prevalent problems are for children in terms of the court system.  Many more children are experiencing parental factors which do not even get as far as the court system.  We require good data, we need to know who is making referrals, what are the problems and what are the interventions that are working.  The partial solution to that is that the agency should improve its data collection methods and the Department should oversee this.  Not only should it collect better information but it should interrogate that information more efficiently so that it can measure aspects such as the tipping point, where are the gaps and where the services might make a difference.</p><p>  I very much appreciate Senator van Turnhout's interest in these issues, in particular her efforts to put pressure on the HSE to pay attention to the need for investing resources in child protection.  A review of the Child Care Act could answer the question raised by Deputy McLellan also in terms of who will provide these services and who they will be accountable to.  I would like to see the Departments of Education and Skills, Health and Justice and Equality identified as statutory agents in respect of providing services for children so that there could no  longer be any prevarication about who provides services and that there is transparency and accountability.  Governance is very important.</p><p>  When I refer to investing in services in the sites where the problems arise, I am not referring to informal community-based services but to trained social workers who have the capacity to assess the severity of problems and, where necessary, to refer them to the statutory services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-04a.619" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Carol Coulter" time="18:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014110400008#G00300"><p>Again, starting with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's questions, in my report I warn that the statistics I have collected are by no means the last word.  Statistics only ever present snap-shots of situations.  When we started out we were not exactly sure what we would find because this is the first time anything like this was done.  We collected the information we thought might be available, in particular information on families which had not otherwise been collected, as Dr. Buckley said.  It is true that in our figures it appears that neglect is under-represented.  Just identifying neglect does not go far enough.  It is necessary to see what else might be there.  Where we found other triggers for the neglect featuring in the evidence, we noted them even though it is rare that it is one thing or the other.  There is a huge amount of overlap.<br/>At this stage I do not propose to alter the way in which we collect data because we will produce cumulative data over three years and if we alter the manner in which we collect it that will distort what we find at the end because we will have new ingredients that will have an effect.  That is the answer to the question on tweaking.  <br/>We compare our data with the HSE's data but the HSE does not distinguish between court ordered care and children in care.  Its figure relates to all children in care but there are differences.  We have already identified that, predictably, there is a higher number of children in voluntary care with relatives than in court ordered care.  There is likely to be other differences between the children in court ordered care and the children in voluntary care for obvious reasons, where the families come to an agreement with the HSE about the child going into care.  The period of time they spend in care are probably different as well.  It would require the kind of data collection to which Dr. Buckley referred, which will have to be done by the Child and Family Agency itself to try to dig that bit deeper into some of those figures.<br/>In regard to <i>guardian ad litem</i>cases and judges not speaking to the children, this is just what we have observed.  The places where there is relatively little use of<i>guardian ad litem</i>tend to be the places where there is not a huge volume of child care applications.  Dublin uses <i>guardian ad litem</i>frequently, as do some of the other big cities, but it is at the discretion of the judge.  The President of the District Court has organised a number of seminars for her colleagues on child protection matters, which have been attended by specialists in the area.  They are voluntary but I understand they have been very well attended.  It is the Judiciary itself which would bring about consistency.  I hope that with the establishment of a judicial council, where education and training are one its functions, it will permit a huge step forward in regard to the development of consistency among the various members of the Judiciary.</p> <p>I hope the establishment of a judicial council, one of the functions of which will involve education and training, will lead to a huge step forward in the development of consistency among the various members of the Judiciary.  Obviously, there are other issues in relation to how these matters are dealt with by different judges.  While we are on the subject of the Courts Service and the Judiciary, I would like to respond to something said by Senator Colm Burke.  The Courts Service has alerted me to some anomalies in its figures.  It is about to roll out a national template.  I hope that next year - certainly the following year - the statistics will be collected on the basis of this national template, which will allow for much better comparisons than those that have existed up to now.</p><p> I was also asked about the prevalence of adjournments.  I am not sure what can be done in the absence of an increase in judicial resources, by which I mean the appointment of more judges and the support staff they need.  The Courts Service, which puts court clerks' bums on seats to ensure courts are open, etc., has lost 40% of its budget since the start of the crisis.  I would like to put it on the record that I have seen great dedication from the courts staff and members of the Judiciary, who often sit until 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. to try to clear lists and ensure all cases are dealt with.  The courts staff are courteous and helpful to the people who appear.  It is not anyone's fault.  It is simply the case that there is insufficient capacity in certain parts of the system.  Family law has been expanding exponentially over the past ten or 15 years.  The system has not been designed to cope with it.  That is why it is necessary to do something radical.  I know the President of the District Court is constantly juggling the judges that might be available and checking whether an unassigned judge can be sent somewhere to help if there is going to be a long case.  It is like trying to pour a gallon into a pint pot.  This work is being done without being able to overcome the problems in a meaningful way.</p><p> The issue of ethnic minorities is a very complex one.  They are disproportionately represented in the system for a number of reasons.  Travellers are socially isolated anyway, as we know.  I think they are under-represented in our statistics, if anything, because the only basis on which we record that someone is a Traveller is if evidence has been given of that person's circumstances that makes it clear.  We do not guess that they might be Travellers.  They might be settled Travellers.  We only know if evidence is given with regard to a halting site or some kind of discriminatory experience.  I think they are under-represented.  We have found that when they reach court, the circumstances of the children are often much more extreme than the average, which is quite disturbing.  This raises the question of whether the intervention is coming at a very late stage.  It is possible that these problems were present in the families in question for quite some time - perhaps some years - before they reached the point of care order proceedings.</p><p> We do not have a great deal of evidence with regard to other ethnic minorities and the issue of direct provision.  All I can say is that some individual cases in which mothers in direct provision suffered severe mental collapses have come through and ended up in the courts system.  One can surmise that direct provision did not help in those cases.  In a typical case of this nature, the child was taken into care following a mental health crisis on the part of the mother, who was alone.  The mother is sometimes hospitalised until she returns to an even keel, more or less, after a period and the family is reunified.  Various individual cases in which such incidents have occurred are reported on the website.  While I certainly think direct provision has played a role, it is not the only factor.  There are two other factors that we have seen in relation to African families, for example.  First, the numbers have been inflated by the fact that unaccompanied minors are frequently African.  I am sure the committee will agree it is good they get rescued by the child protection service, as it is likely that many of them would be in very bad circumstances otherwise.  Second, there is a cultural issue that relates to African families and to families from certain other ethnic minorities.  Families from eastern Europe are also disproportionately represented.  They often display child-rearing practices, such as attitudes towards physical discipline, that bring them to the attention of teachers and social workers.  This raises wider issues about the integration of ethnic minorities and how we can ensure they are aware of what we regard as our norms.</p><p> I think I have responded to most of the matters that were raised.  Reference was made to inconsistencies in different care orders.  I think they have developed because different practices have existed in various HSE sections over the years.  When we consider what is better, we need to focus on the role of data collection in ensuring outcomes for children are measured.  For example, we should examine whether there are more reunifications in places where the norm is to have a short-term care order followed by a review.  We do not have those data.  We have been trying to get them but it has been very difficult for us to do so.  We have been asking some of the legal teams concerned whether they can get those data for us.  I absolutely agree that the types of orders that appear to produce the best outcomes for families should be examined.  At the moment, all we can do is point to something we have found and hope it will prompt a little more investigation.</p></speech>

When I spoke about outsourcing, I was referring to a very small part of the CFA's role in court proceedings.  I wish to clarify that, in my experience, there are many outsourced assessments.  For example, risk assessments of alleged perpetrators of abuse would be outsourced by the CFA.  I am not aware of any area in Ireland that conducts its own risk assessments.  Psychological assessments are outsourced due to the lack of availability of an in-house psychologist.  That can go on for a number of months.  A similar point can be made with regard to speech and language assessments.  The list can be endless.  All of these matters relate to court proceedings.  As Dr. Coulter suggested earlier - I am interpreting what she said - it is possible there is a two-tier system in this area.  It is arguable whether children in court receive services more quickly than other children, but it is a question that needs to be looked at.  It is definite that these assessments are outsourced because the CFA or the HSE could not provide them within the required timeframe.</p><p>  I hope I was not insulting any of my social work colleagues when I spoke about evidence-based assessments.  My remarks were meant to be of assistance.  The reality at a very basic level is that a newly qualified person with no legal training and no training with regard to producing evidence could find himself or herself on the stand after two months, giving evidence on why a child should remain in the care of the CFA.  I believe it is right that social work training is generic in nature.  I do not think people in colleges should be trained specifically in child protection.  The shortfall occurs in the training they receive from the agency that is employing them in how to perform this very important role.  To the best of my knowledge, people are not trained in how to conduct evidence-based assessments.  Maybe they receive such training in some parts of the country.  I would argue that evidence-based assessments have to be multidisciplinary.  Social workers do not work in isolation.  Child protection should be done across the professions.  Social workers are not qualified to do certain assessments, such as cognitive functioning assessments.  There has to be a joining up of services.  That is where the outsourcing comes.  All the issues that have been raised in the questions cross over in terms of what I am proposing.</p><p>  Deputy McLellan spoke about the advantages of longer orders.  She asked whether I would be worried they might drag on and wondered whether I would be in favour of a specific timeframe.  I am suggesting that specific timeframes would avoid the dragging on and the drift.  When the CFA makes its first or second application for an interim care order, all parties accept that something has to change and that assessments need to be conducted.  A timeframe should be agreed for all that in order that there is an expectation that when those involved come back to court after four or six months, the assessment will be completed and the judge will be able to make a decision on the longer-term plan for the child.  The experience at present is that these things tend to drift on for over a year.  This links into some of the other things to which I have referred, such as the argument about whether to outsource if provision cannot be made by the CFA.</p> <p>Such arguments can take months while children are in care separate from their parents.  My proposal is on having a mediated agreement at the beginning, with the people to conduct the assessments identified.  This would establish an expectation regardless of whether the CFA provided its own staff or whether it outsourced.  That argument is a longer-term one but at least this would in some way save a lot in costs in terms of coming back into court every 28 days with four separate legal teams.  My main issue is the drift associated with children who remain in care.  It would be useful to analyse the children who are unified.If one analysed what happens in the year and a half before children go home, one might find they could go home a lot earlier if there were agreements and set timeframes.  That is my experience not only in my current role as a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, but also in the 16 years I practised in child protection.  I have always believed this could be done more efficiently.  That is where those issues come from.<br/>In regard to legal training, I think the CFA can provide it itself.  It pays a lot of money for its own legal advisers and I believe that could be part of the package.</p></speech>

I greatly appreciate that they took the time to be so specific about certain matters.  I have one or two comments and a question.  I am still in shock after reading about the 9,500 children waiting to be allocated a social worker and having realised that 3,000 of them are high risk.  What is deemed high risk?</p><p>  Recently, I have taken time to speak to principals in the area I represent.  Some of the cases they come across in primary schools are quite frightening, and teachers and principals are distressed over how they are being dealt with.  Trying to get children into a service has become a significant difficulty for them, and they all stressed that to me.</p><p>  I have learned from where I live and where I worked in the community before I became a Member of the Oireachtas that the problem seems to be generational.  It seems to extend through generations of families.  One of the reports referred to poverty and isolation.   I do not disagree with this but knowing the number of services on the ground, particularly community services such as after school programmes, family resource centres, local projects and even parenting courses, and the millions of euro that go into them each year, I wonder whether there are too many services rather than one service that would be able to deal with everything.  Sometimes I suspect many of these services duplicate one another.</p><p>  Recently, I was at a mass in my parish where a man spoke about fostering and said the number of children in Dublin 8, 10 and 12 requiring foster care was the highest in the country.  He was looking for more foster parents.  I was really taken aback by that.  I wondered where we are going wrong.  A huge amount of money is being pumped into the system and yet we still have this growing phenomenon of children being put into care.</p><p>  Dr. Buckley said a more far-reaching solution is required.  Will she expand on that?  Insufficient data were mentioned.  This is one of the main problems we have.  Down through the years when working with young children in youth clubs, I always found that most of the children we dealt with locally were first identified as being at risk by the teachers in primary school.  That seems to still be the case.  I do not believe we give enough credit to teachers who can identify the significant needs children have from speaking to and working with them.  We must pay tribute to them because teaching is a very important part of all our lives.  For teachers to have insight and to be able to identity children at risk is of great benefit.</p></speech>

What we have seen among people coming before the courts is that they have not received the kind of targeted and appropriate support they need in a timely fashion.  The importance of matching people to the services they need requires more attention, in particular if people are suffering from a cognitive disability.  It often only comes to light when they become the parents of children because in school a mild intellectual disability does not trigger any supports.  It does not trigger any supports for adults who suffer from cognitive disability.  Parenting is not easy for anybody.  The child might have special needs but even if he or she does not, the demands of parenting might mean that some kinds of supports are required.  However, it can be very difficult to access them.  Unless the child has a diagnosis of what is called a moderate intellectual disability, which I would always regard as quite severe, it is very difficult to access the kinds of supports and interventions necessary.  I am not sure about there being too many services and about the duplication of services.  I believe the CFA is examining that but I have certainly seen a lack of appropriate, targeted and timely supports for the people who need them.  Without them, they end up in what is a much more expensive and difficult situation.  I refer to the need for out-of-home care, which is very expensive, not to mention very traumatic for everybody involved.</p><p>  I agree with the Deputy's remarks about teachers who deserve great credit for being the first port of call for many children.  Very often circumstances will have been quite bad for quite some time.</p></speech>

Children are at risk of significant harm if an intervention is not made.  That would be the definition of the Child and Family Agency.  The underlying point of my submission is that the agency is like a time bomb.  It is not coping and will not cope.  The quarterly reports it has produced indicate a steady increase in the number of cases that are unallocated.  This is likely to get worse when the Children First Bill is enacted because there will be more anxiety on the part of reporters to do their duty and report on children.</p><p>  On the question of what a more radical strategy would be, I suggest that we boost these supports in the Department of Education and Skills, as Senator van Turnhout said.  I agree that teachers are not social workers and need extra resources to help them.  Likewise, the health services need extra resources.  It is a serious problem that needs serious consideration because it is not getting any better.</p></speech>

We are getting &euro;47,500 from the Department to run the centre.  One of the religious orders put in &euro;90,000 and a private enterprise is now prepared to put up &euro;45,000 but neither Department will put in support funding.</p> <p>Technically, the schools these 30 children attended are still getting the money from the Department and yet they will not take the children back.  The problem is what do we do with these 30 children at the end of December.  In many cases, there is no parental support for them.  We are falling between two stools.  This is also happening in the Dublin area where there is a similar centre to the one in Cork.  The education system does not suit everyone but there is a failure among Departments to recognise that fact.</p></speech>
