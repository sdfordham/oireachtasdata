    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-26a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017102600002#B00700"><p>This matter is not on the agenda or under correspondence.  It concerns the IDA's recent appearance at the committee.  It had been asked for a more detailed note on how it verifies the job creation numbers it presented to this committee.  There was some discussion on how the IDA calculates what jobs are created from its clients and how ConnectIreland does it.  I have forwarded two notes or forms to the secretariat.  It is extraordinary, because what the IDA said when it was before the committee was that 14,000 jobs were created last year.  The IDA verifies the jobs by asking the relevant company to fill in a form.  The form, which I forwarded to the secretariat, is an annual employment survey.  It simply has two boxes.  The checks involve making sure that the form was filled in.  The form is sent out to companies and the companies respond by saying how many jobs were created.  There is no follow-up in terms of linking it with revenue, payroll or PRSI.  That can be juxtaposed with the process that ConnectIreland is asked to go through.  It has a responsibility to identify how the jobs are created.  The company has to prepare a spreadsheet with the name of the employee, employee position, start date and end date.  The IDA, at its discretion, can talk to the companies.  It can get permission to view payroll reports, bank statements, latest P30s and samples of employee contracts.  It is much more robust.  It certainly is the case that for ConnectIreland, a very detailed process was in place to prove that the jobs that were created were actually created.  However, in the case of the IDA, a straightforward self-assessment letter is sent out and that seems to be the process.</p> <p>  This is important.  I am not doubting the figures or saying that the figures that were presented to us were not genuine.  However, I am concerned about the process.  It is questionable whether the figure presented to us can be independently verified.  These are figures which guide policy.  Perhaps we should wait until the detailed note comes back from the IDA, but it appears that there are double standards here in terms of how the IDA requests ConnectIreland to verify its jobs while having a much simpler process itself.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-26a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017102600002#B00800"><p>I understand and completely appreciate what the Deputy has said.  I received a similar copy of that correspondence yesterday but it has not been circulated to the committee as it arrived too late.  However, we have written to the IDA directly on this topic, following on from the earlier correspondence from ConnectIreland.  We want a detailed response on that, and we will forward this documentation to it as well.  It will be circulated to the members of the committee shortly.  The question that arises is what happens when the questionnaires are not returned.  What figure does the IDA take in that instance?  I am very interested in the questionnaires that are not signed by the companies and returned.  We want to check the verification, but when forms do not come back, we want to know how the IDA comes up with a number.  I am sure it has some mechanism to count the jobs in particular companies.  We will add that to our list of questions for the IDA.  I have no doubt that we will have a detailed discussion when we receive the reply from the IDA and will proceed from there.  We will ask the secretariat to encourage the IDA to respond as promptly as possible.</p> <p>  That arises out the minutes-----</p></speech>

That was circulated to us yesterday and is on the screen.  Any member who wants the secretariat to circulate a copy should let it know.  Are members of the committee comfortable with that?  We received it yesterday but there was a lot of information on the chart.

I know my place.</p><p>I will read this out because it relates to today's issue in respect of Grace.  It is from Ray Mitchell of the HSE and states &quot;Just to advise that given the range of issues re Deloitte, the [director general] will give a short opening statement this morning&quot;.  We are allocating a maximum of one hour to Grace, because we are dealing with the rest of our business in respect of section 38 and 39 organisations.  He writes, of his opening statement, &quot;Given the time constraints I will bring along copies for the members this morning&quot; and then writes &quot;In relation to the request for a copy of the 15 page draft report produced in May 2017 and sent to [Waterford Intellectual Disability Association], Deloitte have corresponded with us as follows&quot;.  This refers to Deloitte's correspondence with the HSE, which reads:</p><blockquote><i>The </i>[Public Accounts Committee] <i>has not asked Deloitte for access to the draft report.  If such a request came, we would consider the request, but it is not normal to provide access to anything other than our final report.</i></blockquote> <p>We had a discussion in private session during the week about the draft report and the changes in the final version.  We wrote to the HSE for a copy of the draft report it has, as the executive is our point of contact.  It appears to me that the HSE seems happy enough that we write directly to Deloitte for a copy of that report.  I thought that asking the HSE to provide it was the simplest way but it is saying that it has contacted Deloitte and that Deloitte will consider it.  We will write to Deloitte and will confirm it with the director general of the HSE this morning.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-26a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017102600002#B01900"><p>Language is very important.  We are told that, "We will consider the request".  It then goes on to say that it does normally provide anything other than the final report.  The HSE is telling us to write to Deloitte, which will then come back and state it does not normally provide anything other than the final report.  We will have to go through a process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-26a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017102600002#C00100"><p>That is clearly what it says.  That would be the normal process.  They are quoting what I would consider standard procedure.  They would not normally issue draft reports, especially to third parties.  We are saying that this is not normal, the Oireachtas has taken a serious view and the Oireachtas has set up a committee of investigation.  No doubt it will have to be produced, one way or another, in due course in any event, and this is not normal.  An Oireachtas commission is not a normal commercial report that would be presented to a client.  We will highlight in the letter that we understand normal procedure but this is not such.  Are we happy with that?</p></speech>

It is normal, due to client confidentiality, when they are commissioned by the HSE to produce a report that it cannot be used by anybody other than those who commissioned it or those specifically for whom it was intended.  When this report was being commissioned, it was not intended that it would be given to the Committee of Public Accounts and there will have to be agreement between the HSE and Deloitte.  Both would have to consent to it, but it should be borne in mind that the HSE commissioned it and Deloitte was its adviser.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-26a.31" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017102600002#C00800"><p>Not wishing to dwell on it, it seems that a game is being played in a sense.  We discussed whether we could go back to the service provider and the whistleblower to get it and we felt that would not be fair.  If it is owned by the health executive, surely it can release it or we can go back to the service provider which has a copy of it and simply get it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-26a.32" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017102600002#C00900"><p>Mr. Tony O'Brien is here.  We will ask him to confirm that he is happy for us to get the report.  Maybe we will ask him to get it directly and for him to provide it.  That was our first port of call.  He is now saying to write to Deloitte but we will short-circuit that process when he is here in public session.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 819B, correspondence dated 20 October 2017 from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform confirming that the Department is awaiting information from the Department of Education and Skills on the committee's request for information regarding the terms and conditions of employment of certain State employees.  Deputy Kelly mentioned this in passing the other day.  We have received further correspondence.  Something came in late last night and we have not had time to put it up on the system and circulate it.  The members will get the more substantive reply after the meeting.  We just have not had a chance.  It came in very late last night and it has not been circulated.  We will get it circulated as quickly as possible and it will be on the agenda for the next meeting because it will be listed as an item of correspondence received after today's meeting.</p> <p>  The next item is correspondence from or relating to private individuals and other organisations.  Correspondence item No. 820C (i &ndash; ii) is correspondence dated 11 October 2017 from Ms Niamh Larkin, director of audit in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, updating the committee on correspondence regarding Meath County Council.  A matter relating to the legal status of certain companies that have contracts with Meath County Council had been raised by an individual and this was referred by the previous committee to the Department in January 2016.  The letter advises that the local government auditor for Meath County Council met the correspondent in July 2016 and has corresponded with him a number of times from January 2016 to date.  She advised the correspondent in July 2016 that his correspondence did not fall within the definition of an objection, and on 14 July 2017 she confirmed to the correspondent that it was not intended to take any further action.  A copy of the correspondence to the individual is attached.  I propose we note that.  It has been looked at locally by the local government audit.  I propose we note it and move on because Meath County Council is not within the remit of this committee.</p> <p>  The next item is correspondence item No. 821C (i &ndash; ii), dated 17 October 2017, from Ms Patricia Quinn, managing director, Benefacts, enclosing information for the committee about the database of Irish non-profits comprising extensive governance, regulatory and financial data and analysis.  This will be of interest to members.  I think it has been circulated to all members of the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

Okay.  The next item is correspondence, dated 19 October 2017, from Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll, Secretary General, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, providing information as requested by the committee on the foal levy and impediments to basing the levy on the actual amount paid by the breeder rather than a standard nomination fee.  I have not had an opportunity to study this.  This has come before us on three or four occasions.  I propose we hold over consideration of this until the next meeting.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I will list it for correspondence the next day when we have had time to consider it.</p> <p>  The next item is correspondence No. 828C, dated 18 October 2017, from Deputy Mary Lou MacDonald, forwarding correspondence from a nursing home in County Dublin.

It was clear from the correspondence that it was intended for this committee and I have forwarded it on.  It is the case that it is not our business to start delving into the individual circumstances and disputes that may have arisen between any nursing home and HIQA or any other agency.  I need a bit of guidance here in terms of how we respond to this because it seems there is at least one more general issue regarding regulation that is raised by this correspondence.  It refers to the chief inspector of social services, Ms Dunnion, who has been before the committee.  This position is answerable to the Oireachtas, not to the board, and we have a particular responsibility to examine what exactly is going on here.  The lengthy correspondence refers to the part-time discharge of this function.</p><p>Others may be sharing, or presenting themselves, rightly or wrongly, as inspectors or assistant inspectors.  I need a bit of help in terms of how we advance this correspondence and the concerns that arise, not by becoming a referee in the dispute but by knuckling down on the regulatory issues that arise and how we deal with those.</p></speech>

It is very interesting.  I feel that some of the issues that have been raised in the correspondence are likely to be raised by others, and as a consequence we have to get to some format.  I accept what the Chairman has said on the caveat of ensuring the inspector is independent.  We also have to find some vehicle to be able to get to the bottom of the four or five issues of deep concern that are in this correspondence.

The next item of correspondence is No. 829C, dated 19 October 2017, informing us of the motion passed by the Oireachtas on Deputy Pat Deering's membership of the committee.  We have already welcomed Deputy Deering.</p> <p>  Correspondence item No. 831C, dated 17 October 2017, is from Ms Jennifer D&rsquo;Arcy, chairperson of Louth and Meath Education and Training Board, providing a note as requested by the committee in relation to the 2015 and 2016 financial accounts, which have not yet been completed, although I understand progress is being made on this matter.  I propose that we write to the ETB stating it is our expectation that the 2017 accounts will be completed within six months of the end of 2017.  Does the Comptroller and Auditor General have any comment to make on this?  Does he agree with it?</p></speech>

We expect to have them resubmitted to the office in October.  It will be the early part of next year before we have the 2016 accounts.  There is a difficulty there, and the chairperson does acknowledge this, but we are working as quickly as possible with the ETB to get the 2015 accounts first and we expect to have them by the end of the year.</p></speech>

I was concerned, particularly in the education sector, that there was a drift and no way of accelerating it.  It is almost too late by the time it gets here and the committee identifies that there is a problem.  I needed a vehicle to get it on the agenda.  The fact that I produced the first report and the committee took it so seriously has resulted in a speeding up of the process.  I have another report on the 2015 accounts, which is ready for publication.  I have asked whether publication can be expedited in order that it is published before the education and training boards are due to come before the committee in November.  That will allow the committee to have a look at the overall timeliness of that particular sector because there has been a problem, and also the third level sector, which the committee dealt with in April and May of this year.  I anticipate we will do a further report on the timeliness of the presentation of the 2016 accounts.  This means the committee will get the big picture rather than looking at individual ones, and that is important.</p></speech>

The correspondence states that an appeal by Coillte to a decision of the Department of Social Protection will have an adverse effect on the State in respect of pension provision for the staff in question.

The issue the committee must discuss is how we will structure our meeting with representatives of the education and training boards, ETBs, on 16 November.  We agreed at a previous meeting to invite representatives of the City of Dublin Education and Training Board, CDETB, given its size and scale.  The secretariat has proposed having representatives of the Department of Education and Skills and SOLAS, the funders of the ETBs, attend the first session together.  I would like everyone to be present for the full meeting.  In other words, I want the chairmen and chief executives of the two education and training boards to be present for the session with the Department and SOLAS.  Further, I would like all representatives of the education and training boards to hear what is being said about all the individual ETBs.  I do not want anyone coming or going at the meeting.  I want all the groups to be fully aware of what is being said, although we will provide time for different sections.  We do not want to take a silo approach.  We want everyone present throughout.  We will start the meeting with an information session with the Department and SOLAS.  We suggest that representatives of the City of Dublin Education and Training Board be invited to the second session.  While the CDETB separately administers the SUSI grant scheme, we should not mix up issues by discussing the grant scheme.  It is a completely different issue.</p></speech>

The rationale for inviting representatives of Kilkenny and Carlow, Limerick and Clare and Mayo education and training boards is that some of them have been performing poorly with regard to their accounts and we want to bring in some of the tardy boards.  However, I also asked the secretariat to choose the best education and training board and Kilkenny and Carlow Education and Training Board seems to be doing its business properly.  If it can do things right, why can the rest of them not do things right too?  We want to pick out some elements of good practice and tell the other boards they do not have any excuses because their counterparts elsewhere are doing things right.  We want to have a contrast.  Rather than bringing in the bottom half of the class, to use an educational term, we are bringing in examples of good practice.  In addition to having representatives of Kilkenny and Carlow Education and Training Board, we should bring in representatives of one of the other education and training boards to which I referred.  Deputy Kelly favours having representatives of Tipperary Education and Training Board come to the meeting, while Deputy McDonald favours having representatives of Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board come before us.  I ask the Deputies to explain the rationale for their position and we will talk it through.</p></speech>

I have been engaging with the Secretary General of the Department to get better answers because many of them were not acceptable.  My first request for information related to multiple issues, including the locations of offices, savings, interactions with SOLAS, staff mobility, the headquarters of work, the process for securing employment, the process for spending certain allocations and spending of own resources versus SOLAS expenditure.  I asked a range of questions, all of which are in the public domain.</p> <p>  The second issue was related to Education and Training Boards Ireland, ETBI, which is a very interesting entity.  Is it an organisation or representative body and, if it is neither, what is it?</p></speech>

For instance, I think the secretary general of ETBI is a staff member of Kilkenny and Carlow Education and Training Board seconded to ETBI.  It is a system that is used in the Department to create, if one likes, national functions, but they are distributed and paid for by the line entities.  For instance, internal audit for ETBs is located in a number of the ETBs as well.  It is something that is worth pursuing with the Department as to what are these national functions that are run through local organisations.  If Kilkenny and Carlow Education and Training Board has a staff member who is employed in ETBI in a senior position, maybe the committee could suggest that he or she be brought along to contribute.  As well as that, the non-pay costs of ETBI are paid from contributions from the individual ETBs.</p></speech>

On the basis of what the Comptroller and Auditor General said, it is up to the committee as to how it responds to my second request.

While I understand the idea of benchmarking best practice and giving a bualadh bos to Kilkenny and Carlow Education and Training Board which appears to be doing things right, I am not sure it is the most useful investment of our time because ultimately the committee is an accountability platform.  While acknowledging good things, good practice and successes, we are it, as the Chairman correctly stated, when it comes to malpractice.  I understand Mr. Sean Ashe, the chief executive officer of Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board, is planning to retire.  Given what has happened a million times previously, I am anxious, when we pursue lines of questioning about the internal procedures of an organisation or entity, that we will not be told, "I do not know about that because I was not there."  I do not want us to walk slam dunk into that scenario again.  I am aware that the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, has appointed someone to carry out an investigation.  This should not preclude us from inviting the chairman and chief executive officer of Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board to present themselves to the committee.</p><p>It would be odd, to say the least, if we have Kilkenny and Carlow ETB in this module, which seem to have done things very right, while we do not have those organisations that seem to have issues that we need to examine, which is a matter of public commentary and anxiety now.</p></speech>

A letter was to issue from the Committee of Public Accounts in recent weeks to the Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board, ETB, for the attention of all members of the board rather than the chairman.  I talked to a board member who has not been made aware of it but board members are not being made aware of many things and it is being very controlled.</p></speech>

Contacting the chair in a controlling environment is not necessarily always going to give us the answers.  Public funding is involved in Education and Training Boards Ireland, ETBI.  The CEO of Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board just last week attended a conference in Abu Dhabi that was sponsored by ETBI.  I am fascinated about where the money comes from to do that kind of thing.  There is undoubtedly an issue.  It is important that if Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board comes in, we are all circulated with the 2010 report beforehand because we need to know the history as much as the current issue that is under investigation.  It is also useful to look not just at geographic areas but the number of schools.  An area might be small but might have many schools that are under its remit.  Why should we deviate from something when we see a clear audit?  We are unlikely to ask somebody to come in if there is a clear audit.  We bring in those that do not have a clear audit.  Why would we deviate from that?  I understand the point the Chairman makes about good behaviour.</p></speech>

We have a duty.  We are here for value for money for the taxpayer.  I suggest that if we bring in four or five ETBs that have problems, we could take a proactive role and tell ETBs that they need to lift their game.  We are not asking them to do anything that is not achievable.  It is not to give anyone a bualadh bos.  It is to use one ETB to show the others that this is the way they should be doing things.  It would be a success if the Committee of Public Accounts can make ETBs improve their situation and show them good practice.  I take the view that we examine the practice of everything that goes wrong every day.  There is some good practice.  Some Government Departments work well.  We have seen that Revenue and different Departments are fairly efficient in their statutory duty and we bring them in.  We ask if other Departments can be as efficient.  I use them as one example off the top of my head.  The sole purpose was to say to the ETBs that their sister organisation, in the same position, is doing well and that other ETBs should learn how to do it properly.  The only purpose is to show them that this can be done.</p></speech>

I would request, as Chairman, to have them here in case, for example, we have three ETBs complaining that it is not possible, so we can say that it is possible.  We may substitute Limerick and Clare ETB and Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim ETB for the Tipperary ETB and Kildare and Wicklow ETB.  We will go ahead with the Department, SOLAS, City of Dublin Education and Training Board, Kilkenny and Carlow ETB by way of a contrast and also Tipperary ETB and Kildare and Wicklow ETB.  I know we were going to have the other two in for matters relating to financial statements but we are dealing with that topic in its own right on an ongoing basis.  I understand some people will have reservations if the Department appoints an investigator but I think the view of the committee is that that does not stand us down from doing our work.</p></speech>

I thought we had agreed that we would take it up on that.  I think it was on the suggestion of Deputy Catherine Connolly, if I am not mistaken, that we would write to Nursing Homes Ireland and invite it in.  It required some form of clarity on what subjects we might like to address with it.  We can and should provide that.  Arising from last week's engagement with the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, were issues that arose with regard to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, specifically as it relates to the funding of nursing homes and the fair deal scheme.  I thought we agreed that we would issue an invitation for NTPF to attend.  The complication that arose was the necessity for clarity on a memo that has come into the possession of the committee and is now a document of the committee as I understand it.  It has been circulated to us and forms part of our papers.  Clarity was required about the extent to which or whether legal privilege applied to that document.  I also understood that we would seek legal clarity, a legal opinion or legal advice on that matter.  The three issues are legal advice, then, aside from that, the invitation to Mr. Tadhg Daly and whomsoever he wishes to bring with him from Nursing Homes Ireland, and also the National Treatment Purchase Fund.</p> <p>  A specific issue arose around a meeting that we know occurred and an exchange we had that we focused on.  I think we need to finish with that.  This work also feeds into a broader piece of the work programme which we have discussed many times, which is a deeper analysis of the fair deal scheme.  I think &euro;1.3 billion of public money-----</p></speech>

My question is one that our legal advisers might have to answer to.  When Mr. McEnery was here, notwithstanding any restrictions that were on us regarding referencing the official notes that are potentially subject to legal protection, he did strongly contradict what was in that note.  Maybe that will play a part in whether or not it has the same legal protections given that he, as one of the people who was at the meeting, clearly contradicts part of what is in it.  Second, and this is important, when Mr. McEnery was here he did speak about the meeting so that notwithstanding the notes he did talk about what happened at that meeting.  His response to a question as to whether a boycott of the fair deal scheme was discussed was yes, it was, but he was not party to it and did not support it.  There were only two parties in the room, himself and Nursing Homes Ireland, so if he did not initiate, support or take part in a discussion on a boycott, and he acknowledges that discussion took place, then Nursing Homes Ireland did.  If Nursing Homes Ireland did, that is a very real problem.  </p> <p>  In terms of asking them in, they have a duty to come before the committee because this is potentially anti-competitive practice.  We have a duty to put questions to them and then they have an obligation to respond to those questions.  That is nothing to do with notes of any meetings, that is something that was put on the record of the Committee of Public Accounts by someone who was at the meeting, and told the committee that yes, a boycott was discussed; no, he did not support it; no, he was not part of any discussion on the matter and he was troubled by it but that the discussion did take place.</p></speech>

I gather he was open to coming on a different day, subject to clarification of what the committee wanted to ask him.  We all agreed that he would be invited in on that basis.  I know the committee has a huge workload and the Vice Chairman needs help in clarifying the issues we wish to ask, but the decision that he come in has been made.  It is simply a question of writing to him regarding the issues put to him.</p> <p>  On privilege, we need urgent advice on the matter.</p></speech>

I am very conscious about something being privileged or confidential but this is beyond that now.  Mr. McEnery was before the committee as chair of HIQA who attended a meeting about which there is now a dispute.  There are serious questions.  Mr. McEnery and the HIQA board apparently think there is no conflict of interest.  Whether there is or not is a question for the committee.  If there is a conflict of interest then one is not in a position to get value for money.  To be clear, where we come in is on the conflict of interest.</p> <p>  I fully support Deputy McDonald on the nursing homes.  There is a bigger issue here.  We are now in a position where more than 80% of our nursing homes are private, without any discussion or looking at the many issues around it.  I support that, we need to do it. </p></speech>

There is a note, note 12, in the HSE's financial statements, which refers to the cost of long-term residential care and gives an analysis of it.  The figure for nursing home support scheme - fair deal private nursing homes only - is &euro;623 million in 2016.  The cost of public nursing homes is &euro;333 million.  That is a bigger figure than fair deal.  Not everyone who is in a nursing home is on a fair deal scheme.  That gives a figure of about &euro;950 million, so roughly &euro;1 billion is nursing home support, a subset of which is fair deal.</p> <p>  We are also doing some work around fair deal, particularly looking at costs, costing models and so on.  The time frame for completing that will be longer than the committee will be interested in.  We will continue with the work we are doing.  If matters are dealt with and there is nothing further for us to pursue, I probably will not report on those aspects but if there are other residual aspects that I feel there would be useful to present to the committee in a special report, I will do that in due course. </p></speech>

The principal reason for this meeting is the examination of chapter 19 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report 2016, management and oversight of grants to health agencies.</p><p>The committee agreed in private session on Tuesday to allow an hour today for questions regarding a matter discussed with the HSE previously.  A HSE-commissioned report has been produced by Deloitte on the cost of care incurred by the service provider in the Grace case.  Arising out of this, the committee has questions on two specific matters.  These relate to the director general, Mr. Tony O'Brien's covering letter to the committee and his conclusion that &quot;the service provider was not treated either unfairly or disproportionately&quot;, and an explanation for why the HSE argued that certain tables that appeared in an earlier draft should be removed from the final report.<br/><br/>I welcome Mr. O'Brien from the HSE and thank him for making time today.  He will be joined by Ms Aileen Colley, chief officer in the community health care organisation, CHO, area 5 for the first session.  She is welcome.  I remind members, witnesses and those in the Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off.<br/><br/>I advise the witnesses that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter to a qualified privilege only in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br/><br/>Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 186 to the effect that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.<br/><br/>While members may have many other concerns relating to the HSE's treatment of Grace and the service provider, we also acknowledge that the Houses have set up a commission of investigation to examine these matters and we do not wish to do anything to undermine that work.  As such, we will be specific in what we put to Mr. O'Brien today.  We will not get into the broader issues regardless of those concerns.  I am sure that the Farrelly commission has the power and ability to get to the bottom of the matter.<br/><br/>Mr. O'Brien has an opening statement for this session, which he has brought with him.  It has been circulated to all members.  Mr. O'Brien may proceed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-26a.187" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017102600002#H00200"><p>I thank the Vice Chairman for the invitation to attend today's meeting and the opportunity to address concerns regarding an independent review undertaken by Deloitte as it relates to a disability support provider in the south east and that is directly concerned with the case of Grace.  I am accompanied by Ms Colley, the chief officer of CHO area 5, which is the relevant CHO area.  She joined the HSE in September 2015.  Therefore, it is important to point out that she would not have had any involvement in the matters in the south east prior to that date.<br/><br/>I am mindful that, in addressing these concerns, I have taken the time to consider a number of issues addressed to committee members by the provider in correspondence dated 4 October 2017.  It is important to preface my opening statement in the knowledge that matters of concern for this committee are also germane to the statutory investigation that is sitting.<br/><br/>In addressing the matters in the service provider's correspondence to the committee, I wish to provide important background and context leading to the final 20-page report and appendices issued to me, as commissioner of the review, by Deloitte on 15 September 2017.<br/><br/>During the course of my opening statement to the committee in February of last year, I discussed levels of funding for the voluntary provider for the years 2009 to 2015, inclusive.  The budget for the voluntary provider involved was set out together with a comparison of the percentage increase or decrease in budget relative to the percentage increase or reductions across the area and nationally.  In the course of the meeting, the then Chairman stated:</p><blockquote>I understand that Mr. O'Brien [me, of course] is going to have a discussion with it [the provider] and I know he will be fair about it.  I think when you look at the funding figures that you quoted in your opening statement, and factor in the work that had to be done and the care that had to be given, you will find that its funding actually decreased over the period.  I will not argue with you about the figures, but I am going to ask you to examine that table at some stage and be prepared to inform the next Committee of Public Accounts of the position.</blockquote> <p>Following the committee meeting, the figures were disputed by the voluntary provider in question.  As part of an engagement with the organisation, I gave a commitment that I would undertake an independent external review of funding, to which the provider was agreeable.  I commissioned Deloitte, an internationally recognised organisation, to undertake the review in accordance with the following terms of reference, which relate to the cost of care from 2009 to 2016 for a specific individual in the care of a service provider, and the funding provided by the HSE to the service provider from 2009 to 2015.<br/><br/>I now wish to address the serious allegations made by the service provider in its correspondence to the committee regarding the independence of the report.  Deloitte, as part of its methodology, undertook to engage with the provider and relevant HSE personnel and requested information from both parties.  As part of the process deployed, Deloitte exchanged a draft document with both parties and had further engagements with them regarding clarifications and inputs to the draft.  I understand that the methodology employed by Deloitte is the norm when undertaking such reviews.  That is, it is a reasonable standard to expect that both parties to the review would have the opportunity to comment and offer feedback for &quot;consideration&quot;, following which the independent reviewer has to decide on what will or will not be included in the final report, having taken into account the information and views of the parties to the review.  This is precisely what Deloitte undertook as an independent and reputable professional services firm.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding this, and given the gravity of the concerns expressed and the assertions contained in the provider's correspondence, I felt it important to seek written assurances from Deloitte as to its view of the assertions made.  I therefore wish to read into the record of the committee the following response received from Deloitte:</p><blockquote>In support of our findings in respect of part (b) of the TORs (our analysis of the funding provided by the HSE to the service provider from 2009 to 2015), our report includes the detail of the amounts initially reported by HSE to the PAC in respect of funding provided over the period adjusted for funding for one-off and new services which shows the real reduction in funding for like for like services over the period and is consistent with what was in the draft report.<br /><br />There was an additional table (table 3.3) in the draft report which further adjusted the funding received for the shortfall determined under section (a) of the TORs.<br /><br />We determined that further adjusting the table for this shortfall was confusing and could be misleading as the report already clearly set out the shortfall related to part (a) of our TOR.  The removal of this table was not as a result of any pressure from the HSE.<br /><br />As the report was prepared for the HSE, we considered it appropriate that additional information be included in the report which provided the HSE's context to our findings.  It is not uncommon in such reports to obtain responses to findings from those subject to the review and the report clearly sets out that this information was provided by the HSE and not subject to independent review by Deloitte.<br /><br />It was not in our TOR to conclude as to whether the shortfall in the funding for Grace was effectively an additional cut in funding to the body or deliberately done because of the whistleblowing, this is a matter for the Commission of Investigation.</blockquote> <p>Having regard to the above response from Deloitte, I wish to address concerns raised regarding material - in this instance, tables relating to financial data - being in the draft report for consideration as distinct from the final report issued by the independent reviewer, Deloitte.  As I have referenced in terms of Deloitte's correspondence, the information that was contained in table 3.3 of the draft report had already been dealt with in the report and was removed to avoid confusion.  The removal of this table was not as a result of any pressure from the HSE.</p><p>In its final report, Deloitte reproduced the table of figures provided by me in my opening statement to the Committee of Public Accounts on 2 February last year.  These figures were subsequently disputed by the provider.  The Deloitte report at 6.4, page 17, states the following on these figures:</p><blockquote>From our analysis of the breakdown of the funding provided by the HSE to the Service Provider, we are satisfied that the figures set out in Table [6.1] above are in respect of total funding.&quot;.</blockquote><p>The report further states at 6.5, page 17:</p><blockquote>The Service Provider has advised us that whilst there was an overall 18% increase in the level of funding in 2015 compared with 2014, this increase is after the provision of new services.</blockquote><p>I take from this that the figures as presented by the HSE to this committee in February 2016 were correct.<br/><br/>I have accepted the final report as issued to me by Deloitte.  I remain of the view that the evidence in this report indicates the service provider was treated fairly in comparison with other similar service providers in the period under review.  I am satisfied, based on assurances from Deloitte, that any adjustment between the draft report of May 2017 and the final report was not as a result of any pressure from the HSE.  It is also my view that any remaining concerns should be dealt with through the Farrelly commission, which is established in accordance with the provisions of section 32 of the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004.</p></speech>

He states: "Consequently, the Service Provider was not treated either unfairly or disproportionately when compared to other similarly funded organisations."  That is Mr. O'Brien's opinion and it is not the opinion of Deloitte.  How can Mr. O'Brien determine whether it was treated fairly or disproportionately if Deloitte was not asked to consider it?  It is something for the commission of investigation to determine.  Will Mr. O'Brien explain to this committee how he can put in writing to us his view or contention that the service provider was not treated unfairly?  Bear in mind that the last time Mr. O'Brien was here on this matter, he hung the opportunity of an apology to the service providers on whether they were treated fairly or unfairly.  He said we would see what is in the Deloitte report but Deloitte was never in a position to determine whether the providers were treated fairly or unfairly.  Maybe Mr. O'Brien should correct the record of the committee and confirm that only the commission of investigation will make the determination, and it may influence whether the providers get an apology.  How was Mr. O'Brien able to put it in writing to this committee that in his view these providers were treated fairly and proportionately as opposed to unfairly and disproportionately?</p></speech>

Those are certainly the alternatives.  The reason I gave my opinion was because the former Chairman asked me to revert to this committee on that matter.  The question asked at the end of that meeting in February 2016 was quite clear and I am required to form an opinion.  If I formed an opinion that in the interim period or any arrangements since, the service provider was treated unfairly or was being treated unfairly, I would have an obligation to do something about it, notwithstanding the subsequent determinations that the commission of inquiry will make.  As the Accounting Officer currently for the HSE and with regard to the request made of me by the Chairman of the previous committee on the last day of that committee's actions, I have an obligation to form that opinion.  I have formed that opinion and I have shared it with the committee.</p></speech>

The context of the letter sets out what is in the Deloitte report.  It mentions section 6.4 and comparative analysis etc.  It is a reference to the Deloitte report.  On the back of that, Mr. O'Brien gives his opinion that the service provider was not treated unfairly or disproportionately.  My point is the Deloitte report was not in a position to make that determination.  What we can categorically say today is that Deloitte, which produced this independent report, is clearly not saying the service providers were treated fairly or unfairly as it was not within its remit.  Mr. O'Brien has given his opinion, based on what is in the Deloitte report, but this aspect was not in the terms of reference for Deloitte.  Is that a fair analysis?</p></speech>

The Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts of the time did not ask me to commission an independent review but he asked me to have a look.  I took the decision to have the assistance of an external reviewer as part of having a look.  The responsibility to form an opinion on this at that stage, and not prejudicing or taking away from the role of the statutory commission, was mine.  It was my decision to have Deloitte provide that information.  It was this committee's decision to request that it would have the benefit of that report, which I have provided.  In fulfilment of the request of the previous Chairman and as part of my statutory duties, I need to have an opinion.  I have told the Deputy what that is and he is entitled to say he does not agree with that opinion.  The commission of inquiry is entitled to interrogate my opinion but it remains my opinion.</p></speech>

My point is Deloitte has not passed any comment on whether the service provider was treated fairly or unfairly.  With respect, Mr. O'Brien is pre-empting the work of the commission by being very clear in his view that the provider was not treated fairly.  I want to get to another question.</p></speech>

Perhaps the Chairman will allow the Deputy a little more time so I can do that.  In my opening statement, I carry that very phrase in indicating that Deloitte was not tasked with that.  I have reiterated it and it is on record in my opening remark.  None of this takes away from the fact that if I failed to offer an opinion and if I did not come here with an opinion, the view could reasonably be held that I was not doing my job today, which is to have a view as to whether the service provider needs restitution at this point.</p></speech>

There is still an ongoing investigation.</p> <p>  There is the key matter of the draft report that we have not seen.  The whistleblowers wrote to this committee and have concerns that elements in the draft report did not make their way to the final report.  The witness has given the view of the author of the report, which is fine, and indicates table 3.3, which has been referred to, was not removed at the behest of the HSE but for other reasons.  The information was subsumed into a different table.  The service providers have told me they were told by Deloitte that the only reason the table was removed was because the HSE insisted on it being removed.</p></speech>

I can provide to the clerk a copy of the letter that Deloitte provided to my at my request when I asked it to review what had been stated in the letter relayed by the committee from the service providers.  As with the Deputy, I have not seen the draft report and I did not take part in any discussion with Deloitte about the draft report.  I have inquired of Deloitte whether the allegations made are in accordance with its understanding and decisions with regard to the content of the final report, as distinct from the draft report.  It has confirmed in writing that which I quoted in my opening statement.  I have no other knowledge.</p></speech>

The difficulty is this.  Mr. O'Brien comes before us as the Accounting Officer.</p><p>Mr. O'Brien's statement that he did not have sight of the draft does not cut it for me because his organisation did.  The process here is that the report was commissioned by the HSE.  It was at the behest of Mr. Tony O'Brien, as he said.  The terms of reference were set by the HSE.  It was paid for by the HSE and Mr. O'Brien's staff interacted with the author of the report.  Therefore, the toing and froing in terms of giving drafts and, maybe, correspondence was by members of Mr. O'Brien's organisation.  Therefore, he had an obligation to find out what exactly was going on in terms of the communication between his staff and the author on why the table was removed.  It is not good enough for Mr. O'Brien simply to say he did not see the draft and that that is okay and that he does not have to answer questions on it.  He is the Accounting Officer.  I say this to tee up other people.  They will have their questions as well.  I do not believe Mr. O'Brien's answer is satisfactory.</p></speech>

If I commission an external party to carry out a review, the only thing I ever get from that external party is its final report.  I have not seen the one in question.  At the committee's request, I asked Deloitte whether it would be prepared to provide the draft report to the committee.  It has indicated that if the committee requests it, it would consider it.</p></speech>

There was engagement between the HSE and the author of the report.  While it is up to Deloitte to give us a copy of the draft, the HSE could provide us with copies of emails and correspondence that went over and back so we could then determine ourselves whether a request was made by the HSE to remove the table.  That is the only way in which we will be able to determine what occurred.

He referred to Deloitte telling us it was not part of its terms of reference to conclude whether the shortfall in funding was consequent to the whistleblowing.  He has said that, at the last meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts he attended, there was a dispute around figures and that he would look at those figures.  As a member of the committee, like the Chairman, I believe it was always completely clear that the dispute was not just over the level of funding but also, and more to the point, the relationship between cuts or levels of funding and the whistleblowing.  Therefore, it is absolutely disingenuous of Mr. O'Brien to pretend that was not the case.  Why were the issues of funding and whistleblowing not part of the terms of reference for Deloitte?  Why did Mr. O'Brien not insert these as part of its work?  It went to the very heart of the dispute.</p></speech>

First, is there evidence that there was a disproportionate application of cuts to the service provider?  There is not that evidence.  If, however, we wanted to have an analysis of the motivations and actions of a variety of individuals and conversations they might have had, which I know form part of the concerns of the service provider, it would require a degree of compellability that I cannot give to myself or Deloitte but which rests with the commission of inquiry.  Given that we are talking about staff who did or did not take actions over quite a long period of time, some of whom are not currently employed-----</p></speech>

Mr. O'Brien referred in his statement to an appearance he made before this committee in February 2016.  At that stage, these matters of public concern &mdash; the whistleblowing and the funding &mdash; were well ventilated and known.  It seems to me that it was quite a deliberate decision not to ask Deloitte to examine the relationship between the whistleblowing and the funding.  I believe Mr. O'Brien made an active decision on that, yet he says he did not do it because it is a matter for the commission of investigation.  The commission was not established until March 2017, a year later.</p></speech>

There are two relevant points here.  First, I need to establish whether there is evidence that the service provider was treated unfairly in financial terms.  At the moment, I do not see any.  On the second question, if the answer to the first was &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; no external reviewer without powers of compellability could possibly reach a point at which it could give me an opinion on that.

I will summarise his evidence as I heard it.  First, before appearing before this committee today, which is specifically asking questions about the difference between the draft document and the final document, Mr. O'Brien has not yet sought a copy of that draft to read for himself.  I find that remarkable.  Second, the terms of reference for Deloitte consciously excluded any consideration or examination of a link between the whistleblowing and decisions on funding.  Third, as the accountable person and as the person in charge, Mr. O'Brien does not seem to have considered it worth his while to make an effort to investigate for himself within his organisation whether there was any merit in the complaint of the service providers that they had been disadvantaged in any way by the whistleblowing.  He has not told us otherwise.  That is the summary of the evidence as I have heard it.</p></speech>

In responding to the request of the Chairman of the previous Committee of Public Accounts to have this issue examined, the evidence available to me does not support the contention that the funding to the provider was disproportionate or that it was treated differently from other service providers in that period.</p></speech>

As Deputy Cullinane has said, it is disingenuous of Mr. O'Brien to assert this at committee because he is, frankly, not in a position to make that assertion.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Brien, however, has come to the conclusion that the provider was treated fairly in comparison with other similar service providers.  Deloitte, however, did not carry out an examination of the funding of all of the other providers.  Am I right in saying that?</p></speech>

The point is that the committee did not ask for a report from Deloitte, it asked for me to examine it.  I have access to the data and I have previously shared those data.  This was a time, in the period around 2009, when every service provider was experiencing cuts.  Many of those cuts were in the form of reductions in funding matched by corollary reductions such as FEMPI and so on.  Every service provider had cuts.  Is there evidence to show that this provider was treated disproportionately compared with others?  No.</p></speech>

He then goes on to say that this is the norm and that it is reasonable to expect that both parties under review would have the opportunity to comment and to offer feedback for consideration.  That happened with the HSE and with the service provider.  The service provider was very happy that the 15-page report had reflected matters accurately; it had input and said so.  We are then told, however, that a particular table was removed to avoid confusion.  Who exactly was going to be confused by that table?  Only a limited number of people were going to be reading this report.  I would have thought that, for such a change to be made, something a service provider found to be objectionable would have been something of which an independent reviewer would have taken very serious note.</p> <p>  Without a copy before us, it is impossible for us to adjudicate upon it.  Essentially, what happened here is there was some kind of engagement between the HSE and Deloitte.  We probably do not need to see the table as much as we need to see that engagement on the changes that were to be made to the report.  That would tell us an awful lot.</p></speech>

If the committee wishes to have access to correspondence between any part of the HSE and Deloitte, I have no objection.  The committee can frame that request to me and subject to the views of the commission, as I will only provide information if the commission does not object, the committee can have that access.  What I cannot do is give the committee Deloitte's product without Deloitte's consent.  Deloitte has indicated that it will consider a request from the committee.  I have no objection to that request but I would suggest that Deloitte also seek clearance from the commission, which I think the committee would want it to do.</p></speech>

I have a further question.  I noted the HSE's comment and I read the language carefully, which states:</p><blockquote><i>The </i>[Public Accounts Committee] <i>has not asked Deloitte for access to the draft report.  If such a request came, we would consider the request, but it is not normal to provide access to anything other than the final report.</i></blockquote> <p>What process would Deloitte have to go through?  What consideration would have to go into that?</p></speech>

I would speculate - and I can only speculate - that Deloitte would want to have regard to the possible implications for future processes and reviews if it were the case that not only the final product but also various iterations of their draft reports were subject to general review.  This process more or less mirrors, in my view, the type of process that the Comptroller and Auditor General goes through with the special reports, where there will of course be earlier versions; there will be opportunity for comment; and they generally include the views of the Accounting Officer, such as the ones we have today.  I do not that think they would normally expect that the committee or indeed anybody else would want to go through these line by line to look at what changes took place between the first and final drafts.  What I think Deloitte would consider, then, are what the future implications would be for its work more generally, as a reviewer and auditor, were all of its earlier drafts to be published in the same way.  That would be the consideration.  It is not my consideration, however, but Deloitte's.</p></speech>

The service provider took over the case of this special person.  Subsequently, there was a retrospective allocation for her care.

It is important to stress that this case was not taken by the service provider but taken by the plaintiff.  Again, before this committee in 2016, I indicated that in relation to those persons who had been harmed and were the subject of the Devine review, the executive - the HSE - would take a particularly positive approach to ensuring that appropriate restitution-compensation was paid for the failings in care, and the consequences of failings in care, in the south east, related not just to Grace but to a number of people.  Consequently, the approach to this case was not a hostile defensive approach but one, working with the State Claims Agency, which sought to put to right all of the issues regarding the deficiencies in the care that had led to the harm suffered by this person.  Consequently, it was right that the person would be provided with restitution which also would compensate the person for the cost of the care the person had received.  That is one answer.</p></speech>

What I have read from his answer is, "No, we are not acknowledging that this was because we underfunded the service.  That is because we decided to take a particular review of a case."  I put it to him that clearly, it was an acknowledgement that it was an underfunding of the service because it was not like any other service.  It had a very special person in its care who needed very special attention at a high cost.</p> <p>  While I also want to know the specific cost for the Deloitte report because I have forgotten the figure, I shall finish with a specific question.  Is that not a clear acknowledgement that the service had been underfunded, it had been left to care for Grace without proper funding from the Health Service Executive and that is why the HSE gave that portion in the settlement?</p></speech>

That is the nature of this service provider.  In the period in question, going back to 2009, it would not have been the norm for the fully encapsulated costs of each individual being cared for to be provided in a separate account.  Like most section 39 organisations, this organisation was funded broadly globally, but also with some restricted funds and some earmarked funds, for a range of services that were provided under a service arrangement similar to some in the discussions that we will be having later.  In that period, and taking account of the financial position of the service provider, the service provider was being funded at a level that was sustainable for it.</p> <p>  There are two separate issues.  The decisions at the time were in a particular context.  Was the service provider being underfunded?  Was it being forced into deficit?  What was the overall financial position?  The types of decision being made are made in that context all of the time.  In this particular case, it is possible to calculate the total cost of care that was provided.  With the benefit of the knowledge of the Devine report and in the context of a High Court case and the position that I said we would take, that settlement was agreed.  That does not amount to a statement that, in the round, the service provider was being underfunded.</p></speech>

It goes without saying that the transcript of everything said will be sent to the commission for it to look into the matter.</p> <p>  Before the next Deputy speaks, I wish to clarify a point.  Mr. O'Brien referred to examining the Grace case, in respect of which a settlement of &euro;600,000 was approved by the High Court, but he also referred to other cases.  Are more cases coming?  How many are in the system?  We know of one.  This is the first time that I have copped that there might be more in the system.  Has the HSE or State Claims Agency made provision?  Is there any other current case?</p></speech>

My first point is more for the Chairman, after which I will get to Mr. O'Brien.  It is unacceptable for an Accounting Officer who appears before the Committee of Public Accounts, having been invited specifically to respond to queries and concerns raised by us and others regarding an earlier draft of a report, to say that he did not see the draft.  The people who did see the drafts and corresponded with Deloitte are possibly not in the room, which means that we cannot put questions to Mr. O'Brien on which he could confer with those who were in correspondence.  This point is for future reference.  We have to do our job.</p> <p>  Who was the person or persons directly involved in liaising with Deloitte on the drafts?</p></speech>

If Mr. O'Brien does not know the number today, how can he say that this provider was not treated unfairly or disproportionately compared with other similarly funded organisations?  He has acknowledged that the HSE had to pay &euro;600,000 retrospectively and he cannot give us one example of another organisation that received a similar back payment, yet he says that this provider was not treated unfairly.  That does not chime.</p></speech>

This is an organisation that was being funded, it appears, at an appropriate level.  If I were to look at what the directors of the service provider said in their own annual financial statements - in this case, relating to the year ended 2013 - they point out that: "The deterioration in results reflects the reduction in HSE funding (as a result of general cuts to the health service budget under the Government's economic recovery programme and the temporary increase in staff costs which were not funded by the HSE)."  In other words, they acknowledge the context in which financial decisions were being made which affected them and other service providers.  I suspect everyone who suffered those cuts regarded them as unfair.  My examination was to determine whether they appeared to be applied in a reasonable and fair way across comparable organisations.</p></speech>

The Deloitte report indicates there was a 6% cut rather than a 2% increase in the organisation's funding in 2010.  When Mr. O'Brien and his colleagues were before this committee on previous occasions, they referred to a 2% cut.  Misinformation was, therefore, given to the committee.  On the specific point of whether or not this particular service provider was treated fairly or unfairly, it seems &euro;600,000, which is a large amount for a service provider of that scale, was paid retrospectively.  Mr. O'Brien is not in a position to name any other similar organisation that received a comparable payment.  Is it reasonable, then, to determine that the organisation was not, in fact, treated fairly?  Surely no reasonable person could conclude otherwise.</p></speech>

As we know, the Waterford Intellectual Disability Association has made that exact point.  Second, we in the committee can pass on information but we cannot come to a conclusion on this point without examining the funding of other organisations, which we will not be doing.</p></speech>

My point is that he is categorical in saying, based on the information he has, that the service provider was not treated unfairly.  Yet he is not able to give even one example of another organisation of a similar scale that received a retrospective back payment of a comparable amount.  That is a problem.</p></speech>

My second question relates to Mr. O'Brien's statement that the organisation in question was not treated either unfairly or disproportionately when compared with other similarly funded organisations.  The service provider had a particular extra responsibility and, as such, was not comparable with other organisations.  That is the point my colleague, Deputy Cullinane, is making.  It is completely disingenuous of Mr. O'Brien to make that statement.  How many other Graces were in the organisations with which comparisons are being made?</p></speech>

Grace is one person who is in a particular set of circumstances.

Before we went into private session I was reading paragraph 3.18 from the Deloitte report which specifically states: "Subsequently, the High Court approved settlement terms on 27 April 2017 which included a care settlement of &euro;600,000 for past care and &euro;120,484 per annum for the individual&rsquo;s care going forward."  The committee believes that settlement of &euro;600,000 was paid to the service provider for past care which had not been paid up to that point.  That is the committee's reading of the Deloitte report and it has been read into the record.  That is the agreed view of the committee.</p></speech>

I do not wish to delay the committee.  Notwithstanding whether the service provider was treated fairly - we have gone over all of that - the bone of contention is that in a previous hearing of the PAC reference was made to funding of the service provider and whether there was a net cut or an increase.  I think it was said there was a 2% increase in 2010.  Could Mr. O'Brien acknowledge that perhaps the information that was given in terms of how it was framed was not as accurate as it should have been?</p></speech>

Various pieces of information were pulled together at relatively short notice at my request so as to be able to interact with the committee.  It was quite a frenetic time because the general election was taking place.  To be honest, normally I would not have been prepared to come in at such short notice because I would not be as well briefed as I would wish to be.  Had I the opportunity to spend more time, it is undoubtedly the case I would have given the committee more information which might have given wider context to that table.  The table as it stands is not inaccurate but it perhaps is not the entire story which I if had had more time to prepare I would have had more information and I would have given the committee more information.</p></speech>

The more typical example would be in the case of a person who has an injury acquired at birth who may have long-term care needs resulting from cerebral palsy, for example, but there are other instances of harm arising from interaction with the health care system where we now see periodic payments instead of a single lump sum payment.  There is intended to be legislation forthcoming which will make that the norm rather than the exception.</p></speech>

As we have representatives of HSE before the committee, I want to take one minute to make a public health announcement.  I absented myself from the meeting for ten minutes to have the flu jab in Leinster House.  The service is being provided by a company down the road.  Practitioners from a doctor's practice come to Leinster House and make the flu vaccine available at a cost of &euro;18 lest anyone thinks we can receive it without having to pay for it.  In the context of the management of health services I encourage people to have the flu jab.  Mr. O'Brien spoke about this matter yesterday on national radio and might reiterate what he said about the public health aspect.  We will then move on straight away to our main business.</p></speech>

It is also worth acknowledging that the Houses of the Oireachtas as a place of employment facilitate employees, as do organisations such as RT&Eacute; and <i>The Irish Times</i>.  As we approach the flu season, it is important that those in the at risk groups - health care workers and those among the elderly population - avail of the flu vaccine.  There has been some controversy this week about whether it is exactly the right match.  The truth is that it is never exactly the right match, but the flu vaccine confers protection.  It can reduce the number of hospital admissions among the elderly, in particular, by between 50% and 60% and also reduce the number of deaths among those who contract the flu by up to 80%.  Therefore, there is a real and fundamental benefit both for the individual and our society.  I am very happy that this place of employment facilitates everyone who works in it through ease of access to the flu vaccine and hope other employers will also do so.  As the largest employer in the State, we do so.  I applaud the Chairman for the example he has set in sharing his experience with everyone present.</p></speech>

Almost &euro;4 billion of taxpayers' money is given to them.  At previous meetings the committee raised serious concerns about the level of oversight of the sector demonstrated by the HSE.  In the past year or so we have had the Console issue and matters related to top-up payments made to certain staff.  We have had issues in organisations such as St. John of God services, before which we had issues in the Central Remedial Clinic.  Representatives of the Rehab group appeared here on a previous occasion also.  It is greatly welcome that the Comptroller and Auditor General devoted a chapter in his annual report for 2016 to this specific topic.  It is timely and important in ensuring the effective spending of public moneys in a way that will provide maximum benefit for those who use the services of the agencies involved.  </p><p>Mr. O'Brien, director general of the HSE, is joined in this session by Mr. Stephen Mulvany, chief financial officer and deputy director general; Ms Rosarii Mannion, national director, human resources; Mr. John Cregan, head of compliance; Mr. Ray Mitchell, parliamentary affairs division; Mr. Kevin Cleary, HSE compliance division, and Mr. Michael Flynn, national director, internal audit division.

The service providers include large acute hospitals, as well as services for people with a disability and older persons.  They provide mental health, social inclusion, palliative care, primary care and health and well-being services.  The funding to pay for these services is allocated to HSE annually from the health Vote.  In 2016, &euro;3.8 billion, or around 28% of the HSE's Vote, was for the provision of payments to agencies.  It included a sum of &euro;2 billion to be shared between 16 acute hospitals and a sum of &euro;1.8 billion for voluntary and community groups.</p><p> Chapter 19 of the report on the accounts of public services for 2016 examines the HSE's framework for monitoring grants to service providers, drawing on the results of the audit of the financial statements of the HSE for 2016.  The current grant funding system has evolved from a long established model of service provision, whereby the State relies substantially on the voluntary sector to provide certain health services.  The formal arrangements with service providers are usually put in place by negotiation rather than through competitive processes.  The HSE has two types of contractual arrangement with service providers, depending of the level of funding provided.  Service arrangements are put in place with larger service providers, those operating on a for-profit basis and out-of-State service providers.  In 2016 approximately 570 agencies in receipt of &euro;3.75 billion were managed under these arrangements.  Grant aid agreements are put in place with service providers in receipt of funding below &euro;250,000 a year.  Approximately 1,700 agencies in receipt of just over &euro;32 million were managed under these arrangements in 2016.</p><p> The HSE has established a complex framework for the monitoring and oversight of these arrangements that is currently administered and overseen by nine community health care organisations, referred to as CHOs, located around the country and by six of the seven hospital groups, as summarised in Figure 19.1 of my report.  Progress has been made by the HSE in putting in place a systematic process for the oversight and monitoring of grant funded service providers.  However, the has report found that specified procedures within the HSE's monitoring framework were not applied consistently.  For example, funding CHOs did not have details of all of the key governance arrangements for a sample of service providers examined.  A service provider with multiple locations can receive funding from more than one of the HSE's CHOs and be subject to separate monitoring by each funding CHO.  The examination found that in these circumstances the identification of responsibilities in the HSE for monitoring and oversight was difficult.  The results of various audits and external reviews and compliance statements made by service providers highlight a number of governance issues arising across the sector, in particular non-compliance with procurement rules and regulations, non-compliance with public sector pay polices and the absence of internal audit functions.  Service agreements specify key performance indicators and reporting frequency.  Required key performance indicator returns were on file in just over half of the sample cases examined, of which over one quarter were not at the frequency specified in the service arrangement.  In the sample cases examined required audited financial statements had not been provided for the funding CHO in just under one quarter of service arrangements and grant aid agreements.</p><p> The report makes a number of recommendations in regard to the HSE's framework for oversight and monitoring, including that the HSE be satisfied that service providers have appropriate governance structures in place; that the service arrangements clearly set out key performance indicators and associated monitoring arrangements, including the responsibilities of both parties; that the monitoring arrangements specified in the service arrangements be complied with; and that the roles and responsibilities for monitoring be clearer where a service provider receives funding from more than one CHO.  The HSE has indicated that it accepted all of the recommendations made.  The director general will be able to update the committee in that regard.</p></speech>

The Chairman has introduced my team.</p> <p>  The HSE previously acknowledged that it had concerns about aspects of the monitoring and oversight arrangements for the grants paid to outside agencies.  The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General is, therefore, timely and will further assist the HSE in ensuring both the HSE managers responsible for the oversight and monitoring of grants and the agencies in receipt of them will continue to work towards a comprehensive and effective oversight process.  The HSE has provided a briefing paper for the committee which describes the overall governance system in place for the management of the relationship with funded agencies and outlines the various elements introduced to ensure greater accountability and compliance with public sector norms.</p> <p>  The HSE's relationship with the voluntary sector should not be framed in purely negative terms.  I highlight the valuable role the sector plays in the delivery and development of health and personal social services.  The HSE funds 2,279 section 38 and section 39 agencies.  The reality is that the State depends on the voluntary sector for the delivery of many services and voluntary organisations are often the first to identify gaps in services.  At this stage, the agencies accept that expenditure of public funds and, just as importantly for their reputations, other charitable funds will attract greater scrutiny by the funder and the public at large.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's audit shows that there is adequate specification of outputs, that is, that the HSE is clear on what it expects in terms of the quantum and quality of services for the grant to be paid, but that some further work is required on other aspects of the oversight system.</p> <p>  The audit report speaks for itself regarding the Comptroller and Auditor General's assessment of the HSE's approach and performance.  I do not propose, therefore, to recite the detail of the report.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has made three recommendations: the need for the HSE to include an assessment of the effectiveness of governance structures in its monitoring procedures; a need to highlight responsibilities for the monitoring of key performance indicators; and a need for compliance with the monitoring arrangements specified in service arrangements.  These recommendations are agreed to and progress on their implementation is being made.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General acknowledges that the annual compliance statement process, the external governance reviews commissioned by the HSE, the HSE internal audits and the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General in this examination and previous audits all point towards a number of governance issues arising across the sector, in particular non-compliance with procurement rules and regulations, non-compliance with public sector pay policies and the absence of internal audit functions.</p><p>To address these governance issues, the HSE has taken steps to enable agencies to have greater access to the HSE procurement systems and has provided training and guidance to external agency staff.  The executive has also taken steps to maintain the focus on compliance with public sector pay policy by all agencies and it will continue to subject agencies to greater scrutiny, in particular, through the HSE's national HR processes.  The HSE has also taken steps to emphasise a requirement for the establishment of an appropriate internal audit function, or the accessing of internal audit resources, as set down in the service arrangement.<br/><br/>There has been significant progress in effectively overseeing and monitoring the payment of grants, and compliance levels by agencies have improved.  The HSE will continue to develop its systems and it will, for example, establish contract management support units in the community health care organisations, CHOs, to ensure that matters such as the recommended frequency of monitoring meetings is met in all cases and that the oversight of multi-agreement agencies is co-ordinated.<br/><br/>The HSE will also further develop its IT system to streamline the oversight and monitoring administrative processes.  However, irrespective of how sophisticated and extensive the HSE systems are, the HSE cannot guarantee that every agency it funds will meet all its obligations.  In the past, the challenges faced by the sector <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the HSE are rooted in governance issues.  Good governance is fundamental to the effective delivery of services and the sustainability of agencies.  The HSE is not, and does not wish to be, the regulator for the sector and neither does the HSE wish to micromanage external agencies.  The HSE, like all public funders relies, and must be able to rely, on agencies' audited accounts.  The importance of a robust statutory external audit process cannot be overestimated.  Like all public funders, the HSE cannot audit all agencies as that would require an army of auditors.  While agencies should be accountable for the grants made available to them, they should continue to be independent and they should not be so constrained that the innovation and drive they bring to services is lost.<br/><br/>Once again, I welcome the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and I can confirm that the HSE is working to implement the recommendations made and address the concerns identified.</p></speech>

One of the exchanges between Mr. O'Brien and me concerned the role of the HSE and whether there were failings.  I put the question to him whether there were any failings on the HSE side and he said there were none.  I have the transcript here.  He said:</p><blockquote>[I]t is a different thing.  We are talking about learnings, as the Chairman asked us earlier about learnings.  Learnings are not necessarily the result of failings; they are learnings.</blockquote> <p>We have now heard from internal audit.  Does Mr. O'Brien still hold the view, given what is before us now, which is a snapshot of 19 funded organisations showing in most cases the issues identified by internal audit, that there were no failings on the HSE side in terms of compliance or enforcement, or would he now have a different view?</p></speech>

I stand by the answer I gave in the specific case, and it is important for us to remind ourselves that we are talking about what was a rogue agency.  The issues that surfaced in the internal report related to the use by that body of funds which were not provided by the HSE and in respect of which there were, over successive years, clean audit certificates which entirely misrepresented the position.  Clearly that has changed our view as to how much reliance the HSE can place on audit certificates, although there is no option but to place a good degree of reliance on them.</p></speech>

Every one of the findings had a high priority.  The report said that the totality of the findings had national implications for the HSE.  He was very clear that it points to failings of compliance and enforcement.  Internal audit is entitled to have a different opinion from the director general, and it has given that.

My opinion on Console is that the audit report clearly pointed to systemic issues.  One of the consequences of that is that Console is no longer here and the HSE no longer funds it.  The HSE had to be clear about ensuring there was a replacement service before defunding.  It remains the case that what the internal auditors found was the flagrant misuse of charitably given funds, not HSE funds.  That went right to the heart of the honesty of the HSE's relationship with that organisation, which meant that it could no longer have such a relationship.  That does have generalisable lessons, to use the phrase I used at the time, which does affect the way both internal audit, management and the compliance unit relate to those types of organisations.</p> <p>  On the other issues, on a quarterly basis the national director for internal audit presents a report at the national leadership team meeting of the HSE which covers all the audits concluded in that period, with a summary of all the findings, graded by classification.  The findings and their generalisability are discussed, and then there is a process as part of that report of tracking the extent to which recommendations have or have not been closed out in terms of previous audits.  These audits are taken seriously.  They are used as a way of changing the way the HSE carries out its business as an organisation.</p></speech>

I am simply trying to establish if the HSE, at a corporate level, accepts that there were potential failings in terms of compliance and enforcement.  I am not entirely satisfied with the witness's response, but I am entitled to draw a conclusion and the witness is entitled to give his view.</p></speech>

Whether the mistakes are of the funded organisations or the HSE, mistakes must be learned from.  In terms of lessons learned, what changes were made in practices, policies and procedures?  That is what I want to establish.</p> <p>  There is a table on the screen which shows the 19 audited reports which framed the basis of the previous table which generalised the areas of concern.  The types of issues identified by internal audit are a high number of bank accounts, incomplete accounting records, transactions not authorised at appropriate levels, expenditure on gifts and entertainment, poor audit trails over credit card expenditure, absence of policies and procedure regarding conflicts of interest of board members and confidential disclosures, board members not completing Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, returns, salary payments in excess of the Department of Expenditure and Public Reform pay scales, senior staff in receipt of allowances and round-sum payments, staff in receipt of bonus payments, procurement issues including contracts awarded without competitive procurement processes, and documentary evidence not retained for the awarding of contracts.  When I look at all of that, the similarities to Templemore jump out at me.  There were high numbers of bank accounts, incomplete accounting records, unauthorised transactions, and expenditure on gifts and entertainment.  It strikes me that this is something that should concern us.</p> <p>  We then look at the 19 different organisations.  I refer the witness to item No. 8.</p><p>The witness breaks the areas of concern down into five broad headings with subheadings.  For Console they are 1b and c, and 2a and b.  Almost all fall foul of the areas of concern but they are not the only ones.  Some have not appeared on our radar and I am trying to understand or establish what the issues are in these organisations and what corrective action has been taken.  The concerns raised about the Catholic Institute for Deaf People are a high number of bank accounts, incomplete accounting records, absence of financial procedures and controls, expenditure on gifts and entertainment, poor audit trails over credit card expenditure, salary payments in excess of approved pay scales, senior staff in receipt of allowances and lump sum payments, staff in receipt of bonus payments and contracts awarded without competitive procurement.  That is just one example.  What is this organisation?  How many people does it employ?  What level of funding does it get from the HSE?</p></speech>

Can Mr. O'Brien give us his view of what improvements have been made?  I have read his opening statement and have read some other documents he supplied.  These seem to suggest that his response involves more communication and form filling but is short on sanction.  That concerns me.</p></speech>

I think the committee should take comfort from the fact that we have a well-developed internal audit function and a compliance function which address these issues.  The reason we can tell the committee about these deficits and the reason they are being addressed and improved is precisely because we have a pro-active programme of audit.</p></speech>

I would argue that we and the HSE need more powers in respect of compliance.  Has Mr. O'Brien asked for more powers?  Has he examined more powers to ensure there is greater enforcement in compliance and sanctions?  Does the HSE need more powers?  Is that something the Oireachtas can help it with?  I do not think, with respect, that more paperwork is a reasonable response but that is all I hear today.  If the HSE needs more powers and if compliance needs to be strengthened, Mr. O'Brien should tell us because that is our job, to robustly examine policies, procedures and practices.  Mr. O'Brien should tell us if he needs the powers.</p></speech>

The processes I have talked about are much more significant than emails and letters.  They are direct dialogue and meetings with boards.</p> <p>  Most of this set of organisations is relatively small organisations, true voluntary bodies, ordinary well-meaning but not always well-equipped individuals trying to do their very best for cohorts of people in a context where the regulatory burden we impose on others can be quite complex.  We start from a point of assisting them to improve.  That is the primary purpose of internal audit.  Where we find barn door problems we take much more dramatic action.  As the HSE, we could do one of two things: identify problems and have a process which involves eliminating them, getting the organisation into a better state while protecting its services, or the cover-your-arse approach, which, frankly, I do not take, and simply stop the funding because at some point I will have a difficult conversation like this one at the PAC and the people who are the beneficiaries of the service suffer as a result.  We try to work with service providers to assist them in improving their compliance.  That is why I say it starts from that place.  If, however, we are not getting a suitable response, if what we find is absolutely unacceptable then we go a different route but also seek to protect the service providers.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Brien signed a statement on internal financial control on 16 May 2017.  There are 17 pages, and they point out serious issues to the Department.  The statement points out the problems quite openly to the Department of Health.  What is the response of the Department of Health to that statement?</p></speech>

There are serious issues raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General in regard to financial controls, the absence of internal financial controls and governance.  Over 50% of the sample is involved.  Does the Department of Health accept that there is a serious problem in regard to governance in regard to these different organisations?</p></speech>

When I read and re-read, however, I conclude that there seems to be a trend, not just from Console.  The effect of Console is still evident on the ground, with organisations on the ground suffering as a result.  Employees are also affected, as raised repeatedly at this level.</p> <p>  "Systemic" was the word used.  When we look at the sample from the Comptroller and Auditor General and Mr. Flynn's sample, we note the issues are not just once-off.  Console was not a once-off.  There are serious problems coming back.  I refer to simple things.  We have been talking about section 38 and section 39.  The vast amount of money goes to section 38.  There are different governance arrangements for the two, which I understand.  I refer to simple things under section 39, such as the chairperson of the organisation or board not coming back with a statement at the end of the year.  The high numbers of bank accounts etc. comprise more than just a once-off.  Is that not the case?</p></speech>

Somebody asked last year for the cost of all these.  The figure is in millions of euro and we have not even included the new ones.

We are talking about an audit, an internal audit, an audit committee and all the extra layers we are now learning about, which are costing millions.  We know they are costing millions because I have the information here, and I have not even got the up-to-date figures.  Would it not be better to resource internal auditing?</p></speech>

That is one of the improvements that has occurred.  As to how one would divide resources between internal audit and management, internal auditing is kind of a post-event practice.  One is finding out what has not happened or what has happened that should not have happened.</p><p>There must be a balance between the resources we put there, and if I had them I would put more resources there, and the resources at the front end of the relationship which are designed to manage not just financial compliance but also the quality of services, the interests of the clients and so forth.  That is part of the area we are focusing on both by resourcing the community health organisations to develop and deepen that relationship on the one hand and through the compliance unit - the Deputy is shaking her head but I will finish - to help a large number of voluntary people involved in voluntary governance to do their thing better.</p></speech>

At one point we would have had 555 business cases that would have indicated non-compliance.  We have dealt with 235 of those.  As I said, some of those are quite minor issues that relate to people not being paid on the appropriate scale, perhaps a play therapist being paid as an attendant and so forth, and one must get those correct because under the strict letter of the law they do not comply with public pay policy.  We are working on 320 at present.  That is a work in progress.  Those are 320 business cases from 15 agencies.  I have the breakdown of the agencies and the number of the relevant business cases.  They would have come to our attention through responses to the communications I issued, notification from internal audit and notification from the compliance unit.  The matter is very much under control.  It is getting a great deal of focus.  We are working very constructively with these agencies and it is not punitive.  We cannot deem them compliant so there is a process of engagement and dialogue around that - looking at the business case, discussing it with our funders in the Department and then deeming it compliant or not.  Some of it relates to employee relations, ER, and industrial relations, IR, issues as well.  Somebody might already have an entitlement to retain an allowance so there would be-----</p></speech>

By and large, and Michael Flynn referred to this, there is approximately 80% compliance with the recommendations.  We have some tolerance because some of them simply take longer to fix.  However, if we get to a point that we get an assurance that an audit recommendation has been complied with and subsequently find that it has not been complied with, that will have a financial consequence.

I ask the Chairman to indicate when I have three minutes remaining as I wish to address a couple of issues.</p> <p>  We cannot throw all of these organisations under a bus because we need the services that some of them provide.  At the same time, we are in a pitiful position in terms of providing the level of oversight that would give members of the public the peace of mind they are entitled to in respect of expenditure of &euro;4 billion per annum, which a substantial sum of money.  If we continue with a process that is, by consensus, insufficient, with Mr. Flynn completing 19 or 20 audits each year, it will take us 113 years to get through all these organisations.  The HSE has provided a useful table setting out the audits carried out on 19 organisations, which shows that multiple breaches were recorded in three or more areas in almost 65% of audits.  It stands to reason that there is a very serious problem with governance and, potentially, misappropriation of funds in at least some organisations which have been designed to feather the nests of individuals.</p> <p>  This is a matter of grave concern, which requires a wholesale investigation.  I mean no disrespect to the witnesses but it appears the HSE is not capable of carrying out such an investigation.  An army may well be required to do this given the public interest involved, the &euro;4 billion at stake with the percentage of breaches emerging each year.  Last year, the examination carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General made similar findings.  I spent two years locked in a room adjacent to this one discussing banking.  This sounds similar to the Central Bank light touch approach which involves learning and teaching rather than imposing sanctions.  This approach does not serve us well, as we saw in the difficulties with tracker mortgages this week.  We, and those who come after us, will spend the next 113 years identifying the same difficulties.  With respect, the Department of Health and Minister must scope out what needs to be done to adequately manage these organisations and have an appropriate system in place.  That is my commentary on what we have heard so far. </p></speech>

Such a generalisation would not be good thing to do.  In this period, most of the organisations we are looking at on this table are the smaller section 39 agencies, most of which are operating in what would broadly be called the charitable sector.  We need collectively to remind ourselves that there has been a move forward in terms of charity sector regulation.  The HSE does not have regulatory powers.  Clearly, the charities regulator is developing and growing capacity in that area and it may be the more fundamental piece of this jigsaw.</p> <p>  Let us remind ourselves that what we found in Console was not about public funds but about the use of the public's funds, namely, the donated funds.  We would be much more comfortable if we operated in an environment where there was a qualifying criterion that we could rely on that was done externally.  In the alternative, if the committee is of the view, which it may be, that we need to do much more in this area, I would not object in any way if the Government decided to give us, from resources that did not come from core health services, resources to beef up our internal audit division and other sectors.  As it stands, if I were to give Mr. Flynn an extra auditor, I would have to take away a nurse or doctor or some other category of staff.  Those are the hard choices that we have to make.  </p></speech>

It is clear that the system is totally inadequate.  Even if everything is being done correctly by all these organisations, and it is reasonable to believe that is not the case given the percentages we have seen, what we have is not fit for purpose.</p> <p>  What level of duplication is there in the 2,500 organisations?

While they might provide similar services to those provided in other localities, one would not really call it duplication.  There are in the social care division a number of discussions ongoing about mergers, either of entire organisations or of the back office support services for those organisations.  There is clearly a cost effectiveness and an efficiency gain to be had by the amalgamation of some of these providers but that would be done in the context of their remaining as section 39 or voluntary providers rather than seeking to turn them into State assets.</p></speech>

Procurement is a highly litigious environment, which is why we are quite careful about how we do it.  In this instance, for these agencies, this is about bringing them within the scope of our procurement activity, providing them with training and support and enabling them to leverage contracts that we are putting in place.  As the committee already knows, the HSE itself has difficulties in these areas.  Many of these small organisations would not have the capacity to carry out public procurement to the standards that we would require so we are seeking to bring them within the scope of what we do ourselves.  As to how many cases there have been with failed bidders, I do not have that information but we can get it for the Deputy.</p></speech>

The following groups are voluntary hospice groups, Galway Hospice, Marymount Hospice, Cork, Milford Hospice in the mid-west, North West Hospice, Sligo and St. Francis Hospice in Raheny.  All of these facilities have confirmed to the HSE that they were directed by it to implement pay cuts under both the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, Act and the Haddington Road agreements of 2010 and 2013 and that all resulting savings arising from these cuts were fully recouped by the HSE at the time.

Arising from the economic recession in 2009-2010 cuts were made to the overall funding of organisations.  In the case of section 38 employees, there was a requirement to strictly impose the FEMPI pay cuts.  In regard to section 39 agencies, their budgets were cut and they were required to have regard to the effect on public pay policy of the FEMPI cuts but how they applied the cuts was a matter for them.  It is also true that in many instances they applied the FEMPI cuts and there is currently an issue, which I think is the point the Deputy is getting at, about-----</p></speech>

The staff working in these areas are highly trained professionals, doing remarkably similar or identical work to their section 38 counterparts, all of whom have had their pay restored under the Lansdowne Road agreement.  All of these staff have long established and recognised contractual pay linkages with HSE consolidated pay scales.  For the hospice sector to maintain these linkages additional funding has been given in the past from the HSE, when required.  Will this additional funding requirement for the voluntary hospice group be addressed before the end of 2017?  Has the necessary application been made by the HSE to the Department for additional funding within the 2018 HSE budget estimate process to deal with this issue?</p></speech>

The staff in the section 39 organisations are not public servants.  They are not covered by the public service agreements.  We are aware of pay pressures and other pressures in the section 38 and section 39 agencies.  That is part of the ongoing conversation we would have with our funders but we do not have, and certainly will not have before the end of 2017, any specific additional resource identified for that purpose.  As indicated by the director general there was not a uniform approach applied across the section 39 sector and, therefore, its resolution is unlikely to be uniform.</p></speech>

In terms of the committee's work, we commented earlier on the issue of additional regulation and if with additional funding the HSE could do more on the section 39 issues discussed at that time.

Leaving that issue to one side, they appear to work effectively as section 39 agencies.  If they became public sector agencies that would have much wider implications for them.  It would limit their freedoms and it would also have significant public policy implications which would require, I think, detailed consideration in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform at political level.  I do not think the answer can be a simple "Yes, it would be better" or "No, it would be worse" but I do think the question would not be arising at all if they did not have the difficulty with regard to pay.</p></speech>

That is now at the stage where we have signed a contract with the software provider.  We have to design an implementation plan and also procure an implementation partner.  It will be at least 12 to 18 months before the process is completed.  After that, we will then begin implementing the system in the HSE's statutory services, then the larger section 38 agencies, then all of the section 38 agencies, and then possibly some of the larger section 39 agencies.  It will be a number of years before that integrated system is fully rolled out.</p></speech>

Is there a postcode lottery with service provision?  For example, in the case of Enable Ireland services, it depends if one has an organisation in one's area.

Whether an individual service provider is used as a funded entity will obviously depend on whether it provides services.  It is often the case that in one area we would use a voluntary provider to provide service A.  In another area, we might use either a different service voluntary provider or have direct provision.  In the case of any of those examples, they are typically organisations that provide their services within a discrete geographical area, while in a different area those services could be provided in a different way.</p></speech>

Paragraph 19.29 reads: "The HSE stated that it is establishing a strategic community costing programme to determine unit costs of services so that providers can understand where their costs might be out of line with peers for similar service offerings".  Why would this only have been happening in 2016?  This strikes me as something that would be good financial management.</p></speech>

On the hospital side, there is an activity-based funding programme.  It is still in its early stages and is supported by considerably more information technology and software systems than we have on the community side.  Generally speaking, there is a significant lack of information systems across the community sector.  If we can secure investment, our electronic health record, EHR, programme will seek to address that over the next ten years.</p> <p>  In the meantime, we have been making improvements.  Committee members will see mention in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report of clear performance indicators that we are trying to gather so that we can reference performance, including financial performance, in the community.  Even abroad, it is traditionally more complex to determine why a service costs more or less in one area than in another.  This is a large piece of work that is only now starting and will need to be supported through significant IT investment.</p></speech>

We have heard about whether the sample was targeted and a known problem was picked out.  There is oversight yet again by an external body, such as Deloitte in this case, and is likely to be an occurrence every year.</p> <p>  Something is screaming out at me.  It is a policy issue.  There is an abdication of responsibility for what is a public service as opposed to something else.  Mr. O'Brien does not have to answer.  It is just that-----</p></speech>

Pretty much the entire health and social care delivery system started out in the voluntary sector.  Many of the organisations that we now refer to as section 38 organisations, or even some of the facilities and services that are provided as a core part of the HSE's business, were originally established in the voluntary sector.  Dr. Maev-Ann Wren's book, <i>Unhealthy State: Anatomy of a Sick Society</i>, charts some of this in an interesting way.  Slowly by accretion, we have turned what were voluntary bodies into State bodies.  A hospital like Our Lady of Lourdes in Drogheda was a section 38-provided entity.  Now it is fully part of the HSE.  An entity like the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital was once truly voluntary but is now a section 38.  There are a plethora of other organisations.<br/><br/>Philosophically, there comes a time when - the process that the Minister has established will contribute to this - we must ask what is the right relationship between the things that the State does versus the things that the State might pay others to do.  This is the Deputy's point.</p></speech>

It difficult to have a rights-based approach if one does not have control of the organisation or if there is such a variety of organisations that the application and standards in areas differ.</p></speech>

A number of them are companies and will file with the Companies Registration Office, CRO.  They will all file with us.  The Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned some.

Has it been built into their funding mechanism?  There were salary cuts when the crash happened.  Has the restoration of funding from the HSE to those organisations taken account of public service pay provisions?  Staff in these organisations are not public servants, but the retention of staff and so on will be a factor - I have seen this to be a factor - if competition is not between like and like.</p></speech>

That has not been the case.  The principal reason is that the HSE's own funding allocation has not reflected the additional cost of pay restoration, for want of a better term, in the section 39 sector.</p></speech>

Section 39s were subject to cuts.  One would have expected a <i>quid pro quo</i>, in that, when there was some recovery, the same criteria would have applied.  It is undoubtedly leading to a different pattern of service delivery, in that there cannot be a continuity of care.</p></speech>

There probably needs to be a central decision on this because we are looking at voluntary providers in the health sector and other sectors, and a decision in the health sector would have consequences for other sectors, so that is probably a central decision.  Our view is that those involved in those bodies are not public servants and, at this stage, there has not been a decision to restore pay to the extent that pay was cut.  It was said previously that, while we cut grants, we are not absolutely sure that there was uniformity of treatment in the grant cuts.  Some agencies may have cut pay and others may not.  We are not sure of the extent-----</p></speech>

There will be a deficiency of service because if there is an option to go and work somewhere else, people will choose it.  I definitely see that pattern.  It is not just about people's pay.  It will be about the ability to deliver services too.  Mr. Dempsey tells me that the Department of Finance essentially does not give the Department of Health enough money to deal with this.

We have made it clear that our contracting arrangements cover publicly funded voluntary bodies, including section 38 bodies.  Our support is available for them.  We are taking practical steps to provide more access to our contracts, to training, and to other supports in order that it is more practical for both section 39 bodies, particularly larger ones, and section 38 bodies, to use our overall shared procurement service.  The one voice procurement policy is part of Government policy.  We are on a three-year journey to get to the stage where we can have a very significant and good-quality level of public procurement compliance, and we are looking to bring the section 38 and 39 bodies that are not already there to that point.  Some already have good practices in that area.  We are trying to improve their procurement compliance, remembering that our primary interest in section 38 and section 39 bodies has to and always will be the quality and safety of service that they deliver.  Procurement is part of that.</p></speech>

That funding can be restored once the necessary documentation has been handled.  There is a separate process where the level of funding to be agreed in each year is reviewed.  There are often reductions and there are savings targets.  Everything that the Deputy sees in the HSE's service plan about targets set for us globally is then reflected throughout our system in the service arrangements.  This specific matter is about the failure to sign by a given date and that is when 20% of funding is withheld.</p></speech>

As part of that, one of the recommendations requires a repayment.  St. John of God is participating well in a task force set up by the HSE, which I chair, to work through a range of those issues.  At the moment, it is not yet finished, but it is accelerating its efforts to provide sufficient information.  We will go through that particular recommendation and the rest and we will have to reach a conclusion on all of them.  I am not saying that the order has accepted that a repayment will be made, but it has certainly accepted that it needs to work through its recommendations with us and we will need to reach a conclusion on that.</p></speech>

I have a few questions, Deputy Connolly may wish to speak again and Deputy Murphy may have some final questions.  I will address the audit side.  In the HSE's annual report and financial statement for 2016, the section dealing with the directorate members' report is on page 135 and it addresses the membership of the audit committee.  The following individuals are members of the audit committee: Mr. Peter Cross, from the private sector, who is the chairman; Mr. Joe Mooney, former principal officer in the Department of Finance; Mr. John Hynes, former Secretary General of the then Department of Social Protection; Mr. David Smith, principal officer in the Department of Health; Mr. Stephen McGovern from CRH; Dr. Sheelah Ryan, public health physician and former CEO of HSE West; Professor Patricia Barker, chartered accountant, director of Tallaght hospital and former vice president of academic affairs in DCU; and Ms Anne O&rsquo;Connor, the HSE's national director of mental health.</p> <p>  To summarise that, there are two HSE staff or former staff, three current or former civil servants and three from outside the HSE.  The HSE's audit committee is for all of the HSE and not just section 38 and 39 bodies.  The HSE has a throughput of &euro;14 billion or &euro;15 billion per annum.  There are only three non-HSE or current civil servants on the audit committee.  Why is the number so low?  Is that in legislation?  Such a big organisation would benefit from having a majority of its members not being current or former public servants or people immediately connected with the HSE.  I do not get it.  Independence does not jump out at me.</p></speech>

The directorate by its nature comprises full-time HSE officials.  That is how it is composed.  The balance comprises persons considered by the directorate - which has the statutory responsibility to appoint the audit committee on my recommendation, as it happens - to have significant relevant experience.  Given the particular issues that arise for a body in the public sector at the time when this committee was established - it has been refreshed, and there have been some significant changes since this particular report - I believed it was of benefit to have persons who had served as Accounting Officers in the public system, hence the couple of people who were formerly Secretaries General.  However, the chair has no public sector experience and, as the Chairman has identified, there are a number of other members with very significant broadly based experience in the area of accounting, including a senior person from CRH.  It was the balance of competencies and experience and a particular ability to understand the complexities that arise in public sector accounting and the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General and of this committee as distinct from normal private sector accounting.  I also took the view, given the nature of some of the discussions that have to be undertaken, that it would be valuable to have a person nominated to the committee by the Secretary General of the Department of Health, which accounts for the individual who at that point was a Department of Health civil servant.  That became even more important when the role of Accounting Officer moved from the HSE into the Department.  The membership now is slightly different but is-----</p></speech>

Regarding the service level agreements, I have tabled a series of parliamentary questions about all organisations across the entire public service, not just those in the witnesses' area.  I asked to be informed of organisations where there are payments of over &euro;1 million per annum.  I did not go way down.  One paragraph of the reply I got a week or two ago says, "[I]t should be noted that fully signed Service Agreements are now in place for approximately &euro;3.357bn of the &euro;3.574bn total, which [ - these are the ones where payments of over &euro;1 million have been made - ] represents ... 94% of this funding."

Therefore, some of the smaller agencies probably have the highest risk profiles but, as auditors, we cannot avoid the core HSE because we do find things there as well.</p></speech>

I know they are not all published, but the HSE gets them.  I think I saw a reference to the community health care organisations, CHOs, in the different regions having to get a copy of these.  Is there not a mechanism whereby if an organisation has an agreement with the HSE but provides services in five, six, seven or eight CHOs throughout the country, the accounts should not have to go down to each of those managers once it is cleared centrally.  I presume the HSE has that system in place.</p></speech>

We are trying to streamline the process, and the Comptroller and Auditor General has referred to that as well.  We hope to appoint a lead organisation, a lead CHO, which would review the annual financial statements on behalf of all the CHOs, and we would then make that information available to everybody.  One of the Comptroller and Auditor General's issues was that one part of the organisation may not be aware that the accounts have been reviewed by another CHO, so we are streamlining that process.</p></speech>

Should that not be a central function?  If different CHOs are dealing with it and if the financial statements come in centrally, I would have thought there should be a linkage between whoever signs the national service level agreement - we will call it that and we will take a large organisation - and that that section should get its annual financial statement - I ask the witnesses to let me finish the question so they know where I am coming from.  During the course of the summer, the HSE supplied us with information on this.  We had asked for it on a previous encounter and we got letters from the HSE during the course of the summer stating that some of the large organisations had not completed signed agreements.  As Chairman I made that statement public as a result of the HSE's information, and some of those section 38 or section 39 organisations responded directly - I might have sent the witnesses the information - complaining that they had signed service level agreements in seven of the eight CHOs but there was one outstanding and that this gave the impression that that organisation was outstanding in terms of a service level agreement.  I know the HSE does this in two phases and that there is part one and a part two, but surely if the HSE is dealing with an organisation that has a large footprint in several areas, there should be one overall service level agreement because they have only one set of financial statements.</p></speech>

As Mr. Cregan said, whether one does it centrally by the core of the HSE or centrally by one of the CHOs, preferably the one that is the lead CHO for that organisation, the issue is to do it once and to tell the rest of the organisation.  The vast bulk of our voluntary organisations are not big enough to extend beyond one of our nine CHOs, but some very definitely are and some potentially even extend to all of them.  That is just the nature of the business.</p><p>It is imperative for the more important parts of governance that the key relationship, which is covered in schedule 2, is between the local community health care organisation, CHO, and the local part of the service provider to ensure there is real governance across the service, regardless of what other tasks can be done centrally.  If a large service provider has only signed in seven of eight CHOs where it happens to operate in all of them, then it has not completed the process.  That is the reality.</p></speech>

Mr. Mulvany mentioned he received the financial statements as part of their annual audit of financial statements.  I ask him to forward a list of the organisations allocated funding of more than &euro;3 million and the last date of the financial statement he received.  Before he came in, we were talking about the education sector.  While there is a requirement for those in that sector to submit financial statements, some of them are two or three years in arrears.  I would be highly impressed if every one of the organisations that reports to the HSE has already submitted all their 2015 accounts.</p></speech>

Those are public bodies.  The organisations about which the witnesses are speaking are one step removed from public bodies.  The HSE has achieved this because it writes the cheque.  It holds the purse strings.  Some of the third level institutions, the universities, are several years behind in their accounts, and they are public bodies.  The witnesses have achieved a better level of ensuring the return of annual financial statements of all the organisations with which they deal, and they have the 2015 accounts completed.  They are miles ahead with respect to the way in which many other sectors in the public sector operate.  I will ask a soft question in this context.  The witnesses have obviously learned how to deal with this issue.  I am sure if this question was asked of them three years ago, they certainly would not have had that answer.</p></speech>

I will ask Mr. O'Brien, in his own time, to assist this committee in this context.  The HSE has improved a measure and got it right, something that has not happened in other public sector bodies.  We are dealing with major State companies and the Comptroller and Auditor General is still waiting for public bodies to present their accounts for 2015, not to mind the clearance for audit.  Mr. O'Brien might send the committee a note on how he achieved it.  I am asking him to do that by way of assisting the committee with other organisations.  We could do with some of that.  I hope the officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are listening.  We will be having officials from that Department in before us on this particular issue.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has referred to the timeliness of financial reporting in the public sector.  The HSE seems to be making good strides.  It might not be popular to say that today but I have to be straight about it.</p></speech>

Regarding the hospitals, I wish to get the detail on the split of funding, and I acknowledge the witnesses might not have that detail with them.  Of the allocation of &euro;14 billion, or whatever the figure is, approximately &euro;4 billion goes to the section 38 and 39 organisations.  I have asked about this previously and I have been told there is no significant difference in the waiting list in a hospital funded under a section 38 agreement as opposed to a HSE-run hospital.  Regarding the provision for the hospitals, what is the breakdown of the funding for HSE-run hospitals versus hospitals funded by section 38 organisations.  That should be easy to calculate.  Can we get a percentage breakdown of the funding allocated to community health care organisation areas in terms of staff directly funded by HSE versus those directly funded by sections 38 or 39 organisations?

That means they represent about 53% of the total grants.  If the Chairman is asking what percentage they are of the total hospital budget in 2016, I would have to come back to the committee with the actual figure but it was slightly north of &euro;4 billion.  Those 16 hospitals are a third of the total number of hospitals but I estimate those grants represent 55% to 60%, closer to 50%, of the total budget.  They tend to be the bigger hospitals.

Mr. Mulvany will give us those figures.  I do not want to go into this in detail because it is not the topic we are discussing, but I note the replies we have all got to parliamentary questions relating to people seeking home help service, some of which is provided by organisations funded through section 39 agreements.  I could paper my walls with the replies which we have all got.  The reply is to the effect that a person has been approved for the additional home help hours but they are on a waiting list.  Everyone agrees that the person should have the service but there is not the money to provide it.  Some of those providers are funded directly by the HSE and some are funded through section 39 organisations.  That is why I am asking about this.  Will the witnesses forward a reply detailing how many approved home help hours are on a waiting list and dependent on section 39 organisations to deliver?  I am sure they get the gist of my question.</p></speech>

The process is much quicker because it is a funded in a different way.  There was a period two and a half years ago when there was a significant interval between approval and availability of a bed and the capacity to provide funding, but now there is not a discrepancy and the average time involved is about four weeks, which is literally the time that it practically takes to get a bed.</p><p>It is not a financial limitation that is causing a delay.  </p><p> Regarding home help and home care packages, the total budget is not sufficient to meet total current demand.  </p></speech>

Last year after Mr. O'Brien appeared before us, he sent a comprehensive letter setting out the cost of the audit committee and of the compliance unit.  Could he update us on that?  He told us at that point that the internal audit function had 49 staff and cost &euro;2.96 million.  The letter is dated 25 July.  Can Mr. O'Brien update me regarding current staff numbers, what the HSE has put in for and the cost?  It was said that the compliance unit had 12 staff members and an estimated cost of &euro;845,000.  Added to that is the contract management support units.  If Mr. O'Brien could set those out for me along with their cost, I would appreciate it.</p></speech>

If the HSE can do it, the Department can do it.  The HSE probably had the facility of saying it was withholding 20% of funding until it got this.  While we are not suggesting any cut in public funding, the Department should just think about it.  I am not suggesting it.  I am saying it seems to have worked right across the health sector, which is &euro;4 billion of public expenditure for those organisations, and that principle seemed to have a good effect.  Nobody suggested there was any cut to organisations' funding but it did put pressure on them to do it.</p> <p>  A couple of years ago, the Committee of Public Accounts dealt with issues regarding the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC, Rehab and St. John of God, as well as pay in different maternity and children's hospitals and executives not being paid in line with public sector pay policy.  On the face of it, the HSE seems to have come a long way since then.  Does Mr. O'Brien agree?  Could he make a brief comment from his perspective as chief executive?  What were the key ingredients?  Is it as good as it sounds?  Was it very difficult dealing with those organisations?  The HSE seems to be close to a reasonably satisfactory situation.  What were the lessons that should be learned for the public service?  </p></speech>

It will never be fully repainted and is an ongoing constant grind.  The work of our own internal audit committee and various HSE national directors, the contribution of the Committee of Public Accounts and the public response to some of the issues exposed in the CRC, which was a very different organisation then to the CRC of today, have changed the environment around compliance with policy and the appropriate use of public funds.  The Console affair also played into that to some extent.  The HSE has put in place additional procedures to help move things along but I do not think there will ever be room for complacency.  My colleague, Mr. John Cregan, as the committee may recall, was the person we put in as a special administrator-----</p></speech>

We were committed to preserving it as the type of organisation it is in terms of its service ethos and not incorporating it into the HSE.  We put in Mr. Cregan and put in place a process through board match to re-establish it as an independently managed organisation.  It has made great strides and it is interesting that it is currently being considered for a good governance award.  What it proves to me is that where at times we may have to take quite a heavy approach, force changes of personnel and so on, there is great value in many of these organisations and our approach must be one that protects the services they provide, while dealing with the governance deficits that exists.  That has been at the core of our philosophy as we approach this.  It is at the core of what we are doing now.  The overall environment has changed but our purpose continues to be to protect the service while dealing with the governance deficits and not throwing the baby out with the bath water.</p></speech>

That flushes out all of the payments and brings a focus to whether bodies want to be seen to be paying very significant figures.  It is a requirement in the code of practice, which the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has published.  I think it has been there for State bodies since 2009 but it has not necessarily percolated through to some voluntary sector bodies.  Insisting on that as part of the audited financial statements could be another lever in ensuring there is compliance.</p></speech>
