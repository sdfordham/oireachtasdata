Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  Two issues arise from the minutes.  A committee delegation will visit Ethiopia at the end of November.  Full details of the programme and the cost of sending the delegation will be published.  The details, which are being finalised by Irish Aid in consultation with the committee, will be published on the website as soon as they become available.</p><p>  The second issue relates to our discussion in private session last week about making submissions relating to our forthcoming examination of chapter 7 of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General which deals with the penalty points system.  At last week's meeting, we discussed the implications of taking such submissions and the need to ensure any submissions relate solely to the issues in the report.  In that regard, the committee agreed that such submissions would be sent directly to the parliamentary legal adviser as the committee has discretion to return the documents.  Having forwarded such submissions, they would subsequently be the subject of parliamentary privilege.  I have been given documentation on penalty points which I will hand over to our legal adviser.  We will await her advice as to what we should do with these documents.  This approach is in accordance with the agreement reached by the committee last week. </p><p>  We have received correspondence since the meeting of Thursday, 3 October 2013 from Accounting Officers and Ministers.  No. 3A.1 is correspondence dated 27 June 2013 from Mr. Matthew Elderfield, deputy Governor, financial regulation, Central Bank of Ireland, in which he provides additional information requested by the committee at its meeting of 13 June 2013.</p></speech>

An e-mail I sent to the chief financial officer of the HSE at 10.32 p.m. on 21 August remains unanswered.  Its subject was the erroneous decision to apply the terms of the Haddington Road agreement to Sunbeam House Services, a disability service provider in my constituency.  I understand this issue is not confined to my constituency, however.  The HSE was supposed to apply the provisions of the Haddington Road agreement to disability service providers, meaning their budgets were to be reduced by the percentage applied under the agreement.  There is substantial evidence in the case of my constituency and a number of other constituencies that the HSE has reduced funding for disability service providers by a higher amount.  Not only does this affect staff pay and working conditions, as intended, but transport services have also ceased in a number of a disability service providers and other services have been reduced.  As a public representative, I corresponded with the chief financial officer on 21 August last seeking comment on this issues, which affects people with a disability daily.  That I have not been shown the courtesy of a reply almost two months later is appalling.</p><p>  The issue I raised with the chief executive officer has been covered extensively in terms of its effects on people with a disability.  I ask that the committee put the HSE on notice that we wish to discuss with it the manner in which it is applying the Haddington Road agreement to disability service providers.  When we discussed this issue last week with the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Mr. Watt, we were informed that a commitment was made in the talks on the new public sector agreement to make savings of &euro;150 million.  A couple of weeks later, the chief financial officer of the HSE issued a circular to his subordinates stating the organisation would only save &euro;104 million.  Either through incompetence or for much more sinister reasons, disability groups are paying a heavy price through reduced services.  I ask that we put the HSE on notice that the committee intends having a serious discussion with its representatives on the erroneous manner in which the Haddington Road agreement is being applied in the health service. </p><p>  On Saturday, the <i>Daily Mail</i> published a three page story, which must have been based on a leak, on a HSE audit report into another disability group in my constituency.  Serious issues arise as a result of this report.  First, who in the HSE is leaking information on the expenditure of taxpayers' money?  Second, the committee must discuss with the HSE what checks and balances are in place for the expenditure of millions of euro through third parties.  Obtaining answers from HSE representatives who appear before this committee is like pulling teeth.  As a public representative and member of this committee, I contacted the chief financial officer of the HSE on an issue of great importance and did not even receive the courtesy of a response.  I ask for the assistance of the committee in obtaining an answer.  </p></speech>

We have two meetings scheduled for that day.

The Valuation Office, for example, was to submit information on its tribunal of appeal, including its membership and costs.  That has not happened.  There are a number of other cases we should review in the context of our minutes to ensure any outstanding information - I believe there is a lot - is provided for us forthwith because those meetings are now quite dated.</p></speech>

Examples of those matters arising in individual third level institutions were given.  Three matters, in particular, were raised regarding Waterford Institute of Technology.</p><p>  The first matter raised in the special report concerning the institute was control failures regarding the expenses incurred by the office of the president of the institute.  Lapses in control were identified in the course of the audit of the 2009-10 financial statements.  These included insufficient details provided of goods and services acquired or payments made using a corporate credit card allocated to the president, the absence of evidence of the business purpose of goods and services purchased, the use of the credit card to purchase gifts, and an instance where subsistence appeared to have been paid in respect of a period during which restaurant meals and room service had also been charged to the credit card.  Subsequent to the audit, the chairman of the governing authority commissioned an in-depth review of the non-pay expenses incurred by the office of the president and an interim report was produced in May 2011.  A further review, concentrating on spending in the period 2009 to 2011, was commissioned and this was reported on in December 2012.  I understand the president of the institute will update the committee on the actions taken by the institute in response to these reports.</p><p>  The special report also considered the relationship between third level education institutions and associated fundraising foundations, which are generally established as independent entities.  Normally, funding is expected to flow from the foundations to the associated institutions, but in the course of audit a number of instances were noted where institutions' funds were paid instead to the foundations.</p><p>  In the case of Waterford Institute of Technology, a limited company was established in 2005 to raise funds for the institute.  In 2007 the institute transferred funding of &euro;400,000 to the foundation to meet set-up and initial operating costs.  The funds were sourced from a donation by AIB to support the institute's programme for widening participation in education.  In 2008 the institute provided the foundation with an additional &euro;150,000.  At the end of 2008 the total amount provided for the foundation had been substantially spent.  Ultimately, the foundation failed to raise significant funds for the institute and its activities have since ceased.</p><p>  The primary issue raised in the special report relevant to the institute relates to the operation of a number of companies established to provide a range of ancillary services such as student accommodation, catering, sports and recreational activities and retail outlets.  The scale of operation of the companies expanded over time and they had delivered a number of major capital projects.  The group of companies received substantial block funding from the institute, linked with the institute's income from annual student contributions and a banking franchise.  While a note to the institute's financial statements gives summary information on the companies' operations, their results were not consolidated with those of the institute.  Based on the nature and pattern of interaction between the institute and the companies, we concluded that they were part of the normal services typically provided on the campuses of third level institutions and that they should be included in consolidated accounts produced by the institute.</p><p>  Following the last meeting of the committee, the Minister for Education and Skills commissioned a statutory inspection to review the relationship between the institute and the companies.  The report of the inspector was published in July 2013.  I note that the inspector has recommended that the companies be restructured as subsidiaries of the institute and that the institute should then produce consolidated financial statements for the group.</p><p>  I wish to mention the status of the audit of the institute's financial statements.  The institute suspended finalisation of the financial statements for 2010-11 while the various investigations were being undertaken.  In addition, the audits of the 2011 financial statements of the ancillary companies were not completed until May 2013.</p></speech>

I invite you to do that now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-10a.34" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ruaidhr&iacute; Neavyn" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013101000005#D00300"><p>This is a detailed statement to cover the issues that were discussed at the last meeting.  Waterford Institute of Technology welcomes the opportunity to advise the Committee of Public Accounts, PAC, on matters referred to in the special report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and accepts the conclusions reached in the report.</p><p>  I wish to focus on three items: specific transactions relating to flights and expenditure in the office of the former president, the financial consolidation of companies providing services to WIT and the report that the Minister issued under section 20 of the Institutes of Technology Acts on the relationship between Waterford Institute of Technology and companies providing campus services to it.</p><p>  I will set out the nature of specific transactions relating to flights.  At the meetings of 27 September 2012 and 4 October 2012 the PAC raised several queries in respect of chartered flights.  Since then, the institute has completed an internal review of expenditure on flights in the office of the former president.  As part of the expenditure review, the institute examined available documentation and made contact with and received responses from the former president, the former chairman, Dr. Jim Port, Bell Airways, Fewer Harrington &amp;amp; Partners and Deloitte.  As a result of this review I can confirm that two invoices were paid for flights connected to the institute's application for university designation under section 9 of the Universities Act and a review of the application performed by Dr. Jim Port.  The first invoice was for a one-way flight from Waterford to Dublin for a group of four on 20 March 2007.  The flight was connected to Dr. Port's review of the institute as part of the application for university designation and the trip taken by him and others at WIT to a meeting of Members of the Oireachtas and senior Government officials.  The invoice came from a third party, Fewer Harrington &amp;amp; Partners rather than the providers, Bell Airways.  I am unable to provide a complete explanation for this because Mr. Fewer is now deceased.  However, I have been informed that he was a shareholder of Bell Airways Limited and I can only assume he was involved in that capacity.  I confirm that the invoice was authorised for payment by the former president and amounted to &euro;769.56.</p><p>  The second invoice was received directly from the providers, Bell Airways, and was for a chartered return flight between Bristol Filton and Dublin on 29 June 2007.  The flight was authorised for payment by the former chairman and former president and was arranged to transport Dr. Jim Port to a meeting with the then Taoiseach in Dublin following the completion of Dr. Port's report on the institute's application for university designation.  This invoice was for &euro;4,200.</p><p>  The current governing body of the institute believes that the specific transactions relating to flights were unnecessary and did not represent good value for money, that the procurement and authorisation processes adopted were inappropriate and that the information available regarding these flights was insufficient and inadequate.</p><p>  At the PAC meeting of 4 October 2012, the members expressed concern about the accuracy of the first Deloitte report, specifically relating to flights.  Following the PAC meeting, the institute sought written clarification from Deloitte on how this apparent error had occurred.  In a detailed response Deloitte advised that it had raised a query with the former president about why the invoice for &euro;4,200 did not refer to Waterford if it was a flight from Waterford to Dublin.  The former president advised that the aeroplane may have had to be positioned from Bristol Filton to undertake a flight and this explanation was accepted by Deloitte.  I apologise to members that full information relating to the flights was not available at the time of the last hearing and I wish to provide the following clarification.  Queries regarding flights were first raised at the committee hearing of 27 September 2012.  At that time I was aware of only one invoice for a flight to the value of &euro;4,200.  The institute understood that this related to the one-way flight on 20 March 2007 for a group from Waterford, including Dr. Port, to travel from Waterford to Dublin for a meeting with Members of the Oireachtas and senior Government officials, that is, the first flight described previously.  Following the PAC meeting of 27 September 2012 and subsequent communication with the Comptroller and Auditor General, the institute performed a further review of invoices paid by the office of the former president with a view to identifying any further invoices for flights provided by Bell Airways.</p><p>  On the afternoon prior to the appearance of the HEA and the Department of Education and Science at the Committee of Public Accounts on 4 October the institute located the second third-party invoice from Fewer Harrington &amp;amp; Partners which related to a flight from Waterford to Dublin.  The institute contacted the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Department of Education and Science regarding this invoice and immediately forwarded the information to the Department of Education and Science, the HEA and the PAC on the advice of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The institute accepts that the information was provided at short notice and regrets that the members did not have the full information available to them prior to the commencement of the meeting on 4 October 2012.</p><p>  In March 2011 the institute received a freedom of information request regarding expenditure in the office of the president.  Following the release of this information and discussions with the HEA in April 2011, the institute requested Deloitte to perform a review of non-pay expenses in the office of the president for the period January 2004 to March 2011.  The report, commonly referred to as Deloitte one, confirms that breaches in institute policies and procedures occurred.  Specific deficiencies identified included: breaches of institute policies on hospitality, travel and credit card usage; lack of an appropriate co-ordination process; insufficient reporting in respect of expenditure; in some instances, a lack of appropriate tender processes; and inadequate review of expenditure internally and externally.  However, breaches were confined to the office of the president as a further review of internal financial controls throughout the institute did not identify any issues which caused concerns to the audit committee.</p><p>  Following completion of the first Deloitte report, the institute commissioned Deloitte to perform a second more detailed review of expenditure for the period January 2009 to May 2011.  This report, commonly known as Deloitte two report, was completed in December 2012 following significant discussion by the governing body, the audit committee, Deloitte and the institute's legal advisers.  The purpose of this report was to identify whether for the period in question expenditure was incurred in accordance with the institute's procurement procedures, whether the expenditure was institute-related, whether it represented value for money and whether there was any evidence of expenditure giving rise to a personal benefit for the former president.  This report clearly identifies areas of expenditure where the former president may have received benefit.  On foot of this, in May 2013 the institute completed a detailed internal review of non-pay expenditure in the office of the president for the extended period from 1 January 2007 to 31 May 2011.</p><p>  This review focused on identifying any evidence of personal benefit in the specific expenses categories identified by the second Deloitte report.  This period was selected as it is the limit allowed under the Statute of Limitations should the institute seek to make a claim against the former president.  The result of this expanded review was communicated to the governing body, the audit committee, the institute's legal advisers and the former president through his legal advisers.  As a result of this examination, the institute has issued High Court proceedings against the former president for reimbursement of expenditure.  As this now a legal case I have been advised not to provide any further detail except to reassure Deputies that the matter is being pursued to the fullest possible extent.  The governing body believes that the level and nature of expenditure incurred by the office of the former president during the period investigated was unreasonable and in many instances did not represent good value for money.  The consistent breaching of procedures and lack of controls was unacceptable.  The failure of internal and external systems to identify and flag this level and type of expenditure is also of concern to the governing body.  Financial reporting to the governing body or its audit and finance committees did not at any stage give an indication of aberrant spending by the former president.  The audit committee, which has oversight of the internal audit function, did recommend in 2009 that the application of expenses policy should be reviewed as part of the internal audit plan.  This recommendation was not implemented as the committee was advised by management that this would be reviewed as part of an upcoming Comptroller and Auditor General audit.</p><p>  In concluding this matter I am keen to point out the steps taken by the institute to address the specific in issues to ensure they do not recur.  These include: the significant reduction in the budget of the office of the president, from a peak of &euro;630,000 in 2008 to &euro;140,000 in 2013; the budget of the office is pre-approved by the governing body and expenditure is reviewed biannually by the governing body; the institute's policies on hospitality, travel, credit card usage and mobile telephones have been reviewed, updated and reissued institute-wide; Waterford Institute of Technology internal corporate cards have been withdrawn; an appropriate co-authorisation process has been introduced whereby all orders issued by the president's office require co-authorisation; tendering processes are used in all cases where it is deemed appropriate; a complete review of expenditure has been conducted for 2007 to 2011, and a claim for reimbursement has been served against the former president; foreign travel by the president is pre-approved by the governing body; and the governing body has proposed the introduction of the whistleblower charter to facilitate disclosure of inappropriate expenditure in future - this will require input and agreement at a national level.</p><p>  In the report to the Minister issued under section 20 of the Institutes of Technology Acts, reference was made to the financial consolidation of Diverse Campus Services Limited.  In June 2012 the governing body of the institute approved pursuing the consolidation of DCS companies as subsidiaries of WIT under new governance and management arrangements following recommendations made in the Comptroller and Auditor General report, Matters Arising out of Education Audits, February 2012 and the Grant Thornton report, Review of the WIT Development Committee, its activities, financial controls and governance structures since its establishment, of June 2012.</p></speech>

I appreciate his taking the time to clear up or at least to attempt to clear up some of the outstanding matters from previous meetings.  As Dr. Neavyn himself will acknowledge, this is a sorry chapter in the otherwise proud history of Waterford Institute of Technology and all the members understand his efforts to clear up these legacy matters.  In the first instance, may I refer to areas pertaining to the flights to which Dr. Neavyn referred in his presentation?  It is worth noting that one can get a flight from Bristol to Dublin for approximately &euro;30 and as far as I can establish, this also was the case in 2007.  Moreover, a single train fare would cost one less than &euro;30.  This puts the extravagance involved in this regard into some context.  Who approved the flights and who in general would approve, co-authorise or co-approve payments involving flights or travel of this nature in the institute at that point?</p></speech>

In his submission, Dr. Neavyn has provided some additional information on the second invoice, which was connected to Dr. Port's review of the institute and those two flights.

In the case of Mr. Fewer, I understand he was a member of the board of Bell Airways and I believe I said this in my statement.  The company obviously may have done some work for the institute in the past.  I do not have information to hand in that regard.  However, in respect of the flight, it certainly appears that Bell Airways invoiced Fewer Harrington &amp;amp; Partners for the flight from Waterford to Dublin and that this then was passed onto the institute to the president's office as an invoice from Fewer Harrington Architects.</p></speech>

Just before the last meeting, Dr. Neavyn identified that gap and information and identified where that invoice had been.

Some people may deduce there may have been an effort to mislead Deloitte &amp;amp; Touche, for example, in respect of its examination of the issue.  Would Dr. Neavyn agree with that assessment or was it a genuine mistake?  Was it merely sloppy accounting or was it incompetence?</p></speech>

I will give a brief summary of what occurred.  In the first instance, the Deloitte one report was to provide an overall view of expenditure in the office of the president in terms of whether there were categories of expenditure in breach of policies and procedure and to identify issues such as of value for money achieved in that respect.  A second more detailed study was done in the Deloitte two report specifically looking at a more defined time period in absolute detail in respect of all the invoices and expenditure covering that period.  From that study, specific categories of expenditure were identified as having the potential to provide direct benefit to the former president.  We consulted widely in regard to that with Deloitte, our legal advisers, the governing body and the audit committee and the view was taken that we needed to perform a full review within the statute of limitations time period, defined as the six year limit, for all expenditure in the office of the president under the headings that were identified in the Deloitte two report as being areas where there could be potential benefit for the president.  We compiled that report in that detail and it was forwarded to the former president to seek information and points of clarity from him in the first instance but we received no further points of clarity in return.</p></speech>

We have taken a case at this stage to reimburse expenditure that we believe was a personal benefit to the former president.</p></speech>

The Deputy has hit the nail on the head.  I am conscious that the detailed workings on this are part of the legal case we are taking.  I have been advised not to go into too detailed an analysis because we do not want to prejudice the case.  The headings basically cover the flights the Deputy mentioned, hospitality costs, subsistence payments, taxi charges, book purchases and other categories identified in the Deloitte two report.  I think the Deputy has a copy of the Deloitte two report and those categories are identified in that.  I do not want to go into the detailed workings on the claim because that formed the basis of our case but those are the category areas with which we are dealing.</p></speech>

Appendix 3 of the report contains a list of books purchased through the president's office, including: <i>I Never Fancied Him Anyway </i>by Claudia Carroll; <i>Top Tips of the Baby Whisperer</i>; and <i>Mixed Doubles</i> by Jill Mansell.  These books appear to fall into the categories of chick lit and family planning and child raising, which is fair enough.  However, it is peculiar that they would be procured by the president of an institute of technology.  Were they intended as gifts for staff?  Have they been placed in WIT's library?  Are they being used?</p></speech>

We have carried out an analysis of the books and the number of them that remain in the institute.  We have obviously asked the former president to return any books he has in his personal possession and for explanations in respect of books which, effectively, are not within our library.  A number of texts were bought as gifts for visiting dignitaries or people from overseas.  These were specific books relevant to the history or archive and arts of Waterford.  They were, therefore, purchased for gift purposes.  The Deputy is correct that a number of other texts which would have been bought for personal use and we have sought to discover their whereabouts and whether we can get the back or be given payment in respect of them.</p></speech>

Reference was made to chick lit and other issues.  I need to balance such references with the fact that the institute is now ranked first among all the institutes of technology in Ireland in the context of attracting research funding.  WIT does some very serious work and when I consider that with which we have been presented, I come to the conclusion that it does not contain a great deal of new information.  Basically, it is a rehash of previous reports.  I hope we will conclude our deliberations on this matter today because I am not sure whether they are doing anyone any good.  This matter is the subject of a High Court case and I am of the view that it should be dealt with in that venue.  It is very difficult for the current president of WIT to answer questions about this matter, particularly as he was not on the staff at the time.  It is also very difficult for him to understand the mindset which obtained at the institute some years ago.  He has been placed in a very difficult position and he cannot answer these questions.  Dr. Neavyn has done a very good job in dealing comprehensively with this matter, particularly as he has no responsibility in respect of it.  I hope that after today's deliberations the committee will move on.</p><p>  In view of what I have just said, I wish to shift the focus away from the institute and direct a couple of questions to the Department and the HEA.  How rigorous was the oversight function employed by the Department and the HEA 11 or 12 years ago?  What is the nature of its current oversight function in respect of institutes of technology?  What happened in the president's office during the period in question?  Was the level of oversight which previously obtained sufficiently rigorous?  Did people inform the Department or the HEA that guidelines were potentially being breached?  It is not just the institute which had a function here in terms of oversight.  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Department and the HEA also had responsibility in this regard.</p><p>  A former chairman, Mr. Redmond O'Donoghue, has stated that he was unaware of the excessive spend in the president's office.  The controversy relating to this matter ignited in May 2011.  Two years previously it was widely reported in local newspapers - the story even made the front page of the <i>Waterford News and Star</i> - that there might have been an overspend in respect of the president's new office, which cost almost &euro;160,000.  Did anyone in the Department or the HEA contact the then chairman, who stated that he was not aware of this overspend but about which everyone else in Waterford knew because it had been widely reported?  Did anyone outside the college with an oversight function in respect of it raise any of these issues with the then chairman?  Was he questioned as to whether he knew, or should have known, about what was widely publicised in local newspapers?</p></speech>

From our point of view, there is a cascade of responsibility in the context of ensuring that expenditure is undertaken in an appropriate manner within institutes of technology.  The first part of that cascade is the senior management of the relevant institute.  The senior management at Waterford Institute of Technology had a responsibility to ensure that the issues were addressed.  Following on from that there is the governance of the institute, namely, the audit committee and the governing body.  We all agree and accept there was a failure at governance level in respect of the expenses and in the context of the nature of the interaction with the senior executive of the institute.  The approach we have adopted places primary responsibility on institutions to ensure they address those issues.  A code of practice for the governance of State bodies was not in place when all of this started.  However, it was put in place as the expenditure was under way.  Clearly, the Department had a direct role in respect of the institute until the transfer of responsibility to the HEA in 2007 or 2008.</p><p>  The Department has maintained its role and in the meantime it has have been strengthening the nature of governance and setting down clearly the responsibilities of institutions in terms of their internal audit committees, the need for chairpersons to sign off on appropriate expenditure, etc.  The Department was not aware of difficulties and challenges in respect of the expenses.</p></speech>

The code of practice for State bodies, which is now in place for the institutes of technology, is the most significant change.  There is enhanced co-ordination among the internal audits of the various institutions.  The institutes commonly outsource those audits and collectively learn lessons from them.  Those are two of the key elements.  As we discussed last October, we now have a memorandum of understanding with the Higher Education Authority which sets out our respective responsibilities.</p></speech>

We are looking further at the nature and the role of the Department and the authority in the context of the new performance framework we have put in place.  We are at the final stages of a service level agreement with the authority in that regard.  As a final part of that, having regard to the sorts of issues that have arisen in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and at this committee, the Higher Education Authority is currently preparing advice for us on accountability issues.  We hope to agree a revised accountability framework with the authority for the higher education sector in the near future.</p></speech>

One of the elements of that comprehensive statement on a range of governance issues is a statement that they are acting in accordance with approved procedures regarding travel and subsistence expenses, etc.  The overall governance structure has been strengthened not just because of that, but as a result of a general evolution in the understanding and knowledge of best governance practices in public sector organisations.</p></speech>

It has also led us to review how well the code of governance and other regulatory regimes are working.  We did that shortly after the last meeting of the committee.  The board of the Higher Education Authority has asked the executive to review the entire governance and regulatory arrangement between the authority and the entire system - not just the institutes of technology - having regard to issues like academic freedom and institutional autonomy.  To some extent, this has been prompted by the situation in Waterford.  It has also been prompted by the significant change in the Higher Education Authority's mandate with regard to the higher education sector.  The executive has been asked to review what that relationship should be and whether the authority would recommend to the Minister any legislative changes with regard to our regulatory function.  That work is in train.  As chief executive, I have given a commitment to report to the board on that matter early in the new year.  It arises from elements of what has happened in Waterford and, more broadly, from the new mandate of the Higher Education Authority.</p></speech>

Fair enough.  Can I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General, who obviously was not in this position back then, a variation of that question with regard to his office and auditing going back ten years?  Is he happy that it was carried out as it should have been with regard to the potential breaches of the expenses guidelines?</p></speech>

That year was a bit of a turning point because that was when concern arose about matters in F&Aacute;S.  We recognised at that stage that we needed to do something fundamentally different in our financial audits if we were to identify similar situations in other organisations.  At that stage, we instituted a different approach and added onto the normal financial audit testing, whereby we specifically target issues of propriety.  There is now a long schedule of matters, including remuneration of chief executives and chief officers, expenses, credit card policy, procurement, capital projects and financial reporting to audit committees and boards, etc.  I think there are 14 or 15 items on the list.</p><p>  When we were looking at travel and subsistence claims during the period prior to 2009, we would have taken a sample across the whole organisation.  The sample would have been drawn from the full spectrum of charges.  I have to say that in general, we did not find many problems with it in Waterford.  I think there were other reviews of expenditure in Waterford over that period, including the Deloitte report which looked at other expenses in Waterford and found it was generally clean.  Under the system of governance laid down in the code, which was being applied in Waterford, an internal review of the effectiveness of controls is required every year.  I think it was generally coming up fairly clean in Waterford.  It is probably quite an unusual and unexpected thing to find.  There were problems in Waterford, obviously, but they were confined in a very narrow sphere.</p></speech>

One of the exercises we do involves analysing the expenditure under the headings that are reported in the financial statements.  When we look at variances and trends from year to year, we look for explanations if it transpires that expenditure is increasing significantly.  As there was no line in the financial statements that drew attention to the budget of the president's office, we were not looking at that.  The internal reporting to the governing body and the audit committee would not generally have been focused on those kinds of cost centres.  The president will correct me if I am wrong in that regard.  One of the recommendations that has been made is that there should be formal reporting of some of those key cost centres as part of the normal financial reporting to those involved in the governance of the organisation.  When we instituted the change in our procedures - in relation to propriety - in 2010, we picked up three or four instances in which difficulties arose with regard to expenses relating to the president's office.</p></speech>

He asked about the other arms of the State with an oversight function and whether they performed properly outside of the internal oversight in the institute.  Mr. Boland said that certain things were in train but things have changed and are changing dramatically since 2010.  At the meeting of last September, the blame focused on one individual.  Sometimes people need someone to blame.  It is clear that the oversight structures may not have been there as far as looking at the propriety of the decisions and the expense concerned.  Everyone needs to fess up to that.  It has changed since then and it must be acknowledged that there was a deficit when it comes to the arms of the State and their oversight functions.  I am glad to hear that people recognised that and are changing accordingly.</p><p>  I want to ask the Department and the HEA about the findings of the Quigley report.  Specifically, when talking about structures within WIT, the report says that the Department was aware of the structures but did not pursue the issues raised regarding the structures adequately and that the HEA should have taken more urgent and decisive action.  Can the witnesses deal with that in respect of the Quigley report?</p></speech>

I also acknowledge the impact of the Committee of Public Accounts considerations on that decision.  Following our last appearance at the committee, when the issue of the companies was addressed and while we were already in detailed engagement with the HEA and WIT, we met with the current chairperson and the current president.  Arising from that meeting and the manner in which WIT did not have access to full information, we felt we needed to initiate an inspection.  We did so in the context of trying to protect the academic reputation of WIT.  As the president said, we were extremely conscious of it.  The inspection process was helpful and it has given us real confidence about the information we needed on what was happening in WIT.  We all learned a lot.  I am not trying to avoid Deputy Deasy's question and I will come to it in a second.  We have a way forward on the report that we find very helpful.  It involves an additional investment from the State, which will be repaid.  We were being asked to make a call about paying it without enough information.  We now have that call and, most importantly, the companies are being restructured and coming into the ownership of WIT.</p><p>  The report also identified a number of governance changes.  WIT has bought into that and we are glad that it has done so.  It will take some time to implement.  The Department and the HEA have notified WIT that, in an unusual step and in a non-statutory way, on completion of the work within WIT we will have a further expert or group of experts to check on the company issues and the governance issues.  It is an external check on behalf of the Department and will also assist WIT on these procedures.  We are seeking to put in place something as close as we can get to a guarantee about its effectiveness.  In no way are we questioning the appropriateness of WIT to undertake the changes.  However, given the importance of the issues and the need to ensure they are sorted out, we thought we should do so.</p><p>  With regard to the history of the companies, the Department had a number of concerns about the relationship with the companies in the late 1990s and in the early part of last decade, in 2001.  We had a good bit of dialogue with WIT around some of the issues.  In particular, there were concerns of the student union, which were addressed by WIT.  The other issues were perceived to be not as important and they were not followed up sufficiently by us and WIT.  WIT assured us they were separate companies and they continued not to be included in the accounts.  We recognise that we did not follow up sufficiently in regard to those issues.  The fact that we did not follow up on these issues led to the continuing uncertainty.  From the Quigley report, we can see that this uncertainty increased in the past decade.  A number of issues arose in the report and at times they were treated as if they were separate companies while at other times they were treated like companies of the institute.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-10a.125" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Boland" time="11:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013101000010#J00400"><p>From the HEA prospective, the Secretary General has said much of what I wanted to say.  Over a period of about two years, from the end of 2010 until the inspector was appointed, the HEA sought to get information on the situation in WIT regarding the companies, even to the extent of nominating to a working group a retired senior civil servant to get access to sufficient information to allow the HEA and the Department to understand the relationship between the companies and the institute.  For a variety of reasons that do not lie at the door of the institute, it proved impossible to get the kind of detailed information necessary.  This, ultimately, led to the appointment by the Minister of an inspector.  In hindsight, it is not appropriate that a body like the HEA must wait two years and wait for the exercise of fairly extraordinary statutory powers to get information of this kind.  The reason we were reluctant to recommend to the Minister the appointment of an inspector earlier is that it is a draconian action, potentially seriously impacting upon the reputation of an institution.  This is only the third time an inspector has been appointed.</p><p>  I mentioned earlier that we are looking at the area of governance and regulation and the role of the HEA.  One of the areas I am interested in exploring is whether there are activities we can engage in that are less draconian and less impactful on the reputation of the institution.  If the appointment of an objective person to an institution to investigate an issue was more commonplace in circumstances where there are difficulties without necessarily requiring the involvement of the Minister, it does not become such a major issue in reputational terms.  It would enable an agency like the HEA to have a more forensic examination of particular issues at particular times.  I say that with the benefit of hindsight.  It took two years and then six months for an excellent report from Mr. Quigley.  Had we waited six months and had the Minister appointed Mr. Quigley sooner, it would have been resolved in that way.  That is not to rationalise it out of existence but to explain the situation.</p></speech>

The main reason is that having a higher education institute at university level is fundamental to the infrastructure to support sustainable economic development in the region.  That is the clear message we want to give here.  We hope that university designation and a higher education institute operating at university level will be key to sustainable economic development for the region.  In that regard, the two institutes of technology in the south east - Waterford and Carlow - have agreed to combine forces to make this happen.  We very much welcome the recommendations in the national strategy for higher education for a process to create a technological university.  We jointly applied in that process, which has four stages.  The first stage was an expression of interest.  That also entailed developing a detailed MOU of operation in respect of how to achieve university designation, which requires us to produce a business plan to meet the criteria for technological university designation.  These criteria revolve around research and development and academic achievement. </p><p>  On top of that, we are also looking at the consolidation process, because there is a requirement that the two institutes become one as part of the technological university process.  We hope to move the business criteria plan - the plan for the creation of a university and how it proposes to meet the criteria to function as a university - forward this year.  Allied with that are a consolidation plan and the due diligence process associated with that.  </p><p>  Once we submit the business plan, we will then move to stage three.  This involves an analysis of our capability of meeting the criteria for a university.  The final stage is stage four, which involves an assessment by an international panel of how we meet the criteria.  In terms of overall timeframes, we have set a very ambitious target and would like to see that achieved within a three-year time frame.  We think it important that we set an ambitious timeframe and believe we are capable of meeting the criteria.  The Deputy spelled out some of the notable achievements of Waterford Institute of Technology, and they are notable achievements of our partner as well.  We certainly believe that, in tandem, we can achieve these criteria.</p></speech>

There are legacy issues with regard to the previous president when it comes to Carlow.  What Mr. Neavyn is effectively telling me is that they have been dealt with, that this is a harmonious arrangement with regard to a joint application being made and that everything is moving along quite well.</p></speech>

That particular application would have been funnelled more towards the technological university process that is now there, so, effectively, multiple institutes of technology must apply for designation as a technological university, and that is what we are doing in a south-east context.  There is obviously a great level of co-operation between the two institutes.  Indeed, both governing bodies, both management teams and members of the institute community are behind this effort.  There is very strong support from stakeholders in the region, including Members of the Oireachtas and members of the business community, who want see this happen.</p></speech>

I want to deal with the expenses issue first.  A total of &euro;120,000 has been extended to date in spending on that issue.

Clearly there are salacious elements in the details of the case, but why did reason and common sense not prevail with regard to people sitting down to examine the case?  The Deloitte report indicates that between 1 January 2009 and 31 May 2011 the president's office incurred almost &euro;1 million in expenditure and estimates that approximately 40% of this expenditure, or &euro;368,000, provided insufficient evidence of value for money.  Why did nobody realise the institute would end up pursuing a court case until two reports later?  Why did reason not prevail?</p></speech>

This included expenditure that was not considered to offer value for money for the State.  The second report focused on additional spending for personal benefit in a confined period because the figure identified in the first report was quite large.  We subsequently carried out an internal review for the full claim and thus we did not incur further costs.</p></speech>

Once we saw the scale of expenditure between 2009 and 2011, we made a conscious decision that we did not want to incur further costs and, therefore, the staff of my office carried out the review, with a focus on the areas of expenditure identified in the second report.

I take the Deputy's point about the cost to the taxpayer.  It is fair to say, however, that the first two reports were necessary for the commission to get an idea of the scale of expenditure that did not offer value for money or might represent spending for personal benefit to an individual.

Equally, however, we have a specific task to perform.  This appears to be a case of a sole trader operating in an institute.  The chairman of the institute was flying in economy class while the president was in first class on the same flight.  The explanation the president gave was that it was common practice across all the third level institutes that presidents flew business or first class.  Any rational person would see a problem with this.  Why are we only now at the point of pursuing a legal case and when does Mr. Neavyn expect it to conclude?</p></speech>

Is the number of subsidiary companies five or seven?  The diverse campus services, DCS, operate through five subsidiaries.  Would the institute have required prior approval from the HEA or the Department to proceed with establishing them on day 1?  Mr. Quigley's report mentions that the structure is unique.  It reads: "The relationship that exists between WIT and the companies providing campus services to it is unique in the Institute of Technology sector".  Companies that were legally a part of WIT were not subject to scrutiny by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Would the institute have been required to seek the approval of the HEA or the Department prior to their establishment?</p><p>  Clearly, this structure did not provide proper accountability.  Companies had large cash balances for a period, although these have subsequently been depleted.  Amalgamation is now under way, but how did those companies come to be set up in the first place?</p></speech>

I understand that this was effectively set up independently of the institute.  It was considered to be a stand-alone, independent company structure.  This appears to be the issue.</p><p>  As to whether this should have been notified to the Department, one could argue that the answer would be "No" in the case of an independent structure.  Given the Quigley report and the connectivity between the company structure and the institute, however, it should clearly be made a subsidiary, which is what we are doing.  If taken from the pure legal perspective that these were independent, stand-alone companies, there was probably no requirement to inform the HEA or Department.  This is probably why there may have been an information deficit in terms of the company structure from a departmental or HEA perspective.</p></speech>

It was given freedom under the Regional Technical Colleges Act 1992 and changed its name to Waterford Institute of Technology subsequently.</p><p>  The crux of the matter is that the companies were independent on the one hand and not independent on the other.  Our understanding was that they had been operating independently, but the report has clarified that they were not.  In effect, they were really a part of the institute.  The directors of the companies have readily agreed to being consolidated under the institute in the past few weeks.</p></speech>

The matter that we are dealing with is a legacy issue, one that will have a major impact on the college's future funding requirements.

Or one may look at broad areas, but this particular review was specifically on the expenditure in the office of the president - specifically on the detail.</p></speech>

In 2009, there was a well documented case of expenditure similar to this in another organisation.

However, surely at some stage someone looking at governance within the institute would have come up with a query on, for example, the president's office and how it reports its cost centre.  It is referred to as a cost centre there.  That cost centre is called the president's office but I have noticed that within that there is all kinds of promotional material going on, such as efforts to get university status.  That has nothing to do with the president himself - it concerns the college's wish to pursue a particular agenda on university status.  Those costs are not necessarily the president's; they are those of the institute, yet during the audit no one seems to have separated out what was solely in the president's office.  It seems to me that quite a lot of the expenditure and some of the income was dumped into the office of the president when in fact it should probably have come under some other heading entitled "university promotion" or "university status".</p></speech>

In fact, as part of the reviews that were conducted, we would have done that analysis.  The figure that Deputy O'Donnell quoted earlier shows money that was direct expenditure and money that was also associated with other activities.  Therefore the Chairman is correct in that.</p></speech>

There are people operating those systems.  We are tired of hearing about systems in this committee.  People were operating the systems of management and those who were overseeing those systems did not raise an issue or ring any bell.  The Department did not pick up on it and neither did the HEA.  Things went merrily along until such time as a financial issue arose.  That is extraordinary because people are given the responsibility to do this particular job, yet they seem not to have completed the task.  They did not raise any issue about this.  It has cost &euro;30,000 per year and many more hundreds of thousands of euro thereafter because people sat on their hands.  That is essentially what happened here.  That is what I am taking from it.</p><p>  Mr. Neavyn mentioned a particular invoice for &euro;4,200 for the journey.  In his remarks, he said the chairman and president signed off on that.

I found one instance where there was a query as to why tickets were bought at Ticketmaster, if my recollection is correct.  My understanding is that the president was asked to repay that and he did so.  That is proof positive that there was a system in which if enough fuss was made about a matter it would be repaid, or it would be questioned and, perhaps, much more made of it.  In a press release the then chairman, Mr. O'Donoghue, said:<blockquote><br />Never once in that period was concern about expenditure brought to my attention or that of the governing body by as much as a raised eyebrow - not by the finance function, by internal audit, by the audit committee or by the external auditor who is the Comptroller &amp;amp; Auditor-General.  No criticism of spending by the President or the President's Office was ever voiced to me or brought up at governing body meetings, whether formally or informally.</blockquote></p></speech>

They will be a subsidiary of the college.  The advice we would have received, indeed the advice Mr. Quigley may have received, is that the loans were not incurred by the institute as such, therefore they are an undertaking of the subsidiary structure or the company structure.  However, the plan is well in place to deal with those loans.  With regard to the repayment of the moneys to be forwarded for Manor Village and Carriganore, exact details and workings have not been fully calculated at this stage.  We have just effectively made the company structures subsidiaries of WIT since 1 October and we must now do the detailed financial analysis of the cashflows of the companies and their ability to repay the money.  That will be greatly connected to the Manor Village income, and Mr. Quigley makes the point in his report that it is a financially viable entity.  We are using the assumption that the funding generated from the Manor Village complex would repay the moneys to be forwarded by the Department.</p></speech>

There would have been taxi expenses that would have been for the office specifically.

There is no gainsaying that.  The role of the HEA is to ensure there are processes in place in the institutes and in universities that will ensure internal controls are effective.  By and large, they are.  Overwhelmingly they are in the system.  It is not possible for the HEA, given its role, to identify the lapses or misconduct of this sort.  When they arise, I see our function as to ensure action is taken to address them promptly, to review the system of controls that is in place and to make any changes that are necessary.  We are engaged in that.  I mentioned that the HEA is looking at our regulatory governance functions in this context but also in the context of the broader mandate of the HEA to see what additional procedures or powers we might have to make our system more effective.  There is no circumstance in which the HEA has a responsibility to look regularly at the individual elements of expenditure in an institution.  That is, as the Secretary General described it, a function ultimately of the cascade of accountability within the institution itself.</p></speech>

We took over responsibility for the institutes of technology in 2007.  The arrangement in relation to these companies had been in existence since the early 1990s.  We took at face value in the first couple of years the assurance by the institute that they were separate independent companies.  It is only in the context of the issues around the consolidation of the accounts of these companies, an issue recommended by the Comptroller and Auditor General, that we as the HEA became concerned about the governance arrangements that were in place in the context of the transfer of significant resources of the institute to what were, we were assured, independent bodies.  That raised alarm bells.  We then explored the issues over the next couple of years.</p></speech>

I find that incredible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-10a.332" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013101000016#P02900"><p>The primary responsibility rests with the institute, the senior management and with the governance structures.  Clearly, we are collectively very disappointed that those structures did not operate correctly.  That is a clear message to us that we need to ensure the senior management and the governance are aware of their responsibilities and that we update their responsibilities appropriately.  That is the first clear message.</p><p>  In terms of discussing the Chairman's precise question to Mr. Boland on whether the HEA could have done something, could I apply that to the Department, because I think it is appropriate that I do so?  We would have had responsibility for funding WIT directly until it was transferred to the HEA.  We obviously funded the HEA to fund Waterford Institute of Technology subsequently.  As I said earlier, we had an engagement with the institute about the companies in the late 1990s and early part of the last decade.  The institute satisfied us in relation to some aspects but we did not follow through sufficiently about others, and I put that on record.  I am disappointed that we did not follow through more thoroughly with them.  At the same time, they were completing their accounts and continuing on and there were no issues arising.</p><p>  I think issues would have arisen, without the freedom of information requests, with the conclusion of the term of the previous president.  Quite clearly there was a set of arrangements in the institute around expenses which were particular to the development of the office in his time, which were not there prior to that.  The turnover in the senior management and the turnover in the governing authority would probably have given rise to knowledge about the issues if the freedom of information issues had not arisen.  We welcome the fact that the issues arising from the freedom of information did arise.  We take the matters very seriously and we have put a great deal of thought into updating the arrangements.  As the Chairman said, and I do not disagree with him, the implementation of all these systems rely on individuals to implement them.  It is a matter for individuals in each of their different positions, whether they are in senior management, on the government body or the internal audit committee, to ensure they perform their roles appropriately.  Systems are operated by individuals.  We have to ensure this happens.</p></speech>

I do not think it would necessarily be appropriate to do so.  We certainly do not have the resources to do so.  There are 11 or 12 institutes of technology and seven or eight universities.  There is a lengthy cascade of responsibilities in that.  The responsibility of an individual body lies with that body to work and operate within the framework of guidance and framework of accountability and auditing that is in place.  I do not think we get down three or four layers into a cascade of responsibility like that.</p></speech>

I do not expect it to go down layers.  The Department of Education and Skills allocates the money to the HEA.  It is not expected to go down layers, but I would expect Mr. Nolan's Department at least to have a report from the Department of Education and Skills.  I would expect that Department to be looking in on the HEA.  Mr. Nolan is telling me that large sums of taxpayers' money go down through the system and this is the result of some of it.  Nobody is prepared in some respects of this case to take responsibility for not taking a full hands-on approach, although Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; did so a minute ago.  I would expect the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to ensure the Department of Education and Skills ensured the HEA ensured that in WIT, good governance would be observed and taxpayers' money would be protected.  To come before this committee and say that the institute is at fault, while the institute representatives tell us that the systems failed, is just more of the same.  I would like to see it much tighter.</p></speech>

I would like a response to that question on behalf of WIT, the Department and the HEA.

The exercise was a request for Deloitte - which provides our internal audit service - to review the overall expenditure.  This was the Deloitte 1 report.  The Deloitte 2 report was a more detailed review of the time period 2009 to 2011.  Based on that report we were able to identify categories of expenditure where we wanted answers from the former employee with regard to either reimbursement or clarification.  We got neither and we are now going through a legal process to have this finance reimbursed.</p></speech>

Even this morning I heard a number of people speak about the difficult position in which it places individuals.  This is very worrying for any organisation if individuals believe they are impeded from doing their job because of fear of the boss or the person at the top.  I know things have changed and I presume Dr. Neavyn has had a very keen eye to the cultural change within the organisation to ensure this does not happen again.  Is a whistleblower's charter in place and a process for protected disclosures?</p></speech>

The full expenditure in the office is reviewed by the governing body biannually.  The budget for the office of the president has to be approved by the governing body.  The co-authorisation process must occur between the finance function and the office of the president.  The oversight of the expenditure of the office of the president now lies with the governing body.</p></speech>

This charter would be primarily for internal purposes but also it would be a way of trying to revive a level of public confidence, to show that the former culture does not persist.  I would suspect very strongly that if there was that reticence about questioning bizarre and extravagant spending by the president I do not imagine that this was just a limited phenomenon within the organisation.  I suspect if one were to examine the organisation in its totality, one would find that this reticence was echoed in all different parts of the organisation.</p></speech>

I do not think it was prevalent across the entire organisational culture.  That is my personal view.  The Deputy is correct that we want the whistleblower's charter, and very much so.  However, there will need to be consultation with staff representative bodies, with management and with the governing body, with regard to a whistleblower's charter.  The consultation with staff representative groups on something that is to be implemented across the whole sector would occur at national level.  So far as I am aware, those national level consultations have not been completed.  I reiterate that we are not against implementing a whistleblower's charter at local level but we will require agreement from parties.</p></speech>

We will try to discover whether there are any reasons as to why a particular company was specifically selected.  What comes to mind is that rather than a full tender process, there might have been a quotes process, in which case the companies in question could have offered the preferred third or fifth quote.  I am not aware of any personal relationships between any of the providers and any members of staff who would have engaged their services.  That is all the insight I can give at this point in time.</p></speech>

Questions arise as to whether there was a personal relationship between any service provider and the person or entity availing of that service, as Deputy McDonald outlined.  There is the question of whether companies which did not go in for a competitive tender should have been selected at all.  One wonders whether they had a track record with the universities or more usually acted for other, more commercial, bodies, which is my understanding of the case.</p></speech>

They are not things one could overlook.  If people are flying around the world first class or taking private jets here, there and everywhere or doing all manner of things which are documented, as one of my colleagues suggested, everybody must have known about it, not just members of staff but members of the board.  Whereas, these things might not be formally brought to their attention unless those concerned were completely blind they would know what was happening if people were spending money like that.

The way it is done, effectively, is that the senior managers responsible for the particular areas submit a proposed budget; we review them based on the proposed budget that we receive from the HEA - we receive an indication early in any financial year - and then have a discussion.  What I do, with the finance department, is meet each senior manager to discuss the proposed budget and we allocate based on that discussion and the available budget.  During the year we monitor and review expenditure in these cost centres and if people are busting their budgets, then, obviously, we deal with the matter.  In this instance, there was no proper adherence to the policies and procedures in place.</p><p>  The spend of the institute is also brought to the attention of the governing body and the audit and finance committees, in particular, the finance committee because during that time period in Waterford there was both an audit committee and a finance committee.  The finance committee dealt with the accounts and day-to-day expenditure, while the audit committee dealt with risk management and the internal audit plan.  We are amalgamating the two committees because, obviously, we believe that is an important recommendation made within the Quigley report.  However, it is also a decision the institution made, that actually there should be one committee to have complete oversight of the risks associated with expenditure.  That is an important point to make in that regard.</p></speech>

In the time period about which we are talking in respect of the travel and other expenses incurred by the president, were there specific procedures and systems in place and were they looked at?  We clearly see this as a systems failure.  From what I am hearing, it appears as if the then president was able to write a cheque for anything he so chose at the time.  I am most concerned that this seems to have been allowed.</p></speech>

The legal costs associated with the two legal cases, one in relation to the appointment process and the other in relation to the expenses claim, are &euro;22,428.  We, obviously, hope to recoup these costs as part of our legal case.  On the costs incurred for Deloitte one and two, Deloitte one was prepared to actually give us oversight of global expenditure within the office of the president in the time period in question, while Deloitte two was a specific report to undertake a more detailed analysis of expenditure in the years 2009 to 2011.  Following on from this, we were able to identify specific categories of expenditure on which we wanted to have a greater focus for an extended time period.  We did this and went to the Statute of Limitations figure in the six-year time frame dating back from 2012.  Therefore, the review was completed for the period 2007 to mid-2011 and that forms the basis of the claim.</p></speech>

In relation to governance, Mr. Boland has mentioned that in terms of audit, the president and the chairman sign off on governance procedures.

Would Mr. Boland consider bringing in an external auditor to ensure this is done to give reassurance?</p></speech>

The problem - a problem that has been alluded to here a couple of times - is the extent to which a system depends on the people who operate it and if there is a degree of determination to subvert it, that will happen.  That said, one then hopes the other structures in place in the institution, particularly the internal audit function, and, of course, the governing body, will act, first, to deter that kind of activity and, second, to find it and neither of these occurred in this case.  I do not know if there is a further layer of governance or regulation that one could put in place that necessarily would work in this or any future case.  I think the structures are good and that they do need to be regularly reviewed, but, overall, I imagine that they are fine.</p></speech>

My concern is that it is all being done internally.  Mr. Boland is relying on a report coming from internal functions.  I appreciate that there might be fantastic people in all of those functions but our job is to ensure that what happened will never happen again.  I note that expenditure in regard to institutions is &euro;1.2 billion.  It might be worth considering having an external auditor carry out a review at the end of every year to ensure that systems, procedures, governance of systems of finance and their management, and expenditure, be it on expenses or otherwise, are examined and that everything is in line with what is approved by the Department.  That is a recommendation.</p></speech>

In any institution, the chief officer is, in the first instance, the accountable person.  There is an audit committee, internal auditors and a governing body.  They operate in accordance with processes and procedures laid down by the Higher Education Authority on the basis of the code of government set by the Government.  In addition, there is oversight by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is a very sound structure but no structure or system is completely foolproof against human frailty.  I will not argue the point with the Deputy.</p></speech>

I support Mr. Boland's comments but believe there are still areas in respect of which we can work further, notwithstanding all the codes of practice that have been updated.  We are working on that with the Higher Education Authority.  A particular area is the manner in which the institutes of technology operate the shared internal audit service.  An objective is to formalise the lessons learned so that one institute can learn from an issue that arises in another and so there will be system learning.  The finance officers get together collectively but there are opportunities to enhance system learning.  I apologise for using the word "system".  Staff in an institute of technology who have responsibility for the audit function learn about what goes wrong somewhere else but that process has the potential to be enhanced.  This is a development.  We will be considering this with the Higher Education Authority.  We are saying we have confidence in the system but we also have some concerns at the same time.  We must keep working to ensure enhancements are put in place as we learn.</p></speech>

The statement on internal financial control or, in the case of institutes of technology, the statement of internal control, specifically addresses the system of control in operation.  We do not formally audit to the point of establishing every statement is absolutely true and founded on evidence but we do look at the statement to ensure that the review of internal controls has actually been carried out and reported.  Normally, it is reported, in the first instance, to the audit committee but it must also be reviewed by the board or governing authority of the entity.  We also expect that it is done in a timely way.  The operation of controls in a particular year needs to be addressed within that year or very shortly after the end of the year.  Thus, the assurance is in place when the financial statements are actually presented.  There is a question of resources.  We have not sought to take on that function in addition to what we already do.  </p><p>  Not only in the third level sector, but across the public sector, the system of control is actually in place and operating.  We report on the audit certificate in relation to financial statements where we find that the review of internal controls has not been carried out or that it has not been carried out in a timely way.  The Deputy's point is that there needs to be a review.  We look to see that that review is carried out.</p><p>  With the exception of Dublin Institute of Technology, all the institutes of technology use the common contract in relation to internal audit function.  Therefore, there is an external auditor carrying out that review of controls.  In reality, it should cover the operation of all of the main controls that operate within a public sector body.</p><p>  I have a couple of comments reflecting on some aspects of the discussion that has already taken place.  Confidential disclosure and appropriate procedures in public sector bodies are important.  I can say that nothing was brought to the attention of the auditors over many years in relation to questions of extravagance or non-competitive procurement in Waterford Institute of Technology.  The bodies we audit know that we would be very quick to investigate if we had any inkling that there was a problem of that kind.</p><p>  On non-competitive procurement, we test within the entities we audit whether procurement has been as a result of competitive procedures.  We would have carried that out every year in Waterford's case but we did not come across any significant number of instances where that was happening.  Departments, including the Department of Education and Skills, are required to report to us annually if there have been any instances of non-competitive procurement over a threshold of &euro;25,000.  That is not an obligation of other public bodies as a direction of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></speech>

He is the second recipient of the Oireachtas parliamentary fellowship which was established in 2009 to mark the 90th anniversary of the first meeting of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The fellowship is designed to advance the study of the Houses of the Oireachtas and Dr. Barrett has been researching the evolving role of our national Parliament in European affairs.  The results of the fellowship have been published in a 275-page report and this meeting gives us an opportunity to talk about the findings.  I have asked Dr. Barrett to focus on three key issues: what is and is not working in the scrutiny and oversight of EU proposals; what an enhanced role for the Oireachtas in EU affairs, including the committee system and this committee, in particular, might look like and who needs to drive its development; and the wider debate on a greater role for national parliaments in the EU system.  Members who will attend the COSAC meeting in Vilnius in three weeks will be aware that a session has been designated to this subject.  I will contribute on our behalf, as will others.  In advance of that meeting, this is a useful opportunity to discuss Dr. Barrett's views on how we can seek to achieve a greater role for national parliaments.</p></speech>

I will first discuss the wider EU debate on a greater role for national parliaments, after which I will consider what an enhanced role for the Oireachtas might look like and then I will comment, in so far as I can, on what seems to me, from the outside, to work and not work with regard to scrutiny and oversight.</p><p>  The role of national parliaments has greatly increased in recent years and I traced through this progression, perhaps in excessive detail, in chapter 3 of the report.  I do not propose to go into it in too much detail.  Suffice it to say there was hardly any mention of national parliaments in the original treaties.  The real focus was on the European Parliament but this proved inadequate, partly because of the continuing reality that people primarily identify with reference to their nationality and not the fact they are European, and because of low turnouts in European Parliament elections.  The position of national parliaments has changed gradually over time and the legal instruments have reflected this.  We had declarations at Maastricht, protocols adopted at Amsterdam and protocols and treaty provisions adopted at Lisbon which came into force in 2009.</p><p>  Apart from the limited nature of the success of the European Parliament as the standard bearer of European democracy, there are all kinds of historical reasons the focus has shifted to national parliaments.  They are set out on page 129 of the report.  Increasing the role of national parliaments has helped defuse arguments about the growth of a democratic deficit at European level, to some extent at least.  Arguably it has been necessary also to avoid national executives escaping from democratic control due to the transfer of decision making to European level.  A bigger role for national parliaments is compensation for the change made in 1979 which meant membership of the European Parliament was no longer made up of national parliamentarians.  Direct elections put an end to this.</p><p>  The profile of national parliaments has grown and we can look forward to this continuing because there is a general feeling that come the next major treaty revision, the terms of the subsidiarity protocol will probably be widened to allow a review of EU instruments by national parliaments, for example by reason of violations of proportionality or failure to give adequate reasoning for legislation.  The question we should ask is whether we are right to continue to extend the role of national parliaments, in particular in terms of supervision of government ministers.  Many arguments can be put forward in favour of it and some against it.  In favour is the argument that it is the role of national parliaments to supervise the national government on behalf of the electorate in all of the Government's activities without exception, including EU matters.  Also in favour is the argument that increased supervisory powers are needed to compensate for the transfer at European level, and I have already commented on this.  There is also the argument that an increased role for parliament can strengthen the hand of ministers at European level because their arguments become better rehearsed and they have a better excuse for being tenacious at European level.  It can also be argued that the European Parliament is inherently, or in practice, incapable of providing sufficient democratic legitimacy.  There are also arguments based on the idea a national parliamentary role brings Europe closer to the citizens.</p><p>  It is also possible to raise arguments against increasing the role of national parliaments.  One can argue it leads to increased polarisation, more difficulty in reaching agreements at European level and disruption of the delicate compromises needed to get agreement at European level.  Curiously enough, the experience throughout Europe seems to have been that an enhanced role for national parliaments does not increase popular acceptance of decisions at EU level, because the states with the greatest scrutiny are sometimes those with the greatest of degree of euroscepticism.</p><p>  Overall the consensus is that, on balance, the democratic legitimacy of the EU requires the input of national parliaments and the European Parliament, but we need to think very carefully about how and when national parliaments are empowered to intervene.  We need to be aware of a number of issues in particular in empowering national parliaments.  We must recall parliaments are forums and not actors.  Sometimes the division is presented as the executive on one side and the legislature on the other and never the twain shall meet.  In reality, we are all aware the real division is between the executive and its supporters who are the majority in the national parliament on one side and the opposition on the other.  If one establishes a system which does not take account of this real dichotomy as opposed to the more theoretical one, it will not work.  Arguably, this is why the subsidiarity mechanism has not been a greater success.</p><p>  Bearing in mind this dichotomy tells us what we can expect committees to do.  We can expect monitoring scrutiny, in other words demanding information on the government's activities to be done by all committee members, even government supporters, but political scrutiny, in other words assessing how appropriate the government's behaviour is at European level, is something which, in reality, will only ever be done, if at all, by opposition members on the committee just as is the case in plenary session of parliament.  One must remember the real division in this regard.</p><p>  A second factor to bear in mind is that parliaments are subject to serious constraints, such as informational asymmetry, in carrying out their role.  The executive has all of the information but the legislature does not.  This takes some counteracting for which informative mechanisms are required.  Many parliamentarians are simply just not interested in European scrutiny.  At the end of the day, it does not win one votes, and this is a serious handicap in making the system work with regard to European scrutiny.  It must be borne in mind also.</p><p>  A point which is important for us to remember is that a parliament needs to balance centralisation and decentralisation in its functioning when it comes to EU affairs.  There has been a shift in the Oireachtas to sectoral committees with regard to scrutiny, and appropriately so because the scope of the European Union is so wide at this stage that it is impossible for a single committee to act as a sinkhole for all European Union matters.  At the same time, we all know it is not necessarily working all that well in some respects.  As was discovered by the Dutch lower house, there are potential disadvantages to an entirely sectoral approach which lacks any centralised co-ordination.  The experience in more than one member state, and not only the Netherlands, is that leaving everything to individual sectoral committees can lead to European policy matters being neglected in favour of more familiar domestic issues, and consequently one ends up with an inadequate level of scrutiny.  We must ask ourselves whether this is happening in Ireland and, if so, whether there is anything we can do about it.  The state which has coped best with this particular problem is Finland, which, like Ireland, has sectoral committees to deal with European issues, but they all report to a grand committee, and this seems to have been able to make the system work.</p><p>  I will now consider what an enhanced role for the Oireachtas in EU affairs might look like and who needs to drive it.  It is a very good question and the reason is there is no one role for national parliaments throughout Europe in European affairs.  There are many possible roles and jobs for them to do but they cannot do all of them well, so there is an element of having to concentrate and having to choose.  I am involved in an international project producing a handbook of national parliaments in the EU.  Other people in the room are also involved, such as Dr. Claudia Hefftler who is in the Public Gallery.  The project describes five idealised roles for national parliaments, and various states have variations of one or other.  A national parliament can be a public forum.</p></speech>

Comparatively speaking, the Oireachtas must up its game in general, because compared with parliaments in other countries, we are falling behind in European Union scrutiny.  It would be very useful for the Oireachtas to pay attention to other small countries in particular, as we do not have the resources of Germany or the United Kingdom.  Although we have great similarities with the United Kingdom in many respects when it comes to the parliamentary system and it is useful to examine it in that regard, we will never have resources, either in terms of personnel or finance, to mimic the activities of the House of Lords.  It is more useful for us to consider the likes of Denmark, Finland and Sweden to see if we can pick up tips from them to scrutinise European matters.</p><p>  We need to combine decentralisation with centralisation.  It is great that we now have scrutiny of EU measures by all committees, but we need feedback to some centralised body, such as this committee.  We need to up the ante with regard to ministerial accountability.  We also need to up the game with regard to subsidiarity, as we are well down the European ranks.  We also need to get going on the various aspects of European Union policy that do not involve legislation, as I have already mentioned, and, if possible, we need to contribute to at least some major debates at European Union level.  For example, there is a banking union being constructed around us at a European level and we need to contribute to that discussion.  The banks brought down our economy so how are we contributing to that debate?  It is only one example of an issue, as there are others that could be considered.</p><p>  We need to make better use of resources.  We have retained a resource that we may not have had after the vote last week, so what use are we making of the Seanad?</p></speech>

I appreciate the work he has done in putting together this report over the last number of years.  It is a comprehensive document and it will certainly be a very useful guide for members, not just now but in the future, regarding how this committee came about, how European Union committees developed over the years, their roles and responsibilities and the opportunities we have as members of the committee to shape and influence future debates.  I thank him for the time and effort he put into this document.</p><p>  I will take up a few questions and points Dr. Barrett raised.  He mentioned the attendance of Ministers earlier in the year.  During the EU Presidency many of our Ministers were overseas and in Brussels, so there was a reduction in the level of ministerial attendance at meetings.  That was understandable and they can be forgiven in that instance, but I take his point that generally and in the steady state world there should be greater attendance by Ministers.</p><p>  Regarding what we can do, one of the suggestions in chapter 5 is that we send our reasoned opinions and political dialogue to Europe regarding forthcoming legislation.  That is something we do already and intend to do more.  For example, with regard to the social dimension and the paper that was published last week by the Commission outlining a list of indicators we must monitor at European level, that is something this committee will be debating over the coming weeks.  We will ask various parties, such as the youth societies in Ireland and unemployed groups, to appear before the committee to give their opinions on how social indicators can work and how we can ensure we include all the relevant measures.  We will send a reasoned opinion on that to Brussels.</p><p>  There is no doubt that there must be better engagement.  Dr. Barrett points out in his report that after the National Forum on Europe was shut down, the slack was supposed to be taken up by committees such as this one.  Although we do our best to try to generate media interest, to date we have had limited success.  We try to highlight that various meetings are taking place and we try to promote our work programme, but it is very difficult to do.  Any suggestions Dr. Barrett has as to how we can make the media give greater coverage to the committee's proceedings would be useful, because there is a gap.  It is particularly important given the need to ensure there is understanding among the public of what is happening at European level and to ensure democratic legitimacy.  The turnout at European elections has been reducing over recent elections, and we are very worried about the potential turnout in next year's election.</p><p>  Increasing people's understanding of what is happening in Europe is very important, particularly given the fact that things such as the European Semester, the six pack and the two pack are now in play.  Most people are of the view that we will wave the troika goodbye in two months and that will be the end of the involvement of Europe in how we set our budgets, but that is not the case.  With the six pack, the two pack and the European Semester, from now on our budgets will be monitored extremely closely in line with the governance in place throughout Europe.  That is not understood by our people and it is through committees such as this that it is to be hoped we can educate them as to what this new governance will mean.</p><p>  I thank Dr. Barrett again for his report.  I might ask some specific questions later but first I call Senator Colm Burke.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-10a.606" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1150" speakername="Colm Burke" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013101000005#D00300"><p>I thank Dr. Barrett for his submission and comprehensive report.  I agree with everything he said.  As somebody who was in the European Parliament for a short period, what hit me when I returned was the lack of scrutiny in Ireland and the lack of information about what was coming down the track from Europe.  The Commission sets out its programme in November each year for the following 12 months.  We do not discuss that in any committee or in either the D&aacute;il or Seanad.  We must start doing that and examining what is coming down the tracks in the next 12 months or two years.  That was very evident with regard to a number of directives that came through and were in place for a number of years before the public became aware of them.  One was the directive on turf cutting.  Another which I had to deal with when I was in the European Parliament related to environmental impact studies for simple matters such as mussel seed harvesting.  I recall being in Cromane in Kerry and being told that it was a new EU directive, but the directive had been in place for over eight years and &euro;5 million had been allocated to a Department to assist with carrying out the environmental impact studies.  However, because people were unaware of the directive, most of that money was returned to Brussels as it was not used.  That is the issue in getting information out.</p><p>  Two years ago, I suggested that the Seanad set aside two days a month to deal with European affairs alone.  The problem was that when I assisted the Leader of the Seanad in making a submission regarding backup support staff, the proposal was not agreed to.  That was unfortunate.</p><p>  The other issue I was involved in was cross-border health care.  I was directly involved in steering that directive through the European Parliament.  It was finally signed off in February 2011, but 13 months later, as it must be in place by 24 October, the public has no information about their rights under this new directive.  The directive is about one's entitlement to travel to another member state if one cannot get health care in this country or if there is undue delay.  For that reason there should not only be debate and discussion on EU directives in committees but also in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is about getting information out.  Sometimes committees are doing very good and detailed work but, unfortunately, there is no media focus on that.  However, there is a higher level of focus on the D&aacute;il and Seanad, so there is a need to open them to having debates on that area.  It is something I would support.</p><p>  Dr. Barrett mentioned the role of the Seanad.  If he were in our position, now that the Seanad has a mandate from the public in terms of it remaining in being but that there is a need for reform, how would he envisage the Seanad developing its role with regard to European affairs?  Will he outline his views on how it could be used effectively in that way?</p></speech>

It is extremely interesting.  The fact that it criticises some of our activity, or lack of activity, is no harm.  First, we need a considerable amount of time to digest it and discuss it at length with Dr. Barrett.  There is little sense in producing such a report and doing nothing about it afterwards.</p><p>  I strongly disagree with some of it, as Dr. Barrett will readily expect.  There is a contradiction in the simultaneous growth in strength of the national parliaments and the European Parliament.  They are on a conflict course; they must be.  If I am a Member of the European Parliament, I will naturally resent other members states' national parliaments influencing to too great an extent what I am trying to do and, regardless of whether I like it, I will have an affinity with my own country.  That is the European parliamentarian's perspective.  I mean no disrespect to my colleague but if I were a Member of the European Parliament, and I have no intention of ever being one, that would be my perspective.</p><p>  By the same token, for the Member of the Parliament in this country, there is a resentment, which we see around us all the time, of being forced to accept directives coming from Brussels and things happening outside our control.  Dr. Barrett made an important point.  In national parliaments there is a lack in the sense of taking ownership of the European project.</p></speech>

It could not be done otherwise.  It might even have to meet on Monday through to Friday in order to keep up to speed and do all the things that are necessary.  That should be borne in mind.  If the European Union affairs committee were to have an overarching role, the sectoral committees would need to meet on a timely basis to deal with issues that were to come before the EU affairs committee, and the reports would have to come before the committee on time and on a weekly basis.  Both Chambers of the Houses of the Oireachtas would need to be involved in that, be it though the committee system or whatever other way.  In the House of Commons, there are more eurosceptics, whereas the House of Lords seems to be more progressive and constructive.  How can we devise a system in Europe to ensure that all member states sing off one hymn sheet and go in the same direction generally at the same time without imposing on each other?  That is the technique we must develop to a greater extent.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-10a.611" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1030" speakername="Eric Byrne" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013101000006#E00400"><p>We have had interesting contributions to this debate.  The Chairman has read Dr. Barrett's report, which is 275 pages long.  I am sure every other member of the committee has read it too.  I must confess that I read a seven-page synopsis.  I am saying this deliberately.  One will see from the minutes of the previous meeting that we discussed the eighth, ninth and twelfth reports of the House of Commons European Scrutiny Committee and the decision of this committee was to note them as part of correspondence.</p><p>  I see people getting excited because the people have voted to retain the Seanad.  Well, if Members of the Seanad think they can do what the House of Lords is doing or whether they should be allowed to, given the fundamentally undemocratic nature of the Seanad, then I think we are barking up the wrong tree.</p><p>  Why did I make public that I did not read Dr. Barrett's 275-page report?  If members were honest, they would probably admit they did not read it either.  It comes down to a fundamental issue that I do not think was mentioned, although, interestingly enough, around 12 months ago some previous witnesses mentioned it.   I will mention it again because it is a very unpopular thing to hear from the mouth of a politician who has been very successful in using the clientelist form of politics that gets people elected to Parliament here because of the use of the single transferable vote and the immediate competition between politicians from the designated constituencies.  Would Dr. Barrett agree that if one wants a particular degree of scrutiny and oversight - which we are not going to get - the report makes absolute sense, but simple things such as the resources of Members mean that one will not get an Irish parliamentarian to devote him- or herself to scrutiny and oversight to the degree that is suggested in this report, given the clientelist nature of the political process?</p><p>  Has Dr. Barrett looked at other systems?  He mentioned the Danish, the Swiss and the Norwegian systems.  It might be interesting for this committee to look at how they do it, and we may visit, if that is not a heresy in this day and age, to see how they do it.  I am absolutely convinced that they do not have a single transferable vote system.  Under a list system, people who are chosen to be members of parliament from the list have specialist skills and interests in particular topics and subjects and can be more easily placed than can be done here.  Deputy Durkan touched on this when he talked about the committee meeting for an hour a day seven days a week.  The resources are not there to give members the serious level of backup that we would require to go into such analysis.  I am involved in the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade and we have to deal with this topic.  It is an interesting debate because when the Chairman hosted the German-Irish Lawyers and Business Association, one of the questions from the audience was on this very issue of oversight.  Given the evolution of the role of the national Parliament <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> Europe and the strengthening position of Europe as a body of 28 member states, its powers may be of more fundamental importance to the citizens of countries than their national parliaments.  I would like to think we could follow up in a serious way on some of Dr. Barrett's suggestions.</p></speech>

I would first like to comment on the Chairman's point about Ireland's Presidency, which was enormously successful.  My points are not directed at this Government, which has been better than most in respect of ministerial attendance.  This has been a four-decade-long practice and there really has not been sufficient attendance of Ministers here for us to be able to say that ministerial performance in Council meetings is rendered sufficiently accountable.  I am delighted to hear that a submission will be made to the social dialogue as well.</p><p>  Suggestions to gain media attention are so difficult, because I find European issues fascinating but I must acknowledge they are not always at the top of the list of what people want to read.  Outreach programmes would be one suggestion.  Structured involvement by particular parties might be another.  In other words, the committee might invite regularly the same parties, such as farmers' organisations, trade unions and so on, to appear here.  Perhaps the committee should copy the approach of the National Forum on Europe, which might involve taking it out of the committee room and having such meetings in a larger forum and getting people in on a regular basis to express their views.  I notice that the television broadcasts of these proceedings are confined to UPC, which reaches about 20% of the population.  I do not know if it is possible to increase that.  If it were, that would be a great contribution and would put the Oireachtas into the living rooms of the country, if anyone was prepared to switch it on.</p></speech>

Senator Burke has a unique perspective as he has been in the European Parliament as well as the Oireachtas.  There are major problems.  There are different electoral cycles.  Many European initiatives take years to come to fruition, so that if a submission is made here, no political payback is seen.  The Senator's story about the directive reminded me of a relative of mine getting a letter from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine about the nitrates directive, telling him exactly how many cubic centimetres of nitrates his cows were permitted to produce.  That is a facetious story at one level, but it is important all the same because it reminds us that many of our problems with the implementation of directives come down to their implementation within the country.  If that was done in a better way, perhaps we would have fewer problems.  If the Oireachtas did a better job in controlling statutory instruments, then perhaps the kinds of difficulty the Senator was talking about would not have arisen, because a better job would have been done on controlling their implementation in the first place.  I suspect the Seanad could do some work in that respect.  That leads on to the next question.  What can we do with the Seanad?  Deputy Byrne raised that issue as well.  The Seanad could be given a role on some of the jobs I have identified.  For instance, if it is not possible for Deputies to find the time to police the implementation of European Union law, or if it is not worth their while because it is not electorally fruitful for them, perhaps it could be farmed over to the Seanad.  It would be better to have the Seanad doing this than nobody doing it at all, no matter how democratic or undemocratic we feel it is.  We have a glorious opportunity as there is huge pressure at the moment to reform the Seanad.  There is also a great amount of work to be done in the European Union field.  There is work to be done and reforms are needed, so perhaps we could make them join up and give the Seanad a better role.  Let us give the Seanad what the committees do not want to do at the end of the day.  If they do not want to supervise statutory instruments, that function can be given to the Seanad.  If they do not want to hear Ministers before and after Council meetings, that function could be given to the Seanad.  If they do not want to do the subsidiarity control mechanism, the Seanad could be given a bigger role in it, although that is slightly different in that both Houses have to be involved.  A committee such as this could do an enormous amount of good by coming up with a report on how we can use the Seanad.  We should get everybody who was involved in the Seanad debate, such as Michael McDowell, Senator Zappone and so many-----</p></speech>

I think there is a role for the Seanad and now is the time to think about it.</p><p>  Deputy Durkan mentioned the issue of the conflict between national parliaments and the European Parliament.  I suspect both of them have a role.  It is impossible for national parliaments to have a fully European perspective.  We are going to see things from our own perspective in the Oireachtas.  In the European Parliament, we get a more European perspective.  At the same time, the European Parliament cannot do the job on its own by reason of the fact that people identify themselves primarily in national terms and also by virtue of the falling participation rates.  It may well be a shotgun marriage, but I suspect the partnership between the two will be a long-lasting one, and we will have to do the best we can to make it work.</p></speech>

There are no easy answers.  We have to ask whether a mandate system or scrutiny system would be workable, but on the other hand, countries with mandate systems and scrutiny systems tend to be those in which Ministers are more respectful of national parliaments.  There are two sides to this and I take the Deputy's point.</p><p>  He also raised the issue of the centralised committee problem and how difficult it would be to get reports made to the European Union affairs committee, as the committee might have to meet every day of the week.  I do not know the answer to that, but we could ask the Finns.  We should get somebody from Finland over here to talk about it, because they have made it work.

The question of the Prime Minister of Ireland speaking to MEPs and asking them to represent the position he wished to see in the European Parliament comes down to the question of the separation of powers at European Union level and the different functions.  National interests are represented in the Council of Ministers and the MEPs represent what they perceive to be the interests of their constituents, which may or may not coincide with the views of the Prime Minister of the country from which they come.  I assume that is what the Irish Members of the European Parliament were doing.</p></speech>

The original intention was that it would be a different type of House from the other House, which is the whole point.  Deputy Byrne makes the point that it is undemocratic but by doing so he is making the point for me that the Seanad could be a place where EU legislation is debated, because localism is something that does not exist in the Seanad, as opposed to the D&aacute;il.  I am making my point in a very convoluted way but it highlights why the House was instituted in the first place.  EU scrutiny would be an ideal role for the House, now that we have a mandate.  It is one of the more democratic mandates the Seanad has had.  I certainly agree with Deputy Byrne; I would have no problem with a change in the Seanad electoral system and it could be very effective.</p></speech>

Some of the speakers referred to suggestions and recommendations.  To be fair to Dr. Barrett, he has put a lot of issues forward for discussion.  I refer to the ten suggestions at the end.  I did not find them in the text but I jotted them down.  The recommendations in No. 6 could fill the Chairman's work programme without difficulty for the next two and a half to three years.  I suggest that we examine some of the suggestions as this is only a preliminary meeting.  This is a report about the Oireachtas so it is about ourselves.</p><p>  Dr. Barrett has listed ten recommendations.  The report in its entirety is too vast to read in full.  Dr. Barrett addresses issues which every parliament in Europe is wrestling with, some more successfully than others.  If we were to take a starting point, should we refer to Denmark, Finland or Sweden?  Which one would Dr. Barrett recommend that we engage with immediately?</p><p>  On the issue of subsidiarity, there has been some discussion about the Seanad.  I think we should decide what we want to do first and then subsequently decide how we are going to do it, whether in committee or in the Seanad, or whatever.  I refer to the issue of quantum of work.  This Legislature is undergoing change in that legislation will come to committees before being drafted by the Departments.  This will create significant work for committees and, given the resources available to them, I wonder how they will be able to compete with and mirror what whole Departments are doing.  Should we engage in drafting legislation or should we engage with European legislation that has been formally proposed in Europe?  It seems to me to be a stretch too far to try to do both at the beginning.</p><p>  We send MEPs to Europe.  What structure of formal engagement with our MEPs can be possible, given the separation of powers?  MEPs attend our committee meetings very occasionally.  I refer to recommendation No. 3, which is about combining decentralisation and centralisation - a bit of a contradiction.  There is no conduit for councils to send a message to the D&aacute;il.  Equally, there is no conduit between our Parliament and the European Parliament.  Our parties have MEPs and we will meet ours at the Fine Gael conference this weekend.  However, I do not think this committee sends MEPs to Brussels with a sufficiently Irish message from us.  I ask how this might be improved.  Our councils do not send a message to the national Parliament because we have done away with the dual mandate.  I have no doubt we will be speaking to Dr. Barrett at another meeting.</p></speech>

That is an excellent initiative which will prove useful for the future.  I do not know how the ideal form of engagement might look.  I can say that one area in which we have proved very weak is in using the resources we have at European level.  For instance, we have a former director of the World Trade Organization.  The current director of the European Union Civil Service, Ms Catherine Day, is Irish, as is her predecessor in that role.  In addition, we have a former President of the European Parliament.  These people, among whom I include our MEPs, represent an amazing resource of which we are not making full use.  I do not know exactly how the engagement should be structured, but structured it can and should be.  The committee might well have a role in that regard.  It should at least be possible, for example, to have meetings with MEPs from time to time in respect of particular proposals.</p></speech>

I am referring here to subsidiarity within the Oireachtas.  There is a need for decentralisation in the sense that all committees must become involved.  It is not possible in a single committee to have sufficient expertise to deal with agriculture, fisheries, the environment and so on.  At the same time, if we simply leave them to operate on their own without any central control, it will not work.  That is the context in which I am arguing that both centralisation and decentralisation are needed.</p></speech>

In regard to mandating, when we met delegates from the large Swedish European affairs committee earlier this year, we asked them on whose behalf they are operating when they issue a direction to their Minister - that is, on behalf of the European Union or on their own behalf.  They did not answer that question.  My conclusion was that they acted on their own behalf.  They also made the point that they had a particular association with several other countries, all of which, it was noted, have a strong eurosceptic element.  Will Dr. Barrett comment on those points?</p></speech>

Does he, for example, see a system whereby departmental committees would refer their analysis to an overarching committee, which may or may not be this particular committee?</p></speech>

That is what the Council of Ministers is for; it is a forum in which each country can represent its own national position at European Union level.  I would be surprised if any mandate system did anything other than that.  In terms of how such systems function, in the case of Denmark, for instance, the Government itself decides when it wants a mandate, in which case it drafts the mandate and presents it to Parliament.  Far from Parliament telling the Government what to do, the Danish situation has been described as one in which the Parliament becomes an extra member of the Government.</p><p>  The Deputy is absolutely correct in his point regarding euroscepticism.  It is indeed the case that the states with the best-functioning systems in terms of parliamentary control of government tend to be the more eurosceptic.  Perhaps Ireland can be the first to break that mould.</p><p>  In terms of its relationship with other committees, an enhanced system of oversight and scrutiny would increase the workload of this particular committee enormously.  Of course, that oversight role would not necessarily be taken by this committee but by a committee established for that particular purpose, for example, or perhaps by a sub-committee of this committee.  In any case, it would require one committee to be in control to make the system work.  If we simply let every committee do whatever it wants, it should come as no surprise if some do well and others badly.  Indeed, given the pressures the committees are under, it might not be a great surprise if all of them were to perform rather poorly.</p></speech>

Before we commence our main topic of discussion this morning, which is the meeting with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, we have two items relating to EU scrutiny to deal with in public session.  First, we will deal with the proposal as listed in Schedule B.  It is proposed that the proposal in Schedule B does not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  In Schedule A, COM (2013) 472 contains a proposal for regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on fees payable to the European Medicines Agency for the conduct of pharmacovigilance activities in respect of medicinal products for human use.  It is proposed that this proposal warrants further scrutiny.  It is proposed to write to the Department of Health requesting it to outline the results of the Department's public consultation in order to assist the committee in its scrutiny of the proposal.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  Before we commence in public session I pay tribute to Colm Duffy, a member of our staff who is being transferred to a different section.  I thank Colm for his work on behalf of all committee members for the past two years and wish him every success.  I welcome Luke Brennan to the committee secretariat.</p></speech>

Today's meeting provides another opportunity to bring Deputies and Senators up to date on the developments in my Department since we last met in July.  Members are familiar with a number of the initiatives so I will summarise what is in the text.</p><p>  I published the Child and Family Agency Bill and it is due to come before the committee on 22 October.  We will also introduce amendments to deal with the changes to the preschool sector during the course of the committee discussions.  Those are the changes relating to the need to register and the basic qualifications that will be required.  The Bill will give inspectors more authority to demand changes so that the services have the highest standards and to ensure that it will not be necessary to go to court to demand the changes.</p><p>  The board members have been appointed to the family support agency.  The work of establishing the agency continues.  As the committee is aware, a huge amount of work has been done in setting up what is effectively a shadow agency in the past year, with a reduction in the number of managers from 36 to 17.  A new management team is in place and all of the HR issues have been addressed.  A total of 4,000 staff have been informed they will be employees of the new agency.  Everything is working towards the establishment of the new agency in the new year and considerable progress has been made.  I thank everyone who has been involved in that regard.  As the committee is aware, the new child and family agency brings together children and family services, the Family Support Agency and the National Education Welfare Board.</p><p>  In terms of legislative priorities for this D&aacute;il session, in addition to bringing the Child and Family Agency Bill through the Houses work is continuing on the preparation of the Children First Bill and good progress has been made.  Deputy Troy inquired about the children (amendment) Bill.  I hope it will be published in November.  Much progress has been made in that regard.  I hope the Bill will go through the House before the end of the year.  The Government has approved the heads and general scheme of the children (amendment) Bill 2013.  That will provide for the amalgamation of the three different units on the Oberstown site.  It will also ensure there is improved management and operational efficiencies on the site.  Building work has commenced on the Oberstown site.  All of the contract details were finalised in recent weeks, including the various bonds which were complex and had to be negotiated.  All of the planning has been done and the building work has commenced.  In effect, next year we will be able to move 17 year olds from St. Patrick's Institution and there will no longer be 16 year olds or 17 year olds in this country in an adult prison.</p><p>  I wish also to ask the committee to discuss the heads of the adoption (tracing and information) Bill once it is published.  This legislation touches on very complex legal and constitutional issues.  At its core is the competing right to the privacy of a natural mother and the interest of an adopted person in establishing their history and identity.  I believe it will be necessary to have an open discussion on the matter in committee so that the various issues can be teased out.  Many of the organisations representing people who have been adopted will want to give evidence to the committee.  That should be an important part of the public consideration of the issues.  It is clear that we have moved very far in terms of the concept of open adoption and people wanting to get as much information as possible but there are extremely difficult constitutional issues relating to privacy in this country.  There are high expectations of the legislation but difficult, complex legal parameters are involved and that will require a good discussion and fairly complex committee hearings in order to tease out precisely what is involved in an Irish context.  Other countries are doing it but they do not have a Constitution, as we have.  I suggest that the committee would take the heads of the legislation and hold public hearings to examine the constitutional and personal issues involved in trying to develop the legislation.<br /><font color="#2F2F2F">  We were due to submit the third and fourth consolidated report to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child.  Both reports have been completed and forwarded to the UN.  We will be called to report in due course.  The third report was delayed but I am pleased that both reports have been completed.  They have outlined the various changes on which we have embarked in the Department and the various initiatives that have been taken.</font></p></speech>

If this is the case, will she explain why?  It would be appropriate that all Health Service Executive staff moving to this agency must be interviewed so that the agency has the appropriate skillsets to deal with the front-line issues that will arise.  Will the Minister give her views on this?</p><p>  I welcome the fact the Children Act will be introduced in two weeks.  We facilitated additional time for this Bill in the hope it will address concerns over what was omitted in the original legislation.  For example, we hope it will specify inter-agency co-operation, deal with the provision of child and adolescent mental health nurses and so forth.  Will the Minister confirm that these areas will be addressed?</p><p>  It is disappointing that the adoption (tracing and information) Bill has still not been published.  Like others, I have been requesting it for 18 months.  I hope it now receives the necessary attention and priority.</p></speech>

That is exactly as I see my role, as spokesperson on children and youth affairs, in the relationship with the Minister and her Department.  However, at the outset the Chair highlighted the long delay in receipt of responses to signalled issues by members of this committee that, I am sure, if we were to check on the submission times, date back six weeks.  It is not only a matter of three, four or five days.  The Minister, as a Deputy, will appreciate three issues I tabled for address with her.  I got the response to one of them at half past nine when I walked in here this morning.</p><p>  I am also highlighting something that I spoke to the Minister about recently.  We have spoken on a number of occasions about the importance of joined-up thinking on a cross-departmental basis.  I repeat my annoyance that the Minister's office continues to refuse parliamentary questions from me for oral address on the monthly engagement with the Minister where I ask whether she has taken the opportunity to engage with Ministers in other Departments on shared areas of concerned regarding children.  The practice, as I have stated previously, is wrong because one cannot pigeonhole children into merely the narrow position that applies within the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Minister's concern, as I am aware personally and politically, goes far beyond that.  These are reasonable questions.  They are not vexatious.  They are not meant to catch anybody out.  I have had a significant number of my questions disallowed, month after month, and I am sick, sore and tired of it.  I want the Minister to address that with the officials concerned so that it will not happen again.</p><p>  On the Minister's opening remarks, I, too, want to hear what assurances she can give that we have no reason to be concerned in relation to senior personnel of the Family Support Agency.  According to the announcement of 20 September of the members of the board of the Family Support Agency in transition to the new Child and Family Agency board, there are seven members, along with the Chair, Ms Norah Gibbons.  Is that the Minister's intended full complement of the board?  When will the board be established and commence its work?  Has that happened or is there a date now set?  Will the Minister give us an update in that regard?</p><p>  The Minister also indicated her legislative priorities in the course of her opening address here this morning.  I am concerned that in her legislative priorities she referred to the adoption (tracing and information) Bill.  We all worked hard in the children referendum campaign to ensure the successful passage of the proposals therein and I would have expected one of the priorities would have been the promised legislation - the outworking of the decision of the people.  That relates to the adoption (amendment) Bill, which does not appear in the Minister's priorities at this point in time.  I want the Minister to comment on that.</p><p>  Regarding one of my questions on the Oberstown campus, the two Oberstown units and Trinity House, I welcome the news that a campus manager has been identified.  I wonder whether the Minister is in a position to advise us on who is the intended appointee, when the successful candidate will be in position and whether it is an internal appointment.  Perhaps the Minister would give us whatever information she is in a position to give.</p><p>  I am also anxious to know the up-to-date position with the Victor McElfatrick report.  Does the Minister intend to publish it, and if so, when?  I have raised this matter with her previously.  I am concerned that to many minds it would appear that this report has been buried, and that is not appropriate.</p></speech>

Can the Minister comment on the relationship between management and staff now at the Oberstown campus?  There have unquestionably been stresses and strains.  Can she indicate what efforts are being employed to improve this and whether she is confident that whatever historical strains are in the past where they must be left?  Regarding recruitment for Oberstown and the intended potential of the new campus there, is the process under way for the recruitment of additional staff that the Minister highlighted in response to a parliamentary question I put to her just over a month ago?</p><p>  In association with all of that, is the Minister aware that a Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, report on one of the high support units in this country in my constituency, as is sadly the case with many other HIQA reports, has been used to apply a mallet rather than the necessary reforms, and that this high support unit will be closed on the turn of this month?</p></speech>

I welcome the announcements she made, in particular, on the adoption (tracing and information) Bill, on which I would certainly agree with her.  I understand some of the constitutional issues.  As she will be aware, when we were looking at the children referendum Bill, I raised in the Seanad the right to identity and the missed opportunity to look at that issue, but I realised that greater good had to be done in putting forward the referendum.  It is an issue on which we should hold public hearings.  There is a wide body of opinion.  I certainly would welcome that.</p><p>  I asked about the lodging of the report to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child and I want to acknowledge that is submitted and thank the Minister.  With the backlog with the committee, unfortunately, it will be 2016 - unless there is additional funding to the committee - when Ireland will get a hearing on its work up to 2011.  There is a serious issue here about how we scrutinise and look at these issues.</p><p>  A question I asked, question No. 10, goes fundamentally to some of the points that have been raised about reports that are produced.  I noted, in particular, the special rapporteur reports.  I agree that we all here want to work in co-operation, in partnership and collaboratively.</p></speech>

We have obviously taken a progressive approach to the establishment of the agency already.  The staff are already working to the new line management system.  There were interviews for the senior staff, management team and new line management.  It would not be feasible to have interviews for all 4,000 staff.  I am sure the Deputy would agree.  For the most part, the changes were internal.  That is the reality of recruitment at present.  I was pleased that we were able to recruit a good management team.  That is the team that Mr. Gordon Jeyes is leading.  I will ask the Secretary General to make some comments on the micro detail asked about in regard to management change concerning the establishment of the agency and board.  His comments will cover some of the other questions also.</p></speech>

That individual was recruited on a three year contract from England.  The individual has departed at this stage, after a year in post.  Obviously, we all make career decisions.  People contribute for a time and move on.  We will advertise the post publicly and recruit somebody as a permanent replacement.  It is worth noting that, at the start of October, the chief operations officer, who will be the second most senior in the organisation, took up duties.  That individual has a great deal of experience and has been director of children's services elsewhere.  The individual is a social worker by qualification.  There has been some further strengthening of the management team in addition to the departure the Deputies referred to.  Does the Minister want me to comment on governance?</p></speech>

It is more specific on what the Minister and Department will do and initiate in terms of the performance framework and performance statements.  There is more about the particular roles of the board members.  Uniquely, the set of responsibilities of the board <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> management are set out.  Particular responsibilities for the chief executive, in addition to those that will be delegated from the board, are covered.  We have gone further than most public agencies in trying to set out a governance framework.  Another factor worth noting is that there is a specific requirement in the legislation for the board to bring forward a code of governance.  The board itself will have to adopt a set of governance requirements that will apply throughout the organisation, setting out various levels of authorisation that will be needed for various decisions.  That will be submitted to the Minister within six months of the establishment of the board.  We have reflected on the point made by the Deputy and we hope to continue to prioritise the matter.  The Minister's appointments to the board should reflect a strong wish that good governance and a corporate approach to an organisation that will have 4,000 staff and a budget of &euro;600 million should be at the heart of the operations of the board.  That was a part of the decision-making process.</p></speech>

I take the point on the generality of the questions and the timeline associated with their arrival.  We will work on that for our next appearance in order to be within the five day period set out.  Question No. 4, on obesity, came over at 9:30 a.m.  I apologise personally for that.  I cleared all the questions, Nos. 1 to 17.  I cleared the first three separately from the rest.  Through my error, it was not clear that I had cleared No. 4.  That only emerged late last night.  I cleared the matter first thing this morning and it came over.  They should all have been over at the same time, so I apologise about question No. 4 and will commit to trying to improve procedures before our next appearance.</p></speech>

The board has had its first meeting.  It will continue with the work under the chairmanship of Ms Norah Gibbons.  Once the legislation goes through the D&aacute;il and Seanad and is finalised, the board will be called the board of the child and family agency.  Effectively, there will be a transition to the work in question.</p><p>  On Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's question about vacancies on the board, one more is to be filled.  When that is done, the full complement will have been reached.</p></speech>

Does the Judiciary take cognisance in its sentencing that sending a person to Oberstown or a unit in a public hospital ward is unacceptable?  Is it appropriate for members of the Minister's Department to liaise with the Judiciary on its sentencing practice and policy?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-10a.680" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013101000007#H00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for those questions.  It is not clear.  It is linked to court activity and sometimes coming up to the end of a court term one gets many referrals.  Sometimes it is arbitrary depending on what cases are referred to the courts and the previous history.  There is much movement of young people back and forth with court appearances.  Some of them may have had six court appearances before there is a decision, or they may have broken bail.  A wide variety of circumstances might apply.  The Judiciary is very well aware that detention is a last resort.  We will have discussions with the Judiciary on this issue because we want to do the very best for children.  We need to identify whether there are community resources that could be developed for some of these young people.</p><p>  Whether we speak of high support units, special care or detention, we are discussing people with very high levels of need.  In many cases their families ask for them to be taken into care because they cannot manage them - for example, to high support units such as was reported in the Monaghan case.  These are young people who are out of control.  If we were in another country we would probably have a greater range of specialist services for these young people.  I have reviewed the histories of some of the groups who have been in Oberstown recently and they are very similar to the children spoken about in the child death report, who have contact with many agencies, are high risk and can be extremely difficult to help and need a very specialist, co-ordinated approach.  If one really wants to help these young people one needs to deal with proper risk assessment and interventions.  Very often we need very specialist interventions and a range of services to help these people.</p></speech>

Therefore, approximately 25 staff have been employed in the centre because the rosters have to be covered in order that the young people in question have one-to-one care.  They are in the centre and safe.  There is a significant number of staff and significant monitoring.  Care plans are being made in association with their parents and the staff to find an alternative placement for them.</p><p>  The United Nations is behind in hearing the reports on individual countries, but we are ready, whenever that happens.  I have addressed the question on adoption and tracing.</p><p>  With regard to question No. 10, the Senator asked about the recommendations of the special rapporteur.  She made the point well about there being many reports and recommendations and questioned what had happened do them.  In this area, as we witnessed earlier in the context of the report on maternity care, there can be many recommendations, but what happens to them is an issue.  We commissioned research which will be published within the next few weeks.  I read a draft report on the issue by Ms Helen Buckley.  We asked her to address the issue of all the reports that had been compiled on children and how effective inquires, tribunals or reports were and what had happened to the recommendations made.  She and a colleague have a written a report on the reports and made a series of suggestions on how to avoid having many recommendations not being implemented and the approach that needs to be taken to ensure that does not happen.  The intention is to review current monitoring and reporting mechanisms and have a new framework in order that whenever a series of recommendations is made, we apply the framework.  This will mean that reports will not lie on shelves.  I take the Senator's point that it is no good having reports if they are not implemented.  Ms Buckley's report will offer a positive way of addressing that issue.</p><p>  The Senator also raised the issue of youth work funding.  According to the comprehensive review of expenditure, &euro;2.9 million will be taken from youth funding this year.  I agree with the Senator that youth services have had serious financial issues to deal with since 2007.   However, administrators are doing a good job.  I would prefer if there were no cutbacks to youth services this year, but whether I can arrive at that point is entirely a budgetary question.  Clearly, there are priorities in every area and despite the improved budgetary outlook in the context of the overall financial position of the State and while I would like to invest in youth services, we are still in a scenario where we must find savings of almost &euro;3 million.  I will do my best to ensure the figure is less than this, but that is what was outlined in the three-year programme.</p></speech>

I said it was an internal HR report that had to go to the board.  I have not yet received a recommendation from the board on it and when I do, I will communicate with the Deputy.  I am not sure if I will be in a position to publish it.  It was an internal HR report that was commissioned, but I will ask the board if it can be published.  If it can be, I will publish it.  It may be that given there is a great deal of personal detail in it, it would not be appropriate to publish it.</p><p>  Preparations are under way for recruitment of staff at Oberstown.</p></speech>

Does the Minister envisage the new family agency, which will be established relatively soon, will start with a budget deficit?  If so is there anything we can do ensure it does not?  We do not need a new agency starting off with one arm and one leg tied behind it.  We all have large aspirations for its achievements and I ask the Minister to make a statement on this.</p></speech>

I wish to touch on an issue which the Minister has not dealt with; I do not expect her to give an answer here but I ask that it be considered.  Young people, including children as young as ten, are dropping out of education and going down the wrong road towards criminal activity.  They fall between three Departments, namely, Education and Skills, Justice and Equality and Children and Youth Affairs.  A number of voluntary agencies provide services but receive very little support.  I ask the Minister to put this on the agenda for the next six months to see whether more co-ordination is possible and perhaps meet some of the voluntary agencies working in the area.  Voluntary agencies are trying to get these young people back into education, and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also involved, but funding is a major issue for some projects.</p></speech>

We should learn from our mistakes.  When the HSE was established and the health boards were abolished, practically 100% of the staff of the health boards moved directly across the HSE with no recognition of need or ensuring the appropriate skill set was in place.  I appreciate it would be cumbersome and time-consuming, but it would also be the right thing to do to ensure the new agency starts with the appropriate staff from day one.</p><p>  I welcome the fact the Minister is working hard on mentoring and the training programme.  With regard to children ending up in detention, the Minister did not comment on whether she thought it was appropriate for a young teenager to end up in a public ward of one of our hospitals because at the time there was no place for him in an appropriate setting.  This person, who was a danger to himself and the wider community, was placed in a hospital with sick and vulnerable children.  The Minister spoke about the need for preventative care in such instances.</p><p>  I submitted a question on social workers, and my colleague Senator van Turnhout held a briefing session for interested parties on the new child and family legislation.  The Irish Association of Social Workers briefed us on the problems they see.  It stated it was not aware the Minister had established a panel; that the staffing complement must fall below 80% before it can seek replacements; and that in one area in Dublin 300 at-risk children still live at home because no social workers are available to deal with the cases.  We are falling down with regard to preventative care.</p></speech>

I have raised the issue many times because it is appalling and despicable that some local authorities consider fostering allowance to be reckonable income when calculating rent.  It is done by only a few local authorities but it is just outrageous.  The money is meant to be for the needs of the children being fostered.  It is appalling and despicable.  A lady who fosters twin girls lives in a local authority house.  Her rent was &euro;120 per month but because she fosters these two little girls her rent is now &euro;480 per month.  It is appalling this money is not being used for its intended purpose.  I am glad the Minister will discuss it with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government because this issue seems to fall between the cracks.  It seems to be everybody's problem but nobody's problem.  The little girls will suffer because the money is being taken as rent.</p><p>  With regard to family requests for children to be taken into care where they are out of control and perhaps violent or abusive in the family home, I know of a case where a child was taken into care at the request of the family but the child was subsequently brought back to the family home and family is still not able for her because she is abusive and out of control.  A social worker re-introduced her to the family home stating she believes this is in the best interests of the child.  The other family members do not agree with this because there are other children in the home who suffer as a result of the abuse.  The latest update I have is the social worker who stated she is better off in the family home is going on maternity leave in November and is closing the case.  I would like to discuss this case with the Minister because it seems to be a terrible situation for the family.  Other children in the home are at risk because people do not want to deal with the issue.</p></speech>

We are bringing together the budgets of the HSE child and family services, the National Education Welfare Board and the Family Support Agency.  We are examining the most effective use of resources possible in this context.  Over the past two years successful progress has been made on budgetary management.  Undoubtedly we have seen this.  Gordon Jeyes has led a change process on better management at national level but it is very challenging.  I would like to point out some of the challenges which the sector for which I have responsibility is facing.  We have an increasing population which creates a natural increase in demand, whether for fostering which Deputy McLellan spoke about, or because more children are coming into care.  Our work on alerting the public to interrupt and report child abuse means we have more referrals which must be dealt with.  The demographics are very challenging and put increasing demands on the services.</p></speech>
