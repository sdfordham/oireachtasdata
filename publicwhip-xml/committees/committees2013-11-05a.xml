Before I begin, I bring to the attention of witnesses the matter of privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that where possible they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that Members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I now call on Mr. Cormac Cunningham to make his opening statement.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-05a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cormac Cunningham" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013110500003#C00200"><p>It is a great honour to be here in front of the committee to present our case.  I will give some background.  Mr. Ruair&iacute; Cunningham and I are brothers and members of the Cunningham family which has been in the milk business on the island of Ireland for 150 years.</p><p>  As members can see from our presentation, we are Ireland's oldest family dairy.  Wherever one is in Ireland, one will find Strathroy fresh milk and dairy products.  We supply milk and dairy products sourced directly from Irish farms.  Our distribution network covers every county in Ireland.  Being deeply involved in the dairy industry, the issue we wish to raise is an urgent one.  If it not addressed, it will be bad for consumers, farmers and employment in Ireland.  In our presentation today, we outline the potential impacts of this issue and some potential solutions we would respectfully suggest to the committee.  </p><p>  It may seem a bit obvious for the committee but we feel we need to say that we are an Irish business.  We source Irish milk directly from Irish farms and contribute to strong prices for Irish farmers because we actively compete for their milk.  We provide over 250 jobs throughout the island of Ireland and milk and dairy products of the highest quality to Irish consumers.  The "Guaranteed Irish" mark is one of the oldest and most recognisable origin labelling campaigns in Ireland and one of the most trusted symbols for Irish manufactured goods and services.  We carry this symbol.  </p><p>  I will move on to the National Dairy Council, NDC, and its mark.  Despite everything I have just said, we do not qualify for the NDC's packaging mark "Farmed in the Republic of Ireland" simply because the milk we buy is processed in Omagh.</p></speech>

The strapline on its logo contains the term "Farmed in the Republic of Ireland".  Even though we are an Irish company and supply Irish milk, we cannot carry the NDC logo.  In a way, the NDC is being disingenuous and is misinforming the consumer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-05a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cormac Cunningham" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013110500003#C00400"><p>The NDC mark says "Farmed in the Republic of Ireland" but it does not say that in order to qualify to carry the mark, the milk must be farmed and processed in the Republic of Ireland.  We source Irish milk directly from Irish farms all over the island.  We have depots and distribution facilities all over Ireland and employ more than 250 people but because we process this Irish milk in Omagh, we cannot use the words "Farmed in the Republic of Ireland".  Making any distinction between cows North and South is not only bad for us but bad for the entire dairy industry on the island.</p><p>  Having been in the dairy industry for so long, we fully recognise the importance of issues such as quality, origin and traceability.  Consumers want to know that the products they buy have these guarantees and retailers want to know these things as well.  We can guarantee all these things to consumers.  We guarantee the quality, the origin from Irish farmers and the traceability of all of our milk and milk products.  This graphic from our presentation shows the craziness of the entire situation.  One sees the cow on the left and a map of Ireland on the right.  There is no change in what happens to the milk or where it ends up if the cow stands on the upper side.  If the cow stands in the Republic, it can carry the mark as long as the milk is processed in the Republic.  As I said at the outset, I am a dairy farmer.  I bought a group of high EBI heifers from a farmer in the South only six or eight months ago.  They crossed the Border to go to our farm.  Is anyone going to tell me there is something completely different about those cows so that they cannot carry the mark "Farmed in the Republic of Ireland", which they could have if they had stayed at home?  If they come to me, they cannot carry it.  It seems ridiculous.  </p><p>  We also had a strange situation because of the confusion around this mark at the National Ploughing Championships.  Cows were brought down from a farm in County Derry to demonstrate how a robot milker works.  As a result of the confusion, they could not decide whether the cows were Northern or Southern cows and as a result, the milk was almost thrown out.  We came down and picked up the milk.  We made a donation to Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin from the money we generated from the milk rather than let the milk be wasted but members can see the confusion this mark can cause.  The dairies that were there were worried that if they bought the milk, it might be seen as Northern milk.  Looking at where the cow is from is not the way to run a business.  </p><p>  Our processing facilities have been audited by all the key retailers.  They have satisfied themselves beyond any doubt about the rigour and the integrity of our processes we carry out but despite all of those measures, the NDC will not allow us to carry the mark.  This will impact our business.  As previously stated, if it is bad for our business, it is bad for consumers because we actively compete to get into shops and competition keeps prices competitive for the consumer.  It is bad for farmers because we buy milk directly from farmers and are actively competing to get farmers to supply milk to us.  They do not supply the milk to us to get a worse price.  The only reason they supply us is because we pay a better price.  We bring competition to the market base for farmers as well.  If we, farmers and consumers are lose out, it will have an effect on employment.  </p><p>  The NDC is not a State agency or a semi-State body.  This mark is not Government policy.  The NDC is an industry-financed organisation.  However, there is no denying the impact this promotional mark is having.  Some retailers, some of whom we are already doing business with, want it but we are precluded from having it simply because of the location of our processing plant.</p> <p>The NDC was set up in 2009 and in 2011, the NDC mark was launched on milk products.  The council based the rationale for its existence on research.  The survey it quotes states that consumers have become engaged in the jobs debate since the recession with 31% saying they are buying more Irish food and drink brands.  When asked why, 90% say they want to support the economy and jobs.</p><p> However, if one digs into the report, it also states consumers are not interested in a North versus South conversation.  The NDC believes its mark gives consumers the opportunity to show their support for local jobs on dairy farms and in the dairy sector in an active way when deciding what milk or cream to buy.  The mark jeopardises that but the NDC believes it gives consumers in the Republic the reassurance of knowing that if they buy milk or cream with the council's guarantee, it is both farmed and processed locally.  We can give the guarantee it is farmed locally but the provision of the mark at plants where it is processed for chains is bad for competition, farmers, consumers and employment.  We support local jobs and local dairy farmers and we complete robust assurance of traceability and origin.  We understand the motive of retailers for such a mark because they can show the mark to consumers and say, "It is safe.  It is local and we know its origin".  However, there are ways of achieving that outcome that do not result in processors being excluded.  Some retailers may also have a sense that this mark demotes higher quality but it does not.  The NDC does not carry out quality audits on the farms and because the word "National" is in the title, it may confuse people into thinking it is national policy when it is not.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-05a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cormac Cunningham" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013110500004#D00300"><p>That is a local issue but if we broaden it, we must consider the impact this mark could have and the image it portrays of Ireland internationally.  With 90% of our farmers being manufacturing farmers, the majority of milk generated on the island is exported into important markets all around the world.  We would have to come against this sort of competition in other markets.  This packaging mark is anti-competitive and contravenes EU legislation.  It uses country of origin labelling in an anti-competitive way and it has implications for vital trade between Ireland and the UK and the wider EU.  It is inconsistent with national policy on food and drink, the wishes of consumers and the island of Ireland approach to animal health.  The mark is anti-competitive because it is in breach of EU legislation, the Single Market and Article 101 of the treaty on the functioning of the EU.  We received independent legal opinion, which states, &quot;The NDC mark has the effect of restricting parallel import and impeding free movement of goods throughout the EU, which will adversely affect the promotion of a single European market ... There is a clear, <i>prima facie</i> breach of Article 101&quot;.</p><p>  With regard to country of origin labelling, a report by Deloitte and the Dairy Council of Northern Ireland stated, &quot;COOL is intended to clarify the origin of food products for the consumer helping them to make an informed choice on whether to buy a local product over an alternative sourced from another part of the EU or elsewhere&quot;.  Other factors such as price and quality will form part of the consumer's decision but this labelling is not supposed to be used to interfere with the free movement of goods between member states.  The Deloitte report states in this regard: &quot;Denying Northern Ireland dairy products the opportunity to compete for a place on ROI supermarket shelves through the abuse of COOL means that consumers in the Republic are being denied freedom of choice.  This has knock-on effects potentially for vital Irish trade&quot;.  Other markets in the EU are vital for us given so much of the milk produced on the island is exported.  We do not want to do anything that could affect that negatively.</p><p>  I refer to a number of quotes in this regard.  Arlene Forster, the Stormont trade Minister, is exercised about this but the comments Ian Potter, an agricultural commodities trader, particularly milk quota, wrote on his blog about his reaction to hearing about the NDC are more telling.  He said:<blockquote>Meanwhile, we sit back and allow Irish cheese to flood into our market at retail, catering and government procurement levels much of it coming via the IDB/Adams Foods ... if Southern Ireland can exclude our dairy products we should follow their lead instead of continually rolling over and hiding behind competition issues.</blockquote>I do not like to see this stuff written about Ireland.  Pat O'Keeffe, news editor of the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> wrote: &quot;In the case of liquid or fresh milk, my view is that the real losers in this battle for market share are dairy farmers, north and south&quot;.  James Campbell, also of the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal </i>stated:<blockquote> The tonnages of cheese and butter sold into the UK from the RoI far outweigh the value of the entire southern Irish Liquid Milk supply ... The irony is that the money to support the NDC campaign and liquid milk producers is coming from those most in danger if there is a backlash against Irish dairy products in the UK.</blockquote>The quotes go on from independent journalists and commentators on the dairy industry.  They recognise the impact this could have if it was replicated somewhere else.</p><p>  The red tractor mark is often brought up as the UK has a similar scheme but if one looks at it closely, one will realise that this is a food assurance scheme that covers production standards developed by experts on safety, hygiene, animal welfare, the environment among others.  The logo on a pack means the food or drink has met these responsible production standards and is fully traceable back to the farm but it is not used to deny products from other member states access to shelf space.</p><p>  One could take any number of dairy products but I will use Kerrygold butter as an example.  If the Irish Dairy Board was to depend on the NDC mark for trading, this butter could not carry it as the board sources its milk is from the entire island.  It has more than 15% of the German market where it has been trading for 40 years.  It sells the butter at a premium and it is doing a superb job for Irish exports and the brand of Food Ireland.  The board is blazing a trail and the butter is seen as high quality.</p><p>  I refer to national policy that was agreed at meetings such as this.  It refers to Ireland, the food island, and an all-Ireland approach with no divide between North and South.  Bord Bia's Food Harvest 2020 strategy, which was produced in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, outlines that our national strategy for agriculture, food and fisheries is about Ireland, the food island, and there is no differentiation between North and South.  Bord Bia is the State body responsible for the commercial success of world class Irish food and drink.  It takes an all-Ireland approach and has national quality assurance marks.  The board addressed all the issues I outlined earlier relating to quality, origin, traceability and Strathroy Dairy would qualify for the Bord Bia quality assurance mark but the only problem is its remit does not cover milk.  The next slide demonstrates how the board has addressed the nuances of what lies before us.  There are three different marks.  The first states &quot;Origin-Ireland&quot;, the next &quot;Origin Northern Ireland&quot; and the final one &quot;Produced &amp;amp; Processed Ireland &amp;amp; Northern Ireland&quot;.  One could argue NDC is bringing nothing new to the party.  There are enough good strong labels in the market that cover the issues that need to be covered to give consumers the reassurance they need.</p><p>  This is not consistent with what the consumer wants.  Bord Bia's approach is grounded in its own consumer research.</p> <p>Bord Bia's report states: <blockquote>The importance of heritage and tradition &ndash; brands that we are familiar with over years &ndash; appears to have become more prominent in consumers&rsquo; definition of an Irish brand.  Loyalty towards Irish brands today is down to the fact that consumers have become more aware that buying Irish is a step towards economic recovery.  Consumers are not interested in a north v south conversation.</blockquote>As a dairy farmer, animal health is very important to me.  We are aware of issues such as BVD, IBR and even foot and mouth disease in the not too distant past.  Animal Health Ireland is actively involved with Animal Health and Welfare NI to have an all-island strategy.  A BVD eradication programme is under way in the Republic, and while it is a year behind, one is also under way in Northern Ireland.  The same high standards are being applied across the island because the traceability and quality of food on the island is what is important.</p><p> I come to possible solutions, the first of which is the legal route.  The next slide in my presentation outlines Mr. Justin McCarthy's view on the legal route.  I agree with him that it represents time, money and effort wasted that would be better spent exploring other avenues.  Do we need a new quality mark?  There are a plethora of quality marks in Ireland which guarantee quality and provenance.  Some are more stringent than others in terms of auditing for quality.  There is confusion among consumers about what those marks are telling them and what they represent.  It is possible to buy Gem sugar carrying the &quot;Love Irish Food&quot; mark.  To the best of my knowledge we do not produce any sugar beet to turn into sugar.  Barry's tea carries the &quot;Love Irish Food&quot; mark.  Whereas I love Barry's tea, I do not know where the tea plantations are on the island.  There is confusion among retailers about what the marks mean.  The Bord Bia approach we mentioned earlier provides a potential approach to solving the problem.</p><p> In an ideal world I would recommend ending the NDC packaging mark for the reasons outlined on the slide.  We favour an all-island approach.  We do not need all these, sometimes competing, food labels as its confusing for consumers.</p></speech>

It is annoying and embarrassing that it is possible to buy milk in this part of our island that has been processed in the other part of the island without the same legal entitlements from the NDC.  It is effectively cementing partition for want of a better word and is an indictment.</p><p>  Mr. Cunningham said his company provided 250 jobs.  How many of them are in this jurisdiction?</p></speech>

Mr. Cunningham mentioned that he bought heifers or cows in the South, brought them back, milked them there, brought them back down to the South and yet the company is being discriminated against.  Mr. Cunningham mentioned that it is anti-competitive and contravenes EU legislation.  Whereas he does not want to go down the legal route, it is an option.  If this cannot be resolved in a competitive way, will that option become a reality?</p><p>  Mr. Cunningham mentioned the Bord Bia proposal that produce, regardless of where on the island of Ireland it originated, should carry the Irish brand, and I believe that is the way to go.  Did Mr. Cunningham ever consider taking action through the Equality Authority?  This seems like discrimination.  The Equality Authority was established following the Good Friday Agreement.  It may represent an avenue for moving this issue forward.</p><p>  Is there potential for Strathroy to grow in terms of jobs?  Is there potential to establish another processing plant, perhaps in a different part of the island?  What are the options for progress other than through a legal test?  How can we help to try to resolve this?</p></speech>

Mr. Cunningham said that Strathroy products can be found throughout Ireland.  Does Strathroy also supply own-brand products?  Obviously in such circumstances consumers would not see the Strathroy label.  Is that the reason Mr. Cunningham is saying we cannot see the Strathroy label?</p><p>  The National Dairy Council is financed by private industry.  It has been in existence since 1964 and was set up long before the sort of co-operation we would expect now and also before the advent of EU legislation on discriminatory practice.  In all the quotes Mr. Cunningham provided, I do not see any from the NDC.  What relationship does Strathroy have with the NDC and what conversations has Mr. Cunningham had with the NDC?  I must conclude that the witnesses are here because they are unable to make any progress with the NDC.  Will Mr. Cunningham to elaborate on what has happened with the NDC?</p><p>  The NDC is not a Government or semi-State organisation.  It is entitled to include the word "national" in its title because it has been around since 1964.  When it was established it would have been a national dairy council - exactly what it said on the tin.  I am not sure we can level any criticism at it for using the term "national" - many organisations do so.  Given what was going on at the time and now, it is not a crime, as far as I know, to use that term.  I have never been confused by its identity as being anything other than a privately financed industry organisation.</p><p>  I will cut to the chase.  Strathroy has been in business for a long time and is very successful.  It has a very good product.  As it has been in business for 150 years, that is an extremely sound reputation.  Do the witnesses feel others in the industry here are effectively protecting themselves and making it clear they do not want Strathroy as part of their club, because if it is part of their club, it may take their business, including that of Glanbia and others?  Is that at the heart of this?  Do the witnesses feel those companies are protecting themselves and Strathroy has been cut out, thereby preventing it from expanding its business?</p><p>  I do not deny the huge confusion over the various marks.  Mr. Cunningham mentioned Barry's tea.  Everybody knows Barry's tea is packaged in Cork and has been around for a very long time.  Nobody disputes that the tea itself, obviously, did not come from here.  Those labels have been in existence for a long time and they have different meanings.  We have raised the issue here and elsewhere that there is extraordinary confusion for consumers because those marks do not mean what they appear to mean.  Is there another trade group mark that Strathroy can use either in the UK or in Northern Ireland?  What is it about the National Dairy Council mark that is so precious, apart from the obvious reasons Mr. Cunningham has stated about the quality of Ireland's food, Irish milk and so on, which I do not denigrate in any way?  Does Strathroy feel it is being pushed out and that it would like to take a greater share of that business?</p></speech>

What price is paid to Northern Ireland farmers for a litre of milk?</p> <p>Notwithstanding the presentation, I reconcile our guests' very obvious frustration with the concerns expressed by some of my constituents who are liquid milk producers.  They believe that the significant investment in the Republic of hundreds of millions of euro in the development of new liquid milk product lines and the exploration of new export markets is not being matched north of the Border.  Liquid milk producers in the Republic are concerned about the future.  Two weeks ago, our groceries order report flagged a concern that there may come a time when liquid milk is not produced in this country due to downward pressure on prices.  Do our guests wish to comment in this regard?</p><p> I accept their point that there should not be a distinction between North and South.  The example was given of the distance between Donegal and Omagh only being 20 miles there and back.  Is a part of the difficulty the uncertainty about whether the milk that returns to Donegal is the original Donegal milk?  Is this the perspective of the National Dairy Council, NDC, which has been established for a long time?</p></speech>

If the NDC campaign is as successful as it wants to be, Strathroy Dairy Limited would be out of the Southern market altogether and those 75 jobs would be gone.  I imagine that the three large processors in the South would be able to take up the slack of the small amount of milk that we are providing, but they would not replace any of the 75 lost jobs.</p><p>  The Deputy asked about another processing plant.  The answer is "Yes and No".  For years, there have been calls for rationalisation in the dairy industry, in that there are too many plants.  We agree.  Our plant is the best and most efficient on the island, which is the reason that we are the size that we are.  We do it better.  It is not that we have an advantage in price terms, a subject that Cormac will probably cover.  Setting up another liquid milk plant would essentially double costs.  Someone must pay.  Ultimately, that would be the consumer or the farmer if the money was taken back from him or her.  We prefer to leave our plant where it is and get the maximum out of it.  That would be more beneficial for us, the consumer and the farmer.</p></speech>

The Deputy may laugh, but we have gone to considerable lengths.  Our processing plant must be able to produce different types of milk, for example, organic milk.  We all have opinions on organics, but anyone producing organic milk must be able to certify 100% that it has not been mixed with or contaminated by conventional milk.  The same applies to goat's milk.  If one produces semi-skimmed milk, one must ensure that semi-skimmed goes into the semi-skimmed jar, not whole milk.  The separation of whole milk, semi-skimmed and skimmed is easy.  It costs a great deal of money, but we have done that.  We have been audited to show that organic or Republic of Ireland milk can be traced right through our plant from the start to when it is put on a lorry and delivered.  It is not that we do not want to make an investment or cannot do it.  We have the facilities to segregate milk if that is what people want, but that is not enough.  Unfortunately, this does not answer the question.</p></speech>

If the NDC's campaign was successful and we were excluded from the Southern market, we would definitely go down the legal route.  I first came to Dublin to start building this business in 1995 and I would be sore if something like this took that bit of business away from us.  The problem is that a non-government body is industry funded, in that it is taking &euro;2.4 million per year out of farmers' pockets.  Only 10% of farmers can hope to gain, as 90% are manufacturing farmers.  If we went to Europe or wherever and were found to be in the right and received damages, the farmer would pay them.  We have no interest in taking money out of farmers' pockets.  Cormac would probably never forgive me.  They work long and hard enough without us doing that.  This is why we are in attendance today.  If we believed that the legal route was the way to go, we would have already taken it.</p></speech>

As Ruair&iacute; stated, the NDC is indirectly taking money out of farmers' pockets.  Farmers provide that money voluntarily in the misguided belief that it is to their advantage.  The majority of farmers are manufacturing farmers.  To date, the money has been spent on the NDC campaign.  It gets money for generic milk advertising, but that is supplied by Europe.  The majority of the &euro;2.4 million has been collected from the 90% of farmers, including liquid milk farmers.  Who will gain?  I would argue that the liquid milk farmers cannot gain.  There are in or around 2,000 registered liquid milk producers in the Republic.  All of that milk has been paid the full liquid premium, yet only half of it is being used for the liquid market.  The rest of it ends up in manufacturing products.  Obviously, that side is being subsidised.</p><p>  Let us not worry about that, as I have no problem with farmers getting a good price for their milk, but the downside of this campaign is the question of who wins.  Liquid milk farmers cannot.  Even if the market for liquid milk improved significantly, it would not create more liquid milk farmers, quota or licensed liquid producers.  There is no upside for the farmer despite having spent &euro;2.4 million.  Internationally speaking, the downside is for manufacturing farmers who are giving money hand over fist.  Their milk is being used to make cheese, butter, etc.  Per head, Ireland's level of consumption of liquid milk is the third highest in the EU.  People cannot be made to drink much more of the stuff.  The market cannot really grow, although there will be some population growth.  Would it not be better to use the money to try to find other markets?  Research was mentioned.  Some &euro;2.4 million would fund a great deal of research into various products.  This would benefit manufacturing farmers, as it would move milk from whole milk powder, skimmed powder or butter into higher value products.  Derry has one of the lowest consumption levels in Europe of desserts, yoghurts and cheese.  There is considerable scope for a marketing campaign.</p><p>  No matter how the campaign turns out, there is no upside from the liquid milk farmer's point of view.  I cannot see how such farmers will gain, even if they only fund approximately 10% of it.</p></speech>

If anyone is searching for our products, turn a jar upside down and "Strathroy" will be written there.</p><p>  Our gripe is not with the NDC.  It does a great deal of good work.  It educates the consumer about the benefits of dairy products, cheese, etc.</p> <p>They have a place but this campaign is misguided.  It is not doing what it says on the tin and is taking money out of farmers' pockets.  We are not against the NDC but are against this particular campaign.  We do not have any issue with the name.</p><p> As regards membership, the campaign commenced in 2009.  In early 2010 I contacted the NDC and asked if Strathroy Dairy Limited could join but was told in no uncertain terms that it could not do so.

I understand it has been forwarded to a membership committee.  The NDC has stated that Strathroy Dairy Limited would never be able to utilise the trademark because its milk, irrespective of from where it is purchased, is processed in its plant in Omagh.</p></speech>

I am happy enough to use that.  I have no problem doing so.  If were to use it, the issue would then disappear.  We were asked why in our view the campaign was launched.  I do not know because I do not have the NDC's ear.  In my view the reason the NDC campaign was launched was to try to force us out of the market and to give others an unfair competitive advantage over the major liquid milk processor on the island.</p><p>  I will provide some background.  Strathroy Dairy Limited, which was established by my father who is in the Visitors Gallery, has grown to be the second largest liquid milk processor on this island  We started out as dairy farmers and remain so.  Obviously, it is one of the main competitors.  We all know the largest competitor.  In terms of how growth in Strathroy Diary Limited can be prevented or how others can compete against it, this can be done in the area of price, quality and service.  We have no problem with that and will take them on on that basis every time.  The NDC had to come up with something with which we could not compete.</p><p>  In response to Deputy Heydon, I would say the NDC came under pressure from liquid milk producers in the South who believed they were under pressure from milk producers in the North.  In this regard, milk price was mentioned.  Prices North and South are virtually identical.  As I said, farmers do not come to us to get less for their milk in the South.  We also have southern suppliers, who get more than their neighbours.  We do not buy milk cheap and sell it cheap.  We buy it expensively, sell it and make a profit on it because we are very good at our jobs.  Obviously, farmers were coming under pressure from their processors who were going to cut the milk price because of milk coming in from the North.</p><p>  In a meeting similar to this, I met farmers and discussed their supplying us with milk.  A man sitting beside me at that meeting asked me if it was true that we dump milk in the South, which took me back.  My response was to ask him from where I would get milk so cheaply I could afford to dump it and if he thought the farmers who supplied me with milk were stupid.  Those farmers supply Strathroy Dairy Limited with milk because it gives them competitive advantage and pays them a good price for it.  There is no cheap milk to be bought.  There is certainly no milk to be dumped anywhere, not if one wants to remain in business.</p></speech>

It may be being used.  I know from talking to retailers we supply that they have come under sustained pressure from the IFA to support the NDC logo.  One could ask why the IFA would do this.  The IFA should be looking after the interests of every farmer and not just the 2,000 liquid milk farmers.  What would happen if this type of protectionist policy were to be introduced in other countries?  The volume of beef, pork, chicken and dairy products exported from Ireland is huge.  Why would the IFA support this campaign which jeopardises all these exports and affects all farmers in the country?  It is madness.  As regards whether only Strathroy Dairy is being targeted, that is possible.  Much will depend on what view the IFA takes on the matter now.</p></speech>

The price in respect of the largest producer, Glanbia, was 34.78 cent.  Our average price over the same period was 36.7 cent.  We are paying a very good price to farmers.  They would not come to us if we were not doing so.  What is more, they would not stay with us unless we paid them a proper price.  The fallacy that Strathroy Diary Limited provides cheap milk and is dumping it in the South is wrong.  We pay our farmers top price.  We do it better.  We are more competitive.  That is why we have increased in size.  It would appear that processors in the South could not, perhaps, get their ships in order and do things the way we are doing them, and for this reason this campaign was launched.</p></speech>

These lads have nothing to gain or lose with this campaign but manufacturing farmers are stumping out the money for it.</p></speech>

There is no evidence of that.  A huge amount of the investment in the Republic has been in plant and machinery.  The Irish Government provided huge grants to develop the industry, and rightly so, but an awful lot of it went into the creation of more powder and butter plants.  It is what we are going to need.  Let us honest, we are a net exporting nation.</p></speech>

Senator O'Keeffe mentioned that the largest percentage of Strathroy Dairy's product goes into own-brand.  I think this was confirmed by Mr. Ruair&iacute; Cunningham.  What percentage of the dairy's product goes into own-brand?  What retailers are being supplied with their own-brand product by Strathroy Dairy?  The witnesses can answer those questions later on.  It has been confirmed that the dairy is not processing anything from the mainland UK.  I suppose most of my other questions have been asked by other members.</p><p>  The liquid milk suppliers in this country supply the co-ops here.  One of the main co-ops is supposed to have 2,000 liquid milk producers.  The suppliers have to guarantee their co-ops a certain level of quality.  They have to give an assurance with regard to quality of milk, etc.  They have to ensure the cows coming into their herds are professionally calved.  I have seen Strathroy Dairy's advertisements in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> and all the farming publications actively canvassing for milk from the Republic.  I suppose they are taking manufacturing milk from the Republic and using it as a liquid milk product.  As Mr. Ruair&iacute; Cunningham said, some 50% of the liquid milk in this country goes into manufacturing anyway.  If Strathroy Dairy is actually using manufacturing milk as a liquid milk product, what quality assurance can it give this committee and the general public with regard to its product?</p></speech>

As a long-suffering liquid milk producer in the South - I was one of the 2,000 hard-pressed producers for a long time - I find today's debate very interesting.  I would like to ask a couple of straightforward questions.  How much money has Strathroy Dairy invested in its processing plant over the last ten years?  What is the average farm size, measured by reference to the number of cows, of the dairy's suppliers?  How does that compare to what we have in the South?  I would like to ask about the dairy's producers.  The witnesses mentioned that their company has made inroads into every county in the South.  Does it have suppliers in every county?</p><p>  I would like to pick up on the point made by Deputy Heydon about price.  There is a contention that those of us in the South are not operating on a level playing field, compared to those in the North.  I do not mean to keep differentiating between one and the other, as I do not think that is the whole purpose of the exercise.  We all want to get to the bottom of the whole issue.  How is it possible for Strathroy Dairy to be successful and productive if it is travelling to collect milk in counties Carlow or Kildare, bringing it back to Omagh and bringing it back down again to put it on shelves in some of the large multiples?  I will not mention any particular examples.  How is the dairy making a profit from such activity when its produce is being sold at a similar price to that produced by farmers in County Carlow who supply milk to Glanbia, which is just down the road, to be sold from a shelf just over the road?  How can that be done?</p><p>  There is a fear about what will happen if we open the floodgates and a large amount of milk starts to come from the South.  The fact that 25% of the milk in the North is coming down into the Southern market has been debated here over a period of time.  If the floodgates are opened, will that put more and more pressure on producers in the South?  The witnesses have said that Strathroy Dairy pays its suppliers well for their milk.  I would contend that nobody pays their suppliers well.  This issue has been discussed at this forum for a while.  The percentage the farmer is getting today is less than the percentage the farmer was getting 20 years ago.  I would not call that paying well.  How can that be achieved?</p></speech>

I thank both witnesses for coming here and making a presentation.  I suppose it is all about how much milk is sourced in the South, and the number of jobs that Strathroy Dairy is creating in the South.  Senator O'Neill asked whether the dairy buys milk from mainland Britain.  There is a fear among Southern farmers with regard to Northern milk coming in, flooding the market and reducing the price.  There were problems in the past when the price was reduced.  Farmers, producers and farm organisations are afraid that the prices achieved by producers in the South will be reduced.  I think nearly everything else I wanted to ask has been covered.</p></speech>

I do not know where to start.  I will try to start somewhere.  I grew up on a dairy farm.  I must admit my loyalties lie with dairy farmers.  When I buy milk with the National Dairy Council label on it, it always strikes me that such milk is a little more expensive than the milk without the label.  I am not sure why that is - the witnesses obviously know - but I can make assumptions.  Page 12 of the Strathroy Dairy submission suggests that the current system "is bad for competition, farmers, consumers and employment".  I presume it is bad for the dairy as well.</p></speech>

I would prioritise the suggestion that it is bad for farmers.  My first concern is for farmers, my second concern is for security of supply, my next concern is for jobs and my last concern is for the multiples.  The witnesses have spoken about getting this label.  I do not think about quality when I see the label.  I just assume the quality is there.  There is no question mark with regard to quality.  When I look at other types of milk, I do not know how much of it is sourced from third countries.  I just prefer to buy Irish milk.  When I cannot see a National Dairy Council label on a bottle of milk, I sometimes pick it up only to see a UK label on it.  I do not see anybody complaining about the fact that it already has a UK label on it.  This label indicates that the product was farmed in Ireland.  There has to be an "IRL" label or some label pertaining to Ireland.  It is just that this label is a little bigger.  I wonder whether the problem with this label is that it is actually working.  I have no problem buying things that are labelled with the red tractor.</p><p>  I would like to pick up on a few other things that were mentioned by the witnesses.  I might be jumping around a bit.  Page 20 of their submission refers to parallel imports.  I have engaged in parallel imports.  They are not the be-all and end-all of everything.  When parallel imports take place with other products, it is sometimes the case that the product is not exactly the same.  There are abuses of the parallel imports system.  I do not think it is a great argument to make.</p> <p> Mr. Cunningham quotes a Mr. Ian Potter.  His comments are not great.  He is bringing up North-South issues which we should leave behind.  On his website he states that he spends a good deal of time and effort on legislation and political matters relating to quota and entitlements within the United Kingdom and Europe.  He refers to himself as a quota broker.  Does that strike Mr. Cunningham as a biased opinion, as a person running a business?  I believe it is an inappropriate argument to make.</p><p> Do the representatives of Strathroy Dairy believe they are in the middle of a milk war in Northern Ireland?  Mr. Cunningham should correct me if I am wrong but from what I gather, Strathroy Dairy is advertising for milk from the South from producers in counties Meath and Louth and offering them 3 cent per litre extra to bring them up to the North.</p><p> I am unsure of the business model.  I have been in business for many years and I understand one thing, that is, when a person aggressively looks for business this way, it can be a short-term or a long-term strategy.  We all know what happened in the gas market some years ago.  There was strong competition for gas customers through cheap prices.  However, they have dissipated now and there is no longer cheap gas.  I would be interested to hear the witnesses' comments on that.</p><p> I am still farming actively, thanks be to God, although not in milk.  However, many milk farmers I know have put it to me that they do not mind paying the levy to the National Dairy Council.  Clearly they see value in it.  They are concerned about cheap milk coming into the South in large quantities because they are not making money at the moment.  In fact, they are going out of business.  It is not the fault of Strathroy Dairy, but they are going out of business and they are concerned about it.  What advantage is it to us to increase their fear that they go out of business?</p><p> Let us consider it from a consumer point of view.  When I pick up milk with an NDC label, it is more expensive than other milk.  I am hoping that whoever produced it got a few cent more for the milk because they are not getting nearly enough, as Deputy Deering stated.  I got out of milk in 1991.  At that stage the price of milk was &pound;1 per gallon which translates to approximately 26 cent per litre.  If we consider the increases in today's world, that is appalling.  It is hardly enough to allow these people to invest in their business and keep producing profitably, but that is what we must do.</p><p> I fear there is a milk war on at the moment.  Is Strathroy Dairy having a battle within business that we should not be involved in?  Sometimes business battles take place.  Are we being drawn into this?  I am a little uncomfortable that we might become drawn into something that we should not be involved in too much.  I have gone through some issues and I am sorry if I was a little scattered, but the witnesses might try to get through the points as best they can.</p></speech>

Approximately 90% of the product we produce is own-label.  That goes back to the early 1980s when we looked at the trends that came from the United States and which then moved across the water.  They came in to the North and the South subsequently.  One can see it in the increases.  It used to be the case that every drop sold down here was home milk.  Low-fat milk is now sneaking into the market.  Between 70% and 75% of milk being sold in the North is low-fat or semi-skimmed milk.  That will trickle down.  At that time, we looked at it and saw the increase in the own-label sales.  We figured we could spend a fortune growing a brand but it would die a death anyway.  It is possible to see that with Glanbia's liquid sales at the moment.  The branded sales have fallen off a cliff.  I am unsure whether that has any relevance here but that is why we have stuck with the own-label route.  If a retailer has sufficient volume and asks us for own-label milk, we will do it.</p></speech>

We have been in the dairy business for years, from cow right through to helping to pour milk into a person's cup.  I am not referring to the committee members but I have a difficulty with the people who call into question milk and who say there is liquid milk and manufacturing milk.  All milk produced on this island is of a very high standard and all of it is fit to go into any dairy product anywhere in the European Union, whether it is designated as liquid or manufacturing milk.  It is all of the same high standard.</p></speech>

I simply said some 2,000 liquid milk producers in this country are supplying the major co-operatives.  They must provide a certain quality assurance for the co-operatives.  Therefore, Strathroy Dairy is not competing on a level playing pitch to get that badge.</p></speech>

We carry out a quality assurance audit on our farmers.  There are minimum standards within the EU and they are rather high.  The same minimum standards apply to liquid milk.  If one were to go to a manufacturing milk farmer one would find in the majority of cases that the set-up is just as good and the standards are just as high.  Do we insist on the same high standards of manufacturing farmers?  Of course we do.  The milk those farmers get to us cannot be shoddy in any way.  We cannot accept that claim.  Given the shelf-life we put on our product, we have to get high-quality milk.  If there was any differentiation between the quality of the milk been produced by manufacturing milk farmers in the South, obviously we would not want to use it, but there is no difference.</p><p>  This relates to the question from Deputy Barry about liquid milk farmers and how they are very concerned about liquid milk and all the supposedly cheap liquid milk coming from the North that is affecting their market.  I have pointed out that already, a significant number of them are being paid the full liquid premium, which I am perfectly happy about and I do not have a problem with that.  However, the milk is not being used for liquid at all.  The idea that there could be a scarcity of milk makes no sense when the country is awash with the stuff.  There is loads of milk that can be used for liquid.  Will there be a scarcity in the winter months?  If they want to pay a liquid premium to the manufacturers farmers, they will have more milk than they will know what to do with.  Even if they do not, the milk is still here and it is of the right quality.  It is available and it can be used to go into any market anywhere in the EU.</p><p>  There were a number of questions about herd size.  Was the first question about how much we pay?</p></speech>

They are planning for the Harvest 2020 initiative, the ending of quotas and so on.  There does not seem to be the same type of investment elsewhere, in Strathroy Dairy and other processing plants in the North, although perhaps I am wrong to say that.  That would lead to a rather uneven playing field.</p></speech>

As Deputy Deering stated, there is a good deal of investment going on down here and much of that has been financed by the Government.  There is also a good deal of investment by us as well.  I invite anyone in the committee to come to see the investment we have made in our plant.  The extra investment and expansion we have made over the years guarantees for our customers the quality and origin of the milk we are processing.</p><p>  The other question was about herd size.  Was the question about the herd size of the farmers supplying us or the herd size on average in the North?</p></speech>

The average is probably 200.  That is only a guess, I have not worked it out.</p></speech>

I am a dairy farmer myself.  I milk a couple of hundred cows.  The last word I would use to describe the system I run on my farm is "factory".  It is the furthest thing from it.

I do not accept it.  In theory it can happen but I could take the Deputy onto some small farms that I have visited.  In the past I was an inspector and went on to do quality audits on farms for a company in Monaghan Co-op.  I was on farms where the quality standards were far from those on some of the bigger farms.  Size is not an indication of quality, as the Deputy well knows.</p><p>  People who win the quality prizes are often very small farmers but people who have won the national quality prizes-----  </p></speech>

There was no money to be made.  That was not because of Strathroy or the imports that the Deputy spoke about.  He asked if we have suppliers in every county.  Not directly but we buy milk from Lakeland and Aurivo whose networks stretch away into the South and they supply milk to us.  It used to be Connacht Gold.  We buy milk from many counties, some directly, some indirectly.   At the moment we buy directly from Donegal.  There are farmers who have sent in notice and hopefully that milk will be supplied to us on 1 January.  That is if they go through with their applications to supply milk.</p></speech>

I think many of the Deputy&rsquo;s constituents wrote in to see if they could move their supplies to us.  There was a huge response from Cork and we wondered how this would work.  I said ultimately the farmer will pay for the haulage.  Despite that they came back saying, &ldquo;What if we put the tanker on the road and get the milk to Omagh will you take it off us?&rdquo;  There is scaremongering and people say they are worried about Strathroy, that we are going to thrash the market.  If we do not pay farmers a decent price they will not come to us in the first place or will not stay.  We have not been in the milk business for 150 years by taking short-term measures or cutting corners.  We do not do that.  We do the job right.  In response to the question about how we do it.  We do it better.  It is as simple as that.</p></speech>

How can we come all the way down, lift this milk, bring it up, process it and cart it the whole way down again and still manage to make a margin on it?  I can assure the Deputy we can.  We did not come up the Strule in a bubble as they say in Omagh.  We are serious businessmen.  We take our job and the livelihoods of our families and farmers very seriously.  We do not want to put any of that at risk.  We are in business and of course there are risks but we are very good at what we do.  For the third time I invite the committee to come to see what we do.  A huge number of farmers from the South have come through because of the advertisement.  One of the first things they ask when they walk through the offices and the plant is where are all the people.  We have a very happy contented staff, who work very well.  There are very few of them.</p><p>  I have walked around many dairy plants.  Day and daily I walk through other dairy farms and there is huge scope in all of them, including our own, to be more efficient.  At the minute, we believe that we have the most efficient plant on the island when it comes to processing liquid milk.  That brings it back to the idea of investment and whether we should build another plant.  We all know that the dairy industry will change when quotas go and in theory there could be an awful lot more milk but at the same time there are too many plants.  For everybody&rsquo;s benefit it is better to have fewer plants because it brings obvious efficiencies of scale, which is where I would use the word factory.  Is it not more sensible on the island to have a significant manufacturing plant in the north and another in the south to manufacture liquid milk?  This is not something that I alone propose but it has been proposed before now by independent industry commentators.   </p></speech>

Cormac sits in the board room and shouts, &ldquo;More money for the farmer&rdquo;.  We agree with that and we pay a better price than many other co-ops in the South or anywhere on the island but we are businessmen.  The Deputy asked about retailer power.  That is why the White Paper produced by this committee was very interesting reading.  We agree with that.  The retailers have too much power.  They make too much margin.  I am not going to sit here and knife myself by saying something silly.  Everyone knows that is a fact.  If the White Paper offered a way to wrest some power from the retailer and bringing more back to the producer and maybe a bit to the processor we would be all for it.</p></speech>

Quite often when we sell milk we sell it on an annual basis and the price is fixed.  Unfortunately, we have no control over what the retailer does with it after he gets it.  It creates serious havoc for us because as the Deputy says one can lift the label and see the UK mark.  Every dairy product processing plant anywhere in Europe has its individual stamp.  Ours says UK but it also says NI.   If the Deputy looks closely he will know that it comes from that region so it can be traced back to us.</p><p>  The retailers can make whatever decision they want.  Quite often they say that they will run three or four promotions a year, each of which will last a week or a fortnight.  They do not come back to us to say they are running a promotion for two weeks and ask us to give them the milk cheaper.  It does not work that way.  It is their product.  They bought it at a price, and can do what they want with it.  Unfortunately, that is the control they have over it, which is fair enough.   If one buys a car and wants to drive it into a tree one can do so.  </p></speech>

As I said before, half of it does not go into liquid it goes into manufacturing.   If there was a direct connection between the price the farmer received and the label I could see a reason for farmers wanting to support it but there is no guarantee.  There is nothing set in stone that says if one puts NDC on the label one must sell it at a fixed price or a premium and return it to the farmer.  I have often, as a dairy farmer, had the idea of a "fair price for farmers" stamp to go on a carton, no matter where it was produced.  It would guarantee to the consumer that a fair price was being returned to the primary producer.  We are singing off the same hymn sheet.</p></speech>

It is a question of trying to hit a specific price point rather than seeking to pull the wool over anybody's eyes.  However, we all must acknowledge that consumers are smart.  With that in mind, we have chosen not to go down that particular road; we give consumers the credit they deserve.</p></speech>

Certainly, there is no milk war in the shops.  On the supply side, on the other hand, there is something of a war going on to secure direct supply.  Several new buyers have come into the market, including Finn Valley Co-op and others.  Competition is good for everybody and farmers are gaining from it.</p></speech>

Without throughput, one cannot be the most efficient.  My concern is that the current milk war on the supply side is merely a temporary schmozzle that could well settle down, after which farmers might be left high and dry.</p></speech>

In our case, by comparison, it is fairly flat, the average ratio being probably 1.3:1 or something like that.  In short, we are producing milk in the winter.  Taking the island as a whole, it might be the case that farmers in the South see that the fellows in the North have decided to invest in the plant and machinery that are required to produce milk in the wintertime as well as the summertime and decided to let them tear away at it while they concentrate on specialising in other areas, such as maximising the output of grass for grazing in the summertime.</p><p>  My argument is that if quotas go then milk production will rise, in which case the difficulty we will have is not a shortage of milk but how to get it processed in the summertime.  What I foresee is that processors will put in incentives to encourage more milk to be produced in the shoulders of the year, because that will ensure the best utilisation of their plants.  As a businessman, Deputy Barry will understood that.  There will be incentives to produce milk in the shoulders of the year, which will get over - if it ever did become an issue - any shortage milk in the wintertime.  We supply the same amount of milk, summer and winter, 12 months of the year.  We are obliged to ensure the supplies are there.  I have never seen a situation where there was a scarcity of milk for us to buy, anywhere on the island, in January or February.</p></speech>

My point is that if we look at the island as a whole, rather than narrowing our vision to just the Republic, we cannot really say there is a scarcity of milk.  The reality, as we see it, is that there is no scarcity of milk on the island and, moreover, the product is very easily transported.</p></speech>

Others have told us they will move once the quota year is over, that is, they will put their notice in for 1 January and move on 1 April.  We expect to see the percentage getting up to 50% or so quite quickly.  It could go on to rise even higher in future because we are offering a good price.</p></speech>

Deputy Tom Barry referred to comments made by Ian Potter.  I agree that what he said was slightly sensationalist, but it was put out there in order to show the risks.  That is not what we are saying; it is what he is saying.  There is probably an element of scaremongering in it, but it should be taken in the context of what others are saying that on beef and chicken blogs and so on.  It all points to a potentially huge risk there to the entire agricultural export industry.  It is certainly too great a risk to take for the benefit of what is a very small group of farmers.  The industry is too large to make that type of risk worthy it.  A significant portion of the recovery this island badly needs will be based on exports, particularly from the food industry, as has been well documented.  The National Dairy Council campaign could jeopardise that and, on that basis, it is misguided and wrong.</p></speech>

In actuality, the floodgates are open in both directions.  For instance, some 10,000 pigs which come from the South are processed every week in the North.  Any barrier to trade creates huge difficulties for everybody.  I am primarily a dairy farmer but I also have bull calves which I sell.  For the past three years a farmer in Donegal has come and bought every single bull calf born on my farm.  It was a great relationship.  I telephoned him in October when the cow started to calve to ask him how he was fixed.  He told me he had a difficulty in that, because the calves from my farm were now classed as nomads, there would be a problem with getting them slaughtered.  Farmers in the west of Ireland will be aware that the numbers of Northern buyers around the mart rings have gone way down because of this nomads issue.</p><p>  Farmers in the Republic are worried about milk from the North flooding the market in the South.  The reality, however, is that agricultural trade on this island does not pay any cognisance to the Border.  I have two Dairymaster milking parlours which are manufactured in Kerry.  I am on my fourth Keenan feeding wagon, also manufactured in the South.  Keenan does not have a difficulty with its feeding wagons being sold to buyers in the North.  So many products can potentially be impacted if we take a small, narrow-minded view on the way in which agricultural products are produced, processed and marketed on this island, to the detriment of everybody.</p></speech>

I was at a recent Alltech conference in Dublin at which the Bord Bia representative talked about the different campaigns Bord Bia has launched, how successful they have been and the image that portrays.  The dairy product Bord Bia does not cover, unfortunately, is milk.  Bord Bia's ideas have been well thought through and very well implemented because there has been a consensus of opinion.  The Government and the committee have clearly been included in how it runs its affairs.  The NDC, on the other hand, does not come under those controls and as a result it is causing great difficulties in terms of the milk market.  It is running roughshod around the place and causing the difficulties we are experiencing now.  The committee might not want to take Ian Potter as a good example but what he has said are the kinds of things that have been written about Irish milk and Irish dairy products; this is creating confusion and it could be doing serious harm to the good work being done by Bord Bia.  If it brought milk in under the same banner perhaps it would solve the problem and the NDC would be able to go off and spend its money on something else.</p></speech>

It was Deputy Ferris who requested that we invite the witnesses to make a presentation before the committee.  Another member asked where are we going with this to which I replied that we are not quite sure until we start to delve into it, which is probably dangerous.  One of concerns following on from the report - or "white paper" as witnesses called it - we published was that there is so much unknown and so much that seems to be going on with regard to the milk market on the island.  First, there was a concern as to whether there would be an all year round supply of fresh milk.  That may have been an invalid argument or concern, but it was a concern.  The second concern related to the producers of winter milk where the price being paid for manufactured milk was equal.  Some farmers are set up for winter milk production and such production suits less grass intensive farmland and highland areas that have a colder climate.  Notwithstanding Deputy Deering's good farm in Carlow, the perception is that a significant number of fresh milk producers have that type of farm set up.  There was a concern about the dairy herd size in that the only way farmers have been able to compete has been to consolidate and have bigger operations to achieve efficiencies in production but that does not suit all farmers because of a milking platform and so on.  That is where we started off.</p><p>  The witnesses put up a robust case here today and I would say everybody would agree with it.  We will facilitate others, in the way we have facilitated the witnesses, to come before the committee, and the witnesses are welcome to attend the committee again as visitors or watch the proceedings on the lifestream or after the meeting.  There will be people who will have a counter argument.  The committee will then decide what we want to do in terms of our consideration of this issue but that will be a matter for another day rather than today.</p><p>  This has been a useful discussion.  It is only fair that this committee, as a forum for public discussion, would allow people to give their point of view and it is up to others to make a counter argument if they so wish.  I note Deputy Ferris wishes to make a brief comment before I conclude.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for putting forward their case and in so doing for putting up challenges to the committee and beyond it.  I am not an expert in this area but it is fascinating to hear the different arguments.</p><p>  The term "price war" was mentioned.  Senator O'Neill, perhaps tongue in cheek, made a point about milk that is over quota.  If any of that is going on it is illegal and people should report it.  It is as simple as that.  There is a great deal of confusion.  We mentioned the report we published that we would favour the idea of a fair trade logo for everybody engaged in production in the food chain.  Some small processors and producers are being squeezed in other segments of agrifood production, although not necessarily in milk production because those processors are not generally that small.  We will see where we go from here.  I thank the members.  I am sure the witnesses will have found they were asked fair questions.  People are trying to get to the bottom of this.  I thank the witnesses for coming down.</p><p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has to confirm a date to brief us on the Common Agricultural Policy.</p></speech>

My amendment relates to Irish-registered non-resident companies.  A report published in 1998, which tackled this problem, stated that a company must carry out some activity but did not state that the company should be managed or controlled within the State.  A report by the Department of Finance in 1998 recommended that this be addressed in some way.  My amendment, with amendment No. 7, tries to do that.  We say that not only should the company carry out some activity within the State but that it must also be managed and controlled within the State, particularly for tax purposes.  We would like some feedback from the Minister of State on this amendment.</p></speech>

The objective appears to be to cause all companies registered in Ireland to be tax resident in Ireland.  As Minister of State with responsibility for jobs, enterprise and innovation, I am not in a position to consider the full impact or consequences of any change to tax law.  Such an exercise is within the functions of the Minister for Finance.</p><p>  The proposed amendments are illegal under EU law and international law.  The provisions would fall foul of the EU law of freedom of establishment, a core aspect of EU law.  The European Commission closely monitors compliance with this law.  The Commission has recently required Ireland to change a provision of Irish law which required that at least one director of an Irish company be resident in Ireland.  This provision would go much further, effectively requiring all management activities to occur within the State.  This is clearly a hindrance to cross-border trade within the European Union and significantly trammels the ability of a company from another EU member state to establish in Ireland.  This proposal would put Ireland in breach of obligations under double taxation agreements with other countries.  This is unprecedented and would be highly prejudicial to Irish commerce and to Ireland's reputation internationally.  Therefore, I am not in favour of adopting these amendments.</p></speech>

That proved to be the case, and we have more than 150 proposals to work through.  We want to get through Committee Stage, but it is important that members are aware that they can discuss any issue that arises.  In fact, a proposal can only go forward on Report Stage if it has been discussed here.  If members have any concerns about anything the Minister of State has raised, I urge them to address it today.  There is plenty of opportunity to debate any such issues.</p></speech>

Section 59 is effectively a new section which stipulates that during the transition period, the law applicable to an existing private company limited by shares will be contained in Part 16.  There is still some work to be done on that.  I ask members for some latitude in terms of the sheer volume of the legislation.  I am proceeding in accordance with the protocol that we notify the committee of our intent to introduce amendments on Report Stage.  There is no attempt to pull anything out of the hat at the last minute in terms of the entirety of the procedure.  However, there are issues that will arise between now and Report Stage.</p></speech>

I assure members that any outstanding concerns they might have will be dealt with by way of a briefing session after Committee Stage and before Report Stage.  We have had very useful briefings from the Department on numerous occasions in the past.  If there is a list of new amendments on Report Stage, we can have a briefing session, as we have done before.  Report Stage will take place on the floor of the D&aacute;il and there will be unlimited time at that stage to discuss any issue.  There is no agenda here to slip proposals through without debate.</p></speech>

However, there has been some engagement since Second Stage with practitioners, in the light of which several amendments will be introduced on Report Stage.  The word "technical" is not quite correct, but their purpose will essentially be to make the law more efficient in the longer term.  That is the main reason I expect to bring forward further amendments on Report Stage.</p></speech>

This prohibition should not affect the position governing renounceable letters of allotment of fully or partly paid-up bonus shares or beneficial interests in shares, and arrangements should be put in place to take account of the specific regulatory regime for collective investment funds.</p></speech>

A further amendment may be required to ensure that a legal basis is provided for such addresses to be available for appropriate authorities who have legitimate reasons to request this information.  I intend to amend the section further by making provision in subsection (12) for "married person or civil partner" and by making the section gender neutral by providing "his-her".</p></speech>

This amendment aims to clarify this intention by expressly providing that a body corporate may be a shadow director.  It is hoped that this restriction may curtail Ireland's reputation as a tax haven.</p><p>  What we are trying to do is bring more clarity.  We have individuals or companies, be they limited or otherwise, advising companies without being directors of those companies.

It has been upheld in the High Court in Fyffes plc <i>v</i> DCC plc &amp;amp; ors, IEHC 477, and in the Supreme Court in respect of the liquidation of Worldport Ireland Limited in 2008.

At the moment, saying that the directors shall have regard to employees is not a duty.  While acknowledging that the primary duty of a company is to its members and to ensuring they are sustainable from a financial point of view, there should be more protection for employees and there should be a duty to them in the interests of corporate responsibility.  Stipulating that the directors shall have regard to their employees has no strength because it does not represent a duty and is just a token gesture.  If we were to include the employees, it would not mean that the employees would always be seen to be in the right in a dispute but it would give the courts an opportunity to interpret it as they saw fit depending on the information put before them.</p></speech>

This amendment would change it to a duty to employees.  This may mean that members and employees would have a directly enforceable right against directors where they act contrary to their respective interests.  This would compromise the fundamental structure of the directors' relationship with the company, which is described to be fiduciary, that is to say it requires directors to prefer the interests of the company over their interests or those of others, even where those others include some members of the company.</p><p>  The amendment puts into question the status of the law of oppression, which is the principal protection of minority shareholders under the current law and much of the employment law.  Such a vague and general declaration of a duty without any explanation as to how it interacts with existing law would serve to create great uncertainty in company law.  This is directly contrary to one of the key objectives of the Bill, which is to clarify directors' duties.  The amendment may also breach constitutional property rights.</p><p>  Ultimately, bolstering protections for employees should be done using employment law.  These provisions only serve to complicate company law and do nothing to protect employees of partnerships and sole traders and public employees.  Therefore, I am not in favour of adopting this amendment.</p></speech>

It is probably better addressed within employment law but perhaps the Government needs to look at that because there is no indication that we will address the area of employees under company law.  The Minister of State comes from a county where we saw a pretty high-profile dispute last year about employees in a company that was going into liquidation, so there is certainly room for improvement in respect of employees' rights and conditions.  While this may not be the legislation to deal with it, I understand where Deputy Wallace is coming from.  It is something that must be dealt with and if it is not going to be dealt with in this legislation for the reasons outlined by the Minister of State, it probably needs to be dealt with by another committee in respect of employment legislation.</p></speech>

Employment law does not have the capacity to cover all situations where employees' interests are not being catered for by the company in a fair manner.  Including this amendment, which puts an obligation on companies to behave with a greater sense of responsibility to their employees, might be different.  It not be the way things happen in most of the developed world.  That is because of the privileges given to companies.  While I understand that we would not have them if they did not have certain privileges, I believe that the protection of employees' interests in certain situations should be strengthened.  For example, employment law is not much good to one when companies are going out of business.  This amendment would give greater protection to employees.</p></speech>

It extends the obligations on directors in respect of their compliance statements to cover not only tax and company law, but also public interest considerations such as environmental, health and safety and employment law.  It is hoped that this will encourage a wider sense of corporate responsibility towards society and shared natural resources rather than just towards a company itself.</p><p>  In today's language, these amount to externalities and are not considered as being costs to the company.  Externalities are unintended side effects of the market economy and are the impact of commercial transactions that fall outside the two parties to that transaction.  For example, when a consumer buys gardening tools and materials, a positive externality is experienced by others in the community, as the consumer uses those materials to make an attractive garden from which everyone in the community can gain enjoyment and benefit.  On the other hand, if a consumer hires a contractor to cut down the trees on his or her property in order to park an extra car, the community experiences a negative externality, as the scenic beauty, shade, animal habitat and fresh air provided by the trees are lost.</p><p>  Externalities can be positive or negative.  For the companies that organise the production of goods and services in the professional economy, however, they are to be ignored.  Since externalities do not directly affect the responsible parties, profitability is not harmed by them.  This principle has led to significant economic impacts.  For example, the large-scale outsourcing of America's mass production has had considerable effect, including the decline of large urban regions due to depressed demand, resulting in increased rates of crime, family strain and domestic abuse.  These are external side effects of corporate investment strategies, as they do not directly hurt earnings.  Too often, capital is pushed forward despite these side effects.  The world would be a better place if companies had a responsibility to consider externalities.</p></speech>

If members will pardon my use of acronyms, the CLRG decided that such extra duties would do little to increase compliance and would merely result in an increase in red tape at significant cost to business.  The set-up cost for a business was an estimated &euro;90,000 and its ongoing annual cost was estimated at &euro;40,000.  A streamlined version of the director's compliance statement proposed by the CLRG, which is a statutory body, removed the requirement that the statement should include a declaration that the company had complied with all other enactments that could affect its financial performance.  This was found to be the most burdensome aspect of the statement and also the least relevant, as companies were already legally obliged to comply with all Acts of the Oireachtas.  Their inclusion in the compliance statement did not add substantive duties.</p><p>  More than 80% of the CLRG's members, including members representing the Financial Regulator and other public bodies, agreed to a more balanced version of the director's compliance statement.  There is a strong EU impetus towards less unnecessary regulation to make EU businesses more competitive.  This amendment would create unjustifiable and disproportionate costs on Irish businesses and disadvantage Ireland competitively, as we would have gone beyond other countries.  The current compliance statement has received support from industry and regulators alike.  For these reasons, it is intended to preserve it in the Bill.  Therefore, I am not in favour of adopting the amendment.</p></speech>

While there is such a thing as red tape that has no benefit for anyone, much of it was designed to ensure that companies behaved in a certain manner, even in their own best interests.  In the past 20 years, companies have made many decisions that were not in their best long-term interests.  For example, some companies are making decisions based on three-month thinking because everything is driven by the markets and what they can sell.  The companies are not concerned about where they will be in five years' time.  There is nothing to stop them from making decisions that are not in the interests of their long-term health.  Claiming that companies that have regard to the environment and take a more direct duty towards health and safety and employment law will not be able to compete amounts to a race to the bottom.  That is where we are heading in a canoe without a paddle.</p></speech>

To a certain extent, I understand the motive behind the amendment, but one must factor into the equation a corpus of environmental, health and safety and employment law.  The issue of negative or positive externalities does not arise.  We must ensure that there is robust legislation.  Every citizen is subject to the existing corpus of law and companies are legally obliged to comply with all Acts of the Oireachtas.</p> <p>That is already inherent, thereby rendering the amendment unsupportable in that sense.</p></speech>

However, that may be contradictory to the obligation on directors to act in the best interests of the company.  Therefore, this could offer somebody a way out of acting in the best interests of the company if this language is not tightened up to clarify exactly what it means by stating "that a director of a company may have regard to the interests of a particular member of the company".</p></speech>

Upon incorporation of a company, the Companies Registration Office shall issue to all listed directors a document setting our a summary of this Chapter in plain language, to include the duties provided for and the consequences for breach of such duties.</blockquote>This allows for the dissemination of a director's duties as set out in Part 5.  The purpose of this codified version of the duties, which currently exists in a combination of common law and statutory provisions, is to act as a signpost as to the standard of conduct expected of directors.  </p><p>  This amendment will facilitate the wider dissemination of these duties to all new directors upon the incorporation of a company.  This would educate them fully on their responsibilities and, in a broader sense, promote a culture of corporate responsibility.  Currently, this role is fulfilled by a solicitor at the expense of the company and many start-up companies do not have the means for such legal advice.  Also, where there are volunteer directors, for example, in the property management sector - there are many of them around Dublin city at the moment - who are also subject to additional requirements under the Multi Unit Developments Act 2011, they may not have the means to seek legal advice regarding the legal duties owed by them.  </p><p>  People take too much for granted concerning what directors know about their responsibilities.  We could address this matter in this manner and it would be positive to do so.</p></speech>

The Companies Registration Office already sends these documents to directors of newly formed companies.  However, because most companies are formed by company formation's businesses, the documents generally do not get to the directors at all.</p><p>  More important in this respect is that people applying to be registered as directors must acknowledge that they understand and accept their responsibilities as directors when completing form A1 or form B10, that is to say, before they receive the paper copy.  Therefore, I am not in favour of adopting this amendment.  However, even though this is not a matter for primary legislation, I acknowledge that the idea is a good one.  For this reason, I will consider introducing a live link to the relevant ODCE documents so that directors can read and understand their duties online before completing the electronic form when it becomes available.</p></speech>

I agree with Deputy Wallace that it is important.  Even the issue of voluntary directors is becoming more prevalent.  Particularly in an area in which both myself and Deputy Wallace would have an interest such as the League of Ireland, we are seeing a lot more companies being run by supporters who are taking over football clubs and appointing directors.  It happened in my own case.  It would be useful, therefore, to have that live link.  There is obviously an obligation on a director to get that information and to understand his or her duties, but we should make the information as accessible as possible.</p></speech>

I recently joined the board of a cr&egrave;che and have not yet got around to reading a large amount of documents.</p> <p>There is only so far one can go.  If there is an issue with the access of the language that is a different issue altogether.  The Minister of State has made it clear that there is no shortage of material available in regard to the obligations on people who set up companies of which they become directors.  The problem is getting people to read it.  It is up to the individuals concerned to do so.  As I said earlier, I accept that if the language is not accessible for some people that might be an issue.  However, there is no shortage of ways of accessing the particular information.</p></speech>

The idea was to operate them for as long as we could following which the owners of the apartments would take them over.  That has been the process for a number of years.  The level of trouble coming down the tracks in regard to management companies in Dublin is frightening.  There are huge problems with them.  People who have become voluntary directors on these management companies do not know what they signed up for but will find out when they end up in court.</p><p>  Would it be possible to provide that people intending to take up positions as voluntary directors on management companies attend, perhaps, a one-day course in regard to the responsibilities involved and the pitfalls in that regard?  I do not believe the people signing up to these management companies fully understand what they are letting themselves in for.</p></speech>

I am a voluntary director.  One of the key issues is the volume of material which people must read.  Most do not do so and simply take on board what they believe are the responsibilities of a director.  A key issue is to ensure use of simple and understandable language rather than legal jargon of the type we have to put up with on a daily basis.</p></speech>

This is not a matter for primary legislation.  It could be dealt with through the ODCE and CRO simplifying the language or ensuring that people are made aware in the starkest terms of their obligations in relation to any legal entity of which they become part.  That is perhaps all one can do.  If somebody decides to become part of a community-voluntary body or legal entity, there is only so much that the State or Government can do to legislate in respect of that decision.  One would expect that people when signing up to such bodies are fully aware of their obligations.  People have a personal responsibility to find out their obligations.  If it is possible to simplify the language around those obligations the matter should be taken up by the ODCE and CRO.</p></speech>

Is that the case?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-05a.771" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/979" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="11:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2013110500015#O03900"><p>Since group financial statements relate to a corporate group, the group financial statements of a subsidiary, which is also a parent company, would not give any more information than the group accounts of the company at the top of the corporate group.  Therefore deletion of this exemption would benefit no one other than the lawyers and accountants who would have to prepare and file thousands more group financial statements than they do at present.</p><p>  Many foreign direct investment companies rely on this exemption to avoid having to prepare intermediate level group accounts that simply replicate a part of their general top level group accounts.  The economic benefit of investing in Ireland would be substantially eroded by requiring these companies to prepare many different sets of group accounts.  This would also be a departure from established international practice.  Most notably this exemption exists in the United Kingdom.  This deletion might constitute a breach of articles 7, 8 and 11 of the seventh accounting directive.  For those reasons I am not in favour of changing the section.</p></speech>

In the case of an Irish-registered but non-resident company which is a holding company or a subsidiary company, and which is just based on activity and is managed and controlled outside the State, are we saying that the group accounts would cover the activities of the particular company that is registered within the State?  Could any company registered in the State be exempt from making returns under the group financial returns the Minister of State mentioned?</p></speech>

This is effectively avoiding a duplication or proliferation of reporting mechanisms.  The Deputy seems to seek greater clarity on those companies that are Irish-registered but non-resident companies.  Section 301 reads: &quot;Subject to its not having elected to prepare IFRS group financial statements and to <i>subsection (4)</i>, a holding company is exempt from the requirement to prepare group financial statements if the holding company (the &ldquo;lower holding company&rdquo;) is itself a subsidiary undertaking and its holding undertaking is not established under the laws of an EEA state and one or other of the following cases applies.&quot;  It continues to list exemptions and so on.  I am trying to get to the nub of the question.</p></speech>

While I will not go into the particulars of the directive, Article 35 states "an audit opinion, which shall be either unqualified, qualified or an adverse opinion and shall state clearly the opinion of the statutory auditor ... as to whether the annual financial statements give a true and fair view in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework".  Thus, any change to the current phrasing in section 337 could contravene EU law.  On the question of the revised audit and begging the committee's indulgence, I propose to revert to it on Report Stage with a fuller response.</p></speech>

That will give us an opportunity to go through all of the proposed amendments for Report Stage.  We can also discuss any other information and matters like this one.  Members will have an opportunity to discuss all of those matters at a briefing session, if that is agreeable to them.  We can add the transition period to the list for discussion, if need be.</p></speech>

The period seems long, particularly when there is not much new material in the section, which seems to be an amalgamation of a wide range of legislation.  Do we need to provide such a lengthy period for companies to comply with the legislation?</p></speech>

Let us remember that the provision addresses the "restoration of companies that are stuck off and dissolved prior to the enactment of the Bill or during the transition period and to deal with the restoration of companies after the end of the transition period."  That lasts for up to 18 months or so but a company could move more quickly.</p></speech>

There may be a departmental view, there will be a CRO view and there may even be a Revenue on the matter.  The original figure is six months but, following consultation with various stakeholders, it was felt that a figure of three months would be the most expeditious period, rather than 30 days.</p></speech>

The giving and acceptance of restriction and disqualification undertakings from directors are facilitated, thereby saving costs and court time.  One of the Bill's most far-reaching reforms involves the introduction of a new four-tier categorisation of offences.  This follows on from a recommendation of the Company Law Review Group, CLRG.  It is proposed that, except for the most serious offences, namely, fraudulent trading and market abuse, all offences under the Companies Acts should be categorised according to this four-tier scheme.</p><p>  At the higher end of the scale, category 1 offences carry, following conviction on indictment, a term of imprisonment of up to ten years and-or a &euro;500,000 fine.</p> <p>A further new provision allows a trial court to order a person convicted under the Bill to remedy any breach thereof in respect of which he or she is convicted.</p></speech>

The answer to that is that corporate offences are by their nature difficult to investigate.  The fact that white collar criminals have gotten off lightly in the wake of the economic crisis should not lead to the conclusion that the law is flawed.  Corporate criminal investigations often require the gathering and examination of large volumes of complex documentation, which can be painstaking and time consuming and necessitates wide consultation with experts, including forensic accountants and lawyers.  Equally, people may be unwilling to give evidence voluntarily in circumstances where they have worked with or have close business ties to an alleged offender.  As a criminal must be proven guilty beyond all reasonable doubt, many plausible cases of wrongdoing will never be successfully prosecuted.  This must be taken into account in terms of the context of this section.</p><p>  Section 798 as drafted under existing law is unchanged.</p></speech>

However, the court may make an order restraining a company or an officer of the company from removing his or her assets from the State or reducing those assets below a specified amount.

The circumstances in which an injunction can be granted are now limited to cases where the primary cause of action also arises under this Bill.  Alternatively, the cause of action must arise under the provisions of the constitution of the company or relate to the holding of an office of the company.</p></speech>

It deals with the declaration by the court restricting a director of an insolvent company in being appointed or acting as a director.  The court will make the declaration restricting the director upon application from the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the liquidator of an insolvent company or a receiver of any property of the company.  The restriction is for a period of five years and the restricted person may not be appointed to act in any way, directly or indirectly, as a director or secretary or to be involved in the formation or promotion of a company, unless that company meets the required capitalisation levels.</p><p>  It provides a defence for directors where they can show that they have acted honestly and responsibly in respect of the conduct of the affairs of the company, whether before or after it became insolvent, and where the court can see no other reason that it would be just and equitable that the director be restricted.  The subsection has been amended, and that is as compared with the Companies Act 1990, in so far as a new proviso has been inserted in line with a recommendation from the Company Law Review Group.  The additional requirement is that the person concerned "...has when requested to do so by the liquidator... co-operated as far as could reasonably be expected in relation to the conduct of the winding up of the insolvent company".  The reason for the insertion of this provision is to promote greater co-operation by the directors and other officers with the liquidator.  Subsection (3) sets out the capitalisation requirements for a company which has a restricted person acting as director or secretary or taking part in the formation or promotion of that company.</p><p>  Provision is made for restrictions involving a guarantee company to ensure that a company may not escape a capitalisation-type requirement by reason of not having a share capital.  The requirement here is that at least one of the members of the company must give a guarantee of not less than &euro;100,000, subject to the amendment's being agreed to.  In the case of an investment company, subsection (3) will be read as if the requirements are that the value of the issued share capital of the company is not less than &euro;100,000 and that an amount of not less than &euro;100,000 in cash has been paid in consideration for the allotment of shares in the company, subject to the amendment's being agreed to.  A person restricted arising from his or her conduct in relation to a company limited by shares is restricted as regards all other company types as well.</p></speech>

This is a new section to deal with a situation in which a director becomes disqualified under the law of another state.  In such a case, where the company fails to notify the registrar of such a situation, as required by section 150(8) of this Bill, the relevant director will be deemed to be subject to a disqualification order for a period not exceeding the remaining period of the foreign disqualification.  This section is new and tightens up the position under the current law whereby a person is only required to notify the registrar of their disqualification under the law of another state upon becoming a director of a company and not where the foreign disqualification occurs subsequent to their becoming a director of an Irish company.</p></speech>

It is proposed that, subject to a small number of exceptions, such as fraudulent trading and market abuse, the majority of offences under the Companies Acts should be classified according to a four-tier system.  As I outlined earlier, category 4 offences will be prosecutable only on a summary basis and on conviction will give rise to no more than a class A fine, currently set at &euro;6,394 by the Fines Act 2010, previously &pound;5,000.  That is an amount no greater than the District Court can impose for any other criminal offence.  Category 3 offences will likewise be prosecutable only summarily but on conviction may give rise to a prison sentence of up to six months or a class A fine or both.  </p><p>  Both category 2 and category 1 offences attract the same consequences when prosecuted summarily, namely, a class A fine or imprisonment of up to 12 months or both.  Both these categories may also be prosecuted on indictment.  In such a case, a category 2 offence will attract a fine of not more than &euro;50,000 or a prison term not exceeding five years or both.  A category 1 offence will have a penalty of a fine of not more than &euro;500,000 or up to ten years in prison or both.</p></speech>

I welcome from the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland Dr. Ann McGarry, chief executive officer; Dr. Kevin Kelleher and Dr. Ciara McMahon.  Go raibh maith agaibh as bheith i l&aacute;thair.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee<i>.  </i>However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also advise that the opening statement and any other document submitted to the committee may be published on its website after the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  Obviously the location of power plants on the west coast of Britain is of great interest to us and on occasion has worried Irish people.  Therefore, we are entitled, in the wider context of the debate on British nuclear policy, to express our concerns and fears, even though we are not in the same jurisdiction.  As we are near neighbours, there are many issues of concern to us.  Nuclear power is not our chosen route of energy generation.  Therefore, the majority of Irish people probably agree with our policy on nuclear energy.  The effects of accidents at nuclear power plants are strong in people's minds, particularly those who live on the east coast.</p> <p>A number of years ago, a documentary on RTE - it was a kind of docudrama, for want of a better description - dealt with the possible fall-out and implications for Ireland of an accident at Sellafield.  Perhaps Dr. McGarry might take that into consideration in her contribution and in our exchanges.  If such an accident took place, what could we do here?  I am reminded of the infamous political interview about iodine tablets a number of years ago.  I presume our thinking about how we would react has moved on since then.  How are we equipped to deal with the fall-out from a nuclear accident?  Dr. McGarry might bear those questions in mind in her contributions.  We would like to hear her views.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-05a.1498" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ann McGarry" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013110500004#E00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and the members of the committee for inviting us here today to address them on the implications for Ireland of existing and proposed nuclear plants in the UK.  We welcome the opportunity to inform the committee of the results of our assessments and to respond to its questions on particular issues of concern.  As members of the committee have already received a detailed paper from us, I propose to take them through a short presentation that is based on a number of Powerpoint slides.  I will then be in a position to respond to questions.</p><p>  The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland's mission is to ensure people in Ireland are protected from the harmful effects of radiation.  We do this in a number of ways.  Radiation sources and X-ray equipment have many beneficial uses for society in areas like medicine, industry, education and research.  The institute regulates this use to ensure those directly using radiation sources, and the wider public, have an appropriate level of protection.  In addition to our laboratory facilities, we operate a network of monitoring stations around the country where we can measure radiation levels in a range of sample types.  We use the results of the monitoring and the measurements to assess the consequences of radiation levels for people living in Ireland.  The institute plays an important role in Ireland's national plan for responding to nuclear accidents abroad.  We also provide a range of services to licensees and businesses.  For example, we certify the levels of radioactivity in Irish food products that are being exported outside the EU.</p><p>  The committee has invited us to present our assessment of the implications for Ireland of the existing and proposed nuclear plants in the UK.  The slide I am showing the committee lists the existing plants there.  Members will see that there are seven nuclear power plants on the west coast of the UK, facing Ireland.  All of these plants are due to be shut down by 2023.  I also draw the attention of the committee to the Sellafield site, which was mentioned by the Chairman.  The facility at Sellafield is not a nuclear power plant - it is a nuclear fuel production and reprocessing plant.  The next slide shows where the proposed new power plants will be located.  As the UK needs to replace the energy produced by the older plants that are due to be shut down, it has identified eight sites as being suitable for the construction of new nuclear plants by 2025.  As the slide indicates, seven of the proposed sites already have nuclear power plants located on them.  Some of those power plants are still operating and some of them have already shut down.  The eighth proposed site is adjacent to the Sellafield site at Moorside.</p><p>  When we think of how Ireland might be affected by the radiation emitted from these plants, either during their day-to-day operations or as a result of an accident, we must consider the two primary ways in which radioactivity may reach Ireland - through the air or through the sea.  Radioactivity that enters into the air can expose us directly, or we can inhale the air and so be exposed.  If radioactivity gets into the food chain, we can be exposed to it by eating contaminated food.  Similarly, if radioactivity discharged into the sea gets into the food chain, people living in Ireland can be exposed to it.  The term "radiation pathways" is used to describe the way in which radiation from nuclear plants in the UK has an impact on Ireland.</p><p>  The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland assesses the impact of routine discharges from existing nuclear plants in the UK by measuring radioactivity in the environment.  Those radioactivity measurements are considered alongside habit data, which can include data on the patterns of eating fish or shellfish from the Irish Sea or walking along beaches that might be contaminated.  In that way, we can work out how much exposure people in Ireland have to the radiation emitted from those plants.  Subsequently, we can estimate what the implications of the radiation dose they have received might be for their health.  We provide information to the public.  We produce monitoring reports every year to give people details of the impact of radioactive discharges from nuclear plants in the UK.</p><p>  The impact of the routine discharges from Sellafield and nuclear plants in the UK makes up a very small part of the Irish population's overall exposure to radiation.  The pie chart on the slide I am showing the committee gives a breakdown of the sources of the exposure to radiation of a notional average person living in Ireland.  As members can see, radon in our homes makes by far the biggest contribution to our radiation exposure.  The red segment of the pie chart shows that radiation from artificial sources, which includes the radiation dose from Sellafield and other nuclear facilities, the radiation that is in the environment as a result of weapons testing in the 1950s and 1960s and the radiation resulting from past accidents such as the Chernobyl incident, accounts for less than 1% of exposure.  Therefore, the actual day-to-day impact of routine discharges from Sellafield and nuclear plants is negligible.  Sellafield makes by far the largest contribution to the small impact that radiation from nuclear plants is having on the overall level.</p><p>  The next slide gives details of our assessment of the potential implications for Ireland of the proposed nuclear power plants in the UK.  As I have mentioned, eight sites have been deemed to be suitable for the building of new nuclear power plants in that country.  We have studied the likely levels of day-to-day discharges into the air and into the sea.  We have also examined the implications for Ireland and the people of Ireland of the accidents that could potentially happen at any of those locations.  We have assessed five scenarios involving accidents that might release radioactivity into the air and three scenarios involving accidents that might release radioactivity into the Irish Sea.</p><p>  As the plants have not yet been built, we do not have accurate information about what the actual discharges will be.  Based on the information that is available about the types of reactors that may be built at each of the sites, we have developed a generic reactor model to use to estimate releases through day-to-day discharges or as a result of an accident.  After we had agreed on an estimate of the amount of radiation that might be released by either route, we studied how weather patterns would affect the transport of radioactivity to Ireland by air or by sea currents.  We modelled how that radioactivity would get into the food chain after it had reached Ireland.  We estimated what dose of radioactivity might be given to people living in Ireland in such circumstances.</p><p>  I am afraid the font used on the slide dealing with the accident scenarios we examined is quite small.  We assessed five scenarios in which radioactivity is released into the air.  I will not go through this slide in detail.  Each scenario was based on a different frequency, ranging from one in 50,000 per annum to one in 33 million per annum.  While such scenarios are quite rare, they would be quite impactful nonetheless, which is why we looked at them in detail.  We divided the impacts into two categories - the health impacts and the other impacts.  It is clear from the slide that in four of the five scenarios, the releases would result in no observable health effects in Ireland, even in the case of a severe accident.  In the case of the fourth scenario listed on the slide, it is predicted that the release of radioactivity could pose a long-term risk of an increase in cancer rates in Ireland if our national emergency plan for nuclear accidents, which is designed to reduce the impact of an incident of this kind, does not work effectively and certain controls are not put in place.</p><p>  As we saw in the cases of the incidents at Chernobyl and, more recently, Fukushima, an event of this nature can have a socioeconomic impact in addition to its direct health impact.</p> <p>For many of the scenarios there would be socioeconomic impacts.  In some cases, people would be advised to stay indoors for a period, and that period would be determined by the amount of radioactivity released.  It could be from hours to possibly a day or two.</p><p> For most of the accident scenarios we considered, some food controls would be necessary.  The amount of radioactivity reaching Ireland would not be enough to impact people's health directly, but if the food contaminated was not taken off the shelves and people ate it, then it may have some health impact.  Our emergency plan is designed to ensure food controls would be implemented, and that is what we would expect.  Changes could be necessary for farming as well.  We saw that arise after the Chernobyl accident when there were restrictions, particularly on sheep and milk, for a time directly after the accident.  For the accident scenarios we have considered, there could be restrictions as well.</p><p> I have referred to the national emergency plan for nuclear accidents.  The plan sets out the way in which Ireland would respond in the event of an accident at a plant in the United Kingdom or further afield.  The lead agency for the plan is our parent Department, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The role of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland in the plan is, in the first instance, to alert that there has been a nuclear accident.  We have bilateral arrangements with our counterparts in the UK and we also participate in the international alerting mechanisms through the European Union and the United Nations body, the International Atomic Energy Agency, based in Vienna.</p><p> We also have a role in assessing the consequences of an accident.  Obviously, immediately after an accident we would not have any actual measurements of radioactivity, but based on what we know about the plant where the accident has taken place, what we know about the kind of radioactivity that might be released and the amounts, we can model what the impacts on Ireland might be and, as a result, we can advise on what counter-measures might be appropriate or what measures should be taken in such cases to limit the impact on people living in Ireland.</p><p> As of now, nuclear power plants are operating at seven sites on the west coast of the UK.  There are eight sites proposed for the development of new and replacement power plants.  Generally speaking, the wind direction is away from Ireland, and that is important.  We already know there is no measurable radiological impact on Ireland from the existing plants for day to day operations.  Based on the assessments we have done, we estimate the same would hold true for the proposed plants, that is to say, there would be no measurable radiological impact on Ireland from day-to-day operations.  At the moment the reprocessing plant at Sellafield is the main source of artificial radioactivity that reaches Ireland.  We can detect radioactivity from Sellafield but it does not pose a significant risk to health.</p><p> Let us consider the situation of a severe accident.  I mentioned that we looked at several different scenarios which encompass the kind of accidents that occurred at Sellafield and Fukushima.  We believe food and agricultural protective actions would generally be required.  The extent of the protective actions and the period during which they would have to be in place would depend on the severity of the accident.  For the most severe accidents we considered, staying indoors would be recommended for a period and obviously that has a certain impact.  Overall, we believe socioeconomic impacts could be anticipated for a severe accident at one of the nuclear plants proposed to be built in the UK.</p><p> Primarily I have discussed discharges to air but let us suppose an accident resulted not in a release to air but a release from the new plants directly into the Irish Sea.  Generally speaking, we believe protective actions would not be required.  This is because the Irish Sea is so large that the amount of radioactivity released, even though it might be large, would be diluted to such an extent that although we would need to monitor the situation we do not believe that protective actions would be required.</p><p> Based on our assessments we believe routine discharges from either existing or proposed nuclear plants pose no radiological risk to people living in Ireland.  For the accident scenarios that we have reviewed, in most cases, there would be no observable health effects.  There would be social and economic consequences.  The overall impact would depend on the severity of the accident and also on the effectiveness of our nuclear plan to respond to the accident.</p><p> The RPII will continue to monitor radioactivity levels in the environment to make these assessments.  At the beginning I remarked that the plants are not built yet and it is not known what type of plant will be built at each of the proposed sites.  Therefore, we are monitoring the situation on an ongoing basis.  As the plants begin to be built and as more information is available about what is actually happening, we will be able to refine our assessments to give a more accurate prediction of what exactly will be the case.  I confirm that our assessments are conservative to date.  In addition to monitoring and assessing, we will continue to maintain a state of readiness to play our part in responding to an accident were it to occur.  I thank the Chairman.  We would be happy to take any questions.</p></speech>

Dr. McGarry stated that there are no health risks and if that were to stack up it would be welcome.  The concern I have is that there is a health risk and that there is also a risk to the food industry on this island.</p><p>  Globally there seems to be a move away from nuclear power but, according to the map produced by the RPII, the Brits clearly have big plans in terms of nuclear power.  There are five proposed nuclear plants on the western side of Wales and England according to the map.  This means five of the proposed eight plants would be on the west coast.</p><p>  A report on Sellafield was done by the UK National Audit Office.  It stated in respect of Sellafield that some of the older tanks on the site have deteriorated so much that their contents pose a significant risk to the people and the environment.  That was a reference to England and Scotland, not to our island to the west.  The report raised several other concerns in respect of Sellafield.</p><p>  The Government decided along the British Government to commission a report six years ago.  It was decided that the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly would carry out the exercise.  We paid somewhere in excess of &euro;4 million for the report but we have not seen it.  The D&aacute;il has not been allowed to see it.  I am unsure whether the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government or the RPII have seen it.  I hope the institute has seen it but, if not, the Government should be asking why not and why it is not being made available to the Members of Parliament in this State.  All we have seen is a sanitised version, what was called an edited version, which was published.  I have concerns about this and about having an edited or censored version of anything because "edited" can mean anything.  We have not seen it.  The people who live in this State have paid for it.  The commissioning of the report was decided by a parliamentary body representing the people of this island and made up of all the parties in the D&aacute;il, not only the Government.  It decided to have the report on Sellafield carried out but that report has not seen the light of day and there has not been one word or peep about it.</p> <p> I am concerned at the delegates' statement that all they can do is produce a generic model of the reactors being built, including the five on the western seaboard of Wales and England.  We do not know the scale of these facilities.  Do we even know the type of reactor that will be used or anything else about them?  For us to say we are satisfied that everything is in order is decidedly risky from a public health perspective.</p><p> I also have serious concerns in regard to the food industry.  We all recall the images of the donkey and cart that were used to promote Ireland as a tourist destination in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s.  Those images portrayed a land of make-believe.  We are trying to do the same thing now in respect of the food industry - convincing people who purchase from us on foreign markets that we are a lovely clean island.  The fact we are so close to Sellafield and even closer to some of the proposed new plants, particularly the Wylfa plant that will be located near Holyhead, poses a significant risk.  The risk is both substantive and also more intangible in that it presents a risk to our reputation and image.  We are good at creating images and reputations, but if some of the countries to which we are exporting large quantities of food were to examine these developments, they might not have such rosy picture of the situation.</p></speech>

He correctly pointed out that there are two different types of risks to consider here, one being the actual health risks to individuals living in Ireland and the second being the risk to the food industry.  In terms of the situation for people in this country arising from the ongoing day-to-day operations of either the existing nuclear plants or those which are planned for construction, according to our assessments, the amounts of radioactivity released into the environment are not sufficiently high to pose a health risk.  I am referring here to routine operations.  The situation in the case of an extremely severe accident is different.  As I mentioned earlier, in one of the accident scenarios we considered in our study we found, depending on the severity of the accident and whether the plan we have in place turns out on the day to be effective in mitigating the consequences of that accident, there could be an ensuing increase in cancer rates in Ireland.  In summary, our view is that there is not a health risk from day-to-day operations but, on the other hand, there would be an increase in cancer risks if things went very badly wrong.</p><p>  In terms of the risk to the food industry, again I would make the distinction between what happens on a day-to-day basis, either in regard to the existing plant or the proposed new locations, and the potential consequences in the case of a serious accident.  Our assessments show that routine operations do not result in measurable levels of radioactivity in food that would pose a risk to the food industry.  Again, however, for most of the accident scenarios we have considered, our assessment shows there could be - would be in some cases - a risk of food contamination.  In that situation, there would be a threat to the food industry.  Certainly, we are not saying otherwise.  In terms of the health implications for the population arising out of that, our strategy for managing food contamination would be to implement food controls.  However, it would undoubtedly be a serious issue for exporters.  There is no doubt about that.</p><p>  The Deputy also mentioned the report by the United Kingdom's National Audit Office which indicated that there is a risk to people and the environment in Britain arising from the older tanks at the Sellafield site.  In terms of the implications for Ireland, the key question to consider is how the very large amount of radioactivity at Sellafield might be released and make its way across the Irish Sea.  The Deputy will recall that in the case of the Chernobyl accident, it was an explosion that released the radioactivity up into the air, and it was carried by the weather across to Ireland.  In the case of the older tanks at Sellafield, it is our understanding that there is not that type of energy available to lift the radioactivity into the air and bring it across to us.  While we have concerns about many issues at the Sellafield site, our assessment is that the tanks do not have a particular potential impact for Ireland other than by some unusual route, where, for example, a meteorite were to hit a tank and release radioactivity into the environment.  In such a scenario, an impact for Ireland cannot be ruled out.</p></speech>

There was no mention of meteorites or anything like that.  The office stated that the actual condition of the tanks has deteriorated to the point that without ever being hit by a meteorite or Scud missile or anything else, their contents pose a significant risk to people and the environment.</p></speech>

I might not have explained myself correctly.  The tanks at Sellafield are like swimming pools above ground.  I have seen them myself and their integrity is not very good.  If these swimming pools were to disintegrate, all of their contents would be released into the local environment.  While this would be an absolute catastrophe for people living in the local area and the local environment, our view is that, given our distance from the site, the amount of radioactivity that would reach us in that scenario would be insufficient to pose a significant health risk.</p></speech>

Will Dr. McGarry clarify that?  From what she has said and how the discussion has gone, the impression I am getting is that we cannot be certain of that assertion, that it is very much a grey area.  Despite this, the independent international report to which I referred stated clearly that there was no observable health risk in the event of a radioactive leak from Sellafield, no matter how it came about.</p></speech>

People are becoming more aware that certain environmental factors may pose a potential health risk, from telecommunications masts right through to the issue we are discussing today.  The delegates spoke about how they have mapped the various facilities.  The proposed reprocessing plants, as well as the Sellafield site, are all on the west coast of Britain and thus in close proximity to the most populated part of this island.  As such, do they pose a greater risk than the power plants themselves, or does the RPII rank them in that way?</p><p>  In the case of the construction of new plants, are various risk scenarios tested and potential compensation factored into the cost of those plants?  That is something to consider in a context where we might face a serious threat to our food industry.</p> <p>The impact on the food industry creates real costs beyond the boundaries.  Fukushima and Chernobyl are cases in point.  The chart is very interesting because it shows the impact of radon gases, a matter with which we have to deal.  How do we compare with our British counterparts who are closer to the various nuclear facilities in terms of the artificial impacts?  Does Dr. McGarry have that information to hand?  Dr. McGarry has listed the artificial down as low as 1% or less than that.  Is that elevated by location?  I presume it would vary across the land mass but there might be a greater impact on locations closer to the facilities.  Where is the cosmetic generated?  Presumably "terrestrial" refers to telecommunications masts.  Am I right?</p></speech>

She asked about the difference in potential impact between a re-processing plant and a nuclear power plant.  The main difference is that a nuclear power plant is a real source of energy.  If there is an explosion at a nuclear power plant, there is the potential for radioactivity to be released up high into the environment and to be transported in the weather across to Ireland.  A re-processing plant does not have the same energy associated with it.  In order to introduce energy to the situation to get the radioactivity over to Ireland, the kind of events considered were a strike by a meteorite etc., a different type of event entirely.</p><p>  The Deputy also asked about compensation and whether that was factored into the cost of building.  I am not entirely certain about that.  I will ask my colleagues in a moment.  There certainly are international conventions around nuclear liability so it is taken into account.  The Deputy also asked how we compare with people living immediately adjacent to the plant, such as people in the UK living close to either Wylfa or Trawsfynydd or whatever.  In terms of day-to-day operations, the radiation dose they receive is higher than that which we receive but it would be in the realm of no observable health effects.  In the UK it would not be permitted to operate a nuclear plant on a day-to-day basis which had observable health effects on people.  The radiation dose will be slightly higher the closer one is to a facility.  The dose to Ireland from Sellafield is extremely low but what dose there is comes through eating contaminated fish or shellfish, so the amounts are very small. </p><p>  I will ask my colleague, Ciara McMahon to talk about the various scenarios that we tested.</p></speech>

They covered situations where the nuclear power plant has lost its power for some external reason and the differing severity of that loss, whether it loses external power but still has batteries, whether it loses the batteries quickly or slowly and in situations where it loses its power and its cooling, the type of events that occurred at Fukushima.  We did not study particularly what caused it to lose its power.  The scenarios were taken from a recent study by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission which had brought together information and data on ways in which accidents can occur at this type of nuclear power plants.  That data was collected over 25 years so it is state-of-the-art, up-to-date data on what would happen, how much radioactivity could be released, if a power plant were to lose its power and how quickly that happened.</p><p>  We studied three scenarios for releases to sea, one in which the amount of radioactivity released to sea was equivalent to one year's discharges but over a short period rather than over a year; one in which it lost all of its cooling water, which would contain some radioactivity which would go into the Irish Sea over a short period; and, third, a scenario which was equivalent to the amount of radioactivity released to the Pacific Ocean after the Fukushima accident.  </p></speech>

Dr. McMahon said it is uncertain what type of nuclear plant will be developed in the UK.  I assume that in line with the technological advances in nuclear energy there have been similar advances in innovative safety measures to contain any risk.  Is there any research on that area and how far has it advanced?  If an accident does happen can it be fully contained, or can a percentage of it be contained?  I know that is a very technical area but for the layman I would appreciate if the witnesses could expand a bit on that area, risk, the management of risk, and safety innovation in nuclear technology.</p><p>  I recall some years ago, when I was much younger, there was controversy about the national emergency plan, and iodine tablets were distributed.  When was the plan last reviewed?  How was it communicated?  What other State agencies does the institute or the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government work with, such as local authorities, Civil Defence and the Red Cross?  What mechanism is used to get the message out if there is the need for an urgent reaction to a problem? </p></speech>

Each organisation that has a role has its own plan.  That includes the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.</p> <p>We keep it continually under review but we would have had a particular review after the Fukushima accident because we would have used elements of the plan in responding to that accident, even though the amount of radioactivity that reached Ireland was minuscule.  Obviously, many international events were occurring.  We had to work with colleagues in the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, environmental health officers and so on in assessing any imports from Japan.  We also had to give advice to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for any Irish people living in Japan.  Certain elements of the plan were used in real life during the Fukushima accident and that was an opportunity for us to review it.</p><p> There are many organisations involved.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is the lead Department for the plan but it also involves our organisation, Met &Eacute;ireann, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, the Department of Defence, the Defence Forces, the Garda and many other organisations.  We work closely with them and all the assessments we have done, both on the potential nuclear power plants and on the existing nuclear power plants around the world, have shown clearly that because of our distance from any nuclear power plants, the most important thing we have to protect to reduce people's radiation doses is the food chain.  We put a great deal of our efforts, therefore, into ensuring Ireland has plans in place to deal with the potential contamination of the food chain to ensure we can prevent that contamination by taking certain early steps at farm level, and we work very closely with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to ensure those plans exist.</p><p> This morning we had a training session for experts from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  An expert group has been set up under the national emergency plan with experts from the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  We would have regular training sessions.  We are co-developing a handbook and updating that constantly with the best information available internationally but also on particular information of importance to Ireland in terms of where milk is produced, the procedures for getting information out and the best way of informing farmers or other groups such as food producers.  We would work with the people who work with them all the time such as the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p> In terms of the notification, Ireland is a signatory to two international notification systems, one through the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency and one from the European Commission.  In both cases the message comes to ourselves in the RPII in parallel with coming to the Garda communications centre because it operates on a 24 hours a day, seven days a week basis.  We have somebody on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week and if a message comes in, we will be notified very quickly.  A chain is set up in terms of notification of other organisations, and the Garda communications centre, with the help of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, maintains a list of the key contact people in all the relevant Departments.  Very quickly, therefore, the message can be got out and then through the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government the message will be sent out to the local authorities in terms of keeping them up to date.  Those structures are in place not just for this plan but also for all the other emergency plans, including the major emergency plans in which the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has a very strong role.</p></speech>

I wish to ask a question I intended to ask earlier relating to radon levels in the ground.  I come from a constituency in Waterford where there is traditionally quite a high radon gas level.  I acknowledge the work the RPII has put into raising awareness among the public.  It held roadshows a few years ago which were very successful.  It constantly encourages testing of people's homes and workplaces.  Do the representatives consider it a good idea if testing were made obligatory, similar to the building energy rating, BER, certificate which is obligatory when a person wants to sell or lease a house?  The incidence of radon gas levels is a more serious issue.  I would like to get their views on whether they consider it would be a good idea for testing to be obligatory.</p></speech>

Primarily the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has been in touch with the relevant organisations in Ireland to examine how that might be implemented and we hope that would be implemented in the coming years.  It would seem to be a very sensible way to address the issue.</p></speech>

They are the experts on radiation and the institute is charged under radiological protection legislation with assessing risk, advising the Government and assessing how it could be mitigated or what is likely to happen in the future.  There are many types of types of radiation and we are talking about nuclear radiation in particular here.  The Deputy seated to my left mentioned the incidence of radon gas.  It is natural that there is concern about Sellafield, and mention of its name switches a light bulb on in people's heads, but that has dissipated other than what happened in Fukushima.</p><p>  I have a particular interest in another type of radiation, EMF radiation.  Does it come within the representatives' area of expertise?  Concern about it has people up in arms.  People are concerned about the health risks associated with radiation emanating from high voltage power lines.  Even though the institute was established with the necessary expertise to protect us, that area does not seem to fall within its remit.  Is such radiation a risk to health and what parameters need to be observed to ensure it does not impact on people's health?  We must have an honest conversation about this issue.  Much of the conversation that is taking place in the different parts of the country that will be affected by proposals for these lines is fractious and nobody believes anybody.  How safe are 400 kV lines in terms of observing safe practice when they are located near houses, schools and centres of population?  What is the practice across Europe and does laying the cables underground compound the problem or enhance safety?  I am not talking about their visual impact, just their health impact.  We go to many meetings and all we are being told is their impact in terms of cancer.  There is not one person or family who is not concerned.  I would appreciate it if the representatives could given me the science on this.</p></speech>

The remit of our institute in terms of radiation is to do with ionising radiation but the kind of radiation the Deputy mentioned, that related to EMF, power lines, etc., is non-ionising radiation.

Radon is also ionising radiation, therefore, it naturally falls within our remit.  The Government examined the issue a number of years ago of giving our institute responsibility for non-ionising radiation, but that issue has not progressed.  Therefore, we do not have any experts among our staff in that area.  As a result, I am not in a position to answer the Deputy's question.  That sounds as if I am fobbing her off but that is truth.  It is not our area of expertise.  We simply do not have experts in that area.</p></speech>

We were not given responsibility for that at that stage.  There were some concerns a number of years ago and a committee was set up but I do not remember the details of it now.  I was involved and we were asked to look at what would be needed for our institute to take it on.  We looked at the practice in Sweden and in the UK and the kind of expertise they had and how they addressed the issue, but it did not progress beyond that.</p> <p>We were never given functions in that area and I am afraid we do not have any expert in it either.</p></speech>

Should this be a priority for the Government, considering the general fear among communities on account of high power electricity lines?  The fear is palpable.  Does Dr. McGarry consider it should be a priority from the point of view of needing a more detailed examination from a health perspective?</p></speech>

Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh Ms Sarah Neary, senior adviser; Mr. Aidan O'Connor, principal adviser; Mr. John Wickham, building adviser; and Mr. Paris Beausang, higher executive officer, who are present on behalf of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leo as bheith i l&aacute;thair.  I draw their attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee<i>.  </i>However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person, persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  The opening statement and any other document submitted by the delegates to the committee may be published on its website after the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person, persons or an entity in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>  We agreed to consider this issue further as a result of correspondence, dated 4 October, received from Mr. O'Connor.  Accordingly, we are anxious to hear and consider how the regulations will be transposed into Irish law and their practical consequences in this country.</p></speech>

I will explain briefly the CPR and their legal status and deal with the issue of how they affect the standard of construction products on the market in Ireland.</p><p>  The main goal of the CPR is to reduce technical barriers to trade across Europe in construction products.  The regulations will do this by creating technical specifications or standards for individual construction products.  They are written at European level and use common technical language which harmonises test methods, the methods for declaring on performance and the methods used in third party assessment of construction products.  Therefore, when they are placed on the market, the characteristics of products should be the same across Europe, whether one is in Sweden, Germany or Ireland.</p><p>  The CPR make it mandatory, when a product is covered by these specifications or standards, for a declaration of performance to be made and a CE mark will be affixed to the product.  The manufacturer is responsible for these and the information contained in them.  Once one sees the CE mark on a construction product, one knows it has been through this process and that the information is in accordance with the CPR and any other Union harmonisation legislation applying to it.  The CPR envisage everybody across the construction sector using this common technical language.  As regulators of the building regulations, we use these standards and specifications.  Users will use them to choose between products, while manufacturers will provide the information which can be considered reliable.  That is the concept behind the regulations.</p><p>  In terms of legal status, the regulations were adopted in 2011 and came into effect in Ireland on 1 July this year.  They repealed the construction products directive, CPD.  They build on many of the instruments established under the CPD.  They are in the interests of simplifying and clarifying the use of the CE mark for construction products.</p><p>  We needed to bring forward national legislation to police the construction products regulations and provide for market surveillance.  We can go through these issues in more detail.  SI 225 designates local building control authorities as the market surveillance authorities and provides them with powers.  It requires them to authorise persons to carry out inspections and investigative work.  It also provides for the corrective actions to be taken, if a problem occurs or there is an offence.  Defences and penalties are also included.  There is market surveillance at a national level in accordance with national regulations.  There are also voluntary measures in which we are involved at European level.  Where a product is deemed to be high risk, it is dealt with through the provision of a RAPEX notice which is issued by various member states.  We can go into that matter in more detail, if the committee wishes.</p><p>  On the third topic, the impact on the quality of construction products in Ireland, the standards and specifications from the European Union are very different from what we have relied on in national standards.</p> <p>The European standards harmonise the tests, the assessment methods and the declaration a manufacturer makes but not the performance the product must meet.  In this regard the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, has gone through a process of producing national guidance for some of the European standards to maintain the Irish or British standards we would have been familiar with using here.  They have a process in place and are about half way through the harmonised standards issued to date, of which there are approximately 400 or 500, to assess if any more national guidance is needed.</p><p> The CE mark is about putting a product on the market.  When the product is used, it is the responsibility of the designers or the professionals involved, and the builders, as to how it is used appropriately.  That is where the building regulations or the NRA specification come in because they are the national rules that apply.  There is a gap between the European system and what we were used to previously with Irish and British standards but the NSAI is in the process of reviewing that.</p></speech>

Regarding construction products in the market in general, Ms Neary does not have a crystal ball or a monopoly of wisdom on this but with regard to what happened with pyrite and issues such as that, regulations like this will put a squeeze on in terms of the standard of product that arrives in the market but in the likely event - it would have been unlikely at one stage - that there might be a repeat of that, which might not involve quarry stone or whatever, can we take comfort from this measure that those situations are less likely to happen?  Is there any assurance with this measure that it might not happen in the future?</p></speech>

Whatever the manufacturer writes in terms of the characteristics of the product in that DOP, he or she must stand over that.  If it is found that the product does not meet that performance, that is clearly a non-compliance with the construction products regulation.</p><p>  In terms of pyrite, that is an interesting one because hardcore will now be CE marked.  The NSAI has just concluded a public inquiry on what is known as standard recommendation 21, which provides that national guidance.  In terms of the harmonised standard dealing with aggregates like hardcore, there is now a harmonised standard that sets up the test methods, the assessment process and the third parties that must be involved before hardcore can be placed on the market.  The NSAI has produced guidance on the specification and the minimum standards for the characteristics of hardcore when it is placed on that market.  That provides clarity for the users and for the manufacturers.  The manufacturers must declare what those characteristics are and the users can check whether that is what they are getting on site.  There is a greater confidence in terms of what is being delivered.  The manufacturer is clearly responsible for what he or she says that product can do.</p></speech>

In terms of the history in this country, cement production was where much of the problem has arisen but Ms Neary has clarified the implications that might have for that particular sector.  However, with the housing boom I am aware that many construction products like window sills, door heads and similar products were made locally in concrete yards and so on.  Will all of those small suppliers and manufacturers have to comply in terms of their declarations of performance?  Essentially, will all of those products have a CE mark or what process will they go through?</p></speech>

One is through a harmonised standard, which is mandatory.  Between 400 and 500 standards are published and referred to in the OJ.  If someone's product falls within those standards, it must be CE marked from 1 July of this year.</p><p>  There are derogations from CE marking in certain circumstances.  One of the reasons for the CPR was to reduce the burden on small and medium enterprises, SMEs.  That part of the CPR has not been elaborated on as of yet by the Commission but the intention is that there will be simplified rules for SMEs.</p></speech>

I suspect much of that would have been done over the years but are there any plans in the Department or in terms of policy to have perhaps a clerk of works through the local authority system to examine building standards and building product?  It happens in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland where the local authority or a building inspector would call at various stages of a construction and examine it to ensure the product being used is correct, that the steel beams are fire-proofed, that the construction product is good and that everything is up to standard.  That does not happen here.  Are there any plans in that area?</p></speech>

The three main pillars are that when a building is being designed now it must have a full commencement notice, a design certificate that it is in accordance with the building regulations, and a submission of design and compliance drawings.  An assigned certifier is then appointed who carries out certain inspections at various critical points in the project and then at the end, a builder and the assigned certifier signs a certificate of completion and compliance with the building regulations.  There is major reform in terms of the organisation of construction projects.</p><p>  Also, in the context of the CPR and construction products themselves being placed on the market, there are five systems of assessment under the CPR ranging from complete manufacturer's declaration of what he or she is doing, and self-certification, to full third party assessment of both the initial testing, the ongoing testing, the factory production control set-up and the factory production control continuous surveillance.  Depending on the critical nature of the product, the higher up that scale one goes.  That is set at European level, therefore, any fire-related products generally will be at the higher end of the scale.</p></speech>

It has a range of powers.  It can do spot-checks or react where there is a suspicion that the product is not meeting the performance declared for it, and there is a process for giving the economic operator an opportunity to correct the matter.  If he or she does not do that it is escalated to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government who can restrict, recall or ban the product or relabel it for other use, etc.  There are also penalties and fines.</p></speech>

My name is Paul Gregan and I work half-time as a consultant in palliative medicine and half-time as a general practitioner.  I chair the primary palliative care programme, which is a joint initiative set up in 2010 with the backing of the Irish Hospice Foundation, the HSE and the Irish College of General Practitioners, with the aim of identifying improvements and initiatives that would support the provision of palliative care in the community by the primary care team. I represent the Irish Palliative Medicine Consultants Association on that committee.</p><p>  The real reason we are all here today is to hear about the care of those living with life-limiting illnesses in the community, and about caring for them as they die.  Palliative care is very much about the living and how we manage their holistic care from a physical, psychological, social and spiritual perspective.  It is also about caring for people towards the end of their lives and it is about how they die.</p><p>  Care of the imminently dying is a smaller but extremely important part of what palliative care is about; much as care in pregnancy is not all about the birth, palliative care is not all about dying.  After-care, in the form of bereavement care, is the continuation of care past death for families and friends involved and forms part of the remit of palliative care services.</p><p>  We will all have a last year of our lives.  Therefore, we all have a real stake in the quality of care that is provided to those who are at the end of their lives now.  They are us tomorrow.  I have three points to make about their care.  The first is about prioritisation.  In my work as a general practitioner, palliative care patients stand out as generally among the sickest and most in need.  I suspect this is the same across everyone&rsquo;s practice, whether it is medical, nursing or anything else.  It stands to reason that they are therefore in a top-priority grouping for service provision and in many areas, although not in all, they are already categorised as such.  For example, accessing a priority discretionary medical card for a person with a palliative care need, with a turnaround time now from application to receipt of a few days, represents a good example of excellence in care.  However, not being able to access sufficient carer support when a person is deteriorating or dying, or the unavailability of equipment in the community for this priority grouping, arguably represents a fundamental breakdown in care provision.  I would urge all areas of the health service to examine where they can prioritise this care.  These patients should be category one in everyone&rsquo;s book.</p><p>  The second area is around equity.  Different areas of Ireland have different access to palliative care provision.  This is true in specialist palliative care; it is well documented that the provision of specialist palliative care beds is inequitable.  It is also true in community palliative care at specialist levels - for example, where we have funding for five-day-a-week services instead of seven - and it is also true at generalist levels.  For example, in one area there may be only five hours of carer time a week, while five miles up the road there is access to 21 hours of carer time.</p><p>  Similarly, access to services by palliative care patients under the age of 65, who amount to a quarter of the patients under specialist palliative care, needs to equate to that of those over the age of 65.  Arbitrary age cut-offs are not helpful in life-limiting illness.  Palliative care patients deserve priority access to a standard, minimum and equitable amount of care in the community.</p><p>  The third area I would like to cover is nursing.  When I ask my palliative care colleagues about palliative care that could be improved upon, they prioritise nursing.  The fundamental lack of provision for nursing support to patients and families ranks highest in their table of requirements.  We are fortunate that we still have, by and large, a society in which families will do all in their power and ability to help a relative in trouble, but we need to meet them halfway on that and at the moment we do not.  There is an urgent need to augment our nursing services for palliative care patients.  We need a dedicated budget for community nursing in palliative care.</p><p>  Dying is something that each one of us will do in our turn.  Only one in ten of us will die suddenly.  Therefore, we are in a position to adequately plan the individual care of nine out of every ten people, but we are also able to plan adequate care at population health level for those living months before dying and those imminently dying.  We need to plan the care of these people.  It is relatively inexpensive and it is entirely predictable.  We need to do the simple things and the important things well.</p></speech>

Nursing Homes Ireland has made a detailed submission already.  Therefore, today I will concentrate on the current challenges and possible solutions.</p><p>  There have been many positive developments in end-of-life care in Ireland, especially the establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, in 2009.  Nursing homes are probably the most regulated area of the health service, and now HIQA has established thematic inspections on end-of-life care.  The thematic inspections focus on end-of-life care and are geared at improving standards in nursing homes.  Other positive developments include the provision of end-of-life care education for staff working in residential care settings for older people; the establishment of the End of Life Forum; the commencement of the Changing Minds programme; the establishment of the All Ireland Institute of Hospice and Palliative Care; and the Health Service Executive National Clinical Programme for Palliative Care.  These are all very positive developments in end-of-life care in Ireland.</p><p>  Some 25% of all deaths in Ireland occur in residential care settings.  It has been recognised that a substantial proportion of patients who die in hospital could be cared for appropriately at home, in a hospice or in a nursing home.  It is for that reason that the end-of-life care in nursing homes is very important today.  It has been suggested that most people do not die at home because the majority of deaths follow a period of chronic illness.  This reflects the wider need for increased consultant-led chronic disease management in the nursing home and greater communication between regular and out-of-hours GP services.  It is widely recognised that there should be greater consultation with older people regarding end-of-life care and decisions regarding end of life should be made before the person enters a nursing home.</p><p>  The HSE Quality and Patient Safety Audit report identified that there is greater and more consistent access to primary care team services among public long-term care patients than among those in private nursing homes.  This supports the acknowledgement by HIQA that there is inadequate access to all care services, reflecting a wider funding issue in the sector.  The role of the allied health professional at the end of life is widely acknowledged.</p><p>  A survey of directors of nursing recently emphasised a high level of satisfaction with GP services in nursing homes.  However, it was also highlighted areas for improvement, which centred around three main themes: accessibility and quality of service, service delivery, and accountability and sector awareness.  It could be argued that the GP is the gatekeeper of care and is therefore in a prime position to commence discussions and plans about end-of-life care before admission to long-term care.  This ensures that end-of-life care meets the resident's needs and wishes and that these can be met by the nursing home staff. </p><p>  Issues have been highlighted by Nursing Homes Ireland members in regard to the provision of services by GPs.  They include the charging of an administrative fee by some providers for out-of-hours service - known as Caredoc in the South, but there are many other names for the service around Ireland - refusals to visit by some GPs, and triage by telephone.  Also, due to the rural location of some nursing homes in Ireland, it is difficult to get GPs in the out-of-hours service to visit.</p><p>  Symptom relief at the end of life is very important.  It is very important that people who are dying receive pain relief and the care they require.  Unfortunately, if a GP does not call this cannot be provided.  We recommend that the role of nurse prescribers be enhanced in nursing homes.  Unfortunately, nurse prescribers in nursing homes are not issued with a prescription pad for prescribing medication at present.  Therefore, their role cannot be enhanced.</p><p>  The report Creating Excellence in Dementia Care states that up 66% of residents in nursing homes have a dementia.  Due to the unpredictable illness trajectory and fluctuating capacity of residents with dementia, many clinical, ethical and legal challenges present, including recognition of the dying phase.  It can be very difficult for a GP or doctor to admit that somebody is in the dying phase.  This highlights the need for more specialist geriatrician input to assist and support nursing home staff in adequately addressing the needs of residents with dementia within the nursing home throughout their illness and especially at the end of life.</p><p>  The nurse-led hospice at home service is an invaluable support.  However, this service is predominantly during office hours and therefore out-of-hours supports are limited.  This view is supported by general practitioners, who highlighted the need for greater access to out-of-hours service, particularly access to consultant-led palliative care teams.</p> <p>In addition, specialist palliative care services need to be extended to all residents, not just those with a malignancy, to enable greater equity of access to care.  The HSE framework document published in 2008 recommended enhancing hospice provision.  This has not been achieved to date.  There are large parts of the country that do not have access to inpatient hospice services and, unfortunately, some areas have to fund-raise to provide a hospice for their area.</p><p> NHI, in tandem with many other stakeholders, is extremely concerned at the narrow definition of long-term residential care services under the nursing home support scheme.   The former Ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly, highlighted this anomaly on a number of occasions and in reports.  In respect of restrictions for residents in private nursing homes or access to appliances and aids, some of these items are not provided or reimbursed under the primary care reimbursement service.  Equipment such as syringe drivers, nebulisers and oxygen masks cannot be reimbursed.  Therefore, it falls under the cost of care for caring for people at end of life in nursing homes.  The physical environment of many acute hospitals and public long-stay facilities is not the ideal setting for people who are dying.  People who are dying deserve private rooms.  In private nursing homes, 67% of rooms are private.</p><p> The recommendations made by NHI are that the HSE publish the findings of the quality and patient safety audit on primary care team services and outline the actions taken to address the deficits.  A formal mechanism for GPs to communicate with out-of-hours services should be implemented without delay.  The role of the GP in providing services to residents in nursing homes should be clarified and this should be done in tandem with a full review of the GP contract and education for GPs involved.  Registered nurse prescribers working in private health care facilities should be issued with a prescription pad and enabled to prescribe medicines for residents with medical cards.  There should be an increase in the number of geriatricians nationally to improve access to diagnosis and chronic illness management in the nursing home.  This will prevent the unnecessary transfer of residents to acute hospitals.  The hospice at home service should be extended to residents with non-malignant terminal illnesses and should provide for out-of-hours access.  Access to consultant-led palliative care teams should be made available to residents with non-malignant terminal illnesses, not just to cancer patients.</p><p> The priority actions identified in the 2008 HSE palliative care services framework should be implemented as promised to enhance the access to inpatient and respite hospice services nationally.  A Department of Health-led forum or expert group on long-term care, where all the key stakeholders come together and work on a common goal, which is to improve quality of care for residents in nursing homes, should be established.   Consideration should be given to the prioritisation of palliative care patients on the fair deal waiting list to facilitate death in a more appropriate place.  Unfortunately, people are on a waiting list of nursing homes at end of life and by the time the bed comes up, they have passed away.  Legislation pertaining to advanced care directives should be introduced in Ireland.  Currently, there is no legislation on advanced care directives.   There should be a public awareness campaign and tailored education for health care professionals prior to enactment of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill.  Immediate action should be taken to address the deficits and the shortage of nurses in nursing homes.  I thank members for their time.</p></speech>

The ICHN is a professional and educational body established in 1985 to represent public health nurses and community registered general nurses working in primary care throughout Ireland.</p><p>  Research indicates that 90% of the last year of life is spent at home, that the expressed wish of 80% of people with end-stage illness in this country is to die at home, and that only 26% of the 29,000 people who die each year do so at home.  It is apparent there is a great need to improve home care services to fulfil this desired wish.</p><p>  The World Health Organization definition of palliative care is an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problems associated with life-threatening illness through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification and impeccable assessment and treatment of pain and other problems, including physical, psycho-social and spiritual problems.  End-of-life care refers to the care offered to an individual when death is imminent and life expectancy is days or even hours.  End-of-life care is part of what palliative care is but by no means defines it.  Palliative care services may be structured in three levels of ascending specialisation according to the needs of the patient and family and the expertise of the staff providing it.  Level 1 is palliative care approach.  Palliative care principles should be appropriately applied by all health care professionals.  Level 2 is a generalist approach where at an intermediate level, a proportion of patients and families will benefit from the expertise of health professionals who, although not engaged in full-time palliative care, have had the additional training and experience in palliative care.  That would be typical of a public health nurse, community or GN and GP.  Level 3 would be the specialist palliative care services, which are limited in terms of their core activities to the provision of palliative care.</p><p>  For over a decade, it has been acknowledged that people with conditions other than cancer should have their palliative care needs met, and this principle has been adopted in Irish policy documents since 2001.  Services for people with life-limiting diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dementia, heart failure, end-stage renal failure and chronic neurological disorders, are still underdeveloped and fragmented in Ireland.  A key finding of the children's palliative care needs assessment was that the preferred location of caring for a child with a life-limiting condition is the family home with parents receiving adequate professional support.</p><p>  Evidence shows that there are many factors that prevent patients from receiving adequate care in the community and which result in the admission of patients to hospitals, nursing homes or specialist palliative care units.   The difficulties experienced by carers and relatives were more often a cause for hospital admission than those of the patients.  Others found that support at home produced the strongest influence on place of death, with the need for around-the-clock, seven-day nursing care being foremost and access to specialist palliative care advice, specialist equipment, the medical card, social services and receipt of an attendance allowance all showing statistically significant effects.</p><p>  Of the people who die every year at home, the majority of their care is provided by members of the primary care team.  It must be acknowledged that without the input of relatives and lay carers, home death could not be achieved.  Due consideration needs to given to the support and resources required by lay and primary carers in the community.  Public health nurses and community registered nurses are responsible for a particular geographical area and are key members of the primary care team.  They assess the holistic palliative care and end-of-life nursing needs of all patients in the community.  They are responsible for co-ordinating and managing the nursing services delivered to the patient in the community, linking hospital, community and specialist service as appropriate.  Resources are limited to 9 to 5, Monday to Friday, however, with only planned essential calls at the weekend and public holidays.  In most areas, there is very little or possibly no service after 5 p.m and before 9 a.m.</p><p>  There is emerging evidence to suggest that where people die has an impact on how they die, and that those who die at home and in the place they prefer have a better quality of dying, so to speak, than those who do not.   A major inequity exists in the availability of palliative care and specialist palliative care throughout the country due to the way in which services have been developed.  The institutionalisation of care at the end of life and eventual place of death does not reflect the wishes of the majority of the population.  In the next decade, there will be significantly more people living with advancing life-limiting disease in the community and all of these people will require a palliative approach to their care.</p><p>  I will address the dignity care intervention.  The aim of this service development initiative is to implement and evaluate a dignity care intervention that will be delivered by all nurses to conserve the dignity of people at the end of life in community settings.  The ICHN endorsed the palliative care clinical programme which focuses on equity of access based on need of the individual and efficient use of resources.  The ICHN recommends that leadership is required from all the relevant stakeholders within service delivery, education, policy and academia; that choice of location for care at end of life should be fully supported and resourced adequately; that all patients who have a diagnosis of a life-limiting condition should have equal access to all levels of palliative care in the community; that due cognisance should be given to the roles and responsibilities of the public health nursing service-----</p></speech>

As I represent the Alzheimer society, I will concentrate on people with dementia in connection with end of life.  I will focus on four key points that summarise our submission.</p><p>  Our key recommendation to the committee is to have dementia recognised in the first instance as a life-limiting condition in order that specific palliative care can be provided as part of dementia care following diagnosis to the end of life.  Dementia is a life-limiting condition but often it is not recognised as such.  End-of-life care and palliative interventions currently tend to focus on malignant diseases but we need specifically to include dementia as a life-limiting disease.  End-of-life care for a person with dementia needs to be begin at the point of diagnosis.  The trajectory of dementia is not a straight line similar to other diagnoses.  It is complex and there is no cure for it.  The journey begins at diagnosis, it continues and transitions to community services, possibly including an acute hospital admission, before long-term care and the onset of comorbidity.  Too soon is never too soon in terms of planning for dementia and end of life.</p><p>  To enable palliative interventions during the journey, we need to build capacity within current health care teams working with people with dementia.  This would enable the 42,000 people in Ireland who currently live with dementia to live but also to die well.  The number is projected to increase in less than 25 years, a relatively short period, to 140,000.  We have the opportunity to prevent dementia and end-of-life care crises in Ireland.</p><p>  We are working on the development of a national dementia strategy, which will be an important point in public policy.  It is due for publication at the end of the year.  It is critical in the context of this discussion that full policy recognition of dementia palliative care is contained within the strategy.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-05a.1569" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Declan Walsh" time="17:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013110500005#D00400"><p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak to the committee.  I have spent almost all of my professional life working in the United States and the United Kingdom and, therefore, my remarks will address the international trends in the field.</p><p>  I refer to the field of palliative medicine, the physician specialty.  It is a new and evolving medical specialty and its final shape and form is in evolution in terms of where it works, how it works and the various interactions it has a specialty.  It is focused on people with serious or incurable diseases but its final shape and form is not decided as compared to a well-established specialty such as gastroenterology or cardiology.  A major way of thinking about the management of chronic illness is to think of it in two buckets.  One is the acute care system and the other is the post-acute care system of which hospice, rehabilitation and other forms of post-acute care are important components.  The interaction between those systems drives much of the expense and many of the challenges in the management of chronic illness.  The field of palliative medicine arose in part as a reaction to perceived deficiencies in modern medical care, for example, medical care being overly technical or impersonal in the hospital.  This is starting to change because palliative medicine is becoming more of a mainstream medical specialty and that is a significant change internationally.</p><p>  A patient who goes to see a palliative medicine specialist or someone who has had training in palliative medicine should expect superior skills and communication decision-making in the setting of a chronic complicated illness, excellent management of the complications of the disease and the symptoms such as pain, excellent care of the patient who is dying as well as psycho-social care of the patient and his or her family and co-ordination of the care to make sure the patient is in the right place at the right time for the right reasons.  That is a significant challenge because it means the provision of services in the hospital or the community on a 24-7 basis.  The current evolution of palliative medicine internationally is to go towards comprehensive integrated programmes that provide a menu of services in the hospital and in the community, which are linked, for example, by electronic medical records in order that there is excellent continuity of care between the acute care system and the post-acute care system and that the patient does not get lost in the medical care system.  That, unfortunately, is a frequent occurrence with people who have complex chronic illnesses.  Sometimes it emerges that nobody is in charge of the patient's care and that is one of the roles palliative medicine can fulfil.</p><p>  The other major development is the so-called upstreaming concept.  The idea behind this is that many people at the time they are diagnosed with an illness are diagnosed to be incurable at the day of diagnosis and, therefore, it makes sense to involve palliative medicine as a specialty early in the trajectory of the illness.  There is persuasive evidence that early involvement of the specialty can reduce the cost of care, improve the quality of care and reduce length of stay in hospitals.  People who have been referred to palliative medicine services early appear to live longer than those who are not referred until later in the trajectory of the illness.  There are many benefits in terms of the quality and continuity of care and major economic and operational benefits for hospitals to have integrated comprehensive palliative medicine programmes.</p><p>  In the context of the community, there is an inexorable shift away from the hospital into the community in medical care.  This is driven by the ageing population and the realisation that hospitals can be dangerous places to be at times and people should be better cared for very often in the community setting.  The explosion in modern information technology will allow us to look after people in a much more comprehensive and efficient manner in the community and we will be able to do things in the community that one could only do in the hospital until recently.  This has significant implications for training, manpower in the context of the provision of specialists and generalists in the area and for returning to some old fashioned values in medicine such as the ability of GPs or specialists to visit patients in the home and so on.  There are important services that need to be delivered on a 24-7 basis.  There needs to be specialist back up for the community services throughout the country.</p><p>  The international trends are earlier involvement of specialist palliative medicine closer to the time of diagnosis, the provision of integrated services between the acute care system and the post-acute care system to make the best use of the available medical resources in either setting and making sure the patient is in the right place at the right time.  Palliative medicine is emerging as a mainstream medical specialty, which will have significant implications for the development of the field both in Ireland and internationally.</p></speech>

We often discuss community care and primary care.</p> <p>They seem to be the buzzwords in the provision of medicine and medical care in general.  However, it needs resourcing.  There is no point in us saying we can roll out these programmes of support for GPs in primary and community care unless we resource it and train professionals in the competencies required to deliver that care in the community setting.</p><p> GPs are obviously central to the provision of primary care in the community.  Ms Burke spoke about out-of-hours GP services.  We all know that GP services are under pressure because of financial constraints, the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act, etc.  Is she experiencing more difficulties in terms of provision of out-of-hours GP services?  That is a fundamental issue for the provision of care either in the home, or in nursing homes or long-term care facilities.</p><p> We all recognise the central role of the public health nurse in deciding what care is allocated to people.  It is very unfair to ask professionals, whose role is to care for and nurse people, to make administrative decisions over who gets care and who does not.  It is very unfair that public health nurses, who are visiting patients in the home setting, very often need to decide on the number of hours of home help, etc.  It is very difficult for those people whose primary focus is on the provision of health care to make administrative decisions on patients for whom they are caring.  They should be resourced to extend that whole issue.</p><p> Professor Walsh spoke about the acute hospital setting and then post-acute.  While he did not mention it, there is a pre-acute hospital setting.  We need to bolster what is available in the community setting so that when patients are diagnosed every effort is made to support them even in the early stages of malignant illnesses or dementia before they actually slip into the acute hospital setting.  Very often the resources are put in to get them out of the acute hospital setting in a hurry to free up a bed.  There seems to be no planning from diagnosis to entry to the acute hospital setting and then leaving the acute hospital to go back into the community or long-term care.  Is that something we need to consider?  Do we need a planned approach when a person is diagnosed with a terminal illness?  While it may be some time away does a patient plan need to be put in place?  Every effort should be made to prevent them going into the hospital as opposed to getting them out of the hospital when they are in the hospital.</p><p> Among medical professionals is there resistance to registered nurse prescribers or do we just not have enough nurse prescribers?  What is the difficulty in providing nurse prescribers with prescription pads if they are registered to prescribe?</p><p> On the consultant-led geriatric clinical teams, we have a scarcity of consultant geriatricians and in other specialties.  Do they ever visit nursing homes?  Is it possible to get in a consultant-led geriatrician team to carry out an assessment of patient profile and assistance in nursing homes or are they always referred back to the acute hospitals for assessment?</p></speech>

We need to do much better in this area and we need to expend resources given our ageing population.  Between 1996 and 2031 the number of people aged above 65 will have doubled and we need to make provision for that.</p><p>  Has the Prague charter for palliative care gone on to be recognised by major international bodies, including the World Health Organization?  Is it likely to become a charter to which state actors can become signatories?</p><p>  How many additional geriatricians would be required to address the shortfall?  It was stated that more training needs to be provided for community health nursing.  What type of additional training is necessary?  A point mentioned at the other hearings was the need for a stand-alone entity to deal with end-of-life and palliative care.  What form should such an entity take?</p><p>  Those working with people with Alzheimer's disease are heroic.  Everybody knows of somebody who suffers from Alzheimer's disease.  Mr. Martin said that many sufferers would wish to live their final days at home.  At last week's meetings there was a proposal for end-of-life-proof homes, as it were.  It is an interesting proposal.  Does he believe it might help people suffering from Alzheimer's disease?</p><p>  Professor Walsh spoke about a more effective use of resources in hospitals.  I ask him to expand on that.  How are resources currently misallocated?</p></speech>

I also thank them for the work they and their organisations are doing.  Deputy Kelleher spoke about nurses prescribing.  Nursing qualification has moved on and the vast majority of nurses now have an academic qualification.  We have made some changes by giving them extra duties.  What do we need to change to allow them to get into the area of prescribing?  Do we need to change legislation or is it just regulation?</p><p>  I presume individual nursing homes have their own arrangements with GPs.  Is it true that the level of care nursing homes require is not always being provided by the general practitioners in the immediate area?</p><p>  The organisation of step-down facilities is inadequate.  How can that be improved?</p><p>  The Nursing Homes Ireland report referred to the need for a 59% increase in the number of residential care facilities, which would equate to an additional 13,000 or 14,000 beds in coming years.  How can we deal with that?  Do we need to change focus by putting far more into home care packages, rather than trying to achieve a huge 59% increase in a very short period of time?</p></speech>

I do not claim to know much about this area.  It is something that nearly everybody will face.  Nine out of ten people will die gradually as opposed to suddenly.</p> <p>How does one distinguish between palliative care and assisted dying?  What is the process involved in informing families about clinicians' decisions to put relatives on palliative care?  Professor Walsh mentioned that palliative care specialists should have superior decision-making skills.</p><p> Ms Burke stated that we had no legislation on advanced care directives.  What does she have in mind?  Would a patient and-or family seeing a palliative care specialist always know that the patient was dying?  Would people have that capacity?</p><p> Professor Walsh mentioned that he had gained a great deal of experience in the UK.  He is probably familiar with the Liverpool Care Pathway for the Dying Patient, LCP, which has been controversial.  Will he critique it for the committee?  At many hospitals, more than 50% of patients who died had been placed on the pathway.  In one hospital's case, the proportion of foreseeable deaths on the pathway was almost nine out of ten.  It was as if the National Health Service had given financial inducements to put patients on the pathway to dying.  I am interested in the decision-making process.</p></speech>

I will address three short questions to Dr. Gregan.  In what ways could general practitioners, GPs, be supported to enhance their delivery of palliative care?  How could the Irish College of General Practitioners play a role?  His submission mentioned the issue of medical cards for people with terminal illnesses and limited prognoses.  Will he expand on the importance of that provision?  What problems has he encountered when such people need to renew their cards?</p><p>  I thank Ms Burke for her presentation.  I will cite the Minister for Health.  I am not a member of this committee, but I am interested in this subject and have been following it as a broadcaster, a writer and a Senator.  On 23 May, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, told the committee:<blockquote>My final point, which deserves to be made repeatedly, relates to the tendency in nursing homes in the past to refer patients who are dying to hospital emergency departments ... The tendency to transfer gravely ill residents to emergency departments seems to arise out of concerns and perhaps a lack of confidence in dealing with the terminally ill patient.  It is a dreadful tragedy and affliction for such people that the last hours of their life are spent in unfamiliar surroundings.  It is utterly inappropriate.  To address that issue, the Health Service Executive has begun, through its clinical programmes, sending specialist gerontologists out to nursing homes to support them in dealing with these situations, which are emotionally difficult for all concerned.  It is not in the interest of patients who are coming to the end of their days ... They should be allowed to see out their time [that is an interesting term] in the facilities that have become their homes while receiving all the proper care and attention they require.</blockquote>Are people inappropriately transferred from their homes in long-stay nursing homes to accident and emergency departments?  If so, what could be done to help staff to prevent this practice in addition to the clinical programme mentioned by the Minister?  When a resident dies in a nursing home, how does it cope with supporting other residents and staff?</p><p>  I thank Ms Tan of the Institute of Community Health Nursing, ICHN.  She stated that due cognisance should be given to the role of the public health nursing service across the disease trajectory, including end of life, alongside the specialist palliative care service.  Will she expand on this point and what further supports would be required from her colleagues who provide specialist palliative care to have the central role of the public health nurse in end of life care recognised?</p></speech>

Within five or ten years, there will be a serious debate on this topic.  Given his experience abroad, how does he believe that conversation will develop in society?  We can hide from it for as long as we want, but it must be faced, as it has been in other countries.  We know how the majority of society feels about the subject, but that will change within five to ten years.  Some of the reaction to individual cases has shifted radically in a short time.  Euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal in some states in the US and Europe.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-05a.1580" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Paul Gregan" time="17:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013110500007#F00500"><p>I will address a number of points.  Deputy Kelleher's comments on out-of-hours services were well made.  We have a large problem in how those services manage palliative care patients.  They do their best under stringent, difficult circumstances.  If one is in a house in the Kerry mountains at 2 a.m. trying to make a decision about a critically ill person who is not well enough to go anywhere, it is a difficult situation to manage.</p><p>  The programme with which we are involved has examined this matter.  We have considered two ways to help.  First, services can be provided with information prior to attending a patient by means of an electronic palliative care summary e-mailed to them via a secure health link.  Second, services can have access to a specialist palliative care physician via telephone, effectively providing a second pair of eyes to assist in making a decision.  Of further help would be education programmes for GPs who work in out-of-hours services.  Often, they are young and foreign.  The programmes would update them on local skills and requirements.</p><p>  Deputy McLellan asked about the Prague Charter.  It has not been assumed into World Health Organization, WHO, or UN charters.  It considers policy, the provision of essential medicines, training and the integration of the palliative care system.  Internationally, there has been a major push to have the charter adopted by the WHO.  However, it is still new and has not gained traction yet.</p><p>  The Deputy also asked about a stand-alone entity to consider the provision of palliative care in the community.  This would be a good development.  It would need to involve the interested parties, for example, the Irish Association of Palliative Care, IAPC, the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, IHCA, and the Irish Hospice Foundation, IHF.  Developing a group to act in an advisory capacity would be a good idea.</p><p>  Senator Healy Eames asked about assisted dying.  That is the polar opposite of what we in palliative medicine do.  Palliative medicine is about assisted living and managing one's ability to remain alive.</p><p>  The Senator also asked about informing the families of people undergoing palliative care.  Routinely, that information comes from the individual patient.  Most will be in a position to tell a palliative care physician whether they want their families to be informed.  In the absence of a person being able to give consent, a GP or consultant must make the decision <i>in loco parentis</i>.  However, it is good practice to keep a family up to speed with what is happening inasmuch as possible unless there is a specific direction from the patient prior to becoming ill not to do so.</p> <p> Senator O'Donnell asked about support for general practitioners.  The electronic palliative care summary is a good way of supporting general practice.  A practise-based register of patients who are undergoing palliative care would be very helpful.  We are trying to develop this idea.  Under the gold standards framework in the UK, consideration is being given to comprehensive co-ordination of people deteriorating and dying, which helps to prevent people being unnecessarily admitted to hospital.  </p><p> Education would also be helpful.  A question was asked earlier in regard to the Irish College of General Practitioners.  It provides education in this area.  I was a palliative care tutor with the Irish college of General Practitioners for four years.  The ICGP runs a course for GPs interested in this area.  It would be useful to get them involved in the out-of-hours area.  The issue of medical cards was also raised.  Medical cards have been a hugely positive thing for patients on the ground.  As palliative care physicians we often have to prognosticate and work out how long a person has to live.  If we feel a person will die within six months then he or she will qualify for the service.  However, we are not going to get it right every time.  Based on unpublished research we believe that approximately 20% of the time the six month period will be over-run.  We are currently running over by one or two months.  To ask a person within a month or two of dying to reapply for a medical card on a means test rather than discretionary basis is inhuman.  This has to change.</p></speech>

As stated by Dr. Gregan it is difficult to make a decision in the middle of the night about somebody who is dying.  Unfortunately, in some rural parts of Ireland it can take up to 40 minutes or one hour for a Caredoc to get to a facility, during which time the patient is in pain.  There is a need to ensure improved access to out-of-hours services and that people at end-of-life stage are treated by GPs with relevant experience in that area.  It might be useful to, as suggested by Dr. Gregan, develop a database in this regard.</p><p>  On the Deputy's question of whether there are sufficient trained prescribers, the answer is there are.  There are more than 700 nurse prescribers in Ireland, of which, unfortunately, only 440 are currently practising owing to difficulties in obtaining support in their hospitals.  There are only three nurse prescribers in private nursing homes in Ireland, of which I am one.  We can prescribe medication but we cannot have it reimbursed under the GMS system.  That is the difficulty that arises in the context of the prescription pad.  Nursing Homes Ireland, NHI, has lobbied on our behalf for access to such pads.</p></speech>

It has had a positive impact on patient care in that there is timely access to medication.  I am permitted to prescribe pain relief for people in nursing homes who are dying, which is very positive.  I am lucky in that a GP in the nursing home in which I work has given me permission to prescribe using his prescription pad.  Other nurse prescribers in Ireland do not have that luxury.  It is an issue that needs to be addressed.</p><p>  The Deputy also asked about consultant-led palliative care.  During my time in nursing homes I have never witnessed a visit by a palliative care consultant.  They do not visit.  Such visits would be welcomed.  It would assist in terms of greater communication with families.  Unfortunately, some GPs visit Monday to Friday and do not get to meet with or have discussions with families regarding end of life.  Communication and decision-making is the key to good end-of-life care.  Palliative care consultants are the speciality in this regard.</p><p>  Deputy McLellan asked me to outline the shortfalls in geriatricians.  Unfortunately, I do not have the statistics in that regard.  I do not know them.  Connolly Hospital in Dublin operates an excellent system whereby consulting geriatricians visit all the nursing homes attached to it, which prevents re-admission to the acute hospital.  The consultants hold regular team meetings and family meetings.  They also liaise with the palliative care teams to ensure multidisciplinary team decisions around care.  This service is not available in most other parts of the country.  It is a service that should be rolled out.  It would definitely prevent re-admission to acute hospitals.</p><p>  Senator Colm Burke also asked about nurse prescribers.  I have already answered that question.  On individual nursing homes and our arrangements with GPs, each resident is entitled to be treated by the GP he or she was attending prior to admission to the nursing home.  Some nursing homes have GPs attached, to whom they pay an annual fee.  In other cases, the GPs own the nursing homes so they get a very good service.  The nursing home in which I work is serviced by 14 different GPs.  It is difficult to have an equitable service of GPs for residents.  Some GPs are excellent and attend every three weeks.  Others attend only every three months.  The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, recommends that all residents are visited at least every three months.  There needs to be more equity in the GP service.  The Irish College of General Practitioners is working on this.  The chairperson of the committee looking into this is Dr. Tony Lee.  He is working on the development of a document which lists the various things which a GP must do during a visit.  This should help.</p><p>  On additional beds and whether the patients concerned could be cared for at home, unfortunately the dependency level of residents now being admitted to nursing homes is much greater than pre-fair deal.  Under the fair deal scheme patients must be assessed as requiring long-term care.  Therefore, the consultant geriatrician will not sign them off for long-term care if they can be cared for at home.  There is definitely a deficit in the beds available.  Nursing homes all over the country have waiting lists.  As I said earlier, some of the people on these waiting lists are in receipt of palliative care and, often, some die before a bed becomes available.  A big issue that has arisen in the context of the establishment of more nursing home beds is what the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, pays under the fair deal scheme to nursing homes.  There is no encouragement for new providers to set up nursing homes because they will not get the rate of pay that is required for the provision of care, in particular at end of life.  HIQA standards recommend the provision of additional care at end of life.  Where a resident in a nursing home is dying this may require an additional nurse at night to care for that resident, which requires additional funding.  This is not catered for in the fair deal amount provided.  The shortfall between what the NTPF pays for the cost of care and the standard and quality of care which nursing homes want to provide needs to be looked at.  Nursing Home Ireland has a number of times recommended the development of a forum with the key stakeholders, including HIQA, the HSE, Nursing Home Ireland, to work on the key issues.  We want to provide an excellent standard of care but are unfortunately prevented from doing so because of financial constraints.</p><p>  I thank Senator Healy Eames for her questions.  On the issue of there being no advanced care directive legislation in Ireland, currently we have the "Let me Decide" and "Thinking Ahead" forms, which allow people when unwell to make decisions in regard to what care they want to receive.  Unfortunately, these are not covered by legislation.  As such, how legally binding such documents would be at end of life is uncertain.  There is a need for legislation in this regard.  Another issue that arises in the context of advanced care directives is that what a person wants now in terms of end of life care could differ from what he or she would require in 20 years.  This means these documents will need to be updated and reviewed.</p> <p>A person may enter a nursing home and in six months time his or her health may have deteriorated due to dementia, for example.  Therefore, a decision taken six months ago can be very different from what is needed now.  Also, advanced care directives requires a huge amount of education and support for staff, GPs and nurses.  </p><p> Senator O'Donnell mentioned that the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, had spoken about dying patients going to accident and emergency units.  That does happen, but the situation has improved immensely.  We have got much better at talking about end-of-life care and how decisions are made.  We can give a diagnosis that a person is dying.  There are more communications with families around the issue of dying.  We are now confident enough to say to a person's family that if their loved one goes into an acute hospital he or she may pass away on a trolley in an accident and emergency unit.  We ask the families if they would prefer to have their loved one die in a nursing home with staff who know them, thus allowing them to die with dignity and respect.  Communication with families and residents on end-of-life wishes has improved and we are not transferring as many people to accident and emergency units.  I have seen a great reduction in the number of patients to whom this happens.</p><p> We must be grateful to HIQA for its standards and new end-of-life thematic inspections.  It has recommended that we have end-of-life discussions with every resident.  We can compile a document on what a person wants so that things are much clearer.  Thankfully, not as many people are ending up in hospital.  There may be a difficult family who want everything done for their 99 year old mother and feel that she should be transferred to hospital.  Those wishes must be respected.</p></speech>

Some people may have resided in a nursing home for seven or eight years, so staff will have known them very well.  The staff may know the residents as well as their own grandparents and may have grown quite attached to them .  We all sit down and have tea and cake.  Then we discuss the care provided to the person to see if we could have improved their care or done anything better.  The meeting gives people an opportunity to vent their feelings and talk.  For residents, we have arranged a weekly visit by ministers of the Eucharist with holy communion so that they can pray for the person who has passed away.  I also talk to the residents, because some of them may have been very good friends with the deceased and sat beside him or her in the day room on a daily basis.  Every November we have an annual mass of remembrance for people who pass away during the year.  It is an opportunity for the families to return to the nursing home and meet us again.</p></speech>

A public health nurse is well positioned to assess a patient and decide what care is required and who is best placed to provide same.  In most cases, he or she does not make the decision on how much care and time will be provided.  That decision is made by the HSE administrator.</p><p>  From a public health nurse point of view, there is a need for more funding in the area and for public health nurses to have more say in where the funding goes and its prioritisation, particularly for palliative care patients.</p></speech>

That was the point made by the Deputy.</p><p>  Deputy Sandra McLellan asked what type of training should be provided to public health nurses working in the community.  Two types of nurse work in the community: the community registered general nurse and the public health nurse.  One could say there are three types if one includes the specialist palliative care nurse.</p><p>  There are many different education programmes available.  I feel that a multidisciplinary approach to education is greatly needed.  It is something we are considering as time moves on.</p><p>  Earlier we talked about decision-making in palliative care.  A multidisciplinary approach is required, but it can only be done through people knowing and understanding how to do the work.  They need to know how to make such decisions and to communicate in a multidisciplinary fashion.</p><p>  There is a need for carers at all levels to have a better understanding of palliative care and how to communicate within the sector.  They need to know how to communicate with patients and convey their needs and wishes to others on the palliative team.  There is a higher award in palliative care but there are many different higher education courses available, both formal and informal.  Specialist services also play a role in providing education for the general services, either by the community nurse or on a one-to-one basis in a practical situation during a public heath nurse visit.  Centres of nursing education also provide educational training.  The important thing is that we operate in a multidisciplinary fashion. </p><p>  Senator O'Donnell mentioned that due cognisance must be taken of the role played by the public health nurse.  She also asked what help and support is provided by my colleagues who work in specialist palliative care.  For many years the specialist palliative care services developed in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner.  The roles of most of the community specialist palliative care nurses developed, in years gone by, through the hospice home care services.  Now, more nurses with a background in either oncology nursing or hospice units are joining the service.  They have a different approach and a different take on how to provide support to people in the community.  The specialist palliative care nurses should act as our role model and bring their knowledge and expertise to us.  They can help and guide us.  That would give us the confidence to be competent in what we do.  That can be achieved by providing support and education on a one-to-one basis in a practical situation.</p></speech>

She also mentioned end-of-life-proof homes, but I am not 100% familiar with the concept.</p><p>  Today I shall reflect the views of people with dementia and their carers.  More than a year ago the Alzheimer Society of Ireland set up a working group of people with dementia who meet on a regular basis to influence our services and policies.  It is the clear desire of people with dementia and their carers to be supported and allowed to remain at home for as long as possible, up to and including the end of life.  That is their expressed wish.  In the context of dementia, the home setting is always the best setting.  I do not underestimate the intervention and support that carers need to achieve that goal.  It must be right along the trajectory, from diagnosis onwards, rather than in the form of intervention at a crisis moment.  It is a clear desire of people with dementia to remain at home until the end of their lives, if possible.</p><p>  Deputy Kelleher touched on resources.  He also touched on the importance of better planning of resources, which can produce better results.  A lot of resources are being spent in the area, but I shall concentrate on dementia.  In the society's budget submission, for example, we estimated that 15,000 people with dementia live in residential settings at present.  We could reduce that number with better early interventions.</p> <p>If we could reduce it by 10%, we could save &euro;73 million per annum.  A significant amount of resources has been dedicated to this area.  As the Deputy mentioned, we could use the money more wisely with better planning and early interventions.  It will be less expensive if we focus on early intervention.</p></speech>

Real leadership and accountability are needed if that is to be achieved.  While there is broad agreement in that regard, we face a challenge if we are to succeed.</p></speech>

Significant resources are being spent in this area.  We argue that they are being spent at the expensive end - the crisis end - whereas a better result could be achieved if there were better planning and early intervention.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-05a.1622" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Declan Walsh" time="18:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013110500010#J00700"><p>I would like to respond to what Deputy Billy Kelleher said on the subject of pre-hospital care.  In the case of a person who has been diagnosed with a chronic incurable illness, it comes back to the concept of having a defined plan of care agreed with the patient and the family.  The plan of care should reflect the patient's wishes.  The patient's care should be co-ordinated between the acute system and the community or post-acute system.  In many cases, when somebody goes into hospital for a few days before going out into the community, these are random events, with no continuity of care and a lack of good communication between locations.  The current evidence from the United States suggests earlier involvement of palliative care services reduces the average length of hospital stay and the likelihood of readmission to hospital.  It is at the interface with community nursing homes that we can make sure the patient stays where he or she is best cared for.  If he or she really needs to be in hospital, well and good.  It is important that he or she should not have to go there because of some unanticipated crisis.</p><p>  There is a continuing debate about the resources issue.  If one has &euro;100 to spend in a hospital, should one spend it on palliative care or intensive care beds, for example?  We are not going to resolve that issue today.  There is good evidence to support the general understanding that better resource allocation in hospitals will feed into the achievement of a better plan of care, thereby leading to earlier discharge from hospital and freeing up hospital beds for those who really need to be in hospital.  This, in turn, will reduce the cost of care which is extremely expensive, as members will be aware.</p><p>  The move towards seeing palliative care as a universal right has been addressed.  The European Association for Palliative Care has issued its Prague declaration.  All the signs are that this will move ahead through the World Health Organization, which we would all welcome.</p><p>  I was also asked about the relationship with assisted dying.  This is a very complicated issue and I suppose the short answer is to say the focus in palliative care and medicine is on the relief of symptoms.  There is a minority of people who have intractable symptoms.  In some of these cases, the people in question need to be sedated.  This means that they are given drugs, or doses of medication, that render them unconscious.  The objective is not to kill the person but to give him or her whatever medication he or she needs to relieve his or her distress.  There is an important distinction.  While it could be the case that these doses of medication might cause a person to die, the focus is on the therapy aimed at relieving whatever distress he or she is suffering.  There is no question of somebody who is not suffering to any great degree being approached by a person with a dose of medication saying, "Now we are going to end your life."  That is the distinction.</p><p>  Most people who have worked in this field feel very uncomfortable about the manner in which the assisted dying debate is presented.  The short way of putting it is that hard cases can make bad law.  I have been working in the field for 30 years and the biggest issue I have had to deal with in that time is not that people want to die.  People want to continue to live; that has been the overwhelming desire of nearly everybody I have seen in my professional career.  One sometimes tries to persuade them to receive less medical care and fewer medical services.  People will hold on to life with a grim determination.  These issues need to be presented in a balanced way.</p><p>  I am in favour of the Liverpool care pathway.  I like pathways.  I think it comes back to the issue of continuity of care.  There should be a plan of care for each person.  The Liverpool care pathway has run into problems because there has been a somewhat over-zealous application of some aspects of it.  In addition, there have been some issues with the training of the staff expected to implement it.  The devil is in the detail, as it is in many aspects of life.  One might know what something looks like, but when one goes to put it down on paper, it becomes very black and white and may be open to misinterpretation.  There is certainly an issue in that regard.</p><p>  Advance directives are now mandatory in the United States.  Every patient who comes into a hospital must have an advance directive.  As a matter of routine, every patient must be asked about his or her wishes in that regard.</p></speech>

Certainly, my experience has been that when it is decided a person is, in fact, dying and that a certain series of interventions or measures is needed to ensure his or her comfort as he or she dies, the family is consulted in advance.</p></speech>

It is inevitable that the public debate on this subject will increase.  The rapid ageing of the population in many countries is forcing the debate.  As I said, most of the people who work in this field have concerns about the way the debate is presented.  They are concerned about how it is playing out.  When vulnerable elderly people are going into hospital, they might believe someone is going to kill them.  There are serious concerns in that regard.</p> <p>It is important to emphasise that everyone who is very ill should know for sure that they are going to have access, either in the community or the hospital setting, to high quality palliative care.  If they have such access then with the provision and continuity of care I believe many of the difficult challenges we face could be significantly ameliorated.  Anyway, the debate will continue; there is no question about it.</p></speech>

However, it is certainly true that some of the interventions can be pharmacological.  Some medicines can help and have been shown to help and, if not to cure, then at least to slow down the prognosis of the disease.  Equally, some interventions on a more social basis have also been shown to have a major impact on delaying the progression of disease, for example, keeping people engaged and exercised, etc., not least supporting their own carers.  There can be a mix and certainly there is no up-to-date advance in terms of medication but I would not rule out the importance of people having it included in terms of a timely diagnosis.</p></speech>

It is very difficult in many cases.  We have to wait until someone else dies and their hours become available.  However, we continue to lobby our line manager until those hours become available to us and then we transfer them over to our patient.  That is the only way we can do it.  If the hours are not there, they are not there.</p></speech>

Their contributions will be a valuable and critical source in the compilation of our report as well as the substantive papers we have received.  I realise it is difficult to encapsulate everything they might want to say into five minutes of a presentation but I thank them none the less.</p><p>  I remind people that in addition to our public hearings we are also seeking submissions from the public, interested parties, organisations and stakeholders.  The closing date for receipt of written submissions is Tuesday, 19 November.  Further details are available on the Oireachtas website and the health committee webpage.  If anyone in the Public Gallery is interested in making written submissions, the details are available through the Oireachtas website and the closing date is 19 November.  At the next meeting we will continue this series of hearings on this important and sensitive topic.</p></speech>
