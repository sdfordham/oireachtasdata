    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-30a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1103" speakername="Andrew Doyle" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015093000002#C00200"><p>I welcome the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and his officials.  We just had a discussion, which delayed us a little, about the nature and structure of the whole system under consideration here.  I think there is general frustration among the members of the committee with the way the performance indicators, as they are currently outlined, work - or do not work.</p> <p>  Due to the limited time, rather than go into session 1 we will move straight to part 2, the opening statement from the Minister.  At the end of the meeting, the committee will make a report on the outcome of the deliberations and lay it before both Houses, as well as circulating it to the working group of chairmen.  We would like to see if we can find a way for the Departments, the committee secretariat and the liaison group to come up with a more workable formula.  We have been shown a model based on the New Zealand model, which may represent best practice.  Perhaps that could be further developed.</p> <p>  As it is, there is frustration with how the indicators are laid out.  For example, the projections mention Origin Green, but it is not clear how that manifests itself as a benefit to the Department.  Bord Bia takes care of it.  Will it result in a better outcome for the agri-sector?  In the same way, the enactment of the consumer and competition Bill is mentioned, although this Department is not directly responsible for it.  At the same time, it is clear that, if implemented and enforced, the Bill would give tools to the relevant authority which should benefit the agriculture sector.  When a target is given without explanation, it seems a little bit vague and people have to pick up on it.</p></speech>

Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I invite the Minister to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-30a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015093000002#D00700"><p>Today I will also attend a meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality to discuss the mid-year Estimates, where we will go through the same process.  We have used the committee system to introduce better performance measurement and management tools in order to ensure there is more transparency around how Departments perform.  Their performance can be tested in committee.  This committee's secretariat has done a good job by putting a paper together which contains constructive criticism.  It deals with the Department's measurements and its internal processes, but claims that the generalised statements do not give committees enough details to get stuck into in terms of compiling questions.  I accept that claim to a certain extent.  It is important that we respond to some of the criticisms.  People now apply the New Zealand model to what happens in Ireland.  People want to know why we cannot do things like New Zealand.  There are a lot of good things in the New Zealand model, but that country faces different challenges from Ireland.  For example, half of the expenditure that comes through my Department is EU money, and there is a whole series of requirements to go along with that funding, such as inspections and audit systems.  Ireland is assessed regularly throughout the year, in a very detailed way, by the European Commission.  It ensures that our systems are robust, analyses how we spend the money and assesses whether we get value for money.  If we fail in any of those measurements we get significant disallowances.  New Zealand faces none of that because it does not have a Common Agricultural Policy.</p> <p>  A big part of our performance indicators are audited by the European Commission, which spends well over &euro;1 billion through my Department each year.  There are very tight control and monitoring systems that we are obliged, through the legal regulations of CAP, to deliver on, and we cannot just ignore all of that.  When we talk about a wish to deliver control and inspection programmes to underpin the protection of funds and their timely delivery, the committee secretariat says that is an example of our supplying information that is vague or is not definitive in terms of targets.  The targets that are set for us have been set down in regulations and they are absolutely definitive.  The Department is not perfect but there are a lot of good things happenings, in terms of performance indicators, that we need to apply, particularly with regard to EU moneys that are spent.</p> <p>  There is no other Department - apart perhaps from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, through its Action Plan for Jobs programme - that is more focused on long-term and medium-term target setting, delivering on these targets in terms of deliverables and recommendations, and measuring them on a monthly, never mind an annual basis, than the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p> <p>  Every year my Department publishes a report entitled Milestones for Success.  Earlier, the Chairman mentioned Origin Green and the sustainability journey.  My Department writes a full report every year which, to my knowledge, has never been debated by this committee.  That situation is a reflection on us.  Perhaps we should have brought it in here.  The Milestones for Success reports are published every year; they are in the media every year, and we launch them.  A huge amount of work goes into compiling them.  It is a fair criticism by the committee that we have not debated those reports here, because they are actual deliverables that we need to get across the line, and those in the industry are involved in that as well.  </p> <p>  We have a plan, Food Harvest 2020, that was put together by the last government, to its credit, which contains 215 recommendations that needed to be acted upon and completed.  There is now a report that measures our outputs in terms of those recommendations.  I do not see the same thing happening in New Zealand.  We now have a Food Wise 2025 programme which has 386 recommendations.  I chair a monthly meeting with all of the stakeholders, which included, in the past, an implementation group for Food Harvest and now includes the same for Food Wise.  We had a meeting this morning where we went through the recommendations and identified who was responsible for all of them.  Four key agencies are responsible: BIM, Bord Bia, Teagasc and Enterprise Ireland.  As chairman of the stakeholders' group, I point the figure and say to people, "Who takes responsibility for X, Y and Z?".  I ask when will they be delivered on and say, "Let us assess as we go along."  To be fair, this committee should be involved in some of those discussions a little bit more than heretofore.   I accept the criticism, if it is one, that we have not been more open about setting targets.  There are 23 items in an Action Plan for Jobs that we need to finalise.  I can assure the committee that the Taoiseach will point his finger at me if we do not get those things done.</p> <p>  I accept that we can improve.  I accept that we need lean management systems across all Departments which insist on continuous improvement and allow committees such as this one to benchmark performance, under whatever performance indicators we agree on, so that we can show we are improving year on year.  If we do not improve then the committee must ask us hard questions that we must answer.  </p> <p>  The suggestion that we have tried to avoid setting targets and deliverables is an unfair criticism.  It may be a fair criticism to claim that we have not introduced targets and deliverables to the discussions that we are having with the committee.  I am anxious to work with the committee on this matter.  If we can improve how the Department measures its output, I am confident that we will score pretty well.  The New Zealand model is relevant and there are elements of it that we should do more of here.  We have also done other things very well, and we should not pretend that has not happened.  That is the only comment I want to make on the matter.  I am open to making the Secretary General and anyone else in my Department available to the committee and its secretariat so that we can all work together to improve things for next year.</p></speech>

It is the process of accountability to this Oireachtas for the money that is given by the Oireachtas to Ministers to spend.  It is unreasonable for the Department to expect Deputies and Senators to get all of this information from all the various documents and create a parallel set of indicators.  From what the Minister has said, the Department has much more definitive indicators in all sorts of other accountancy systems, but it shares them with the Oireachtas in a direct manner.  In other words, they are not written in the Book of Estimates.  Let us look at the information we got this week.  All of the subheads used to be published in the Revised Estimates, but this week, for example, we got a breakdown of REPS, the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, GLAS, etc. under a heading of "Agri-environment schemes."  We are in the last day of the ninth month, but we got a breakdown that used to be published in the Revised Estimates.</p></speech>

It is fine to say it is here and there but the Minister will know from being a backbencher previously what is involved in terms of resources to start going to this and that website and so on.  I believe it should all be in one place and easily accessible for us to do our work.  I believe that through interaction with senior officials in the Department we could come up with a far more efficient way of doing our business.</p></speech>

I think there is agreement.  Perhaps the monthly milestones could be discussed with the Department officials without having to wait for the Minister to be available to discuss the performance indicators.  Similarly, with Food Wise 2025 and the implementation groups, perhaps we could get a periodic report on how implementation is working across the sectors.  That might be useful for the committee because it would represent an overview.  After that, we can get down to the money end of it.  Anyway, we need to get at it earlier, unfortunately.  The fact that the budget has been brought forward two months has not helped the process either.</p> <p>  I have to suspend the meeting because another vote has been called in the House.  Perhaps we can get agreement after the vote.  There are four Government Deputies and one Opposition Deputy at the moment.  If we had two more Opposition Deputies we could have agreed to move on.  However, we cannot get agreement and we have not spoken to the Whips.</p></speech>

This is a valuable opportunity to review how we are progressing with the various challenges and opportunities presented across the various sectors in agriculture, food development, marine and forestry and to talk about market prospects across these areas and new investment opportunities for the coming year.</p><p>The agrifood sector continues to play a considerable role in our economic recovery.  The sector remains Ireland&rsquo;s largest indigenous industry and accounts for almost one in nine jobs, many in rural and coastal areas where few other employment opportunities exist.  Earlier this year Bord Bia confirmed a fifth consecutive year of growth in agrifood exports.  The value of Ireland&rsquo;s food and drink exports grew by some 4% during 2014 and reached almost &euro;10.5 billion, which is another all-time high.  That is some &euro;3.2 billion higher than in 2009, representing an increase of more than 45% in that period.</p><p>In July the Taoiseach launched a very important plan for a new ten-year strategy for the agrifood sector, aptly named Food Wise 2025.  Food Wise 2025 predicts that over the next decade Ireland can: increase the value of agrifood exports by 85% to &euro;19 billion; increase value added to the sector by 70% to &euro;13 billion; and increase the value of primary production by 65% to &euro;10 billion.  This should deliver a further 23,000 jobs in the agrifood sector by 2025 and will present many challenges for us to face.  I think that prediction of 23,000 jobs is quite conservative.</p><p>In April this year the milk quota system ended and opened up opportunities and sustainable growth for the dairy sector for the years ahead.  Nationally, we can conservatively predict that the next five years of dairy expansion will deliver approximately 10,000 new jobs across rural Ireland.  Ireland&rsquo;s plan for a 50% increase in milk volume in five years is unmatched in the EU; other member states expect no more than 20% extra milk.  Almost simultaneously with the ending of the quotas, a number of factors, including a Russian ban, reduced demand for dairy product and increased stocks and production in China have resulted in significant downward pressure on dairy prices.  I think we are all familiar with that.  This is putting significant pressure on farmers.  It is a global issue but it is also very much an Irish issue and it is not possible to address to it in isolation here in Ireland.  I am engaging on a continuous basis with EU counterparts and the Commission to ensure that every possible measure is taken at EU level to mitigate the effects of the current situation.  </p><p>The key measure recently given effect by the Commission is the facilitation of advance payments of 70% under the direct payments scheme and 85% for rural development schemes before completion of controls.  In other words, &euro;750 million will given out next month on 16 October, which would not, or certainly that amount of money would not, have been given out but for that advance payment.  This will be of significant benefit in terms of easing the cashflow of farmers. </p><p>Furthermore, the European Commission announced earlier this month that it is providing a &euro;420 million direct aid package for European farmers.  Ireland&rsquo;s share of this fund will amount to just under &euro;14 million.  Among other measures announced, the increase of more than 100% in the rate of private storage aid for skimmed milk powder is very significant, as well as storage aid for cheese.  We had our first meeting of the dairy forum yesterday and I was very blunt and forthright with the farming organisations in terms of trying to get some feedback from them as to how they wanted us to spend that direct income support for farmers.  I agree with them that we should look at basing our distribution model on flat-rate payments, which, I think, will positively discriminate in favour of smaller farmers.  That would be a good thing to do.  It is not a huge amount of money but it will help cashflow for many dairy farm families.  We need to separately allocate some money for the pig sector as well and we will probably give some priority to young farmers by way of some percentage top-up in terms of those flat-rate payments as well.  I would be interested in people's views on that approach.  We have not finalised any decisions.</p><p>I can assure members that I will continue to work with the industry, other member states and farming organisations to consider how we can refine and improve mechanisms to help farmers to cope with downward price cycles when they arise.  We spent a good deal of time yesterday talking about price volatility.</p><p>Today&rsquo;s meeting will allow us to look back over the year to date, look at the remainder of the year and, as we are now close to budget 2016, it will allow me to get some feedback from the members and to take questions from them in that regard.  In the financial data we have supplied, we have tried to tie the financials and the outputs together in the briefing and I am happy to elaborate on any elements the members may wish to discuss.  This year the Exchequer contribution to the Vote of my Department amounted to &euro;1.26 billion, &euro;1.044 billion in current expenditure<b></b>and &euro;216 million capital expenditure<b>.</b>This represents an overall increase of &euro;41 million over last year&rsquo;s figures and is the first time my Department&rsquo;s budget has increased since 2009.  Expenditure so far this year is in line with profiles and it is expected that this will continue over the remaining quarter.</p><p>My overarching priority for 2015 has been to deliver the first part of the Government&rsquo;s commitments to the farming and fishing sectors in the commencement of actions under the new rural development and seafood development programmes.  These supports prioritise vulnerable sectors and support the incomes of family farms.  Overall, I secured &euro;439 million for investment in the rural development programme, up from &euro;405 million in 2014.  Schemes under the new rural development scheme, including the green low-carbon argi-environment scheme, GLAS, the beef data and genomics scheme, TAMS II and areas of natural constraint, ANC, are up and running, and I am pleased that, despite an additional two weeks allowed for application, &euro;114 million of ANC payments issued to farmers last week.</p><p>Next month will see payments under agri-environment schemes begin to issue.  This year &euro;155 million worth of payments will issue to 17,000 rural environment protection scheme farmers, closing out that important scheme, 19,000 farmers under the agri-environment options scheme and to up to 26,000 farmers under the new GLAS.  This scheme, when fully open, will support up to 50,000 farmers and require funding of &euro;250 million.  It will build on the success of these earlier programmes and encourage farmers to farm in an environmentally friendly manner.</p><p>The total allocation for the various on-farm schemes planned under TAMS II is &euro;395 million over the course of the rural development programme.  For 2015, I allocated &euro;34 million of grants under TAMS, which represents a 100% increase on the 2014 budget.  This provides for final payments on TAMS I, new schemes under TAMS II as well as a new farm safety scheme, which, unfortunately, we are reminded again today is extremely important.  I recently extended the period for receipt of applications under TAMS I and the farm safety scheme by two weeks and I am pleased that this additional period of time allowed many farmers to submit applications for finished projects.  Officials in my Department are working on those applications now with a view to processing payments for issue over the coming months.</p><p>In August I announced the opening of a new TAMS II scheme for pig and poultry investments and recently opened two more new TAMS II schemes.  One is the animal welfare, safety and nutrient storage scheme and the second one is the low emission slurry spreading scheme, or LESS as it is known now.  The benefits of the schemes range from the construction of new animal housing, the provision of nutrient storage facilities and the ever important safety elements to a more sustainably-friendly approach to the spreading of slurry, with knock-on benefits for Ireland&rsquo;s ammonia and climate targets. </p><p>As members will know, 2014 was a year when tragedy struck too many Irish farm families.  Conscious of the loss of life and injuries sustained on farms in recent years, particularly during 2014, I opened a farm safety scheme in October of last year.  Following on from the demand from the farm safety scheme, which saw applications from over 6,000 farmers, I was pleased to be able to relaunch the safety component of this new scheme - the animal welfare, safety and nutrient storage scheme.  This will give all farmers an opportunity to assess what can be done on their farms to improve safety and save lives, we hope, on family farms.  I am determined to do everything possible to reduce the tragic accidents that we have seen on farms, particularly in the past 18 months or so.  Unfortunately, I think, the figure so far this year is 14.</p><p>There is a family grieving as we speak.  </p><p> As the beef industry experienced a very difficult year in 2014 I was conscious of the need to give particular priority to providing the level of support that can contribute to restoring confidence in the sector.  I was pleased that we were in a position to fund support measures worth in excess of &euro;83 million.  The cornerstone of this support package is a significant increase in the funding allocated to the new beef data and genomics programme from &euro;23 million to &euro;52 million.  This 126% increase will place Ireland at the international forefront of genetic improvement in beef and will make an important contribution to improving the carbon efficiency of Irish production.  Payments under this scheme will issue to participating farmers later this this year.  There are just under 30,000 farmers in that scheme.  </p><p> I also prioritised innovation as part of the smart agenda through a substantial fund for research and development and training amounting to &euro;28 million under FIRM, Stimulus and forestry funds and Teagasc training courses.  The new call for research proposals will shortly issue.</p><p> The allocation of almost &euro;147 million for Ireland under the new European maritime and fisheries fund is significant for the sector.  In aggregate terms this represents a doubling of Ireland's allocation of EU funds relative to our allocations under the former European fisheries and EU financial instruments for sea fisheries control and data collection.  </p><p> The Department has prepared a new operational programme in consultation with the industry which has been submitted for approval by the European Commission.  The new and substantially improved allocation of funds, combined with more than &euro;90 million of national co-funding, will enable me to launch new schemes under the seafood development programme aimed at driving investment in fisheries and seafood development to 2020 and securing the future of the marine sector.  </p><p> Taking account of the fact that the Irish bloodstock industry is of enormous economic benefit to this country - we saw that in terms of sales yesterday - I increased State support for the horse and greyhound industry by &euro;14 million to &euro;68 million last year.  It has been estimated that the industry provides in excess of 14,000 jobs, approximately &euro;1.1 billion in economic output and is responsible for exports worth in excess of &euro;200 million.  The increase in State support for both industries is a recognition of a significant shortfall in funding going into the horse and greyhound sectors in recent years as a result of a downturn in the economy.</p><p> Budget 2015 saw a suite of taxation measures designed to support modernisation, restructuring and the promotion of growth and expansion.   The tax package which was worth about &euro;300 million to the farming community, was largely negotiated and put in place by the person on my left, who did a fantastic job on it with the Department of Finance.  Overall, 2015 has been a challenging year.  We have had to develop and launch the new basic payment scheme which will see some &euro;1.2 billion of funding issued to Irish farmers, 70% of this will be issued in mid-October, recognising the difficulties farmers are currently experiencing.  Many countries in the European Union cannot make those advance payments because they do not have the systems in place to do that on time.  It is a recognition of how robust our systems are that with a few weeks notice a decision can be made for 70% advance payment and we can make it happen.  I hope we will deliver that on time with the full amount of money involved. </p><p> We have also had to develop and open new schemes under the rural development programme.  Opportunities following the abolition of quotas were undermined by the downturn in world demand for dairy and the Russian trade embargo and have required a swift EU response to put in place supports.  I remain confident in the future for dairy in Ireland in the medium to long term.  We are already seeing signals that the market is starting to turn.</p><p> The Government remains committed to agriculture and the marine sectors.  I am determined through the Department's initiatives, schemes and programmes to continue to support and develop these important pillars of Irish society and of the Irish economy.</p></speech>

The Minister said the value of Ireland's food and drink exports grew by 4% during 2014 and was &euro;3.2 billion higher than 2009.  Perhaps he would develop on that theme.  Was that caused by volume or price increases?  The second issue is germane to this debate.  What policy decisions, particularly those in regard to expenditure, had most effect in increasing the value?  If we knew that, we could then put more money towards those particular policies.  The Minister mentioned a massive increase in dairying, 50% in volume.  Will this be achieved by getting more milk from the same number of hectares or by people swapping land usage to dairying from other farming activities?  Has any analysis been carried out by the Department on the possible impact of this on other sectors of the farming economy?  The upside is obvious but the downside needs to be looked at if there is to be a massive shift of land usage.  Given that 85% of rural development schemes are being paid out this year, will that affect the Estimates with 100% of the money on the RDP being paid between now and the end of the year?  I have one other question.  An interesting document was published yesterday, Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016-2021.  It provides, in a table on page 21, the agriculture, food and the marine Exchequer capital envelope 2016-2021, &euro;198 million;  2016 - &euro;217 million; 2017 - &euro;208 million; 2018 - &euro;208 million, 2019 - &euro;208 million; 2020 - &euro;208 million; and 2021 - &euro;208 million.</p></speech>

Presumably there is quite an amount of detail.  For example, the names of piers have been mentioned down to that kind of micro detail.

How many people are participating in GLAS this year?  Does the Minister expect that payments will be made under the GLAS scheme by the end of the year?</p> <p>  We discussed beef genomics earlier.  I welcome the fact that approximately 30,000 farmers are in that scheme.  The only downturn I see from my discussions with farmers is that when they have made all the payments for testing and so on, the size of the payment they receives is quite small, it is &euro;60 to &euro;70.  Is there a possibility of increasing that figure to &euro;100 or &euro;150?</p></speech>

Without agriculture and the agri-industry, rural areas would be decimated because IDA Ireland and other bodies have washed their hands of rural areas.  We must continue to invest.  It is far more productive when spending penetrates down into rural communities, helping to retain rural businesses.</p> <p>  In respect of GLAS and AEOS will the &euro;250 million be allocated in 2016 to ensure payment in full to all GLAS and AEOS participants?  The TAMS has been a success with &euro;34 million disbursed last year.  Does he anticipate that sum will be increased in the budget?  The Minister opened two new schemes and the payment is very important in that context.</p> <p>  In the area of knowledge transfer, I read somewhere about administrative and indemnity issues in relation to the operation of the scheme with Teagasc.  Has that been sorted out?  I anticipate that will be ironed out and the revenue issues will be sorted so that the Teagasc personnel are not put at a disadvantage.</p> <p>  I am unequivocal in my support for the beef data genomics programme.  It is absolutely critical to the beef industry.  Some time ago the Minister indicated that he would meet the farm organisations.  Perhaps he and his officials would meet the farm organisation to iron out some teething problems.  Clarification is required.  One hears daily about people wanting to leave the scheme, but that is foolhardy and I urge them to reconsider and stay within the scheme.  I see significant potential in that scheme.  It is important that the Minister goes into a room with the farm organisations and clarifies matters for them.</p> <p>  The comprehensive review of agri-taxation issues is worth &euro;300 million a year.  This is very welcome.  This is targeted to increase land mobility and restructuring.  Farmers like many who are self employed are being treated inequitably in the taxation system, because a self employed person is entitled to a self employed income tax credit equivalent to that available to the PAYE sector.  I ask the Minister to beseech his colleagues, the Minister for Finance to ensure that it is given to self employed and farmers in particular.  It is very important to bring equity and equality within the taxation treatment of individuals.  Farmers are no different and it would be very important to them, especially for farmers on low incomes.</p> <p>  There is the issue of income averaging in terms of those who derive an income from forestry.  The income generation is up and down.  That is extremely important.  I urge that this be brought into play immediately.  </p></speech>

I have a specific question regarding the beef data scheme.  Prior to the commencement of the scheme there was a great deal of talk that the figure of 30,000 members who had been predicted to enter the scheme, would not be reached.  What is the final cut-off point?  Are the people who are in the scheme in it and is there a point of no return?  Is there a sense that farmers are looking to withdraw from the scheme?</p></speech>

The China Racing Club paid the top price of &euro;1.7 million for a yearling bred by a Cork man who started with nothing and now owns the Alexander Hotel, the Davenport and a farm in County Kildare.  The horse has come to be broken here in Ireland.  It is excellent that the people in China want that amazingly valuable animal to be broken-in in Ireland.  That is a great success story and I thank the Minister for supporting the industry.</p> <p>  I really welcome the Origin Green programme by Bord Bia in which I participate.  It must continue to be supported in a great way.  We deal with the multiples in America, Europe and Scandinavia, - we are off to Norway next week - but they will not deal with us in the future unless we have a visionary sustainable programme for our little food company.

There is a general point on the output which is not directly related to budget but perhaps will be, cognisant of the ongoing climate change obligations, that is our output increase and current output to which land mitigation is factored in so that we do not face huge penalty or curtailment.  The next point is particularly relevant in my area, which is that TB is still an ongoing issue.  While the number of animals has decreased the incidence in herds is static at best, if not increasing.  There is an issue with regard to dairy farmers, and I am not a dairy farmer, for income compensation which is quite low per animal and is limited to a limited number of animals.</p> <p>  I will ask the Minister to answer these questions before we go around again.</p></speech>

We have increased our exports to France by 21%; to the Netherlands by 43%; to Germany by 34%; to Belgium by 23%; to Sweden by 15%; to Denmark by 43%; and to Poland by 72%.  One or two member states, Italy and Spain are down a bit in value.  The growth in food export to the UK is up by 24% in value.  One the things that is really adding to our numbers this year, despite the fact that dairy prices are down, and dairy is the most valuable export followed very tightly by beef, is the exchange rates.  When sterling is as strong as it is against the euro, it makes Irish product very good value in terms of competitiveness.  One will see many of our suppliers into UK retailers will be upping their numbers and having very strong years even though the price in sterling might not have changed hugely the exchange rate has changed and therefore Irish companies are much more competitive versus their counterparts either north of the Border or in the UK.</p> <p>  The market to Africa has grown by 46%, America is up 36%, Asia is up 122% driven by China.  To be honest dairy exports to China have gone from roughly &euro;60 million to nearly &euro;400 million in that period, mainly around infant formula.</p><p>Even though China is buying much less powder this year, it is probably buying more volume from Ireland this year than last year because we have helped to insulate ourselves from the trade in basic powders by having much more infant formula from companies like Wyeth, Abbott, and Danone, and new commercial propositions like the partnership between Beingmate and Kerry Group, producing product for the Chinese market in Charleville.  This is a direct dividend for a rural town like Charleville, producing a product for the Chinese market, a very high-end, valuable market, selling for about $45 a tin or such like.  It is a good example of how a rural community can benefit from a growing market.<br/><br/>Some people think about China and they just think about the big companies.  There is a reason we are seeing &euro;120 million being spent on dairy-drying facilities in Mallow, while near Waterford Port<font color="#FF0000"></font>we are seeing nearly &euro;200 million, in Charleville &euro;50 million, and another &euro;40 million in Mitchelstown.  All of these rural economic drivers are built on the back of these markets.  The direct question Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked was whether this was driven by value or volume.  It is driven mainly by value.  For example, seafood has increased in value export terms by almost 40% in the last four years.</p></speech>

There have been dramatic increases in volume in whiskey, for example.  Some 6 million cases of Irish whiskey are now sold.  Four or five years ago that figure would probably have been 3 million.  They plan to double volume again by 2020 and again by 2030.</p> <p>  It is a mixture across multiple sectors of more volume, more value, more premiumisation, and these factors are helped in some sectors by either currency exchange rates or increased commodity prices globally.  We have had the downside of commodity prices too, particularly in the grain sector and obviously this year in terms of dairy.  Our expenditure on R&amp;D and innovation is very important In terms of getting a dividend from increased exports.  The latest call we had, which was &euro;28 million around research projects, is driving a reputation in Ireland now for innovation in the food and drink sector, which is helpful.  That is one of the reasons Kerry Group will open its global food innovation centre tomorrow.  When that is fully up and running, it will have 900 people, mostly postgrads, designing the foods of the future, adding value to raw material in Ireland.  That is what is driving growth.  The supports we spend on Irish family farms to keep them in business through good times and bad are also critical.  If we do not have the raw material coming from family farms and if they are not making money out of producing that raw material, then we cannot have the basis for the export growth and value added that we talk about.</p> <p>  In terms of the rural development programme advance payments, there is no issue with direct payments.  In regard to advance payments-----</p></speech>

I asked whether the expansion in dairy was due to extra production per hectare or people changing from one enterprise to another and, if it is the second, what effect that will have on the other industries.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-30a.87" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015093000002#K01700"><p>First, it has not happened yet, so we cannot give definitive answers on that but I anticipate that the current herd number will be able to produce between 15% and 17% more milk.  That is the estimate we have.  In other words, we can improve the yield per cow significantly.  Many NGOs, in particular, that talk about concerns around emissions and climate change miss this point.  The Irish dairy herd can produce much more milk and reduce the emissions intensity of that milk production because the same cow of the same age will be producing more milk by better grazing management, better feed conversion efficiency and so on.  We are putting a great deal of research into that.</p> <p>  There will undoubtedly also be an increase in the herd size between now and 2020.  We think this will be about an extra 300,000 animals.  Correct me if I am wrong, but I think those are the figures.  Obviously some more land will be needed for that, but there is a great deal of land in Ireland that is under-utilised in terms of stocking rate and with improved efficiency and better grazing management, many dairy farmers will be able to expand their output without requiring a lot more land.  Certainly there will be more competition for land among dairy farmers.  That is true.  We are not predicting a significant reduction, for example, in beef output as regards suckler beef on the back of that.  What we will see now is a more focused look at how we use agricultural land more efficiently and more sustainably.  In all of our counties there are good examples of farms that could be more efficient and getting more young farmers into farming will help on that journey in terms of applying a more science-based approach to production.</p> <p>  There will be an increased herd size.  We have already seen that in terms of the calving numbers this year, which are strong, and we have seen about a 12% increase in output of milk.  We have probably had the best grass growth this year that we have ever had.  If one speaks to the co-ops, as we did yesterday, at the moment dairy farmers are getting very strong bonuses in terms of quality in milk components, which is helping with the difficulty as regards base price.</p> <p>  There will be advance payments on GLAS and organics.  What we had planned was &euro;20 million on GLAS and &euro;10 million on organics.  We are now trying to plan &euro;22 million on GLAS and &euro;11.5 million on organics, which would be an 85% advance payment rather than a 75% advance payment.  We should, I hope, be able to factor that into our Estimates for this year.</p></speech>

There will be some spillover on GLAS payments from this year into next year, but that is the norm.  The priority for farming organisations and farmers is always to get the maximum number of people in.  If we have to split it between December and January to span two accounting years as regards Estimates, then we try to manage that as best we can.</p> <p>  On the capital programme, I am glad to have an opportunity to explain the approach the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is taking, because it is different to most other Departments.  We have an agreed capital figure for 2016, which is &euro;217 million.  That is enough for us to do all the things that we are promising to do for next year.  We then attempted to put numbers in terms of capital expenditure, linked to forestry; to the rural development programme, mainly TAMS; and to the capital expenditure we will need, for example, in fishery harbours and so on.  We tried to put that profiling right up until 2021, but it was proving almost impossible to do that and get agreement on it because many of these schemes are demand-led.</p><p>Farmers approved for TAMS have two years to spend the money and they decide when they spend it.  It is not like building roads, where the State can plan for expenditure depending on how much money it has.  Essentially, we have agreed a baseline figure through to 2020.  Incidentally, 2021 will be a new Common Agricultural Policy year so who knows what money will be available then.</p><p> We have agreed a baseline figure of &euro;208 million, which is a significant increase on what was spent up to this year, and we have agreed with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that we will add to that baseline figure annually taking account of what is likely to be spent year on year, which will be significantly more than &euro;208 million in most years between now and 2020, to accommodate the commitments under the rural development programme, the forestry programme, the seafood development programme and so forth.  For the first time in a Government-published document there is a full commitment from the Government to plan and estimate for the full delivery of the rural development programme by 2020.  I am very happy with the outcome there.  We have agreed the figure to be spent next year and a baseline figure after that, with very strong wording that states those figures will be topped up to accommodate the expenditure profile of the RDP as it rolls out.  I hope that gives the Deputy an explanation of the numbers.</p></speech>

One is in Castletownbere, where we have committed to spending approximately &euro;20 million on extending the Dinish pier to accommodate a significant increase in both foreign landings and activity generally.  The second will be in Rossaveal, where we are considering an investment project over the lifetime of the capital programme.  We will announce details of that when we have them.</p></speech>

That will have to come through in the same way as on the last occasion.  When there were bad storms two or three years ago a &euro;70 million fund was put together by the then Minister, former Deputy Phil Hogan, and that was spent through different Departments.  Our Department spent approximately &euro;13 million.  I presume that would happen again if there were storm damage that required a response.</p> <p>  Incidentally, there will be ongoing maintenance and other projects in fishery harbours.  In Dunmore East, for example, we are spending &euro;7 million this year on a dredging project.  There is also a project on Cape Clear.  There will be other projects in fishery harbours.  There will be a project in Killybegs.  People in Greencastle are seeking money to be spent there, and that might also happen.  Many projects have to be financed and we have factored that into our numbers.  However, regarding the two big flagship projects to which we are making a commitment, we have already announced some details about Castletownbere and we will do something similar about Rossaveal in the not too distant future.</p></speech>

We will spend &euro;20 million on GLAS this year.  There will be 26,000 farmers in GLAS.  We will open a second round of GLAS for applications starting, hopefully, in the week of 12 October.  We will accept another 10,000 or so.  They will start their membership of GLAS from 1 January next and they will be paid next year.  There will be approximately 36,000 farmers in GLAS.</p> <p>  We are moving towards the 50,000 figure.  Some people would like us to take in more than 10,000 this time but we must be responsible in scaling up GLAS.  We cannot spend &euro;250 million on GLAS next year.  I would love to be able to do it, but we cannot.  We never said we would be able to do that.  We said we would accept as many farmers as we could from the first day and 26,000 was far more than most people were seeking when it was being designed.  To have 36,000 in it by the end of the first year is not a bad performance.  We will take in the other 15,000 as soon as we can afford to commit the full &euro;0.25 billion a year that will be spent on GLAS.  It will be done as soon as possible.</p> <p>  A number of members asked about beef genomics.  We are setting up a working group and the farming organisations will be included in it.  When the beef genomics scheme was launched there were concerns that it was too complicated and unworkable.  To be honest, the Department should have done more in terms of information meetings at that point.  We have tried to make up for that by holding those meetings in different parts of the country and we will do more of that.  Many people have been reassured about beef genomics.  I attended a number of public meetings and there was talk that there would be a mass exodus from the programme and that there would be no more than 5,000 farmers in it.  There are almost 30,000 farmers in the programme.  A small number of farmers decided to pull out for their own reasons, but the vast majority of people are staying in beef genomics and are now talking it up.</p> <p>  We have written to everybody in the scheme to give them a detailed outline of how it will work.  The Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, has given farmers information on qualification criteria, and 90% of the farmers in the scheme are already at a star rating in their herds that they are required to reach by 2018-19.  They are at that point now.  It is about bringing the other 10% up to that standard in the next few years by improving the information they have about breeding, linked to both performance data and the DNA of their herds.  In time, the beef genomics scheme will be one of the most innovative schemes ever introduced as part of a rural development programme.  Of course, there are challenges at the start to ensure that people understand what is required of them.  The farming organisations have been involved in that.  They are not shy about telling me when there are problems.  There will be a mid-term review of the scheme at the end of next year and if there are problems and changes are required, we will make the changes.  I have said that previously.  We are trying to help farmers with this, not catch them out.  I believe beef genomics will be a big success.  We have tied up a large amount of money in it, so it must be.</p> <p>  Deputy Penrose asked many questions.  I answered the question about GLAS and the &euro;250 million.  We will reach that as soon as possible, but it will not be next year.  Expenditure on TAMS will be &euro;34 million this year.  Next year it will be much more.  Expenditure on TAMS has proven remarkably difficult to estimate.  There will be less spent this year than we were expecting.</p><p>We will need to reallocate some of that money to make sure we get the expenditure, and we need to carry over some of the money into next year because the TAMS bills will keep on coming.  They do not respect calendar years.</p><p> On knowledge transfer schemes, some of the Teagasc advisers have a concern that there may be a tax liability with regard to the form of payment that is being proposed for them as individuals.  We need to address that issue with the Revenue Commissioners.  It is a question of making sure they are paid through the Teagasc infrastructure.  When I read this story it was the first time I had come across it, but I will do my best to address it.</p><p> The working group on beef data will very much involve the farming organisations, who asked for that and will get it.  On land mobility, one of the great successes that has been quietly happening in agriculture is the move away from conacre towards long-term leasing since we made the tax changes to encourage that over the past couple of years.  The increase in the numbers of farmers in long-term leasing is significantly up, maybe by 27%, and we need to keep pushing it because for young farmers to get a piece of land for 11 months is a disaster on lots of levels, especially when it comes to borrowing money on the back of it and investing in the soil in a field if they do not know they are going to have it the following year.  We need to get long-term leasing in place, and it is starting to work.</p><p> Self-employed tax credits are a matter for Deputy Michael Noonan.  I am always supportive of farmers and try to help their income levels.  We have a very able team of people negotiating with the Department of Finance, and they got a great result last year.  The conversation is continuing this year so we will hopefully get a good result in a few weeks' time.  </p><p> There is no commitment from the Department of Finance on income averaging in forestry.  I would like it to consider this, and it was very much part of discussions between our Department and the Department of Finance last year in the build-up to the budget, as it has continued to be.  If there is no income averaging for people in forestry, they will cut a certain amount of trees up until the threshold where taxation kicks in.</p></speech>

There is real frustration in the forestry sector on this issue.  To be fair to the Department of Finance, it has been unbelievably accommodating on issues we have raised with them, the proof of that being in the past number of years.  There are issues relating to this particular request, but we will keep working with the Department of Finance until the budget.  I do not, however, want to over-promise on this, as I am not sure it is going to be agreed.</p></speech>

There are a massive number of jobs in really rural areas in the mills, so it is not just affecting the guy who sells the trees.  There is a knock-on effect on the viability of some of our very large and successful timber mills, which have survived the downturn intact, amazingly, so I am a bit surprised that the wise heads in the Department of Finance cannot recognise that they are losing the PAYE tax and PRSI from mill workers.</p></speech>

Deputy Heydon asked about the beef scheme.  The irony of the beef genomics scheme is that a lot of farmers who decided, for whatever reason, that they did not want to get into it now want to get into it.  If we are not spending the full amount that we anticipated we would spend - and we may be slightly under that this year - we will, of course, look to let more people in, but the rural development programme only has a set amount for the beef genomics scheme and we cannot spend more than that.  There are issues around young farmers who are starting out and who may want to come into the beef genomics scheme late, having not been in farming at the start of the scheme.  We need to prioritise them, but we will keep it under review with the working group and we will see how we can make sure we spend the full allocation.  If that means letting more people in late, we can look at that, though it is not that easy to do, as one signs up for a certain number of years.  If everybody in the scheme has signed up for five years and we take people in late there are knock-on problems because the scheme then goes beyond the lifetime of the current scheme into the next rural development programme into the 2020s.  Late applicants are a headache for the purposes of managing the scheme, but we will look at making exceptions and showing flexibility where we are allowed to do so by the Commission.</p> <p>  I congratulate Senator O'Brien on the growth of her own company.

I am a very simple person with a great team, but I worked with Enterprise Ireland and Bord Bia over the years and they drove me crazy with business plans and lean manufacturing ideas.  We went through a lot to become the company we are.</p></speech>

Other people say: "That could be me if I put the right plan in place."  Four and a half years ago, Bord Bia had 350 companies on its books, but it is now helping approximately 750.  That is an indication of what is happening in the small foods sector.  Some of them are not small any more but are very much medium-sized companies with big growth plans.  We have not seen too many Irish food companies go from medium to big in the past ten years, even in this growth period.  There are glass ceilings that are very difficult to break through in terms of funding and the ability to put infrastructure in place to become the next Glanbia, Kerry Group or Greencore.  We have to help companies make that jump.</p> <p>  The Senator's comments on the racing industry are welcome.  The sales yesterday are an indication that spending money in this sector pays dividends, and we have managed to keep it going through a very difficult economic period.</p> <p>  I am a very big supporter of Origin Green, and I hope that by the end of next year, all Irish food and drinks companies will either be signed up to Origin Green or already in the programme.  In this way, our &euro;11 billion or &euro;12 billion of exports will all be under an Origin Green banner, which represents a commitment to continuous improvement around stability and measuring, internationally and independently certified for credibility.</p> <p>  One of the areas in which this committee could do a lot more work with our Department is climate change.  I am hugely frustrated by commentary we sometimes get across mainstream media platforms about agriculture being the big problem, which neglects to mention that Ireland is probably doing more in terms of climate change in agriculture than any other country in the world right now.  Some 46,000 beef farms in Ireland are currently measuring carbon footprints in their herds with a carbon calculator.  No other country in the world is even talking about that but we are doing it.  All 17,000 of our dairy farmers have signed up, through their farming organisations, to a dairy sustainability scheme, for which they are not being paid.  Virtually all of our food companies are either in Origin Green or have signed up to Origin Green.  We are focusing on output and adding value but also on a sustainability journey that is measured and benchmarked as we go.  It would be great if the committee focused on some of that to raise awareness of it, perhaps by bringing in some NGOs to talk about it.</p><p>The idea that Ireland needs to reduce its carbon footprint by simply producing less does not make sense from either a climate change or an economic perspective.  On disease, we had a big step forward in relation to brucellosis recently when Northern Ireland achieved brucellosis-free status the week before the ploughing championships.  We have managed now to do away with pre-movement testing of animals, which is great news for farmers North and South of the Border on a practical level.  I acknowledge that there is a particular TB problem in Wicklow, which we think is linked to deer or badgers.  The herd has a TB incidence of 4.92%, which is down from a high of 15.72% in 2010, but there is still an issue in Wicklow, which we need to keep working on.  There has been huge progress in the number of reactors per thousand animals tested, which is now down to 5.19 from 8.85 in 2014.  That is in Wicklow east.  While there is a problem, there has also been a significant improvement in the numbers there.  I think I have answered everything.</p></speech>

Some of those involved with the farm managers and Macra na Feirme approached me at the National Ploughing Championship and said that while the &euro;40,000 upper limit is very good and helpful, there is an issue whereby young farmers are getting a 25% top-up as more of the money is being extracted in the lease.  It was suggested that a maximum per acre should be applied as a control.  In other words, one would get up to &euro;40,000 tax-free for a long-term lease, but, taking a figure of &euro;200 per acre, the rest is taxable.  I imagine if that could be implemented, the Revenue Commissioners would love it.  I am not sure it can be.  However, it puts a brake on the price increase, especially as it applies to young farmers who landowners will know are in receipt of top-up payments.  It is the opposite of what we usually look for.  We are looking for a control measure here to aid young farmers.  It is something that should be discussed with Macra and farm managers in particular.  That is who mentioned it to me at the ploughing championship.</p></speech>

Macra has taken on somebody whose full-time job is to talk to farmers about land mobility and to put arrangements in place.  They asked me at the ploughing championships whether, over a certain amount per acre of spend, one would not provide a tax break in order to keep prices down a bit.  One is kind of moving into the territory of price fixing in that case, which sometimes has knock-on consequences in terms of the availability of land.  The most important thing here is that as much land is available for lease as possible.  We do not want any disincentive to landowners in respect of making land available for lease.  If we start to control prices and change the incentive, thereby reducing the amount of land available, we will be in a dangerous circle of having less land, thereby driving the price up even more, and trying to force it down through tax measures.  We will look at it, but that proposal is a double-edged sword.</p></speech>

A person can pay what he or she wants; it does not control the market.  Say, for example, the person letting the land could only claim a tax relief.  If one buys private health insurance, which takes pressure off the public system, one can only get X amount of tax relief.  After that, if one wants to increase one's policy, one is on one's own.  There is nothing to say that somebody cannot pay &euro;400 per hectare with the tax relief incentive on the first &euro;200, and one is on one's own after that.  Otherwise, it is a major incentive and a bonus to the person who is getting big money per hectare.  It encourages inflation in the market.  It is worth looking at.  The Chairman has raised a valid issue.</p></speech>

If one has 200 acres and gets &euro;200 tax free, that is fine for a long-term lease.  If one gets &euro;300 per acre, one is getting a lot more and one only gets the &euro;40,000.  Smaller acreage is particularly where it applies.  It is often a very big addition to a young farmer's enterprise where he or she is actually able to add perhaps 50 acres.  If he or she has to pay &euro;400 an acre, which is the price that was quoted to me - whereas the farmer is well within the limits - he or she would still be well within the limits.</p></speech>

The purpose of today's meeting is to consider the performance information included in the Estimates and the improvements that may be desirable in that regard and to undertake a mid-year review of the position as regards outputs and expenditure in relation to the Vote for the Department of Education and Skills for the year ending 31 December 2015.  In addition, the intention is to brief the joint committee on the emerging position so as to permit it to participate in the 2016 Estimates discussions in advance of the allocations being finalised.  I propose to deal with the issues in order during the meeting.</p><p>As is the case across a number of committees, I propose that after the meeting the joint committee may agree a report or recommendations on the outcome of our deliberations today and lay it before the Houses, if it so wishes.  Three separate briefing documents from the committee secretariat have been circulated to members which explain the purpose and structure of the meeting, the issues arising and possible questions for members.</p><p>We will now have a discussion on Vote 26, Estimates for the Department of Education and Skills 2015 and the Department's briefing.  I welcome the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sulllivan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, and their officials.  </p><p>Before I invite the Minister to speak, I will read the note on privilege.  I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>The opening statements submitted to the committee will be published on the committee's website after the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I have asked the Minister to focus on the part of her statement relating to performance and outputs at this stage and she has agreed to do that.</p></speech>

As you said, Chairman, I will speak about the performance information first.  The committee is considering the performance information that is included in the Revised Estimates volume for education and how that information might be improved to better assist the committee in performing its financial oversight role.  This relates to the various output targets that are listed for each of the four high-level programme goals for my Department, together with various indicators of performance.</p> <p>  My officials have over the past few months been working closely with staff of the Oireachtas service and staff of the committee in this area, with a view to improving the type of output and target information that is presented in the Estimates.  Some progress has already been made.  That is to be welcomed and it will, hopefully, be reflected in the targets to be included in the Estimate for 2016.</p> <p>  My Department does agree that the guidance on setting performance targets, issued by the New Zealand Auditor General, can assist the efforts to improve the performance-based information included with the Estimates for the Department.  We are happy to continue to work with the committee in this regard.  We consider that this engagement would also include the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which publishes the Revised Estimates volume, and whose input would also be very important in this context.  It was that Department which facilitated the introduction a few years ago of the new performance budgeting approach to the production of departmental Estimates.  Performance budgeting essentially introduced the concept of including performance-related information directly into Departments' Estimates, whereas before this performance information existed separately to the Estimate.</p> <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is, I understand, also currently considering how the format of the 2016 Estimates might be improved.  My Department also believes that some of the other benchmark and guidance material that informed the introduction of performance budgeting, including material from the European Union and OECD, should also inform this new process.</p> <p>  I am confident that co-operation in this area between line Departments, the Oireachtas service and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will over time lead to improvements in the targets and outputs presented with the Estimates.  There will be issues and challenges to address here, but I believe that they can be resolved through the adoption of a reasonable and pragmatic approach on all parts.  Some of the issues have already been encountered in the engagements of the past few months and some are alluded to in the briefing material produced for committee members today.  They include such issues as: deciding whether certain output material in the Estimate should continue to be included, even though it might not meet all of the criteria set out in the New Zealand guidance.  This would relate, for example, to important structural changes made in Departments to allow them to better deliver their services, but which might be regarded under the New Zealand guidance as being more in the nature of internal processes.  I refer to such matters as the reform in the vocational education committees, VECs, coming together as education and training boards, ETBs, and the reform in the further education and training sector; dealing with situations where information on performance is not available on an annual basis.  This would be the case in relation to certain international surveys of education performance, such as the programme for international student assessment, PISA, survey; cases where results will only be achieved over a period of longer than one year, which is a feature of many educational programmes; cases where important education outcomes cannot be attributed to one particular activity or target.  This would be the case, for example, in relation to key indicators such as leaving certificate retention rates, or to participation rates in higher education; and how best to capitalise on the reality that Departments, in addition to the Estimates volume, use a wide range of mechanisms for reporting progress on targets and policies.</p> <p>  My Department, for example, has produced significant reporting outputs as part of the integrated reform delivery plan, IRDP, for the education and training sector which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website and how the Estimates can accommodate the presentation of important context information in relation to education and education expenditure.  This would include key metrics such as numbers of mainstream and special needs teachers, numbers of SNAs, and numbers of schools.  As I said, however, I am confident that these and other issues arising can be satisfactorily resolved in the current process of engagement.</p><p>I again thank the Chairman for allowing me to make these introductory comments about this part of the meeting.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, and I are happy to respond to questions.</p></speech>

Regarding the departmental output tables, I have a question on school transport services.  I refer to the targets and outputs, items Nos. 4 and 5, the number of students provided with school transport services and the number of school transport routes.  The target and output for students provided with transport in 2013, 2014 and 2015 was 114,000.  The target for school transport routes in 2013 was 6,000 while the output was 6,500.  Given that the output was 500 more than the target, what was the situation?  In 2014, the target was 6,000 school transport routes, which was achieved, meaning there were 500 fewer routes.  The 2015 target is also 6,000.  My experience on the ground has been that the number of school transport routes has been restricted due to the changes to the minimum number of students required for a route.  The changes to the "nearest school" rule have also have an impact in that students can avail of transport only to their nearest school.  It has reached a pinch point this year, reducing the number of school routes.  Routes that would have previously included students who were not going to their closest school have lost students and are, therefore, being discontinued.  Could the Minister comment on this?</p></speech>

In 2014, the target was 1,100 and the output was 1,387.  The 2015 target was 1,100.  If the 2014 output was 1,387, why was the 2015 target reduced?  Why did we not make 1,387 the target if that is the number needed?</p></speech>

I welcome what I believe the Minister said, that she would agree with working towards the New Zealand model and work with the committee to achieve it.  Does the Minister hope to get close to some of the elements of the model in the context of delivering the 2016 Estimates?  I hope so, and it would be a positive response to us.  The Minister gave examples of areas in which the model might not work for the Department.  One example was the fact that important educational outcomes cannot be attributed to one particular activity or target.  From our understanding, it would not necessarily have to be measured on one target.  In the example the Minister gave, if we are talking about leaving certificate retention rates, we would be examining where they are now, where we want them to be next year or the year after, and there would be a series of actions to achieve it.  Although the overall objective would be to achieve improvement in this area, a range of activities would be measured.  The goals would have to be specific and the outcomes measured.  This is what we want.  I welcome the Minister's up-front response and willingness to work with the committee to achieve the New Zealand model.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-30a.164" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015093000002#D00800"><p>I will begin with Deputy Brendan Ryan's general question on the model, how we report and how we are trying to be as clear as we can be regarding how the committee can have its oversight over what we are doing and how it can examine the outcomes.  We want to move towards the New Zealand model as quickly as we can, and we have made progress.  As I outlined, there are constraints in that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is responsible for the design of the Estimates documentation.  There is a practical issue in that a number of measures are required to reach a particular outcome and, as members can see by the small size of the print, we are constrained by the physical space.  It is difficult to fit in all the measures designed to lead to an outcome, such as improved retention for the leaving certificate.  We need the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to be engaged in terms of the practicality of how we can present the material as clearly as possible.</p> <p>  In principle, we want to move as close to the New Zealand model as possible.  The programme for international student assessment, PISA, is an example of something that is measured in a different way from an international measuring system.  We must determine whether we can work out some yearly success based on a measure that is not done yearly.  If PISA results indicated we had improved literacy and numeracy levels, how could we determine how much of it happened in one particular year?  It is a practical problem.  We need to continue to work with the committee and we want to commit to this.</p> <p>  Senator Moloney and Deputy McConalogue's questions are related.  We do not yet have the outcomes for 2015 regarding school transport or anything else such as special schools.</p></speech>

With special needs, we have had to seek extra resources, regarding resource teachers and SNAs, which we got this year.  There is a lesson to learn that we need to be as real as we can in our predictions.  We can give the committee an update as we get the outcome.  Some of the figures vary greatly, and superannuation is an example.  The predictions of the number of teachers who retire can, and have been, totally wrong.  The numbers of teachers who retired in 2012 and 2013 were totally different.</p><p>We cannot be sure of some of the figures, but can only make a guesstimate.</p><p> Perhaps Deputy English would now like to respond on school transport.</p></speech>

Also, some routes are still being sorted out and some cases are still being dealt with.  Deputies and Senators would be aware of this because they are raising these matters with us directly as are people involved.  Therefore, we will not have the full figures for this year until near the end of the year.</p> <p>  The question asked was whether savings are being achieved or whether numbers have changed.  The Deputy's concern seems to relate to the reduction in the number of buses.  We are working from estimates.  We estimate that fewer than 500 school children would be affected by changes relating to the size of buses, but again we will not have the full detail on this for another couple of months.  I will come back to the Deputy with the details then.  The issue raised is a concessionary one also.  The numbers affected by that will increase as the years go on.</p></speech>

That is significant, a 500 additional route output beyond the target.  However, the 2014 target was again 6,000 and the report states that target was achieved.  Now, the target is again 6,000.  There are 500 additional routes in the figures.  What are those 500 routes about?</p></speech>

My figures are concentrated on the past year or two, under my watch.  The situation is that each year we have new routes and we also have some routes that end, because there is no longer a need for them.  To clarify, if pupils are eligible, but the number on the route goes below a figure of ten, the remote grant kicks in and people receive financial help towards the cost of transport.</p></speech>

The 2014 target was 1,100 but there were 1,387 teachers in special schools, 287 above the target, yet at the start of 2015, the target was only 1,100.  That means the target for this year for teachers in special schools was 20% less than what was in place last September.  That is massive, but the point was not well addressed.</p></speech>

What this committee hopes is that we can agree a process today for working together towards that model in the lead-up to the Estimates, rather than waiting for the Estimates to arrive and being dissatisfied with the result.

In respect of the capital investment plan, which we saw published yesterday without any prior consultation on the headline figures, is the Minister willing to conduct a similar exercise in advance of the detail of how education capital investment will be spent over the coming five years in respect of what the options might be and how it might be divvied up so that this committee could have a similar role to the role it plays in the annual Estimates?</p></speech>

It is a different context to measuring outcomes and working with the committee in its role in measuring outcomes, but I am happy to engage with the committee on its priorities.  Obviously, the capital plan has been announced and we will very shortly announce the detail of the education-specific aspects of the capital plan, particularly relating to the schools capital programme and some of the other measures in it.  I am happy to engage with the committee but I do not know whether there is a formal structure whereby we can engage in respect of the capital plan.  I am not aware of anything that has been established in the same way as this procedure but I am happy to go along with whatever is the norm in terms the committee's interaction with the Department.</p></speech>

The main thing is what is proposed by Deputy O'Brien, namely, that the committee would liaise with Department officials and the secretariat after the budget until the next Estimates to see how we can improve for next year.</p> <p>  The committee has been advised that some of the outputs and a significant number of the output measures and associated targets, including the Estimate, concern themselves with internal processes.  That would include a published revised toolkit for S&iacute;olta.  A view has been put to the committee that such measures say nothing about how efficiency or quality of service delivery will change as a result, if at all, and that their value is as explanations for target results where they are expected to contribute significantly to and be reflected in improved output and productivity.  Does the Minister have any comments on that?  Obviously, it would have been part of the discussions between the secretariat and departmental officials.</p></speech>

We are happy to work with the committee and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of improving those measures.  The point I made in my opening remarks is that in some cases there would be things that might be described in the New Zealand model as being internal processes, but we would consider them to be important in terms of outcome as well.  An example I gave was the restructuring of the VECs, which in the New Zealand model might be described as an internal process but which in fact is important in terms of outcomes, including measurable outcomes.</p></speech>

It is fantastic to have targets and to try to achieve targets.  It is very welcome.</p> <p>  In respect of Vote 26, public sector activity and the compilation of an online inventory of school accommodation, in 2013, the Government had a target of 85, but there is no output at all for 2013.

One of the issues that has been raised with the committee in terms of the Minister's presentation is that some output measures are not specific enough to be meaningful in a performance budgeting context.  One example relates to higher education.  It mentions significantly progressing the NUIG human biology building, but it does not say how or with what.  There is not much to that.  What is the Minister's view on the publication of measures that do not have specific targets associated with them?  Are there any plans to improve on that?

I could be misreading this.  It goes from 0.95% to 99.7% of the target.  Underneath that, there is a figure for the percentage of schools assigned NEPS psychologists.  Is that 99.4%?</p></speech>

Schools are limited to two reports - for two children - so I do not see how the figure can be 99%.  The school might have access to NEPS, but the children in the school are not getting the psychological reports.  Reports I get seem to suggest that.</p></speech>

The target for 2015 is that every school would have access to NEPS psychologists.  That does not mean they have as much as the Senator or I would want them to have, but it is a service that has not been as well resourced as we would like.  Our target was to ensure that every school would have access to NEPS.</p></speech>

I know one case in which a family was told they could have the assessment in the middle of June, when the child was leaving the school.  There is a huge problem there, when one looks at the figures, with children who need a psychological report having to wait for an entire academic year.</p><p>Capital funding specific to education certainly needs to be examined.</p></speech>

We have made some progress in having access for all schools but the amount of access is the issue.</p> <p>  I am sure the Senator knows that the National Council for Special Education has proposed reforms in the area of supporting children with special learning needs in schools.  Since we did not have all the data, we have not been able to introduce the reforms this year.  We are awaiting data, particularly on complex needs, from the HSE but have not yet got them.  However, the intention is to introduce the new model of allocation in the near future.  We are establishing a pilot scheme this year, in which I believe 48 schools will be participating, to determine how the new model will work.  The intention is that when young children enter school, we will have got information from early childhood services, etc., informing us of their needs.  A problem at present is that schools, in order to provide for the needs of a child coming in, must have assessments carried out.  In many cases, they cannot provide for a child's needs immediately.  The new model is designed to address that issue.  As I said, there is to be a pilot scheme in the coming year.  The new model will be introduced after that.</p></speech>

Everybody here knows that, in some cases, people have to pay for private assessments in order to get supports in schools.  That is clearly unfair to families and schools that do not have access to very much money.  That is one of the main reasons the new model has been proposed.  We want to introduce it as soon as we can.</p></speech>

While it is very good to have a target and are working towards it, would it be of value to have a page on some of the clusters that are working very well and in respect of which a target has been reached or partly reached, and those that are proving problematic, for whatever reason, be it associated with money, change or another factor?  It would be an explanation.  Some people are more interested in and more involved in some areas than others.  They know more about certain areas than others.  Therefore, what I propose would be a good exercise to determine the pros and cons.</p></speech>

Access to a psychologist in no way reflects the extent or quality of access.  I am surprised to see some schools do not have access to NEPS, let alone having to go on a waiting list.  The Minister might clarify what exactly having no access means.  Have those affected nobody to contact?  I presume that is what it means.</p> <p>  Does the Minister have any data on the number of students who would not have received NEPS reports in the past year, although they were requested for them?</p> <p>  On item No. 144, concerning the further development of proposals for a capital assets test, "NA" is stated.

I am somewhat disappointed there is nothing with respect to guidance and counselling services in the schools.  From having spoken to people in third level and further education, I note we are now beginning to see the cost of the failure to provide guidance as students move through second level.  There is poor choice of third level programmes.  I would have expected us to try to row back on that.</p></speech>

The reason there was a target for access for schools is that we had not reached 100%.  We are not proud that every single school did not have access to NEPS, and that is why the target exists.  It is a target but the more important issue is the one both members raised, namely, that there should be adequate access to NEPS.  That is a matter we have to continue to work on.</p> <p>  With regard to the capital assets, that criterion has not been applied in assessing people for SUSI grants.  It is not live and that is why it does not apply.</p> <p>  On the technological universities Bill, this is where we differ slightly from the New Zealand guidelines.  We believe it is an important outcome to have such a Bill.</p></speech>

It is an important output as far as I am concerned.</p> <p>  With regard to Senator Craughwell's point on guidance, the matter will have to be considered in the current Estimates process.

The Minister of State, Deputy English, and I thank the committee for the opportunity to be here.  I want to give a brief opening statement on the other element of the meeting.</p> <p>  For the mid-year review of 2015 expenditure, the briefing slides we have provided to the committee present the expenditure position to the middle of August 2015, together with the main components of this expenditure.  Net overall expenditure across all programme areas of &euro;5.172 billion to the end of August was running &euro;62 million behind profile, &euro;80 million behind profile on current expenditure and &euro;18 million ahead on capital expenditure.  However, as things stand, it is anticipated that towards the end of the year, expenditure will come under pressure from three main areas.  I mentioned one of them already - superannuation, where it looks like there will be in the region of 350 to 400 more teacher retirements in the year than originally provided for.  The other anticipated sources of pressure are student support payments, where demographic pressures are impacting strongly on expenditure; and expenditure on resource teachers and SNAs.  While the exact scale of these pressures is not yet known, they should be more crystallised in the coming weeks, at which stage the impact of additional students in schools and colleges will become known.  A clearer picture of the number of teacher retirements will also emerge at that stage.  However, my Department is at this time anticipating that a Supplementary Estimate will be required on the Vote.</p> <p>  Members will be aware of the figure of &euro;600 million to &euro;750 million indicated as being available to fund expenditure measures in the budget, including pay demands.  The determination of the overall budgetary strategy for 2016 will be finalised in Government discussions over the next fortnight.  I am, therefore, quite limited as to what I can say at this time.  However, I welcome any inputs that members may wish to make in this matter.  </p> <p>  The key areas of funding in the school sector include a new six-year investment programme that will fund the construction of 62,000 additional school places at primary and post-primary level to address demographic demand, as well as the completion of large-scale projects under the current programme announced in March 2012.  The ongoing delivery of these additional school places will ensure that there are sufficient school accommodation places in the education system for every child to have access to a physical school place.  Funding will also be available for the refurbishment of schools in older buildings that require improvement.  Funding for the provision of smaller-scale classroom accommodation for schools will be maintained.</p> <p>  The plan also includes funding for the replacement of prefabs with permanent accommodation.  Site acquisitions to facilitate the provision of new schools will continue to be funded, as will the funding of unitary charges under the public private partnership, PPP, school bundles.  The plan also provides for an important investment of &euro;210 million in IT and wireless networks in schools.</p> <p>  The planned total investment in the higher education sector in the period 2016 to 2021 amounts to &euro;350 million.  This figure includes direct Exchequer capital of &euro;110 million which will enable the funding of a minor works scheme.  This will enable institutes to plan for and undertake necessary improvement works, as well as commence programmes of equipment renewal, including upgrading of IT facilities.  In addition to this, there remains &euro;40 million of approved direct Exchequer capital yet to be drawn down for the Grangegorman project.  Accordingly, the sector will derive an up-front capital injection of &euro;150 million in the period up to 2021.</p></speech>

When members are asking questions, if they are asking a general question, they might just say so, and if they are asking about a specific programme, they should indicate whether it is programme A, programme B or whatever.  As they indicated but did not get in during the last part of the meeting, I am bringing in Deputies Cannon and Collins first.  Then I will go back to the other members, starting with Deputy McConalogue.</p></speech>

Our prefab rental bill has dropped from just under &euro;40 million per annum to &euro;25 million.  We have replaced a huge number of prefabs across the country, at a time when resources were very limited.  I say well done to the building unit and to anybody involved in that programme.</p><p>Will the same momentum continue?  Will there be that focus on reducing the use of prefabs in our school system?  Over time they have become inherently unsafe places in which to educate our children.  Why they were ever adopted as a mechanism for providing school places I do not know.  I would like to see the excellent work of the last two or three years continuing.</p><p>A number of schools that are on the existing capital programme have, due to nobody's fault, experienced some serious issues around site acquisition, particularly in east Galway.  Will such schools automatically migrate over to the new programme?  One assumes they would but I would like confirmation.</p><p>I congratulate the Minister on the impending publication of the digital schools strategy and on securing &euro;210 million to fund it.  A strategy without funding is a pretty pointless exercise.  I look forward to seeing that money being expended.</p><p>Over the last three or four years, great work has been done on the provision of 100 MB broadband to every post-primary school in the country.  Is it envisaged that part of the &euro;210 million will be spent on providing the same to our 3,300 primary schools?  While it is a huge undertaking, in the context of a national broadband programme which seeks to have 30 MB to every community by 2020, I hope there is a parallel ambition to connect all our primary schools to a minimum of 30 MB and an aspiration to 100 MB over time.  <i>siliconrepublic.com</i>has predicted that by 2020 we will have the fastest rural broadband in Europe, based on the private and public investment that is about to happen.  The last thing we need is for that broadband provision to be put in place while our school system lags behind.  I would like to see this develop in parallel with the programme being rolled out by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White.</p></speech>

Some schools are going to have to be built specifically for parents who do not want to baptise their children.  How is that worked out by the Department?  The Minister's presentation points out that there will be a physical school place, but that does not mean there will be a place for every pupil without forcing some students to go to a particular type of school or to a school outside of their locality.</p> <p>  My next question goes back to the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, special needs assistants, SNAs and resource teachers.</p><p>Obviously, a certain number of school children will not be able to access those resource teachers.  Consequently, unless provision for the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, is increased, that area is being under-resourced.  Does the Minister understand my point?  Obviously, there is an entire layer of children about whom we do not know.  I do not know what are the statistics but how many children have sought but not received such reports?  How does one address that in outcomes, inputs and all these weird and wonderful ideas?</p></speech>

I refer to the issue of patronage, that is, point 11.  I believe the outputs were marked as being not available for this year.  At the beginning of the tenure of the former Minister, Deputy Quinn, he indicated his hope that 50% of schools would change their patronage during his term of office.  I would have imagined that a figure should have been given on the number of schools the Department would like to see changing patronage.  Obviously polls were carried out in 32 areas and I ask the Minister to comment in this regard.  She should clarify how many changes have been achieved thus far.  Does she have a figure in mind as to what she would like to be achieved?  The Minister indicated she expects a Supplementary Estimate Vote may be required by the end of the year.  What is the current position?  When the budget was set last year, no budget line was included for the minor works grant for schools.  Where does that now stand and can the Minister commit at this point to paying a minor works grant this year?</p></speech>

In the form I have to hand on expenditure by the Department of Education and Skills on higher education, it states we are spending &euro;15,457,000 under subhead C12, research activities.  However, under capital expenditure, it is stated we are spending &euro;37.6 million in research.  Can someone explain that to me?  Which is which and what is what because I have a question in this regard?

I am asking where is it a delight to spend the money because the Minister constantly sees work being well done in the area or sees a result.  I am aware there is a result because I understand education is a result of itself but I mean specifically, through all these areas, where does the Minister see the greatest return?  Does she see it in the DEIS schools, in languages or in higher education research?  Where does she see such value constantly?  Again, what is being spent on the Grangegorman project?  In addition, as I am somewhat confused about all the money we are spending on research, I ask the Minister to outline that business.  Do we have the same parallel target programmes or has there been an initiation of that within higher education by the Department for that sector's outcomes and outputs in respect of all the money that is being spent?</p></speech>

More importantly, however, they take a huge weight from the shoulders of management in those schools, in so far as the latter has no responsibility for the infrastructure of the building, other than to request through the management body that repairs be made.  While there probably is a case for developing this, is account being taken of the additional burden being placed on managers of schools who are not in public private partnerships?  As members are aware, management structures have been depleted considerably in recent years.  Another point concerns expenditure on information technology, IT, which has been a hobby horse of mine for quite a number of years.  Schools operate as individual islands, if one likes, apart from their fellow schools, even within education and training boards, ETBs, and the purchasing power for hardware and software, software in particular with regard to the licences being paid for it, is a matter of grave concern to me.  However, some time ago with the roll-out of broadband, one would have hoped it was possible to move from stand-alone systems over to a cloud-based system using something like Citrix or VMware, where the dependency on having up-to-date hardware is removed and one can use relatively old hardware to run the latest software.  This has bothered me for some time.  In the United States, many of the big companies fund education because, of course, the students are being trained in their products.  In some Nordic countries, there has been a move away from licensed software to open systems software.  How much per annum is being spent?  I had personal experience in my own college of how much was spent on information technology and it was a fairly significant sum.  I am aware the Department has been examining this issue for some time but has a real move been made towards centralising the purchasing of IT equipment, moving towards the cloud and, if one likes, taking the manufacturers of software and beating them into reality regarding the costs?</p></speech>

The Department of Education and Skills provides no funding towards school meals, by which I mean breakfast clubs or lunch clubs.  The Department of Social Protection provides funding for the food to the tune of 60 cent per pupil for breakfast and &euro;1.40 for lunch.  However, the problem is schools are having difficulty in manning and staffing such programmes, which is where much of the expense lies.  It appears as though the Department of Education and Skills, while it allows the schools to provide the breakfast and lunch clubs, will put forward no funding towards their cost.  Does the Department have proposals to so do in the future because these clubs have proved to be vital, particularly the provision of breakfast for students who may not have had anything eat the previous 12 or 14 hours?</p> <p>  On the question of broadband, I find it difficult to envisage how it ever will be possible to roll out high-speed broadband to all rural schools in Ireland, given that the local school on which I am on the board of management cannot even get broadband to it.  It physically is impossible to get it, as the mountains and so on make it a nightmare in that area.  Consequently, I believe it will be difficult to achieve and I imagine it would be hard to quantify the amount of money it would cost to get broadband to all national schools.  Hopefully, however, there will be some work in the future in this regard.</p> <p>  There is one point I have always found it hard to understand.  I note the Minister of State, Deputy English, has left the meeting.</p></speech>

Why are those nine children not as important as the ten children?  Why can a small minibus or, if the number drops to four, a taxi not be provided instead of telling the parents that a remote transport grant or whatever is available?  Transport should be provided to every child to get them to school, especially those living in rural Ireland where the parents cannot bring their children to school because they travel to work in a different direction.  It is a nightmare.  People say these are only nine pupils but those nine children need transport.</p></speech>

I would like to see some use of the term "further education" because it is a fast-growing and dynamic sector.  For example, all age groups over 18 are flocking to the former VEC schools and colleges around Dublin and finding them of tremendous value in terms of rebuilding a career or for general self-improvement.  We need to separate it out as a sector because of its value and how widely it is patronised, particularly in cities, but I am sure it is the same in the countryside.  We should pay more attention to it.  The Department should examine more carefully how it can foster this relatively new branch of education and make sure it is resourced, particularly in working class areas where people might not have a history of going to college.  Throughout Dublin there is tremendous value being placed on it and men and women are attracted to it in very large numbers.  I would like it to get some mention and given some distinctiveness in its own right, and to have that represented in documents such as the one before us.</p></speech>

Will the Minister explain what comes under the miscellaneous category on the appropriations-in-aid page?  There is &euro;6.1 million, &euro;6.2 million and &euro;6.4 million in the miscellaneous column.  Also, regarding secondments and overpayments, are there many overpayments?  What happens in that respect?</p> <p>  My next question is for the Minister of State, Deputy English.  Senator Moloney raised the question of a bus being supplied for ten students but not for nine.  With regard to transport to special education schools, my office raised a particular case with the Minister this year about a child who was looking for transport to a special education school.  A bus drove past that house with another child attending a special education school but this child was not entitled to that transport and had to pay the concessionary fee of &euro;100.  I still have not got an explanation of the logic behind the reason a bus could take one child and not the other.</p> <p>  I understand the criteria, and I may be going a little off-point, but when it comes down to the choice of a school for a child wishing to attend a special education school, an issue on which I have had many dealings, often the choice comes down to the school the special education needs organiser, SENO, recommends.  The person who knows the child with special educational needs best is the parent, and often parents would like their child to attend a school half a mile in the other direction or a little further.  If they attend the school the SENO recommends they get the transport but if they do not, they have to pay for it themselves.  Is there any way this problem could be examined and addressed?  I have brought up with the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, the question of who determines that.  Sometimes they talk about the SENOs.  Despite what is said, SENOs do not always see the child and I do not understand how people can make decisions about where a child can attend school without even meeting the child.  That is very important in terms of the transport because it causes huge headaches.  This year, despite the improvements, I cannot give parents an answer to the reason one child with special needs was allowed to get free transport when the child who lives three doors up the road attending the same school had to pay &euro;100 concessionary fee.</p></speech>

We will continue the prefab programme.  In the existing programme the focus was mostly on the rented prefabs but we will now move on to the prefabs that have been bought.  We have to approach the schools and put it to them that we would replace the prefabs.  In cases where a new building will be built, automatically the prefabs will be replaced but in the other cases, we will be approaching the schools in the context of the capital programme.  The answer to the second question is "Yes" in regard to the schools already in the current programme but where there was a delay for one reason or another, they will stay on.</p> <p>  The digital school strategy is nearly ready to go.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, and I have been working hard on it and we are close to conclusion.  We want to get our capital allocation first, and the allocation the Minister, Deputy White, was getting with regard to the general roll-out was relevant also in regard to finalising the strategy.  The aim is to have wireless broadband available to all schools but if I can respond also to Senator Moloney's point, which is related, we want to bring it from outside the school into the school under our budget.  Bringing it up the mountain will have to be paid for under the budget of the Minister, Deputy White.  There is private sector involvement in the roll-out as well but the State will be doing the parts the private sector does not consider it appropriate to do.  It is a combination of getting it to the school gate and then us rolling it out in terms of moving from 30 up to 100 megabytes, as the Senator suggested.</p> <p>  Deputy Collins has left but I will briefly answer her question; Deputy McConalogue continued with the same topic.  Deputy Collins's first question was on the need for new schools.  Our estimate is that 19,000 places will be needed at primary level and 43,000 at post-primary level.  That is looking at the demographic growth.  The primary growth will peak in 2018, the post-primary will continue to grow up to 2024, and higher education will continue to grow further again.  That is the way the demographics are growing.  That is the reason we have included a bigger figure for post-primary than for primary.</p> <p>  With regard to having diversity of patronage and choices for parents, when he was Minister, Deputy Quinn started a process and a policy around providing more diversity.  When schools are being provided parents in the area are questioned about the type of patronage they would like, and the vast majority of the new schools have been of multi-denominational patronage, mostly Educate Together.  That is one way in which we are providing diversity.</p> <p>  The other way has been slower and more disappointing, that is, the divesting process.</p><p>That has not delivered as quickly as we would have liked for a variety of reasons.  I intend to meet all the patrons.  While I cannot remember the date, I will meet the Catholic bishops in the very near future and also the other patrons to discuss how we can inject a bit more pace into that process.</p><p> I would like to move more quickly on it.  Where there is a growing population we can provide choice more easily than where there is a stable population because of the issue of displacement.  If we were to simply open, for example, a multidenominational school in an area where there is a reducing population, it would probably result in reducing numbers in other schools.  That is something that has to be considered.  I would like to see progress and will be working to ensure that we get more progress in that regard.</p><p> Deputy Joan Collins asked about general allocation.  I think she asked what would happen if someone was not able to get a report.  There is also the general allocation for special needs.  All schools get a certain amount of resource teaching hours on the basis of the number of students in the school whether it is a boys' school, girls' school, DEIS school, etc.</p><p> I believe I answered Deputy McConalogue's question on patronage.  He asked me about minor works and the Supplementary Estimate.  I have indicated that we expect there will be a Supplementary Estimate in education.  The minor works will be part of our consideration a little later in the year.  Obviously, I have not announced the detail of the capital education programme as yet, but we would hope to look at that.  The Deputy also raised it here with me last year and we were able to deliver it last year.  However, I cannot give him a definite answer on that yet.</p><p> Senator O'Donnell had a number of questions.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, might also want to comment on research funding because it is in his area of responsibility.  Apparently the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform reclassified the funding from current to capital; so it is accounted for differently.  We can come back to the Senator with a more precise answer on that.</p></speech>

In can clarify this for the Senator, but I think we estimated about a further &euro;40 million from the State.  I might not be right on that so I had better come back to the Senator.  About 1,000 students transferred on to the campus in September 2014.  It is a very big project and it is over time.  As it is a PPP, considerable private money is also coming in.  Senator Craughwell, who is gone, made the point that PPPs in schools have delivered good buildings and it is also much easier to maintain them from the point of view of the school management because the PPP involves maintenance as well as building.</p> <p>  Senator O'Donnell also asked me a very interesting question about where I thought the best return for spending was.  The simple answer is that there is return from all the spending in one way or another.  If we were to take something out and say we would not bother spending on a particular level we would soon see huge-----</p></speech>

He also asked me about IT costs.  We will publish the digital strategy very shortly.  That will look at the area of IT and how best to spend the money there in order to keep up with changing hardware, software, etc., in that area.</p> <p>  Senator Moloney asked about school meals and the DEIS review that I just mentioned; I hope that answers that bit of her question.  Responsibility for funding of school meals lies with the Department of Social Protection.  I know of some very good models where community organisations get involved; there are many good models around the country.  The interdepartmental group involved in the DEIS review includes officials from the Departments of Social Protection, and Children and Youth Affairs.  Responsibility for school completion lies with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and responsibility for school meals and other things lies with the Department of Social Protection.  That will be an opportunity for a little more co-operation across Departments to get the best possible outcome for our children.  School meals will also come into that discussion.</p> <p>  I believe I answered the question on broadband.  I was asked about the miscellaneous area and the headings about secondments and overpayments, etc.  That comes under appropriations-in-aid, money that comes in.  This would include, for example, where the full amount of a grant was not spent.  We have to account for money that comes back into the Department as well as money that we spend.  That explains that subhead.</p></speech>

I think the Minister of State might also want to say something about the area of research.</p></speech>

Research has been reclassified from current to capital owing to a change in the EU accounting rules.  Under the US accounting rules for many years, research was regarded as a capital spend because it gives a return over a long period of time.  We did not in Europe.  We counted it as current spend.  That has been changed and now our budgets across all Departments reflect it as capital spend.  I can assure the committee the &euro;37 million is money well spent and more is requested.  Money spent on research, development and innovation is something the Government is driving across many Departments.</p> <p>  The total taxpayer spend on research and development will be close to &euro;800 million.  We want to get it back over &euro;1 billion.  Our commitment is for 2.5% of GDP.  There is a range of programmes funded through higher education along with other Departments.  It is very much about future-proofing the economy.  Money spent on research and development now is about developing talent for the future so that people can work in public research systems and also take up jobs in new companies and so on.  We know from our research that the companies that get involved with the education system and that spend money on research and development are the companies that are growing faster and exporting more.  They are the companies developing new policies and ideas, and taking on new people.  So it is all part of the future-proofing of the economy.  We would like to have much more than &euro;37 million in this regard if we could.</p><p>I hope over time we will have more.  It is well spent and well tracked.</p><p> We are developing a new science strategy in which all of the Departments are involved which we hope to announce in November.  This will include new ways to fund research and to have competitive funding among all the disciplines.  Various disciplines have probably often raised this is a concern with committee members, as they may have felt that in recent years it has been more difficult to obtain money.  It is because there was less money.  It is as simple as that.  We are making it very clear in the new strategy that all of the disciplines will have access to competitive funding and various other moneys.  There will also be new ways to track this money because it is a concern when we spend a lot of money as to how we can track and follow it and measure the outputs.  This is dealt with quite well through our agencies, including the Irish Research Council and Science Foundation Ireland.  We want to be able to improve this and make it clear to all involved that the money is well spent.  I guarantee it gives a return to the country, but we need to be able to track this and prove it.</p><p> The further education and training budget is under skills development in programme B.  The further education and training strategy sets out that it must become a pillar, as we want to give it recognition as best we can.  It has a major contribution to make to skills development in the country.  Every company says there is a shortage of talent and we are in the middle of a talent war.  Skills development and closing the skills gap will only be achieved through a blend of higher education and further education and training.  The Department is trying to recognise this, and the various strategies clarify this and give credence to it, and it is a case of how we can push the agenda.  Eventually the funding will be increased but it must become more responsive to enterprise needs.  This happens through further education and training because of apprenticeships, traineeships and the various schemes in colleges of further education which work with enterprise and community needs and respond to them.  We need to be able to match this with funding.</p><p> Several committee members have raised the issue of school buses and what happens when the number falls below ten.  The threshold was seven and this was raised to ten through changes made a number of years ago.  There must be a cut-off point at some stage, such as three, two or five people, whereby running a bus becomes an inefficient way of spending taxpayers' money.  The ideal number picked at the time was ten.</p></speech>

There is an issue when it goes below the magic number, be it ten or seven, as it was in the past, with regard to what happens these people.  If they are eligible for a bus ticket they will receive a contribution towards the cost of transport.  This is the remote grant.  The families of children eligible to get a bus which is no longer running because it is inefficient to do so can apply for a grant towards the cost of transporting the children to school.  People can apply for it and will receive it, and rightly so because it is not their fault the number of passengers has gone below the magic number.  We must try to run the scheme efficiently throughout the country because it has a limited budget even though it is a demand-led service.</p> <p>  Quite a lot of the increase in the spend on special needs is with regard to provision, because it is something we take very seriously and, in fairness, the Department is responding to ensure people with special needs are able to avail of education.  There is quite a high spend in this area to facilitate it.  With regard to why someone is not eligible to use a bus going past his or her door, a bus route is based on children who are eligible to go to their nearest school.  I will come back to who decides this.  In the case identified, the person was not eligible to go on the route, but a concession will be made for such a person if there is space on the vehicle.  The scheme must be implemented in the same way throughout the country.  Non-eligible children are regarded as concessionary and must make a contribution to the cost, which is &euro;100.  I know this is an additional cost, but it is not excessive in the scheme of things and it is a contribution.  To be fair and equitable with regard to how we run the scheme throughout the country, even though the bus passes the house - I know it seems illogical-----</p></speech>

It might seem illogical in individual cases, but the same rules must apply throughout the system.  With regard to who makes the decision, special education needs organisers, SENOs, implement national rules.  They cannot discard the rules.  They try to follow guidelines and principles.  They must judge and recommend the school that a child is eligible to attend.  It is generally the nearest school, but in the case of a child with a disability or a language issue the nearest school suitable to these needs is found and this is properly resourced.  SENOs must judge this based on the national guidelines and make a recommendation.  It is probably helpful along the way if they meet the child, but this is not necessary to be able to judge where is the nearest school with supports.  It is generally done through reports.  It is wrong to blame SENOs, who must follow the rules.  We try to make these rules as fair as we can throughout the country.  We are always reviewing them to see if we can make changes, but there must be a system to judge which school a child will attend.</p></speech>

We do not have the finances to allow endless choice.  This is why a scheme was introduced.  If parents made their own choice in all cases, and certainly with regard to special needs, we would have to try to provide buses going every which way, and we cannot do this.  There must be a system and guidelines, and we hope this is applied in such a way as to suit everyone's needs.  I have seen cases in which the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health have come together to find alternative solutions, and we have managed to achieve this in some cases.  We are always reviewing guidelines and rules to see whether we can change them to allow for this.  We cannot have a situation in which a parent decides.  Yes, they are best placed to know, and they certainly have influence and meet the SENOs, as I deal with cases on a daily basis in which there is engagement, but someone must make the call to apply the rules, and it cannot be the parent.</p></speech>

I stated that when the number of passengers drops below ten and suddenly becomes nine, the bus is taken off the road.  Why can we not reduce the bus size to a minibus to provide for nine or six?  Even if it decreased to two, we could use a taxi.  Fare-paying parents would still make a contribution.  If one has free school transport and suddenly the bus is taken off the road, one receives a remote transport grant, which does not cover the cost of alternative transport.  I do not know where exactly the Minister comes from, but it is very awkward for people who live five, six, seven or ten miles from the nearest school and go in a different direction to work.  Nine is quite a big number of children to leave on the side of the road and not put on a bus for them.</p></speech>

Originally the buses were 50-seaters, and over the years, as the route gets smaller or the number is reduced, the bus is reduced to a minibus.  Generally, minibuses carry more than ten people.  Sometimes there must be a cut-off.  Parents receive a grant, and in some cases they pool it to pay for another mode of transport for a group of people.  We must run a system.  We do not have an endless budget.  I wish we did, but taxpayers will not endlessly fund it and there must be a cut-off point.  At this stage the magic number is ten, and it has been well researched that this is the most efficient.  Children are not left on the side of the road and it is unfair to say they are.  I should clarify that it is probably wrong to say "free transport," because it is subsidised transport.  Most people still have to pay a contribution; they do not pay the full cost.  Efficiencies state that it does not pay - and it is not right - for the State to use taxpayers' money to fund a bus for fewer than ten people.  This is why the decision was made.</p></speech>

I do not want to single any out, and I do not know the background or the truth, but I have seen reports regarding the institutes of technology.</p><p>The institutes are important for providing access for people from socioeconomically disadvantaged areas, including rural communities.  They should be supported.  Is there an update on this front?  Did this matter form part of the considerations during the Estimates process?  Has provision been made for colleges that need support?<br/><br/>The Minister is aware of my views on the diversity of patronage model.  I am concerned that we are segregating people, perhaps even as regards race and socioeconomic background.  That is not possible in a village.  If there is just one school, it must be for everyone.  I noticed reports in <i>The Irish Times</i>about a proposal from the bishops of a model similar to the one used for community colleges at second level, in that the church would come on board.  This might be a route towards divestment and I would view it favourably.  My goal is for there to be one model of school throughout the country that involves everyone on a negotiated basis.  At what stage is the proposed model?  Is it an actual proposal yet or has there been negotiation on it?  It would be like having a community national school, but it would involve the church like the community college model does.  My understanding is that some schools might divest into that model.  Will the Minister provide an update?<br/><br/>I understand that the Minister and her Department are trying to mainstream supports for Travellers and move away from the old, somewhat <i>ad hoc </i>model.  Will there be research on the outcome?  Will this model result in more success?  I attended an event yesterday at which I gave out awards to Travellers who had got their junior certificates through a programme.  It is important that more Travellers complete school.  Has the Minister anything to say in this regard?</p></speech>

He mentioned that the issue of school transport had been addressed, but he will be aware of a situation that I raised with him last summer.  It has been determined that the nearest school is through a mountain pass that is not traversable.  The students cannot use school transport and, as such, must pay to attend a school that they have always attended.  At the time there was talk of a review of the school transport scheme with a view to revising that part of it.  How does that review stand and what are the chances of a change?</p> <p>  Another point has been raised with me a number of times about students being affected by the nearest school rule.  It relates to questions of ethos and language.  One can travel to the nearest school of ethos or language, but if the Catholic religion is one's ethos, one cannot travel to the nearest Catholic school if an education and training board, ETB, school is closer.  If one is of the Protestant denomination, however, one can pass the ETB school to attend a Protestant school.  I agree with the latter, but this difference in opportunities has been raised with me by the parents of Catholic students.  Will the Minister of State comment in this regard?</p></speech>

Members have referred to schools in their areas in terms of the building programme.  A small, four-teacher school in Dundalk that I visited last week has had an application in for the past 22 years.  The teachers share a tiny cubicle of a toilet with a kitchen counter just outside it.  I plead with the Minister and Minister of State to consider this school specifically when announcements are being made.  I say this publicly, having already said it privately.</p></speech>

Students who have special educational needs and are approaching the age of 18 years will leave school next June.  The situation has improved for the majority, in that the stipulation is that they should know where they are going by the end of June, but in order to prepare them, they need access to science and other subjects.  This should be taken into consideration.  There should be relevant and proper preparation for leaving school.  When I made inquiries recently about when a liaison was supposed to visit, I was told November.  For someone with special needs, being told in November that he or she will be leaving school as soon as next year is too great a leap.  There must be a transition, starting when children are 14 or 15 years of age, so that they can get ready and know.  Vulnerable children will be leaving school in June.  They will go from being cocooned in a school setting to day service and so on.  It is important that parents have this information.  Not enough information is being made available or preparation being done, be it through job coaches or someone in the school.</p></speech>

Deputy Ryan raised a good point.  Much of our focus in the science strategy has been on research and development, innovation, working with enterprise and third level education.  Whereas Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, is given the job of advocating for and encouraging science through primary and secondary levels, the Deputy called for an important target.  All students having access to science is a resource issue, but we should consider it in terms of the strategy to determine whether there is a way of closing the gap over a number of years.  The Deputy is the first person to mention it even though I have attended hundreds of meetings on the science strategy.  It is probably the most obvious point.  I will work on it and revert to the Deputy.  The science strategy involves a number of other Departments.  It is a good target, but solving the issue is a different story.</p> <p>  Deputy McConalogue is aware that I have met parents regarding the school bus issue.  Many saw resolutions this year, but we were unable to solve it for everyone.  The bus is not going over the mountain this year.  The route, which is based on eligible pupils, does not need to cross the gap about which everyone is concerned.  The system measures the shortest traversable route.  This is what is done across the country.  It can cause difficulty if one lives on a mountain Kerry, Cork or Donegal.  We even have the odd mountain in County Meath, or big hills as we call them.  However, the way the system measures must be equitable throughout the country.  There must be a common system.  There is no other way of doing it.  When I met the parents alongside the Deputy and others, I gave a commitment to review the situation continually to determine whether there was something obvious that we were doing wrong, whether we had missed a commonsensical approach and whether we could make tweaks that were within budget so as to improve the system.</p><p>That is an ongoing process.  Any major changes are a budgetary issue.  We are under a lot of pressure in all Departments when it comes to money.</p><p> I gave the parents a commitment but made it clear to them that there was no pending solution this year that would solve their problem.  I did give a commitment that I would try to solve their problem within the rules.  This year the matter have been resolved for most of the students and we will work on the matter for the years ahead.</p><p> A fair point was made about ethos and language.  I understood that the issue related to the minority religion.  Roman Catholicism was always very dominant in this country and it was always felt that there was access to religious instruction in such schools.  Whereas minority religions, specifically the Church of Ireland, were not catered for.  That is what the rule is about.  There are some cases ongoing about the choice of going to a Catholic school as opposed to an ETB one.  That matter is generally dealt with in legislation.  I shall take a look at the matter and will come back to the Deputy with a proper briefing.  It is generally regarded that an ETB covers all religious requirements.  I understand what has been said and I shall come back to the Deputy on the matter.  The original provision was to cater for minority religions.  </p><p> I have answered the main questions that I was asked.  I am sorry to leave but I must catch a flight.</p></speech>

I wish to make a brief point about the minor works grant which is normally paid by the end of the year.  It is ironic that we cannot get a commitment from the Minister that the payment, which is &euro;50 per student on average, will be made even though a commitment was made this week to pay &euro;27 billion which will not be available until the next government comes into office.  No commitment has been given to pay the minor works grant.  Schools are waiting for the funding and the Government could pay it.</p></speech>

We gave back &euro;25 million last year and the HEA has engaged with the sector on the issues.  We will give assistance when we get to the capital budget.  For example, the PPP model will probably be of assistance to it as well.  We have the report by Peter Cassells to come as well.  The new models were around kinds of schools and different management bodies coming together.  We are open to all of those possibilities.  For example, there are schools with joint patronage in a variety of ways, such as Educate Together with ETB.</p> <p>  With regard to the Travellers aspect, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, has proposals in that regard.  I do not think that my Department specifically measures outcomes for Travellers.  It is separate from others at this point in time. </p></speech>

The purpose of this part of the meeting is to receive a briefing from the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, ORAC, and the Irish Nationalisation and Immigration Service, INIS.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. David Costello, the Refugee Applications Commissioner, and Mr. Michael Kirranne, acting director general of INIS, along with Mr. Kevin O'Sullivan and Mr. John Roycroft.  I thank the witnesses for being here.</p><p>The format of the meeting is that I will invite the witnesses to make an opening statement of approximately five minutes, to be followed by a question and answer session with members of the committee.  Rather than having an omnibus series of questions, we will take answers immediately after questions.</p><p> Before we begin, I have to draw the attention of witnesses to the situation on privilege.  I ask them to note that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.

As part of the Government's response to the crisis, the Minister for Justice and Equality brought proposals to the Government which were considered and agreed at a special Cabinet meeting on 10 September.  The multifaceted approach that is being adopted includes the establishment of an Irish refugee protection programme, which will provide international protection to up to 4,000 people under resettlement and relocation programmes.  It is expected that this number will be augmented by further family reunifications.  The number of people in need of international protection will be kept under review.  It has also been decided to establish a new cross-departmental task force, chaired by the Department of Justice and Equality, to deal with the operational and logistical aspects of the support programme.  A range of Government Departments will be represented on and involved in the task force, which has already had its first meeting and will work with non-governmental organisations, religious bodies and local authorities.  In addition, the Red Cross will implement certain elements of the programme.  The UNHCR is also represented on the task force.  The Red Cross will specifically lead the task of engaging with public pledges of support.</p> <p>  The Government has also decided to establish emergency reception and orientation centres for the initial reception of those arriving under the relocation programme.  It has also approved the provision of an additional package of processing resources to deal with the major increases in asylum applications and other immigration cases.  The resettlement programme has already commenced.  A number of people who were selected through the UNHCR process from Lebanon have already arrived.  They form part of the overall number of 520 people involved in that programme.  The first relocation measure to be approved by the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 14 September last involves an overall number of 40,000 and Ireland will be taking 600 from that.  The next package of measures, which was agreed on 21 September, involves some 120,000 people who are in need of international protection.  The overall number that Ireland will take under that package is approximately 1,850.  The precise number has not yet been worked out, but that is the best estimate at this point.</p> <p>  As I have indicated, an interdepartmental and inter-agency task force has been established.  In addition, a number of subgroups have been established to look at specific areas.  In that context, the Department of Justice and Equality will take the lead in the process of relocating people to Ireland, in the refugee assessment process and in the establishment of the orientation centres.  Work has commenced with the Office of Public Works and the Department of Defence on looking at the available State properties that could possibly be used.  Other options will also be considered.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the city and county managers will take the lead in providing accommodation to people who are granted refugee status.  As I have said, the Red Cross will take the lead in the overall co-ordination and management of the many pledges of support that have come from the public.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will also liaise with the non-governmental organisation community.</p> <p>  My colleague, Mr. John Roycroft, has just been appointed to head up a new project and programme office that has been established in the Department.  That office will co-ordinate the various aspects of the programme across the Department.  Preparations are under way for working with our EU colleagues abroad.  The Refugee Applications Commissioner will outline the further arrangements in that regard.  The best practice for dealing with people who are arriving in these circumstances is for them to be accommodated in a single location, rather than being dispersed immediately.  It is likely that they will come with a common language and without a knowledge of Ireland.  It is considered best practice to deliver services in a co-ordinated fashion at a single centre rather than dispersing individuals immediately.  The intention is that these people will be processed through the asylum process very quickly.  After that has happened, other State bodies and agencies will take over the task of finding longer-term accommodation, etc.  That covers my opening statement.</p></speech>

I am also the deputy chairperson of the European Asylum Support Office, which is the EU agency that is responsible for asylum operational issues in the EU.  The functions of my office in Dublin are to investigate applications for refugee status from individuals, applications from refugees for their family members to join them in the State and applications for subsidiary protection.  Two forms of international protection are processed by my office - refugee status under the Geneva Convention and subsidiary protection, which is a form of protection under EU law.  The Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner employs 100 civil servants.  We also employ a panel of legal practitioners on a contract for service basis.  Both the civil servants and the legal practitioners undertake the interviews.  They will be doing the interviews for the people coming here under the relocation programme.  The actual recommendations are made to the Minister for Justice and Equality by civil servants in my office.  We also have a wide variety of other functions.  When we are processing asylum cases, we must schedule interviews, organise interpreters and carry out country of origin research.  A vast array of backroom work has to be carried out as well.  All of our case workers, panel members and other staff undergo rigorous training from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  The decisions we make in our office are subject to quality assurance by the UNHCR, which is the international agency with a mandate for protecting asylum seekers and refugees.</p> <p>  The plan for the Irish refugee protection programme is that people being relocated to Ireland from Greece and Italy will be processed by my office.  From an operational perspective, this will mean members of my office will participate in liaison teams in Italy and Greece to help in the selection of the applicants concerned and to organise their transport to Ireland and other logistical arrangements.  It will also involve processing applications.  Those applications will be processed at the emergency reception and orientation centres.  One of the specs in the establishment of these centres will be that interview facilities will have to be provided to my office.  This will involve my staff and panel members going to the office to organise the interviews.  Under the EU decision, there is a requirement for those coming in to be fingerprinted and issued with residence cards.  We will do that as well.  All the applicants concerned are from countries of serious conflict, such as Syria and Eritrea.  They are all likely to have well-founded claims for refugee status.  Accordingly, I will be able to prioritise them in line with powers I have under the Refugee Act.</p><p>Depending on the complexity of the cases involved and a range of factors, such as date of arrival and further numbers because they will be coming in groups over two years, it is anticipated that the processing of applications in the reception and orientation centres will take a number of weeks.</p><p> In terms of the readiness of my office, we have already commenced planning for this.  We have set up a working group with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, which is advising us on the approach we should take.  We intend to utilise our already well-tuned systems for interviewing, organising interpreters and undertaking country of origin research.  We have the process and the infrastructure in place.  I am also a member of the interdepartmental task force established by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  We will be working closely with the UNHCR and a UNHCR expert on international protection and refugee law will be seconded to the office to guide us in the approach we take.</p></speech>

We all have major concerns about the slaughter over the past few months and those people in Syria and other conflict areas who are looking for accommodation.  Across all parties, we all have a moral, international and legal duty to support these people.  I strongly support any measures to help the refugees and people in need at the moment, at this crisis in their lives.</p> <p>  There seems to be some confusion, nationally and internationally, about the figures.  At EU level, 120,000 have been identified as being in urgent need.  At an Irish level we are agreeing to take 4,000 over two years.  Is that the situation? </p></speech>

The overall number is 160,000.  For Ireland, there are 520 under the resettlement programme, that means taking people from the neighbouring countries involved in the UNHCR programme.  Under the two EU programmes for relocation, there is a total of 600 and 1,850.  That is our best estimate at this stage, making approximately 2,450, and 520 under resettlement.  The overall number agreed by Government is up to 4,000 and a decision on whether for the balance there will be further EU programmes for relocation or whether they will come under a resettlement programme.  It is over a two year period, as specified in the EU instruments.</p></speech>

Already many Kurds and Syrians living here are making requests.  This could be part of the strategy too.</p></speech>

The selection of people from this programme and the series of programmes is decided at EU level and by the European Asylum Support Office, EASO, and the countries involved.  They will come predominantly from Greece and Italy.  There are discussions going on at the moment as to how that selection will be made.  There were various meetings last week and this week to work out the details.</p></speech>

They are based in hotspots in Greece in Piraeus, and in Catania and Lampedusa in Italy.  It will be up to the Italian and Greek authorities to look at the caseloads of the people who have applied for asylum in those countries who have a 75% grant rate normally for refugee status based on EU statistics.  The three groups primarily being considered at the moment are Syrians, Iraqis and Eritreans.  Effectively it would be for the Italian and Greek authorities to look through those caseloads with the assistance of EU agencies and with Irish liaison officers.  The primary role will be for Greece and Italy to choose who in those caseloads, based on their territory, who have applied for asylum will come here.  We can express a preference for education, qualifications and family links, if the groups are already in Greece and Italy under the relocation programme.  The view, however, is that it has to be left to the Greek and Italian authorities to select the cases.</p></speech>

Given the current situation in this country, a red light will go on in the heads of many public representatives and councillors when they hear that these people will "lead on providing accommodation" while we have a major housing crisis and there are people in a very bad situation.  How then are we going to deal immediately with another 1,850?  Many people will ask the fundamental question about whether we can provide the accommodation and resources.</p> <p>  In respect of a single centre, I would be very cautious about having all refugees in one spot particularly when 700 or 800 parishes around the country could take ten each and they would not even be noticed.  That would cover the 4,000 before you get out of bed in the morning.  Mr. Kirrane should be very careful of any facility that will ghettoise people who come into the country after living in a conflict situation.</p></speech>

The intention and the expectation is that they will be moved quickly.  Therefore, whether there are one or more of the centres will depend on how quickly we get in the people and the number will be spread over two years so they will not all come at a particular point in time.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the local authorities have been represented on the task force and they are the bodies responsible for finding the accommodation around the country.  Several of these people have pledged accommodation and they will be followed up by the Red Cross and will be dovetailed with that, with the intention that we expect to hold people in particular centres for only the minimum amount of time necessary.</p><p>That is until such time as their refugee status has been determined.</p></speech>

They have given us a great deal more clarity around the proposals we have seen.  In particular, it is helpful to hear the specific difference between resettlement of those who come from refugee camps in Lebanon and neighbouring countries to the war zones and whose refugee status is predetermined and relocation, which relates to the bulk of people we are taking in and who are generally coming from Italy and Greece.  The witnesses have given us a good idea also of how the selection will be made and the timeframe for decision making here.  What is the timeframe for the first arrival from Italy and Greece of people who will be relocated and who come mostly from Syria and Eritrea?</p></speech>

The timetable for that will be dictated by how quickly the hotspots are established and the speed with which we get our liaison officers on the ground.  We also want to ensure that we have the appropriate accommodation here for them when they arrive.  At best estimate at this stage, we expect to see the first coming by year end.  That is not fully decided.  It is a very fluid situation at the moment and there are discussions going on at European and domestic level.  We want to ensure that by the time we receive those people, we are ready and have the centres and facilities in place for them.</p></speech>

I should have said at the outset like Deputy Finian McGrath that all of us are horrified at the terrible plight in particular of refugees from Syria arriving in Italy and Greece and at the appalling journeys they have had to make and the dreadful personal tragedies we have seen.  Arising from that, Mr. Kirrane has given us the idea that it will be months before we start to see the EU process cranked up to the point where people are being relocated from Italy and Greece.  My next question arises from that.  I have spoken to colleagues who have been in Greece and who have seen at first hand the terrible conditions Syrian families are in there, including sick people, children and older people.  I understand that in Greece and Italy, there is a reluctance to bring in international humanitarian relief efforts.  Will there be any move towards that if it seems that the relocation process is going to take some months given that there are people in serious need currently?  I am talking about the International Committee of the Red Cross and bringing in the capacity of international NGOs.  I understand that there has been a reluctance in Greece to invite them in and to acknowledge the scale of this humanitarian crisis for refugees.  Reports from Greece tell us that.</p></speech>

What I can say is that at EU level there are significant discussions on providing EU support to Greece and Italy on the ground to establish hotspots and to ensure that there are sufficient resources in place to support the front-line countries which are getting the bulk of numbers and having difficulty in coping.  At the last meeting of the JHA in Brussels, there was a discussion on providing additional funds at EU level for Greece and Italy specifically to deal with the influx and provide assistance to these countries.  Hotspots are important in terms of how quickly they will be established because that will immediately enable people to be dispersed and relocated through various other countries and the process will kick in fairly quickly.</p></speech>

My other question is for the commissioner, Mr. Costello.  In terms of the capacity within his office to determine these claims quickly when people arrive, will additional staff be required?  The commissioner said he is planning the allocation of resources now.</p></speech>

In any event, I have also been recruiting additional barristers and solicitors on a contract for services basis.  There are already 20 of them working with me and 15 more were trained in by the UNHCR two weeks ago.  A further 15 are being trained in next week.  Allowing for the fact that I have responsibility for my existing case load, which has to be dealt with also, I am reasonably happy that I will be able to process the cases expeditiously.  We expect, having regard to the nature of the countries they are from, that most will be given refugee status subject to a clear determination under the law.</p></speech>

Ireland has always been known as the country with the "c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte" and we all want that for people who have been through such a terrible time.  I am very concerned about how it is going to work and I find it all a bit vague in terms of what is before me.  I am deeply concerned about putting people into reception centres.  I have no idea about exactly how long it is envisaged that people will be in these reception centres.  My question is to Mr. Kirrane.  I come from a town that has a direct provision centre.  While the staff who work there are exceptional and go far beyond the call of duty to look after the people who live there, the system is completely flawed.  The people live in terrible situations.  Some of them have been living in mobile homes for more than ten years.  These are people who are already here, but now we are going to bring more people in on top of that.  The places people are saying may be suitable as reception centres include empty Army barracks, one of which is in my constituency.  I would not like to bring my family to live in one of those barracks.  It is not fair to people.  We also have a serious housing issue to which Deputy Finian McGrath referred.  If one puts people into a reception centre and processes them, where are we going to house them afterwards given the serious housing issue?  We are talking very vaguely whereas I would like specifics as to what kind of accommodation people will have in these reception centres.  I do not understand where Mr. Kirrane gets the idea that it is best practice to put people into a situation like that as it ghettoises them.  I would love a little more padding around that.</p></speech>

As I said previously, the intention is that people will remain in these centres for a relatively short period of time until their asylum cases have been processed.  As to the conditions, we intend that the facilities will be the best that can be provided and the intention is that they will not be in these centres for long periods.  Talk of ghettoisation is not what we have in mind.  The intention is that people will come into the centres, stay for a relatively short period and then be dispersed in small numbers throughout the country so that everybody can manage how that is dealt with from an integration perspective and so on.  The intention is not to have people in these centres for a very long period of time.  There will be a flow.  People will come, have their cases processed - it is over a two-year period - and move out and new people will come in.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's question on best practice, we have had discussions with the UNHCR on this topic and the reason for keeping people together is that it is easier and better to deliver services to people in a single group rather than trying to deliver that service in the initial stages where individuals are scattered throughout the country.</p><p>The EU instrument has a specific concern about secondary relocation, as it is called, namely, that services should be provided for people who are coming by way of benefit-in-kind, not through direct payments.  There is a concern that people who will be relocated will want to move and relocate to another European country and, therefore, the European Commission sets out in its legal instrument that this is how we should approach it.  From a humanitarian perspective and from a discussion with the UNHCR, it is regarded as best practice.  Based on the requirements set down in the legal instruments, we are obliged to deliver services by way of benefit-in-kind rather than direct payment.</p></speech>

I still do not know how long it is expected people will be in these centres.  Mr. Kirrane said it was easier and better to deliver to a group of people.  It is easier and better for the service provider, not for those who are in receipt of the service.  How many families is he talking about putting together in a centre?  Is it intended to restructure the inside of a barracks and put in family units or will there be dormitories?</p></speech>

Specifically, a task force has been established, chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in to examine the issue of transiting those who have been granted refugee or other status from the direct provision.  It has been working over the past two months and will conclude its work in the next few weeks and report to the committee.  We have examined the number of people in the system who need to transition out.  Overall, a good proportion move within three months and the vast majority move within six months.  There is a recognition that there is a need to provide more information and services to these people, and the task force is examining producing an information pack for people to help them to transition more quickly from direct provision.  People move out relatively quickly.</p> <p>  The difference between this group and those who are in the direct provision system is that the intention is that they would be processed very quickly.  Part of the difficulty with the direct provision system is that children are already established in schools or people have families, and moving to a different location where accommodation may be available is not always very easy.  We often have to wait for summer or the end of the school term before families will move.  A delay happens because people in direct provision are already established and have links to the community and, therefore, are seeking accommodation in those communities.  With this group, on the basis that there will be quick processing of their cases, there is more flexibility in terms of matching accommodation to the families in a more efficient manner.</p></speech>

The team is meeting this week to put a process in place to examine applicants from Syria, Iraq and Eritrea who have applied for asylum in Italy and Greece and to select groups from them to go to each of the States.  The selections will be in line with the numbers that have been allocated to each state, for example, Ireland will take 600 in the first decision and approximately 1,800 in the second decision.  The files will be given to individual states to confirm that they are happy with the caseload.  They will have very limited choice.  The Italians and Greeks, supported by the EU agencies, will make the choice.  While we can decide for security reasons that we do not want a person, it will be a limited input.</p> <p>  When the cases are agreed, people will come on a three-monthly basis.  We have to inform the Commission of how many we can take on a three-monthly basis.  The travel will be effected on the ground by the Italian and Greek authorities and then the people will arrive here.  We will be expecting them and they will enter the emergency centres for accommodation and any other supports they need, such as health assessments.  Around the same time, I will begin to schedule people for interviews.  I expect, given that they will be coming on a group basis rather than all the 2,400 together, that I will be able to do it on an incremental basis over a period of, say, two or three months.  Given that they are coming from areas of serious conflict, the expectation is that they will be granted refugee status.  Then, the next group will arrive.  I do not anticipate major delays in my office, unless we run into particularly challenging cases.</p></speech>

Several years ago, I visited refugee camps in Lebanon that had been occupied for decades by Palestinian refugees.  These Palestinian refugees were taking in family members who were refugees from Syria.  Refugees were taking in refugees.  I have seen at first hand the lack of resources provided to Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey which are predominantly dealing with the crisis.  The international community failed to support those countries and adequately resource them to deal with refugees.  Meanwhile, very wealthy states in the region are taking no refugees and giving no support.</p><p>There is a big picture of utter failure internationally to either resource countries who are being very generous or to challenge countries that are not doing anything.  In terms of the position here, I welcome the confirmation from the Government that we will take 4,000 refugees in the next few years but I have some concerns.  In regard to the first issue, we need to win hearts and minds among our own citizens.  Obviously the witnesses have heard the commentary around "we have a housing crisis and we need to address that" or "we still have an unemployment crisis" and so on.  We have also heard from President Tusk in his state of the Union address that the EU would provide a subsidy of around &euro;6,000 per refugee and that the Government would then seek to ensure that whatever it spends on the relocation programmes would not be factored into the usual budgetary procedure.  In my opinion we can do both.  I hold the strong view that we can say to our citizens that we can address the housing crisis, the economic recovery and take a reasonable share of refugees but how does one reassure the citizens listening?</p></speech>

It has established a website, which was launched on Monday, to garner all of these offers.  We are aware of a website called <i>uplift.ie</i>.  We have had discussions with the NGOs who organised it.  The indications were that there were somewhere around 15,000 offers of help.  All of these may not be specific accommodation offers.  There is a range of support.  That was the indication received when that website was established.  The intention is that the Red Cross will garner all of those and look and see where in the country they are to try to match where services are required with the offers that have been made.<br/><br/>On the broader question, the intention is to harness the support of NGOs at local level to deal with matters of integration.

All right-thinking people want to reach out and deal with people in the current emergency and the people who are making these arduous and sometimes dangerous journeys.  Behind all that, however, are stories of particular persecuted groups in the Middle East.  I am thinking of Christian groups in some areas, non-Christian, non-Muslim groups such as the Yazidis, Muslim minorities in some cases, and, in certain areas, not necessarily the people making the journey but possibly those who have no future in their Middle Eastern homelands, if one is to take a hard <i>realpolitik</i>view of the situation.  It seems to be the intention of the EU to deal with those who are arriving on our shores and Mr. Kirrane has said the Greeks and the Italians will for the most part make the allocation.  Is it a harsh fact, therefore, given that the EU has limited capacity to absorb people, that some of those persecuted groups may very well be left behind in all of this?</p></speech>

While 4,000 is a big number, it is a very small one in the overall scale of what is being talked about.  There are two programmes, one of which is resettlement.  We work closely on the ground with the UNHCR which selects people from camps or on the borders, particularly in Lebanon, to come under a resettlement programme.  It is a two-track approach, one to deal with our EU colleagues in respect of relocation and the other to deal and work with the UNHCR on taking people directly from the immediate circumference of war-torn Syria.</p></speech>

It does allow that to be taken into account, but at the end of the day it will be for the Italians and the Greeks to select the cases, working with the states concerned.</p></speech>

Operating on the principle, as I said informally earlier, that no question should be taboo, the EU has acknowledged that there are legitimate questions about security.  Given that the Italians and Greeks will allocate people to different countries, it is for those countries to object if there are security reasons to object.  What steps can be taken by Ireland in that situation?  How real is our ability to establish whether some of the people who might be coming, or allocated to us, would be a security threat in the short or long term?</p></speech>

What percentage is that of the overall cost?  I ask because we need to be able to say to citizens the housing crisis and unemployment will be addressed by Government but that this is a separate budget that is part of our international responsibility.  Ireland contributes hundreds of millions of euro every year to overseas aid, for example.  It is part of our responsibility to the international community.  I want to get a sense of whether clear explanatory notes have been prepared.  For example, the question I asked first related to the suggestion by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, that he would ask that whatever expenditure was deployed on this would not be taken into consideration as part of normal budgetary calculations.  What position is all of that in at this stage?</p></speech>

We are working with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the overall cost for the Department in respect of the provision of this service.  This includes accommodation, resources to process and so on.  Other Departments, whether the Department Education and Skills, the Department of Health or local authorities, are working on the cost of their elements.  We are getting good support from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in regard to our Estimates discussions around this because it is recognised that additional resources are needed to make this happen.</p></speech>

Mr. Kirrane spoke about working with NGOs.  For example, the Community Workers' Co-operative has published a very good submission on good practice in terms of integration, assimilation, and interacting with local communities in advance.  One model that was brought to my attention was in Southill in Limerick with the Congolese or African community a number of years ago.  That is a really good model to look at.  Has Mr. Kirrane looked at previous best practice?  Is there a plan in place if, for example, 4,000 refugees are distributed to 40 different locations throughout the State, presumably larger urban areas?  Who is he talking to in terms of NGOs?  What models has he looked at that have worked well in the past?</p></speech>

The decision on the numbers coming was only made last week.  The subgroups under the task force, which I mentioned, will be looking at each of those areas, including how best to engage with local communities and best practice in respect of previous programmes that were run for refugees, with a view to picking what is best from those.  Certainly that is the intention over the coming months.</p></speech>

It is universally agreed that our direct provision system is a poor one because of the length of time people must remain in it.  Uniquely in the European Union, we do not allow asylum seekers to work.  That means in some cases people have been stuck for more than ten years without the right to work, which is a poor record.  We now have a situation where Mr. Kirrane has explained that countries are identified, of which Syria is one, as I assume are Afghanistan and other such countries, whose citizens will be fast-tracked for asylum, going through the UNHCR and our system.  What does that say to people who have been waiting ten years in the direct provision system and are still languishing, unable to work and living on &euro;19 per week?  Will the situation of the thousands of such people be addressed?  Will there be a more consistent humanitarian approach to those who are already here, looking at the new numbers coming in?</p></speech>

For this year to date, the number of asylum claims is around 2,600.  There are many people in the system who are relatively new to it.  There is recognition from the working group on direct provision that the system is too slow and that the length of time people spend in it is the primary issue.  The Government recently allocated additional resources to speed up the processing of those cases and we intend to move quickly on that.  In addition, the international protection Bill will be published in a matter of weeks.  This will introduce a single procedure which brings together into a single process the various stages of the process that are currently done in a linear fashion.  The intention is that this will speed up the process.  All aspects of somebody's protection application and their humanitarian leave to remain will be treated at the outset in one process, rather than having a linear process where there will inevitably be delay because one process must conclude before the next begins.  The intention is to increase the rate of processing significantly through both of those measures.</p></speech>

In general, people have greatly welcomed the announcement that 4,000 refugees will come here on the resettlement programmes.  I am just wondering about family reunification.  There is such immense goodwill and I know that under the Syrian humanitarian admission programme currently in operation, only one in three of those who applied - about 114 family members - were able to join their family in Ireland.  Will the family reunification for people coming in under these new programmes be operated swiftly and perhaps with higher levels of admission?  I understand the witnesses may not be able to answer that at present.</p></speech>

Irish asylum law, namely, the Refugee Act 1996, provides for family reunification.  As well as enhancing our claims processing, we have to enhance our family reunification sections.</p><p>This must be done to ensure that, when those who are relocated are granted status and apply for family reunification under the law, their cases are processed.  We must crank up that part of our service as well.</p></speech>

States can only object on security grounds, but they have a right under the directive to feed their interests into the process in terms of applicants' specific qualifications, characteristics and family, cultural and social ties so as to assist with integration.  It is possible for Ireland to indicate in that limited way that we want people with, for example, English language skills if they are available.  However, that is only a desire and it is for the Greek and Italian authorities to make the decisions.  There is a little bit of flexibility.</p></speech>

We use biometric fingerprinting.  Under Irish and EU law and the two decisions in question, all asylum seekers are required to provide their fingerprints.  It is meant to support the operation of what is known as the Dublin regulation, which enables decisions to be made as to which state processes an asylum application.  The Dublin regulation will not apply in this instance because cases that would normally be for Greece and Italy to process will instead come to Ireland.  However, we will still need to take fingerprints so that the relevant EU IT systems are marked to the effect that the applicants are now the responsibility of Ireland, Germany or wherever.  People are fingerprinted electronically in my office.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-30a.508" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015093000002#AA00900"><p>I fully support performance budgeting and the development of clear and transparent output reporting.  I believe this will assist the Committee in better considering the high-level outputs and provide a solid basis for examining what has been achieved.  I will set out the Department's key considerations in framing output targets, but first I would like to provide some context for the current position.</p><p>The alignment of expenditure programmes with output targets and their publication within the Revised Estimates volume was an important development, and I am pleased to note that the committee may have some useful suggestions as to how these output targets may be improved.  My Department has been engaging with the committee secretariat to set out the context for the current indicators and discuss possible future developments.  The expertise on defence matters rests within the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces, including the identification of appropriate output targets.  I understand that the pros and cons of possible approaches were discussed at length.  However, I will not enlarge upon these discussions beyond what may not have been fully reflected in the brief that the committee received from the secretariat.</p><p>The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has responsibility for publishing the Revised Estimates volume, and my Department has had extensive engagement with that Department in framing the current measures.  This built upon the work that was previously undertaken in preparing annual output statements.  The space made available for output targets and associated reporting within the Revised Estimates volume has informed the approach used by the Department and has required a reduction in the amount of information that was previously provided.  However, this information is still reported within the annual report of the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces, and my Department has provided much of this information for inclusion in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's publication <i>Ireland Stat</i>, although this has not been activated by the Department as yet.  In this context, there is a significant amount of performance information produced and publicly available.  The output targets currently in use reflect those factors as well as the nature of defence provision and critical success factors that must be considered.  </p><p>Security is the bedrock on which a State's economic, political and social well-being is built.  Security challenges require a whole-of-Government response, and there are a range of Departments and agencies with security responsibilities that contribute to the State's overarching security framework.  The defence contribution encompasses defence of the State from external armed aggression, which is a contingency; the defence contribution to domestic security; and the defence contribution to international peace and security.  In addition, defence capabilities are used to provide a broad range of non-security supports which maximise the value for money of defence expenditure and reduce duplication of service delivery across the State.  The recently published White Paper provides a useful framework for considering those outputs which are critical to the successful delivery of the defence mission, which is &quot;To provide for the military defence of the State, contribute to national and international peace and security and fulfil all other roles assigned by Government.&quot;  The White Paper sets out a comprehensive assessment of the security environment and any threats that arise.  The ongoing monitoring of the security environment is a key requirement that has a major influence on the defence policy response, operational requirements and associated capability planning.</p><p>As outlined in the White Paper, Ireland continues to strongly support the multilateral system of collective security represented by the UN and the primary role of the UN Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security.  The EU is also a major player on the international stage, with an increasing capacity to influence the international security environment using all of the instruments at its disposal, including economic, diplomatic, political and military instruments, known as the &quot;comprehensive approach&quot;.  Within the framework of multilateralism and collective security, and in support of international peace and security, the White Paper states that Ireland will continue to contribute to a range of comprehensive and collaborative security arrangements within the EU, the UN and the OSCE, and bilaterally with other states.  This ongoing policy development represents a key defence output that contributes to Ireland's security.  Domestically, the continued refinement of the State's emergency planning framework and further development of defence capabilities in support of other Departments and agencies are also key policy areas for the Department.</p><p>As set out in the White Paper, the role of the Defence Forces reflects the Government's policy requirements and the operations that the Defence Forces may be required to undertake.  The roles have been updated to take account of new developments or those which have acquired an increased importance.  Many of these operations are demand-led and reflect the contingent nature of many defence operations - those that are dependent on need, or those that are subject to Government requirements, such as overseas missions.  As such, the target is to meet demand when required.  This is the nature of defence business and defence outputs.  </p><p>The general approach within defence is to develop memorandums of understandings with those Departments and agencies that may require defence assistance.  In many cases, this provides a means to clarify call-out procedures and the availability of defence assistance.  However, due to the demand-led nature of most of these services, they do not contain specific targets for numbers of operations.  The exception to this is the annual control plan agreed with the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, which sets out Naval Service fisheries patrol day targets and Air Corps fisheries patrol flight targets.  The committee will see from the figures that we have some challenges in terms of outputs as regards Naval Service fisheries patrol days this year, for understandable reasons.  I will go into those later.  </p><p>The White Paper also considers future capability requirements.  It defines military capability as the ability to attain operational success in a given scenario, achieving desired effects under specified standards and conditions through ways and means.  It consists of a conceptual component, a moral component and a physical component.</p><p>There are a range of actions across the Department and the Defence Forces which are required to develop and maintain military capabilities.  These actions include, but are not limited to, investment in new equipment, education and training, maintenance and development of infrastructure, ongoing review of military doctrine, the development of appropriate human resources, HR, policies and the development of regulatory frameworks.  These actions are internal processes that contribute to capability outputs but are not capability outputs in themselves.  There is no universally accepted metric for military capability, which is a key output for Defence Vote 36.  This is a challenge for all countries including those with well developed performance reporting mechanisms.  The Department has closely examined the approach in other countries, such as New Zealand, which I know this committee has examined, where capability reporting is underpinned by a broad performance reporting framework including annual reports, with a view to identifying appropriate metrics.</p><p> Defence Vote 36 outputs are delivered through a single programme with three strategic dimensions which are interdependent.  First, defence policy, which is policy outputs; second, ensuring the capacity to deliver, which is capability outputs; and third, Defence Forces operations, which is operational outputs.  This provides a balanced perspective on defence outputs, all of which are critical to success.  My Department has engaged with the committee secretariat in reviewing this categorisation and I am satisfied that this represents a solid approach to categorising defence outputs and is not inconsistent with the approach taken internationally.</p><p> The refinement of output targets remains a work in progress, and I particularly welcome the signals from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that more space will be forthcoming in the 2016 Revised Estimates to report on outputs.  This will broaden the options for the Department in developing appropriate targets, and I intend to take this opportunity to expand reporting on military capabilities.</p><p> The current measurements of performance on Vote 35 Army Pensions are calculated to show the number of military pensioners in payment plus associated retirement, disability and dependants&rsquo; awards granted during the year and other related metrics.  This reflects the overall annual caseload activity or throughput of the programme.  Such performance measures are relevant and appropriate, bearing in mind the demand-driven and non-discretionary nature of the Vote and the fact that there are no goods or services provided to third parties.</p><p> Activity and output under the programme show an underlying upward trend reflecting the increased caseload arising from the continued rise in the number of military pensioners year on year, and a corresponding increase in related activity generally.  In that regard, the Department&rsquo;s military pensions output targets for 2013 and 2014, and for 2015 to date, were achieved and I am advised that the Department has no significant concerns around performance or service delivery of Defence Forces pension benefits to beneficiaries.  Following its engagement with the secretariat, the Department is very much of the view that the two output measures currently in use have merit and should continue in use, subject to review in light of the imminent transfer of the military pensions payroll processing function to the Civil Service Payroll Shared Services Centre, which is under the aegis of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p> I am not suggesting that we are perfect.  I believe we can and should work with the committee to try to modernise and change, where appropriate.  If the members have suggestions, we are all ears.  If we can produce better metrics that are effective at practically assessing improvements year on year, I am open to implementing them but I am not open to doing things for the sake of looking good.  </p><p> We have a White Paper now.  From a policy point of view the performance indicators for me will be related to how we deliver on the White Paper and the choices it contains.  The nature of defence, which is very different from many other Departments, is demand led.  We need to be ready to respond to an ask of Government or the State, whether that be at home or abroad, often in very difficult circumstances.  What we do control are issues such as fleet replacement programmes in the Naval Service.  We have a very good outcome from the capital plan announced yesterday where, over the next six years, we will see an increase in capital expenditure for defence of &euro;65 million, which is the first increase the Department of Defence has seen for very many years.  We are in a place now that can see the delivery of the ambition in the White Paper on Defence, and I intend on being proactive in terms of making that happen as soon as possible.  The more we can engage with this committee in terms of measuring performance as we go along around efficiency, management and performance, the better but we must make sure that any system or metrics we are putting in place are real in terms of their measurement and that they are relevant to an Irish situation as opposed to simply replicating a New Zealand model, which is a country that has very different challenges from Ireland.</p><p> We had this discussion this morning in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and they were also using a New Zealand model in terms of potential metrics for the future, despite the fact that New Zealand agriculture and Irish agriculture have fundamentally different challenges in terms of implementing rural development programmes and the Common Agricultural Policy.  New Zealand does not have any of that.  We should try to design together better metrics for Irish based challenges, and we are open to any suggestions members might have in that area.</p></speech>

I am conscious that we are beginning a new process and, to a certain extent, all of us are finding our way in terms of that process.  I do not know if any of the members would profess to be experts in the area of performance targets or indicators but the Minister's point, which is difficult to argue with, that there is no universally accepted metric for military capability is understandable.  At the same time, given that military capability is at the centre of what the Minister's Department does, we would like to hear his view on the New Zealand guidance.  Is it the correct way of setting out performance targets?  That has been the basis for discussion already between the Minister's Department and committee secretariat staff.  I would like to hear the Minister's view on that.  First, is there an acceptance by the Minister and his Department that the New Zealand guidelines is the correct way to go?  Second, would his Department have issues about the way the guidance has been applied to the performance measures?  It is easy to measure performance in terms of capital spent but in the area of military capability, and perhaps in some other areas of activity, it is far more difficult.  For example, the Minister alluded to the White Paper, and we commend him on all the work he has done in bringing that forward, but is the production of the White Paper an appropriate output measure to be considered or does it simply set a target and indicate a policy direction for the Department?</p></speech>

One of the frustrations we had is that the Revised Estimate that shows figures for the Department and then outputs is all on one page.  If we consider what New Zealand does, it has an outputs document, which is almost like an annual White Paper in itself, in terms of outputs across defence, with a series of metrics and performance indicators.  We have no problem with that because we do it anyway for our annual reports and if we could build it into a reporting mechanism that involved the committee and allowed us produce much more volume in terms of what we are trying to achieve, I would have no issue with that.  For example, I see the White Paper as a policy framework that needs to be implemented over the next ten years.</p><p>We will have an annual report on the White Paper each year, and I would love to be able to be here to speak to the committee about what we are achieving, changing and improving through the implementation of the White Paper.  It would be a very good performance metric and benchmark for us.  We are looking to increase significantly the size of the Army Ranger Wing.  We need to be questioned each year on how it is being done.  We have problems with recruitment in the Reserve.  This year, 179 people have joined the Reserve.  We have recruitment challenges, and we should be measured and tested against what we think we can do in a 12-month period and what we actually do.  A metric is already there for the Naval Service's role in fisheries protection with regard to hours at sea.  It is a good metric, but this year there is a good reason as to why, knowing we have a problem, we have decided to reprioritise.  This is what the Department of Defence must do.  If people are dying in the Mediterranean and we have ships that can save them, I am sorry, but that is a bigger priority for me than fisheries protection, and I make no apologies for it.  We have had other challenges, such as the late delivery of the <i>LE James Joyce</i>and an historical asbestos issue which needed to be resolved.  We have had a number of problems that have had an impact, but this is a good example of a benchmark against which we can be judged.  If we do not meet the benchmark I will need to produce good reasons.  If we could create other metrics and measurements for other outputs for the Department of Defence we should try to do so, but they need to be relevant to what we are actually doing.</p></speech>

How is military capability measured?  If a series of targets is provided, the committee can then ascertain whether the targets have been met.</p></speech>

If we decide to maintain a presence in the Mediterranean for a while, there is a capability requirement to do so.  Our Air Corps does not have significant defence capacity, but it is not in our mission statement to have it.  Other countries will measure it very differently.  The vast majority of people in our Permanent Defence Force are in the Army, and the focus is very much on overseas missions and assisting other arms of the State in the roles they have here.  Capability is very much designed around UNIFIL, UNDOF and training missions in Mali.  Capabilities must be framed in the context of the risk assessment and the response to it.  If we decided not to have any more overseas missions, our capability measurements would be totally different.  We would not need Mowags and the type of armour we use would be different.  That is what we mean when we say there is no set metric for capabilities, because every country has a different focus for defence.  Ireland is very different from our closest neighbour and from other countries.  Ireland is a country that is similar in size to New Zealand and Israel, but the capabilities in terms of measurement are obviously entirely different, depending on the challenges faced.</p></speech>

The combined Estimates for defence and Army pensions for 2015 provided for gross expenditure of approximately &euro;898 million.  Of that sum, &euro;677 million was allocated to Vote 36, which is the Defence Vote.  More than 70% of the Defence Vote goes towards providing for the pay and allowances of up to 10,500 public service employees.  The remaining non-pay allocation provides mainly for the replacement and maintenance of essential equipment and operational costs.</p> <p>  The Army pensions Vote makes provision for retired pay, pensions, allowances and gratuities payable to or in respect of former members of the Defence Forces.  The 2015 Estimate provides a gross sum of &euro;221 million for the Army pensions Vote as a whole.  More than &euro;211 million of this allocation covers expenditure on all superannuation benefits for former members of the Permanent Defence Force and their dependants.  It is primarily demand-driven and non-discretionary.</p> <p>  Today&rsquo;s meeting is primarily about expenditure relating to 2015, and I take this opportunity to reflect on the importance, both financially and operationally, of having an effective strategic planning framework in place.  In a changing security climate, it was imperative that a strategic assessment of the security environment was undertaken.  This assessment ensures Ireland&rsquo;s defence policy framework is in a position to respond to emerging security challenges and contribute to international peace and security.  After an extensive collaborative process involving multiple stakeholders, I was very pleased to launch the White Paper on Defence in August.  This document reflects the current realities faced within the wider defence and security policy environment, acknowledges the increasingly complex nature of security threats in the world today and emphasises the need for a comprehensive response.</p> <p>   The White Paper sets out the roles the Government has assigned to the Defence Forces and considers associated capability requirements.  It sets out proposals on the replacement of major equipment platforms for the next decade and other priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service.</p><p><font color="#002041">It </font>provides clear direction and a pragmatic approach to defence and ensures that we can continue to rely on the service provided by the Defence Forces to the security of the State.  I would also like to highlight some of the other defence-related milestones and achievements throughout the year. <br/><br/>As of 15 September 2015, Ireland was contributing 482 Defence Forces personnel to 12 overseas missions throughout the world.  This level of overseas deployment reflects Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing contribution to international peace and security.  The main overseas missions in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, with 198 personnel, and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF, with 141 Defence Forces personnel.  The Minister of State is on his way out to visit them at the moment.<br/><br/>In response to the refugee crisis in the Mediterranean and following Government approval, Ireland&rsquo;s overseas deployments now also include the Naval Service deployment to the Mediterranean.  The <i>LE Eithne</i>arrived in the south central Mediterranean on 23 May 2015, to assist the Italian authorities in humanitarian search and rescue operations.  The specific role of the Irish naval vessel is to provide a search and rescue capability and to undertake humanitarian rescue operations at sea in the Mediterranean.<br/><br/>The<i>LE Eithne</i>, during her deployment to the mission from 18 May to 17 July, rescued a total of 3,377 migrants from the waters between Libya and Sicily.  The <i>LE Niamh</i>was subsequently deployed and to date has been involved in the rescue of 4,020 migrants.  In total, 7,397 migrants have been rescued by the Irish Naval Service to date.  I think that number has risen since this was written.  Undoubtedly, this is a tragic and highly complex issue but the actions of both the <i>LE Eithne</i>and <i>LE Niamh</i>have highlighted the capability and commitment of Ireland&rsquo;s Naval Service to respond effectively to crisis situations.  Their outstanding efforts have saved lives, and, to that end, I am pleased to say that the <i>LE Samuel Beckett</i>, which departed the naval base, Haulbowline last week, will continue to assist the Italian authorities in this ongoing humanitarian operation.  In the event of any further deployment beyond November 2015, I will revert to Government with proposals. <br/><br/>The White Paper reaffirmed my commitment to maintaining the permanent Defence Force personnel at a level of 9,500.  In that regard, a very active recruitment campaign is under way.  Already, in 2015, 194 personnel have completed, or continue, in training, and that number is expected to increase significantly by year end.  In addition, there have been 517 promotions across all ranks of the permanent Defence Force to date in 2015.<br/><br/>The Defence Forces continue to provide a military operational response to both the civil power and civil authorities, as required.  This is a vital public service role which highlights the attributes of the Defence Forces across a broad spectrum of areas including prisoner escorts, explosive ordnance disposal duties, air ambulance services, emergency aeromedical support roles, search and rescue missions and maritime patrols.<br/><br/>As we advance towards 2016, I expect the Defence Forces to play a very central role in the commemoration events that will take place.  Already in 2015, under the decade of centenaries commemoration programme 2012-22, the Defence Forces have participated in several events including the State commemoration of the funeral of O&rsquo;Donovan Rossa in August.  Additionally, the Defence Forces recently commenced the delivery of the national flag to all primary schools in the country.  This event started on 14 September 2015 and is scheduled to be completed before Proclamation day, 15 March 2016.<br/><br/>The recently published White Paper on defence also considered the further development of the Reserve Defence Force, RDF.  It outlines a range of measures which will be progressed during the next few years.  These measures build on the value for money review on the RDF and aim to improve on the overall effectiveness of the RDF.  They should also contribute significantly to recruitment.  If the RDF is doing more, more people will want to be part of it.  The truth is that it is more difficult to get into the RDF now.  There are fitness and other tests.  When people do get in, they are well trained and they are a resource we need to use more and will use more.<br/><br/>The naval vessel replacement programme has continued, and the <i>LE Samuel Beckett </i>was added to the fleet in 2015, joining the LE James Joyce which was delivered in April 2014.  A third ship purchased under this programme, the<i>LE William Butler Yeats</i>, is scheduled for delivery in July 2016.  The progressive and prudent approach taken to these purchases is testament to the value for money ethos prevailing within the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces, with these vessels all procured without recourse to additional funding.  This has been achieved by careful management of financial resources and re-allocation of funding to meet additional requests for equipment and supports.<br/><br/>The Department works closely with the Defence Forces to ensure that they retain the capabilities to fulfil all roles assigned by Government, both at home and overseas.  In this context, the 2015 allocation allowed for the acquisition and upgrading of a range of priority defensive equipment.<br/><br/>The capital envelope for defence also makes provision for infrastructure development works.  The 2015 Estimate made provision for expenditure of &euro;18.5 million on new building works and ongoing maintenance of existing buildings and also included funding for the military archives building at Cathal Brugha Barracks.<br/><br/>Over the 2016-21 timeframe of the capital investment programme, significant capital funding will be expended on replacement programmes for defensive equipment across the Army, Naval Service and the Air Corps, including payments arising under the naval vessel replacement programme.  It will also provide for the ongoing refurbishment of a diverse Defence property portfolio and the provision of replacement or additional facilities, where required.  This capital funding envelope also provides for the development of a new institute for peace support and leadership training building on the UN training school in the Curragh.  The institute is intended to provide a new international resource in the area of conflict resolution, conflict prevention and peace-building.  If the committee wants to set up a separate meeting on that particular issue, I would be very happy to do it.  We have a very ambitious approach to developing something very special in Ireland over the next few years and I would happily spend an hour or two talking to the committee about it if it wants that.<br/><br/>Before concluding,  I want to refer again to Vote 35 - Army Pensions.  This Vote, which is demand-led, has funded the payment of military pension benefits of all categories to some 12,000 pensioners, including retirement pensions and gratuities, disability pensions, spouses&rsquo; and children&rsquo;s pensions.  Owing to the continued underlying increase in the numbers of retirement pensioners being paid from the Vote and the ongoing impact on pension payments of the exceptionally high numbers of retirements on pension in previous years, a net shortfall of some &euro;9 million is projected for 2015, as it was last year. Therefore, I would like to advise the committee that a Supplementary Estimate will be required later in the year. Similar to other years, this shortfall on the Army Pensions Vote will be met from savings within the Defence Vote.  We are not asking for extra money, we will make the necessary savings and arrangements in our own Vote 36 to be able to deal with this, as we did last year, and we debated it then.<br/><br/>In summary, across the combined Votes, expenditure is broadly on target.  Provision has been made to ensure the required funding is available within the Defence Vote to meet the Army pensions shortfall without recourse to any further Exchequer funding requirement.  If anyone has any comments or questions I will happily try to address them.</p></speech>

I will start with the issue on which he finished, namely, the pensions Vote.</p><p>Without going into specifics, a matter was brought to my attention last week on which I will seek information from the Minister at a later stage.  I understand there was a fire on a naval vessel in the 1960s which affected two individuals and I have received correspondence from an individual on that subject.  I am sure the Minister is aware of this issue and I would appreciate if it would be possible for him to outline his position on it either to me or through the Chair.  I have no desire to go into the specifics here in committee but perhaps the Minister would be so kind as to provide me with his position.<br/><br/>In respect of the Minister's comments and those of the Chair, as an Irish person one must be immensely proud to observe the absolutely critical mission the Naval Service is completing in the Mediterranean at present.  I believe the number to date is 7,400 people and I am sure that as the ink dried on that printout, the numbers had increased.  I echo the sentiments of the Chair in commending all the personnel involved in what is a critical lifesaving mission in the Mediterranean.  Any person who is on board Irish territory in the Mediterranean while carrying out his or her duties can return home rightly proud of his or her involvement in the saving of so many thousands of lives under what I am sure have been horrific circumstances from time to time in recent months.<br/><br/>On the issue of the fleet, I was not aware that the name, the <i>LE William Butler Yeats</i>, had been selected.  As I had not been following that, it is nice to know.  I am aware the Naval Service has eight vessels at present, the newest of which is the <i>LE Samuel Beckett</i>and the oldest being the <i>LE Aoife</i>, unless I am mistaken.  I am guessing this from its designation, P22.</p></speech>

Very well.  I presume the retirement or the standing down of some of these vessels is envisaged over a period and perhaps the Minister can outline to members the proposals in this regard and the timeframe being considered because I appreciate some of these vessels are getting on a bit.  In addition, as part of the enormous amount of money that has been both expended and saved in the procurement of new vessels, I am sure there is an ongoing fleet replacement programme.  Perhaps the Minister can outline the Department's proposals for future replacements of older vessels currently in the fleet such as the <i>LE Eithne</i>and the<i>LE Aisling</i>.  I do not know how old the <i>LE Orla</i>and the<i>LE Ciara</i>are but the Minister might inform me in his response.</p><p>I echo the sentiments of the Chair regarding the retirement of the Chief of Staff - I was going to say Secretary General - and commend the work he completed in recent years.  Over the 25 or 30 years since I was a young boy, I have always been greatly interested in the conduct of the Naval Service, the Air Corps and the Army, particularly in respect of peacekeeping and similar matters.  They rightly are a source of immense pride among Irish citizens.  The Minister has rolled out a recruitment programme, which is welcome, and obviously, as has been mentioned, fleet renewal across all three services will be improved.</p><p>I revert to a matter on which I have touched three or four times as we have discussed the Estimates over the years, namely, the ministerial air transport service, MATS.  Is there an update, for instance, on the aircraft that currently is in the United States?  Has it been sold?  I believe it has been but perhaps the Minister can update the joint committee in this regard and on the sort of money the Department might have received for that aircraft.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-30a.539" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015093000002#EE00500"><p>They all are good questions.  First, in respect of the fleet replacement programme, the White Paper states we want to have a minimum of eight ships in the fleet.  We got a little bit caught out this year, if I am honest, as earlier in the year we had decommissioned the<i>LE Aoife</i>without having the<i>LE James Joyce</i>available and as a consequence were without one ship for a couple of months.  We then also made a commitment to send a ship to the Mediterranean.  The<i>LE Eithne</i>, which basically has been the flagship for the Irish Naval Service for some time, was the first to go and we had an asbestos issue with one of the older ships.  However, all those problems have been resolved and the fleet is back up and running fully.</p><p>The Deputy is correct in that the <i>LE Aoife</i>was the oldest ship in the fleet.  It is to become part of the Maltese Navy, probably for the next five years, while the Maltese seek to design and build a new vessel.  However, that ship will be put to good use in a part of the world that badly needs capacity at sea, that is, in the Mediterranean.  That vessel has been in Cork Harbour in a dockyard while getting a thorough survey and assessment as well as a bit of work done before going to the Mediterranean.  However, I understand it will be leaving within the next three weeks.  This is a big deal for the Maltese authorities who will be sending some of their senior military personnel to Cork for the ship's departure.  The oldest ship in the fleet at present is the <i>LE Aisling</i>, which was built in 1980.  Thereafter, the <i>LE Eithne</i>, the <i>LE Ciara</i>and the <i>LE Orla</i>are all from 1984.  When the<i>LE William Butler Yeats</i>arrives next summer, the<i>LE Aisling</i>will be decommissioned.  The next ship we will look potentially to replace may well be the<i>LE Eithne</i>.  The capacity of that ship is different from all the other ships in that it is the only ship with a helicopter landing pad, although it is not used any more.  Consequently, the Department is examining the possibility of what is described as a blue-green ship, which is a larger vessel that would have more capacity than simply being an offshore patrol vessel such as the<i>LE Samuel Beckett</i>, the<i>LE James Joyce</i>or the<i>LE William Butler Yeats</i>.  Even though they are really good at what they do and are almost ideal ships for what is needed in Irish waters, I believe we need to have one ship in the fleet that is slightly larger, has more capacity, has a helipad and can play a role both at home and abroad that perhaps is more comprehensive than is possible with some of the other vessels.  There now is enough in the capital programme, the Government having agreed it and published it yesterday, to be able to consider making replacements.  Decisions must be made in respect of budgeting as to whether the<i>LE Eithne</i>is to be the first one or whether the <i>LE Orla</i>or the <i>LE Ciara</i>or both should come first.  It takes about three years to decide that a ship is to be replaced.  One then goes to tender for its design and build and then one actually builds it and our engineers are part of that.  Am I under some time pressure?</p></speech>

On the MATS question, as the Deputy has asked this previously, there has been a decision by the Government that the service will operate with the single aeroplane available to it.  It has some range issues and so on but the decision has been that it is what the service will operate with for the foreseeable future.  Were a new Government to make a different decision, that would be a political decision rather than an operational one.  I think there are other priorities, quite frankly, in terms of defence expenditure at present.  However, that would be a decision, as I stated, for any new Government in a few months time.</p></speech>

I join Deputy Farrell in complimenting everybody in the Naval Service on the work that is being done in the Mediterranean.  It is quite extraordinary and the Irish people at large are appreciative and proud of what their Naval Service is doing there.  Is the Minister confident the Government will agree to extend that activity beyond November?</p><p> In addition to the valuable work being done there, can we do more in our international role in addressing the asylum and refugee issue?  We can let it be known that along with what we are doing here indigenously to accommodate refugees, we are also very active daily in a way many other countries are not in this rescue mission.  Some of us are conscious of that but I do not know whether the message has gone abroad that we are daily doing something about that problem.  Does the Minister envisage any position in which our naval personnel can do something of a systematic nature to address human trafficking and abuse?</p><p> I am glad the Minister mentioned the reserves and he has made some very positive statements since taking office about the reserves and their role.  None the less, when I speak to reservists, they tell me their practical experience on an ongoing basis is one of impediments being put in their way, with recruitment falling short because of practical obstacles.  It was suggested to me recently that a group of people who passed the various tests which are correctly posed to those seeking to enter the reserves did not get in because the required Garda clearance for the group - there are 100 people - was not sent to the Garda authorities in time.  Neither the potential reservists nor the Garda have control over this and this would not suggest a very positive or proactive approach to recruitment on the part of the authorities with direct responsibility.  I ask that we bring in representatives of the reservists to hear directly from them, given that we had a very useful meeting with them some time ago.</p><p> I look forward to a further opportunity to debate with the Minister on the capital investment programme.  I commend the purchasing of naval vessels and the value for money in that respect.  What the Minister outlined today in that case is perfectly acceptable.  The Minister spoke about the peace support and leadership training for the Curragh, and I made a submission on that in the Green Paper.  Our party is very strongly committed to that.  I am conscious that 100,000 personnel are deployed by the United Nations at any given time, which is a lot of personnel in need of training.  Our expertise in peace support, leadership and military diplomacy gives us a capacity to meet a particular demand.  I would love to hear from the Minister at a later date about how ambitious he is for that initiative and how he sees it developing.</p><p> I note the Minister has achieved further savings.  The Department of Defence has been outstanding in this regard and I salute all the officials there in how they have achieved savings.  Nevertheless, those savings are being achieved against a background where we are told continually that the people serving in our Defence Forces are heavily dependent on family income supplement and they contend with very poor pay and conditions.  Given the savings, does the Minister accept something substantial must be done in terms of pay and conditions for serving members?</p></speech>

There are many good questions there, to be fair.  On the Mediterranean mission, the <i>LE Samuel Beckett</i>is due to be back on 5 December.  It is another rotation of approximately eight weeks.  The plan now is that at that point we will not replace the vessel because the anticipation is there may not be much traffic at that time of the year because the weather may make passage difficult.  I certainly anticipate that, because of the success of the mission, we will send a ship back there early in the spring, perhaps in February or March.  Having said that, we will assess the issue and if the Italians say they need us to stay, we will have to respond to that.</p><p>This was very new for us during the summer and the Naval Service had three weeks' notice to send a ship to the Mediterranean.  This is putting much pressure on the service and it has performed really well, but it is affecting the other roles it must play.  If we are going to have an approach that keeps a ship abroad permanently on different missions - it is currently in the Mediterranean - we must reflect on whether eight ships is enough for the Irish Naval Service.  We have a responsibility in fisheries patrol and the role must be played as part of the Common Fisheries Policy.  It is not just a voluntary action.  If there is going to be a priority in the Government to maintain a ship in the Mediterranean, it will have resource consequences, just as keeping our Army in UNIFIL and the UN Disengagement Observer Force has resource consequences.</p><p>I must flag that idea but I believe in what we are doing in the Mediterranean, which is great work.  I want to ensure we can continue to play a positive role in a very tragic humanitarian issue.  We can reassess that close to the time.  The current plan is to bring home the ship, assess the mission, learn lessons and look to provide the Italians with the assistance of a ship in the spring.  That will be kept under review.</p><p>It would be a good idea to bring in the reservists.  I can quote the White Paper and list everything we are committing to do for the reserves.  It is a pretty strong statement.  I accept we are not getting a flood of people looking to join and there are issues to be considered.  We essentially have a reserve at half strength and that needs to change, so we will do it.</p><p>On the peace and leadership institute, I have spent much time talking and thinking about the issue and we made a strong commitment in the White Paper.  This concept will grow but we need to do it properly.  We will not do a rush job before the election, for example.  We will put an experienced group of people in place to plan and grow this idea.  We have money to spend on building what will essentially be a new university campus attached to the UN peacekeeping school.  It will become quite a big institute in future.  I will happily speak to the detail of this at a later stage.</p><p>Pay and conditions in the Defence Forces are linked to pay and conditions right across the public sector.  We have a new pay agreement and it will kick in from 1 January, costing the Government an extra &euro;300 million next year.  That will be factored into the budget in a few weeks.  The Defence Forces will benefit from that, like everybody else.  We cannot do separate deals for the Defence Forces while leaving out other areas within the public sector.  We would not get the money from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></speech>

The Minister has indicated, with respect to the capital investment programme, that he will provide for ongoing refurbishment for a diverse defence property portfolio.  I am always harassing the Minister about this but my concern relates to the use of barracks in my constituency.  I would like to see barracks, in my constituency and elsewhere, used for Civil Defence or Reserve Defence Force training.  I am very concerned about using the barracks as a reception centre for refugees.  They are not appropriate for that in any shape or form.  Having visited those barracks, to my mind it would not be appropriate to put families into them.</p><p>I hope the Minister would not consider doing that.  I ask the Minister to consider, for example, using the barracks in Mullingar for a Civil Defence headquarters or something like that.  We should utilise the barracks and not allow them to become run-down.</p><p>The Minister referred to the overseas missions.  I wonder whether there is provision for those who come back from those missions with post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD? The Minister spoke of pensions and looking after families, but there are soldiers coming back who are suffering from PTSD.  They feel they are not getting the care that they and their families were promised before they went on the missions.  I am concerned about particular members of the Defence Forces.</p></speech>

We do have a lot of activity there in terms of a permanent Defence Forces presence.  That will be maintained and probably enhanced in the future.  Mullingar presents a more challenging situation because there is no longer an operational barracks there.  I spoke to Deputy Penrose earlier on this issue.  We will do what we can and we have been doing what we can to ensure the barracks is used by State agencies as much as possible.  The Deputy can be assured that if something is to be done about accommodation for refugees, it will be in appropriate locations.  Army barracks are not the only locations being looked at.</p></speech>

I understand the Deputy has contacted my office about one case, which we are concerned about, and we are acting upon this.  There are strong social, personal and medical supports within the Defence Forces, but if there is a problem that is not being addressed appropriately within the Defence Forces, we will address it.  It is not acceptable that people return from missions and are exposed or vulnerable because of their experiences abroad.  The Deputy has my personal assurance on this issue.  I will not hand it off and pretend everything is perfect.  If there are problems we will address them.  I understand there are good support structures in place, but if there are exceptions we will try to deal with them.</p></speech>

Apologies have been received from Deputy Anne Ferris.  As we are in public session I ask that all mobile phones be turned off as they cause interference with recording equipment.  The Minister will attend another meeting at 4 p.m. so our time here is limited.  The purpose of this meeting is to consider the following motion which was referred by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 23 September 2015</p><blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves Ireland&rsquo;s accession to the memorandum of understanding concerning the principles for the establishment and operation of a battle group to be made available to the European Union in the second half of 2016.</blockquote> <p>I welcome the Minister for Defence, Deputy Simon Coveney and his officials to this meeting and invite the Minister to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-30a.560" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2015093000002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chair and I apologise to the committee for the reading of a third submission into the record today.  The Department is undergoing a process of seeking approval for a memorandum of understanding regarding Ireland's proposed participation in the German battle group 2016.  I will now put some facts into the record for the reasons behind this proposal.  The motion is:</p><blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves Ireland&rsquo;s accession to the memorandum of understanding concerning the principles for the establishment and operation of a battle group to be made available to the European Union in the second half of 2016.</blockquote> <p>In commending the motion I will now outline the background to Ireland's participation in the German battle group.  The ambition of the EU is to be able to respond rapidly to emerging crises.  This is a key objective in the continued development of the EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy.  In the Headline Goal 2010, the EU set itself the objective of being able &quot;to respond with rapid and decisive action applying a fully coherent approach to the whole spectrum of crisis management operations covered by the Treaty on the European Union&quot;.  This is a mouthful but it is eurospeak for saying that we need to have the capacity to respond to a crisis if and when it happens.  A key element of the Headline Goal 2010 is the capability to deploy forces at high readiness, broadly based on the battle groups concept.</p><p>The purpose of the EU battle groups is to undertake operations as outlined in the Amsterdam treaty.  These operations, known as Petersberg Tasks, include humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking.  In the Lisbon treaty these tasks were expanded to include joint disarmament operations, military advice and assistance tasks in supporting the reform and restructuring of security services and legal institutions in fragile states, conflict prevention and post-conflict stabilisation.</p><p>A central tenet of Irish foreign policy is support for the multilateral system of collective security represented by the United Nations.  In this regard, Ireland has worked to uphold the primary role of the Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security.  This commitment has found expression in Ireland&rsquo;s longstanding tradition of participation in UN peacekeeping operations.  Participation in EU battle groups represents another means for Ireland to express our commitment to the UN and its principles.</p><p>The Defence Forces contribution to this battle group will involve a Recce-ISTAR company together with staff posts at both the operational and force headquarters.  Recce is an abbreviation of reconnaissance and ISTAR is a military term meaning intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance.  The role of a Recce-ISTAR company is to operate in a forward position to generate and deliver specific information and intelligence to decision makers in support of the planning and conduct of operations.<br/><br/>The total number of Defence Forces personnel involved in this battle group will be approximately 175.  This level of resource commitment will only arise should the battle group be deployed to undertake an operation and should Ireland agree to participate, and if we agree to participate the triple lock will have to apply.  The commitment in terms of personnel leading up to and during the stand-by period, where the battle group has not been mobilised to undertake an operation, will be eight officers and two NCOs.  These will be deployed to battle group headquarters in Strasbourg and engaged in training and planning activities.<br/><br/>The German Battle Group Memorandum of Understanding is an agreement between the participants comprising the battle group, namely, Germany, Austria, Czech Republic, Ireland, Croatia, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, which sets out principles in relation to the operation, deployment and management of the German battle group.<br/><br/><b></b>Sections 1 to 4, inclusive, deal with the definitions and reference documents that are applicable to this memorandum of understanding.  They define Germany as the framework nation and Austria as the logistic lead nation and broadly outline the purpose of the memorandum of understanding.<br/><br/>Sections 5 to 8, inclusive, deal with the consultation process, exercise, training, certification and operation of the battle group.  Most battle group training will take place in the contributing member states.  Irish troops will be mainly trained here in Ireland.  That said, a joint training exercise with other battle group elements will also take place in the east of Germany at some point.  Approximately 170 Defence Force personnel will be required to deploy to Germany for this exercise, which is scheduled to take place from 18 to 29 April 2016.  The estimated cost of participation in this certification exercise will be in the region of &euro;955,000 to take account of transportation of equipment and the provision of food, fuel and other services in Germany.<br/><br/>One important issue to note is that each battle group participant retains the right to deploy or not to deploy its forces, irrespective of an EU decision to launch a battle group operation.  Equally, each battle group participant retains the sovereign right to withdraw its contingent at any time.  The command of each contingent remains under national control, with operational control delegated to the operational commander.  As such, any deployment of the Irish contribution as part of the German battle group will still be subject to the triple lock, which is a UN mandate, Government and D&aacute;il approval, and this will remain unaffected by Ireland signing the memorandum of understanding.<br/><br/><b></b>Sections 9 to 13, inclusive, outline the arrangements in terms of financing, logistics, classified information, the status of forces and the issue of claims and liabilities.  When a battle group participant is within the territory of another participant, the issues of jurisdiction and discipline and claims and liabilities of forces will be dealt with in accordance with the NATO Partnership for Peace Status of Forces Agreement, PfP SOFA.<br/><br/>A status of forces agreement is an agreement on the status of personnel engaged on overseas training and operations, whereby the host country agrees to extend certain rights and privileges to such personnel.  These include arrangements regarding jurisdiction in respect of certain crimes, powers of military police, enforcement of discipline by the superiors of the relevant personnel and determination of liability for damage to the property of third parties.<br/><br/>While all the other German battle group participants have signed the NATO PfP SOFA, Ireland has not yet done so.  We have previously acceded to the relevant provisions of the SOFA, generally through an exchange of letters with the European Union, NATO or lead framework nations for any operation in which we have participated.  It is intended to engage in a similar exchange of letters in relation to these matters in respect of our participation in the German battle group.  It should be noted that the immunities and privileges provided for in the SOFA, including those to which Ireland will accede through an exchange of letters, will not apply within Ireland.  SOFAs respect the principle of territorial sovereignty and given that there is a constitutional impediment to foreign forces being deployed in the State under their own command structures, effectively the terms of the SOFA are of no effect within the State, as no troops can be so deployed.<br/><br/><b></b>Sections 14 to 16, inclusive, deal with the process of participation of additional states in the battle group, the timelines for coming into effect and termination of the memorandum of understanding, and the process for dispute resolution.  The terms of the memorandum of understanding are similar to those that Ireland has previously acceded to for the 2008, 2011 and 2015 Nordic battle groups, as well as the 2012 Austro-German battle group.<br/><br/>While no battle group has deployed to date, the EU battle group concept has yielded many benefits to developing improved interoperability between the Defence Forces and the forces of other EU member states.  The battle group has also enabled the EU to develop its decision-making processes for rapid deployment on crisis management operations.<br/><br/>The purpose of battle groups is, very simply, to enable the Union to be more effective in contributing to international peace and security in support of the United Nations by putting in place a rapid response capability.  In this regard, it is worth again recalling the strong support of the United Nations for the EU&rsquo;s efforts in this regard.  During his recent visit to Ireland in May this year, UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon commented positively on the EU-UN relationship and the importance of having a rapid response capacity.<br/><br/>Ireland&rsquo;s active engagement in EU battle groups enhances our capacity to influence the ongoing development and evolution of the rapid response capacity of the European Union, in particular, the role battle groups can play in reinforcing and acting as a strategic reserve for UN blue-hat operations.  Active engagement by Ireland across the range of activities under the Union&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy means that Ireland can help shape this policy in a manner which is consistent with our values and our support of multilateralism and for the United Nations.<br/><br/>Ireland&rsquo;s participation in battle groups supports the development of rapid deployment skills and capabilities within the Defence Forces, together with improved interoperability with our partners.  It also enhances Ireland&rsquo;s credibility as a provider of professional and effective military forces for crisis management operations.  Finally, it reinforces our standing and capacity to influence the ongoing development of the Union&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy in support of international peace and security and the UN.<br/><br/>The term &quot;battle groups&quot; is an unfortunate one because it conjures an image of an army going to war.  That is not what the UN battle groups concept is all about.  It is about trying to create an absence of war and intervene before conflicts arise, or while conflicts are under way, to try to protect civilians, separate warring parties and create peace and stabilisation in parts of the world that desperately need assistance to do that.  They have not been deployed yet even though they have been around for quite some time.  I suspect that may change.  Many countries are losing patience with spending money, training and preparing and not actually deploying that resource.<br/><br/>What Ireland is committing to, and which I hope the committee will give its support to, is to be part of that process, which is about Europe using its influence and resources to help create stabilisation in post-conflict situations or to help conflict in the first place.  It makes a lot of sense that, as a country that has a deep history in peacekeeping, we would be part of European efforts in that regard.  I hope the committee will be able to support what we are proposing to do next year to be part of a German-led battle group for the second half of next year.</p><p>Do members have questions or comments?</p></speech>

Under the Lisbon treaty these tasks were expanded to include joint disarmament operations and military advice assistance.  What exactly does that mean?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-30a.564" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2015093000002#C00400"><p>Essentially, what it means is that we do not want to be restricted to humanitarian assistance only.  There are missions that may necessitate disarmament.  Ireland has been involved very successfully in the UN mission to Liberia.  Peacekeeping and peacemaking sometimes involves a range of things.  The Lisbon treaty upgraded the kind of missions that battle groups can get involved in.  At no stage is this about being part of conflict or war; it is about trying to prevent it.</p> <p>  We cannot decide to be part of a battle group that is deployed without actually coming back to the Oireachtas, having a debate and ensuring that the triple lock applies.  For Ireland to be part of the deployment of a battle group, were it to be deployed, there would have to be an UN mandate and the approval of both the D&aacute;il and the Government.  If there is a fear that we could be dragged into conflict by the back door because we are part of a battle group, people should know that that cannot happen unless we choose to be part of it.  There are safeguards.  In the vast majority of circumstances, if a battle group is to be deployed, it will be deployed in a spirit with which I think Ireland will be comfortable.  We will have to pass the usual triple-lock test before our troops can be part of a mission.</p></speech>

Ireland is not a member of NATO.  We are not going to be a member of NATO any time soon.  We have put arrangements in place that are the equivalent of signing the SOFA to ensure that our troops get the protection they need when they are abroad, training with other troops in other European countries.  It would probably be more straightforward if we did sign the SOFA, but I do not want to give a legal opinion on the complexities of that.  I do not have the detail to provide to the committee, but perhaps we can provide it from the Office of the Attorney General.</p></speech>

I raised this issue on Second Stage and heard the Minister's reply.  Effectively, the Bill abolishes civil partnership going forward, as persons can no longer enter into a civil partnership from the date the Bill is enacted.</p><p>While I welcome the Bill, as I did on Second Stage, I am not convinced of the rationale for that.  I would have thought the purpose of the vote was to accommodate the myriad types of family arrangements that are in place in Ireland.  I would have thought a better way to do that would be to open up civil partnership, which is currently limited to homosexual couples, to both heterosexual and homosexual couples.  The Minister indicated that she had received advice from the Office of the Attorney General to the effect that this would be unconstitutional.  I am slightly sceptical about the use of advices from the Attorney General that nobody can see, question or read - advices from counsel can be quite nuanced - to shut down debate in this House, which is something that has happened quite a bit in the course of this D&aacute;il.  Has the Minister specifically obtained advices from the Office of the Attorney General - I am not referring to advices that have been hanging around for years - to the effect that there is a requirement to abolish the institution of civil partnership in order to legislate for homosexual marriage?  Has such clear advice been obtained?  If the Minister wishes to respond to that now, I would welcome it.</p></speech>

I will just go over the detail of the policy again and maybe add a little extra to what I said previously.  The policy based on the new constitutional context is that civil partnership registration will cease after a reasonably short period of transition.  As the Deputy knows, section 8 of this Bill repeals most of Part 7A of the Civil Registration Act 2004, which had set out the basis for registration of civil partnerships.  The status of current civil partners remains completely unchanged.  I think we are all very clear about that.  There is no question of removing any of the rights and obligations of civilly partnered couples or of changing their status in regard to each other.  They will be free to marry each other if they so choose, or to remain as civil partners.</p> <p>  I would like to say a little more about the legal advice I have received.  I have been advised that it would not be constitutional to keep civil partnership available and to open it to opposite-sex couples as this would create a risk of making civil partnership a potential competitor to marriage.  All of the advice I have makes it clear that making a marriage-like relationship available would violate the constitutional pledge to "guard with special care the institution of Marriage, on which the Family is founded, and to protect it against attack".  The legal advice I have is that civil partnership was legally and constitutionally justifiable because same-sex couples did not have the opportunity to marry.  Now that same-sex couples can marry, the rationale for civil partnership as a distinct institution has disappeared.  Accordingly, civil partnership is being wound down.  The State is constitutionally prevented from making an alternative legal relationship available to couples, even though some might wish to become civil partners rather than marrying.  That is the legal advice I have.  This is an obvious question that arises.  One has to consider it from a constitutional point of view.  I have set out the advice that is shaping what we are doing in the Bill in relation to the future of civil partnership.  It is very much based on advice relating to the role of marriage in the Constitution.</p></speech>

I do not doubt that the Minister has received this advice, even if I might not necessarily agree with it.  The Attorney General's office is the Attorney General's office.  Ministers and Governments are bound to follow the advice of the Attorney General's office.  The 2010 Act introduced cohabitation and provided for the rights of cohabitees.  If civil partnership is somehow a competitor to marriage, I suggest that the same thing must apply to cohabitation and giving rights to cohabitees.  I am not entirely convinced by the rationale we have heard.</p> <p>  The Minister is right when she says that civil partnership is a marriage-like institution.  I do not necessarily know why it has to be a marriage-like institution.  I do not know why the long-standing consanguinity impediments to marriage in Judeo-Christian traditions and Roman law, which predated marriage as a Christian institution, were introduced into civil partnership.  I remind the Minister that the concept underpinning civil partnership is that it gives rights to people living together as a family unit who wish to obtain legal protection for that unit and to give rights to each other in the event that something happens.  A common example of that in Ireland would be two elderly siblings who live together in a fairly dependent way.  They no have rights under the mental health or pensions Acts or anything else.  If something happens one sibling, the other sibling has no rights even though they have been living together as a family for their entire lives, albeit obviously in a non-intimate way.  Irish law provides very little protection to people in such circumstances.  Why do we need to have the consanguinity impediments in civil partnership?  I do not know why civil partnership cannot be open to people who are not otherwise in a civil partnership or married, but are in a non-intimate relationship.  I note that intimacy is not a requirement for being treated as a cohabitee, although I suppose it is presumed that the couple were intimate at one point.  One way of avoiding this idea of competition would be to change the nature of civil partnership and open it up.</p> <p>  I would also like to make the point that marriage is a permanent institution, notwithstanding the divorce legislation in Ireland.  It has to be demonstrated that a marriage is irretrievably broken down in order to have it dissolved or to obtain a divorce.  The same thing does not apply to civil partnership.  They are two very different institutions.  I do not really see that one necessarily competes with the other.  People choose to marry or cohabit or whatever.  I think there are other ways around it.  I would like to flag my intention at this stage to look into the matter further with a view to proposing an amendment on Report Stage.</p></speech>

I have set out the legal advice I have received in this regard.  As Deputy McNamara will be well aware, the rights of cohabitants under the 2010 Act are quite limited.  The Act provides only for rights of redress in the case of a relationship of dependency.  When the Deputy speaks about changing civil partnership, he is really raising a separate question.  This is about the Marriage Bill.  That is really as much as I have to say about it at this stage.</p></speech>

It is quite short.  It is from a man who signs off as &quot;Pension Equality&quot;.  It states:</p><blockquote>I wonder would you be good enough to propose an amendment to the Marriage Bill at the Select Committee stage in relation to the block which Section 81E (5) and (6) of the Pension Act places on anyone, retired, more than one year from bringing a claim for pension equality.<br /><br />It affects LGBTI people, straight people, and children.<br /><br />The time limit, besides being arbitrary (unlike other provisions it does not run from the date of the discrimination e.g. the refusal of the pension) is also contrary to EU Law which does not allow a time limit in national legislation which makes access to the relevant Court or Tribunal impossible as this one does for anyone claiming a pension benefit which only came into existence years after their retirement.</blockquote><p>It goes on with two short paragraphs.  They state:</p><blockquote>The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has relied on this time limit to have a claim to the Equality Tribunal rejected in March 2015.  The State&rsquo;s reliance on something which is self-evidently illegal as well as unjust is in marked contrast to its self congratulations about Same Sex Marriage.  It is also an unfortunate example of an attitude which is regularly condemned harshly by the Supreme Court and the High Court and widely reported in the media, where the State in ligation against it, seeks to delay and defend the indefensible.<br /><br />We are urging you to propose an amendment to the Marriage Bill in the terms below, which would deal with the matter.  The Marriage Bill is amending many pieces of disparate legislation and this is in fact quite a simple amendment.  It would be a great pity to launch marriage equality and at the same time bar retired LGBTI people from the Equality Tribunal if they are wrongly refused a pension for a spouse.</blockquote><p>He has given me suggested wordings in this regard and I can submit them on Report Stage.</p></speech>

The purpose of the amendment will be to remove the requirement for civil partners who have registered their civil partnership in Ireland to have to give the three-month notice when seeking to marry one another.  This amendment is to reduce any unnecessary administrative burden on civil partners wishing to marry.  The three-month notice period is not required in their case as they will already have complied with that requirement before registering their civil partnership or they will have been exempted by a court order.  In all cases they will have established their identities for the registrar and provided all the evidence that is normally needed by the registrar when establishing whether a couple can marry, so I will introduce that amendment on Report Stage.</p></speech>

The Minister mentioned administrative burdens to people who are in a civil partnership and wish to marry.  One of the biggest administrative burdens, applying equally to gay and straight couples who wish to enter into a civil marriage, is the inability to get married because of staff shortages in the registrar's office.  People can marry from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. from Monday to Friday but most people want to marry outside working hours.  We can discuss resources as much as we like but the reality is that resources are not there.  I will propose an amendment to section 54 of the 2004 Act, which sets out who can solemnise a marriage, to include peace commissioners and commissioners for oaths.  These people would clearly have to be accepted by the registrar and demonstrate suitability.  They should be trained and know how to do it.  There are already safeguards, including the requirement to give notice to the HSE, to be interviewed and so on.  All these safeguards should be maintained but it would allow people to get married at a hotel or venue of their choosing outside of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. from Monday to Friday.  That is an unreasonable administrative burden, although I accept it is necessary now because of the financial constraints in which the State finds itself.</p> <p>  Commissioners for oaths and peace commissioners are responsible people and the latter are appointed by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  They are appointed on the basis, if not of being politically connected, then that they are responsible people.  I do not see why they could not carry out this important function in society or why it should be reserved exclusively for the Health Service Executive, which has many other functions.</p></speech>

Before changing those categories, which is what the Deputy suggests, we would have to consider implications and what it might mean.  It is a matter for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection because it comes under related legislation.  My understanding is that currently there are no plans to change the categories of bodies or organisations that may apply to have their members entered on the register of solemnisers.  I appreciate that the Deputy has said he wants to bring forward an amendment to change that but it would have to be considered carefully in the context of any implications.</p> <p>  It is anticipated that the increased demand for marriage solemnising arising from the implementation of the same-sex marriage provisions in this Marriage Bill will be offset to a significant extent by the cessation in the registration of civil partnerships, which is provided for in the Bill.  As the Deputy mentions, registrars are employed by the HSE which is responsible for their terms and conditions of employment.  I take the point made by the Deputy about weekends, which is reasonable.  I know there are some discussions ongoing on broader issues relating to the human relations side of registrars.  I take the point and I will certainly relay the Deputy's concern to the relevant Ministers.  Clearly, there is a demand for weekend ceremonies as well.  Under the current terms and conditions of employment of registrars under the HSE, that is not a possibility.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-30a.640" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1092" speakername="Paudie Coffey" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015093000002#E00200"><p>I welcome the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe to discuss the mid-year review of the Estimates for transport, tourism and sport - Vote 31.  The purpose of this morning&rsquo;s session is to engage with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport in order to assist the committee in undertaking a mid-year review of the position on outputs and expenditure with particular reference to performance measurements in regard to Vote 31 for the year ended 31 December 2015.</p><p>The Minister will assist the committee in its consideration of improvements that may be desirable regarding the performance information included in the unabridged Estimate.  The Minister might also brief the committee on the emerging position in order that this committee might participate in the 2016 Estimates discussions in advance of allocations being finalised.  The committee welcomes the Minister.</p><p>I draw the attention of the witnesses to the fact that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also advise that any submission or opening statements made to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>Can the Minister indicate the position on the New Zealand guidance in setting output based performance targets? The committee understands that had been the basis for discussion between the Department staff and the committee for the last number of months.  I refer to the guidance included as appendices to the briefing materials circulated.  The committee understands that the Department may have issues with how the guidance is being applied to the performance measures it has included in the Estimates.  Can it be established whether the Department has issues with the guidance itself?</p></speech>

The table to which the Vice Chairman refers is the departmental output table of 2015.  It lists all of the different outputs by all elements of my Department.  I believe an evaluation has been done as to whether they are specific, measurable or relevant.  My own observation is, as Minister heading into the next Estimates process, that I believe there is an opportunity to make them even more output focused.   I will give the committee a small example of what I mean.  If we were to look at the figures on the sustainable development of airports or the outputs in public transport in the future, we need to have figures on the number of people who use public transport or the number of people who use different airports.  I will now turn to the figures on tourism.  We are increasingly moving towards looking at the spend by tourists to Ireland, alongside the numbers of tourists.  These are the measures the Department and I use to evaluate our performance.  It would be helpful for the coming 12 months if those things converged with the measures in the Estimates process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-30a.642" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015093000002#E00400"><p>I thank the Minister and I welcome his statement in which he and his Department accept the necessity for improved performance output around documentation and I welcome the willingness to try to improve.  If we as a Parliament can work with Departments like the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport we will all benefit in the long run.</p> <p> Regarding the output measures and the associated targets to be included in the Estimates, in some cases they are not specific enough to be meaningful.  The Minister addressed this when he spoke about the airport example.  I suggest the implementation of recommended actions in accordance with stated milestones.  While that is aspirational, it needs to be contextualised.  On the plan to continue work on smarter travel projects, it becomes very difficult to measure what the output ultimately is in that regard.  I am not being critical and I do not look for a direct answer other than an engagement that says this is where we need to get to.</p> <p> The desire to develop the Wild Atlantic Way discovery points is a vision which becomes difficult to measure in terms of the output.  It would help if there was a more specific aim, for example, to develop four of the Wild Atlantic Way discovery points over the next 12 months.  Or, regarding smarter travel, it would help to identify two or three projects which could be delivered within a time-frame.  It may make it easier, for those of us on this side of the table, to hold the Minister and his Department to account on where things fall between the cracks.  If we can get this right over a period of time it will serve the country better in the long run because it will mean that all of us are more keenly focused on how money is spent if it does get spent.  The Minister will not be left in the difficult situation at the end of the year of having money left over from various projects that he is then in a position to spend on other pet projects in the run-up to an election.</p></speech>

I draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to section C of the Estimates and the issue of ports.  It indicates the number of ports and seafarers to be inspected.  If one looks at section D and sports it states that Sport Ireland legislation is to be published, and there are measures about the distribution of funding for local authority swimming pools.  These are specific proposals.  There is opportunity to make more progress on making them even more output focused on elements that are not related to legislation because legislation is binary in that it is either published or it is not, it is either enacted or it is not.  However, we can track how many people come to Ireland, how they spend when they come here and the duration of their stay.  This is the sort of data that Tourism Ireland tracks and upon which it reports back to my Department.  It is in all of our interests that we include this data when one looks at how my Department and I perform.</p></speech>

I will suggest to the Chairman in due course that there be an opportunity for a sub-committee of this committee, made up of the spokespersons for the various parties, to engage with the Department officials and to go through in more detail some of the issues that arise and to find a more common platform.  Today is a welcome development but it might be better to sit down and agree some framework for the future so that there is no ambiguity at the end of this process.  The Minister might be Taoiseach by next year.</p></speech>

The Minister must have different polls than I have.  That is a suggestion that we might look at that so that the committee could engage more fully in a more convivial environment rather than across a committee room, and agree the template for the long term.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-30a.649" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015093000002#F00600"><p>I think that is fair enough.  I believe that some of the measurements here do what the Deputy and the committee want.  What the committee has asked of the Department is fair.   I believe that other measurements could be clearer.  That is my responsibility.  There are parts on which I would resist the committee.  If I look at tourism, measurement number one is to agree 2013 business plan for implementation by tourism agencies.  The committee has said that this is not specific but I argue that it is pretty specific.  The committee says it is not measurable and I could argue about that.  It is certainly relevant, yet the committee has said that it is not.  If we make things more specific it will be possible to make a more careful evaluation of whether they are being delivered or are on track, or not delivered as the case is.  There are things here that the committee has an N-rating against, for example, to finalise a new detailed tourism strategy and action to be applied by year end.  Our tourism strategy is developed and the action plan is underway.</p></speech>

Does the Minister consider that the way he judges performance and targets is sufficient?  We have talked about the New Zealand guidelines.  Does the Minister consider that it is necessary to monitor the performance in a similar way, to review the targets at the end of the year, and to be targeted in what the Department does?  It is easy to judge in sport if something is working or if an athlete is performing or otherwise but how is the overall picture in sport measured?  Is it measured by achievements or by the amount of money the Department gives and the value it gets for it?</p> <p>  I have the same question about the road networks.  Do we measure it in terms of performance and the percentage we have achieved in terms of the budget that we provided for those roads?  Is that how the Minister looks at it or does he just look at whether he got this project done or this maintenance done?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-30a.651" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015093000002#F00800"><p>It is a mixture.  I am clear within my own Department what my priorities are.  When I came into office those objectives were published.  I meet every month with the management boards of the Department and we review where we are with the priorities that we have set.  That is partly by virtue of necessity because there are so many different things going on within my Department that I have to be very clear on what the particular matters are that I believe are important to the country and that I want to make happen.  I have a list against which I evaluate where we stand on different matters but other things happen that take up one's time and energy and can sometimes get in the way of priorities.  For me, that is more of an argument as to why clear priorities are needed in the first place.  One can always be taken off course by events.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's question on how we evaluate things - it depends on the policy area.  I will give the example of sport.  The Deputy is correct about how we evaluate the output in sport.  One of the outputs that we track is the number of medals that national athletes win.  We look at that every year.  That tracking is done by the Irish Sports Council.  We also track levels of participation in sport.  Much of the work that the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar has underway on Healthy Ireland will allow us to get outputs and look at the number of people by age group who participate in sport.  This has led to one insight for me that I feel strongly about, which is how we drive sporting participation, particularly among more disadvantaged communities.  That is something that has only emerged from looking at the outputs from sport.  Outputs will vary and will depend on what part of the Department we look at.  </p> <p>  If we look at new roads projects, it is as simple as asking if the project is funded.  Where does it stand in the planning process?  Has work begun on it?  When will the project open?  If we look at maintenance, I would track that through the amount of funding that we make available to local authorities to help them replenish and sustain roads that are already there.  That is how we would look at that.  </p> <p>  I have already touched on the question of tourism.  Another area of transport is sustainable and smarter travel.  We track the number of people using public transport and the numbers and trends.  For example, we track how many people use Leap cards.  These are all very carefully looked at by me and my officials who work in the area.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister and his officials.  As we are discussing outputs and measureables, one of the important things to note is the announcement made by the Minister on 29 September 2015.  From my region and the mid-western region, the outputs are very clear in terms of the commitment made by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  I acknowledge the work the Minister has done on the ports and specifically the port in my constituency, the Shannon Foynes Port Company, and the decision the Minister's Department has made to link it to the national road network, which is hugely important.</p> <p>  I welcome the decision of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, after years of waiting and years of the Celtic tiger and many missed opportunities, to finally proceed with a bypass of Adare in County Limerick.  That is hugely important for the local economy and a measurable outcome.</p> <p>  I have brought the policy of festival grant aids to the Minister's attention before.  The Department's policy states that it has to be quantified on bednights.  My colleague, Deputy Griffin knows it is very easy for south Kerry people to quantify bednights with the infrastructure that is available.</p></speech>

That is the measurable outcome.  It is very difficult to measure in parts of the country where the infrastructure is not in place.  I have identified issues before on this.  There is an in-built unfairness in how the current structure is managed because one will see the same old faces year in, year out getting a leg-up from the Department while new people in parts of the country where the infrastructure is not as developed are left out.</p><p>That is something that, on the basis of fairness, the Minister should look at when he has an opportunity.  There is a measurable there.  I stayed in Ireland this year on holidays and if one goes into a hotel, as I did in Donegal, and asks them what the difference is this year, they will say two things.  The first is the 9% VAT rate, which has made a massive difference to them.  The second is a very simple concept but something that has been hugely welcomed in that part of the country - the Wild Atlantic Way.   A series of signposts has brought people, for example, from my part of the country, Limerick, into county Donegal where they might not have thought of holidaying before.  It is a measurable outcome.  </p><p> There are aspects of the tourism policy on which more could be done.  There are areas that have mountains, the Ring of Kerry, lakes and fantastic scenery and there is a fantastic product there but there are other parts of the country with an equally good product which have difficulty in accessing the basic levels of support that the Department makes available through F&aacute;ilte Ireland.</p></speech>

The first one is on the two roads that the Deputy referred to, the Shannon Foynes road and the Adare bypass road.  I know as well as the Deputy where those projects stand at the moment.  They both face journeys in the planning process and so on, but I believe it is important that yesterday I and the Government made clear our support for those projects in the long run.  It will take time for them to move forward.  I am familiar, as the Deputy is, with the history of the Adare bypass and everything that has gone on but it is important that the Government has indicated that strategically it believes that these projects have to happen.  When they move to their respective planning and tendering processes, we will be committed to finding a way to make them happen.</p> <p>  The Deputy has talked about tourism and about festivals, in particular.  He met with members of my office about that recently and I was briefed on it.  I know where the Deputy is coming from in the sense that there are some larger festivals at the moment that command a fair bit of support.  I will differ gently with the Deputy and say that we do not give a leg-up to anybody and we certainly do not give a leg-up to any familiar faces.  We look carefully at how money is spent and we have changed the amount of money that we have made available to particular festivals on the basis of how we believe they perform.  I accept the Deputy's point that new festivals that are trying to get up and running cannot provide the track record of how they performed in the past because they did not exist.  That is to state the obvious.  This is something that I will discuss with F&aacute;ilte Ireland to see if there is any way of dealing with this.  </p></speech>

No matter what Minister is in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, if he or she were not seen to support these festivals there would be blue murder.  There are some festivals that make a significant contribution to the economy but might not be as well known as the household names, and they are at a major disadvantage.  The household names have the Department where they want them.  What will happen on the day somebody cuts their funding or the day a festival that has been running for 50 years is asked to wash its face?  The Minister knows as well as I do what would happen.  I am asking for a level playing field.  At some stage, 50 years after they were founded, might some of the festivals be asked whether they can do this on their own?</p></speech>

That is just the nature of the jobs we do.  If one looks at the support for the festival programmes and at the support that many of the larger festivals get, one will see that the funding they receive from the Department through F&aacute;ilte Ireland has been substantially reduced.  We are challenging festival and sporting events constantly to identify additional sources of funding.  That is the truth.  However, I hear where the Deputy is coming from, particularly in terms of new festivals and programmes that are looking to establish themselves.  I will ask F&aacute;ilte Ireland to look at this issue.  As I know the Deputy is interested in the issue, my office will revert to him.</p></speech>

Let me remind members that we are dealing with performance measures for the 2015 Estimates.  In the second part of the meeting we will deal with general questions.</p></speech>

I am disappointed that the Killarney to Farranfore route has been omitted from the capital plan.  Is it possible to have this route added to the capital plan at this late stage?  The gridlock in Killarney is well known and has an impact on tourism as well as on commuters who are trying to access other areas in the county.  It is very detrimental to the local economy.  There is only one way of addressing the significant bottleneck resulting from the uplift in the economy, with increasing traffic and heavier vehicles using that particular route between Killarney and Tralee.  I am most disappointed with this omission, because the groundwork has been done and the project is shovel-ready.  The plans were put on display in Killarney for public consultation some 15 years ago, and we were very optimistic that this would proceed within four to five years.  With the downward trend and collapse of the economy it was put on the back burner.  That project should be examined as a matter of urgency.  I ask the Minister, who has responsibility for tourism as well as transport, to go back to the Cabinet to have this project included, because of the significant investment in preparations for the project.</p> <p>  The development of the Wild Atlantic Way has increased visitor numbers and generated additional moneys.  I wonder if a proportion of the additional revenue generated from the Wild Atlantic Way will be used to improve the infrastructure and the community facilities on this route.  That is only right and fitting.  There is also a need to consider the omission of panoramic scenic roads on the seashore, such as the road from Tralee to Cloch&aacute;n on the Dingle peninsula.  Deputy Brendan Griffin was very involved with the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring, in having the Cloch&aacute;n peninsula included.  Such deficiencies need to be corrected.  This should be put right over the next couple of years.  For many of the communities along the route tourism is a new concept, as in the past their areas were not marketed.  Now, with the major influx of tourists, services need to be expanded.  There is a need for community groups to get together to service the influx - for example, by providing parking areas for camper vans.</p> <p>  The old country pubs are a major part of the culture and tourism product.  We need to look at pubs that are in danger of closing because their owners are finding it difficult to sustain them.  We also need to look at the internal transport system, as many remote areas need to have better access to transport.  I raised the issue of hackney licences with the Minister last week, as people are finding it difficult to get a hackney licences.</p> <p>  The IFA raised issues arising from the abolition of the milk quota and the impact it will have on rural roads, with the transport of milk from the farm gate to the co-operative in heavier tankers.  Rural roads on the western seaboard are deteriorating due to adverse weather conditions, with some areas getting twice the rainfall that Dublin gets.</p> <p>  On the N72, which is gateway from Cork to Killarney, there are a number of acute bends near the railway bridges at Rathmore.  The National Roads Authority, in conjunction with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, needs to straighten out the road at these railway passings.</p> <p>  Deputy Griffin and I are very much aware of-----</p></speech>

First, I will deal the capital spend and the percentage we are investing in regional and local roads.  Out of &euro;10 billion programme that I announced yesterday afternoon, some &euro;2.4 billion is for regional and local roads.</p><p>When I was drawing up the announcement that was made yesterday, I first gave priority to rebalancing our expenditure in favour of making sure that over time, we have enough money to maintain what we have.  I then looked to identify a small number of additional new roads projects that will make a big contribution to the three priorities I have outlined all year - removing bottlenecks to access to ports, airports and job creation, facilitating regional connectivity and dealing with the issue of congestion.</p><p> I appreciate what the Deputy is saying regarding his disappointment about the failure to include the road he has mentioned but I had to make choices all over the country in regard to what we could and could not go ahead with.  While I accept his disappointment about the failure to make provision for a route through Killarney, I remind him that we have met other priorities in his county.  For example, we have recognised the need to support the road in Dingle at some point in the future.  We gave a very clear commitment yesterday to the development of the road between Baile Bh&uacute;irne and Macroom.  The development of the road in question, in the interests of improving connectivity between County Kerry and Cork city, is a long-standing issue that Deputy Griffin has been raising with me for well over a year.  We have not been able to do everything that people would like us to do.  That is a reflection of the need to continue to make choices about how we spend the money that is available now and in the future.</p><p> I would like to respond to the points that the Deputy made regarding tourism.  He spoke about the whole idea of reinvesting back into the development of the Wild Atlantic Way.  We are already working hard to do that.  Earlier this month, the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, outlined details of a new programme to develop between 145 and 150 information points that are located all along the Wild Atlantic Way.  This is being done to try to provide better experiences for those who visit the locations in question.  We now have plans in place for four signature discovery points.  This work is under way.  Over time, we will continue to upgrade the experiences that exist along the Wild Atlantic Way, based on the money we have at our disposal.  The Deputy made a point about infrastructure along the Wild Atlantic Way.  We have not been able to make progress with any additional roads in County Kerry other than the two major projects I have already mentioned.  We are looking to make progress elsewhere along the route.  For example, we are seeking to make a contribution to the route along the N59 in County Donegal.</p><p> The Deputy raised the question of hackney licences with me in the D&aacute;il last week.  I understand the NTA has been in contact with Deputies on this matter in the last year.  I know that people want the area of knowledge to be below the county level.  However, the NTA is strongly of the view that this would give rise to many other difficulties.  For example, there might be people who are very well qualified to drive within a particular cluster of communities but are not qualified to drive beyond that.  It is for that reason that the NTA is of the view that at the moment, we should not change the licensing regime, which I support.</p><p> The Deputy also made a point about the effect of the abolition of milk quotas on regional roads.  I remind him that &euro;2.4 billion of the &euro;4.9 billion we are investing in the maintenance of existing roads will be spent on regional and local roads.</p></speech>

Are there any further questions on the performance measures?  If not, we can move on to the second part of this meeting.  Deputy Griffin has indicated.</p></speech>

It would be remiss of me not to thank him for yesterday's announcement regarding the N22 road between Macroom and Baile Bh&uacute;irne, which is great news for the Kerry constituency and the south-west region.  I think it is a game-changer.  It will be the greatest socioeconomic development for Kerry in many years.  I would also like to mention the N69, the Adare bypass and the Dingle relief road.  They comprise a great suite of measures for County Kerry.  I would like to express gratitude on behalf of the people of Kerry.  Yesterday was a very good day for the county, after many dark years.</p> <p>  The Minister is aware that I have been raising the need to try to boost winter tourism for many years.  I believe we have an excellent opportunity to boost visitor numbers to Ireland in the shoulder months.  I suggest that the Wild Atlantic Way is an excellent vehicle in this regard.  We should market that product as a winter experience as much as a summer experience.  I have always used the example of standing on Slea Head looking out to the Atlantic in January, as distinct from July.  I think people should be coming from all over the world to experience the ferocious wilderness and invigorating energy of the sea in months like January.  Having previously raised this issue in parliamentary questions and received responses from the Minister, I know that extra expenditure was provided in 2015 to try to market the shoulder months and the winter months.  Do we have any update on how that it going?  Are we getting a worthwhile return on our efforts to boost off-peak visitor numbers?  Do we need to put more money in?  Is there a tipping point that needs to be reached so that a real impact can be made?  I suppose I am looking for as much data as possible on that.</p></speech>

We are trying to get additional vacations and holidays into Ireland at points of the year when we have the capacity to facilitate them.  I will explain how it is working at the moment.  I suppose we are in the off-season, or the off-shoulder period, now.  We will have to see how it is going to perform.  It is clear that the investment we have made in tourism to date is yielding extraordinary results.  If I recall correctly, the visitor figures that were released yesterday show that there has been an increase of between 13% and 15% in the number of visitors to Ireland so far this year.  I have every reason to believe we will finish this year with a double-digit increase in the number of people coming to Ireland.  When we deliver that figure, I expect that we will see an increase of between 5% and 10% for the off-shoulder period compared with a year ago.</p></speech>

I understand that we are on course to break all records from a tourism point of view.  It is fantastic.  It is clear to me, as someone who comes from a tourism county, that large numbers of tourists have been in the country this year.  That is really encouraging in counties like Kerry.  I suggest we can try to make this more sustainable by spreading it into the winter months as much as we can.  Unfortunately, people are traditionally laid off during the winter because of the seasonal nature of tourism.  It is something we could be cognisant of in future.  We could put more effort into it.  We should try to continue the existing efforts to boost activity in the winter months.  We should see if we can do something about this aspect of the matter.  I have looked at other countries.  I am aware that efforts are being made in this regard already.  It seems to be something that has been pushed by Scotland in the last couple of years.  The figures have been quite good there as well.  We should try to keep this issue on the agenda.  I reiterate that it has been a good tourism season.  I acknowledge the extent to which Government policy on tourism has shaped results in this industry.</p></speech>

Before we move on to the second session, I would like to know whether the Minister and his officials accept that there is room for improvement in the performance measures.  Perhaps this has been covered already.  Will the Minister and his officials engage with the Oireachtas secretariat to identify improvements in those measures?</p></speech>

We are coming off a decent base in terms of the breadth of indicators we have and how specific some of them are.  There is an opportunity to do this more effectively in the future.  As we are doing it we will also need a bit more clarity regarding the adjudication of the Oireachtas on the specific measurable and relevant columns.</p></speech>

It would be remiss of me not to congratulate the Minister, the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, and all their staff.  Tourism has been a tremendous success story over the last four or five years.  A large number of jobs have been created.  There have been benefits to the economy.  Many overseas visitors have come here.</p><p>It is a great success story and is no doubt due to issues the Minister raised, such as the reduction in VAT and the cessation of the &euro;3 per passenger departing from an airport.</p><p> I will comment on the greenways.  I come from a town that has a magnificent greenway.  Unfortunately, it starts not in the town of Carlingford, but at the marine which is approximately 400 yd. north of Carlingford on the sea.  That greenway is being used throughout the year.  It is encouraging visitors at weekends to come and stay in Carlingford and in the villages of Omeath.  Both towns have benefited greatly from the greenway.  It is proposed to extend it, to Omeath and on to Newry, and eventually, perhaps not in my day, to Portadown along the Clanrye river.  It has been encouraged by Newry and Mourne District Council.  I would emphasis the greenways anywhere they are and congratulate the landowners involved, through whose co-operation this has happened.  I invite the Minister to look at this greenway from Carlingford to Omeath, with a view to extending it from the marina to King John's Castle on the pier in Carlingford along the sea.  It would have to be built up on stilts - I have seen one in Portugal done similarly.  As far as greenways in part my of the world are concerned, it would be the jewel in the crown.  I thank the Minister for his efforts.</p></speech>

It contains 73 actions, all of which reflect my view that aviation and our airports are not a consequence, but a cause, of economic growth.  If one looks at what is happening in all of the airports at present, if one looks at the engagement that this Government has had with the aviation sector, it has brought more jobs into Ireland, it has brought more tourists into Ireland and it has developed a platform for our country to grow sustainably in the future.  By 2020, we believe, Irish airports will handle approximately 33 million passengers per year.</p> <p>  In that document, I guess there are only two points I would want to emphasise.  The first is that the number one policy that underpins everything we would do in aviation is safety and security.  That is the bedrock upon which we grow our access to the rest of the world.  We have placed considerable focus on how we can grow connectivity, how we can grow competition on key routes into Ireland and how we can support the State and regional airports.  There are different steps against different airports, depending on their nature.  Each of the State airports, which, as the committee will be aware, are Dublin, Cork and Shannon, have clear plans regarding how they want to develop in the future.  For the regional airports, one of which is in Deputy Griffin's constituency, I am pleased to be able to say that earlier in the year we published the regional airport plan, which outlines the supports that we want to give to regional airports between 2015 and 2019 and outlines the legal framework within which we need to make those supports available and that has now been agreed with the European Commission.  The next phase, in aviation, will be setting in place the national aviation development forum, which will be a broad group of stakeholders across the sector which we will use to consult as we look to develop Irish aviation in the future.</p> <p>  On maritime, there are two sections to which I would draw the committee's attention.  The first is the status of the Harbours Bill 2015, which has completed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il and will shortly come here for Committee Stage consideration.  I believe this is the most important legislation on the ports sector for decades and I look forward to working with the committee to ensure its enactment.  I also launched, earlier this year, the new national maritime safety strategy, which concludes 33 actions to make the maritime sector, our seas and rivers, as safe as possible.</p> <p>  I continue to place considerable value on the Irish Coast Guard and the work that my Department has done in upgrading the fleet of helicopters available to it.  The deployment of new Sikorsky helicopters gives them tools that will significantly improve the already great service that they can deliver.  With the services and technology available through Valentia Island and the work that the Irish Coast Guard has done there, it now has the ability to cover the breadth of Ireland.  It is a sign of the support the Government has given them.</p> <p>  On sports, I merely want to underscore the importance of the setting up of the Sports Ireland organisation.  The Bill in that regard has now been enacted.  I also note that work is already under way on the national indoor arena in the National Sports Campus in Abbotstown and in supporting our athletes as they get ready for the Olympics in Rio in 2016.</p> <p>  We will never have the money needed to support everything that everybody wants us to do but I believe, across my Department, we are making steady progress in areas that will be to the benefit of the country in the long run.</p></speech>
