    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-01a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1099" speakername="Marcella Corcoran Kennedy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2015120100002#B00300"><p>I have received apologies from Deputies Anthony Lawlor and John Lyons.  I remind members, visitors and people in the Gallery to ensure their mobile telephones are switched off for the duration of the meeting as they interfere with the broadcasting equipment even when in silent mode.</p> <p>  This meeting has been convened to consider the Supplementary Estimates for Vote 32 - Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, which were referred to the select sub-committee by the D&aacute;il on 19 November with an instruction to report back to the D&aacute;il not later than 9 December 2015.  I welcome the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, and his officials and thank them for the briefing material that was provided.  It has been circulated to the members of the committee.  Based on this information, the secretariat has prepared a briefing document which has been circulated to members and to the Department.  Is it agreed that the meeting should follow the structure in the briefing document?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I propose that the following arrangements apply to the debate.  The Minister will make a brief address to the committee, after which each of the opposition spokespersons will have an opportunity to make a brief response if they wish.  We can then consider the Supplementary Estimates.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I remind members that in accordance with Standing Orders discussion should be confined to the items constituting the Supplementary Estimates, which are: subhead A.5 - IDA Ireland; subhead B.4 - science and technology programme; subhead B.5 - programme for research in third level institutions.  I ask members to indicate the subhead to which they are referring when contributing.</p> <p>  I invite the Minister to make his address.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-01a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2015120100002#B00400"><p>I will not have to make a lengthy address.  I will just explain the three elements that are before the committee.</p> <p>  The first is additional provision of &euro;21 million for IDA Ireland.  The second is a total of &euro;5.5 million for the science and technology programme - &euro;5 million for Science Foundation Ireland and &euro;500,000 for the Tyndall National Institute in Cork.  All of that is to support strategically important research infrastructure in higher education institutions across the country to enable Ireland to maintain and further grow its innovative capacity and its collaborations with industry, and to provide our top class scientists with the required equipment.  The third is the provision of &euro;23.5 million for the programme for research in third level institutions, PRTLI.  This is effectively paying out on matured liabilities under the PRTLI, which is infrastructural provision for the science and research area.  It is more cost effective if the State pays out now and it creates some new business head-room capacity for capital expenditure in our Votes in the years ahead.</p> <p>  I am happy to state that since the previous occasion on which I appeared before the committee, IDA Ireland has had a strong flow of job announcements.  A further 2,500 jobs among IDA Ireland clients have been announced since the beginning of October, with some very significant announcements among them.  SAGE, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Apple were just some examples.  This year has been another very strong year for investment wins by IDA Ireland and the agency is well on track to meet and surpass its jobs targets for the year.  Halfway through the year it was 10% ahead on its jobs performance.  Obviously, we will not have definitive year end figures until after the survey is completed.  That will be available in the new year.  It is a detailed survey of the actual number of people in place, as opposed to projects being announced, and the flow through that IDA Ireland has sight of through its daily work.</p> <p>  One element of the Supplementary Estimate relates to an additional &euro;9 million in IDA Ireland grants drawdown, which is required under the Supplementary Estimate.  This means that IDA Ireland clients are hitting their jobs targets earlier than envisaged, so there is an earlier drawdown.</p><p>We also have a stronger flow than previously, meaning that the run on IDA Ireland grants is stronger than anticipated.  While it is an extra demand on the Exchequer, it is welcome that more people are in employment.  It needs to be borne in mind for context that the IDA Ireland client cohort typically contributes &euro;22 billion in spending to the economy each year.  The State is growing significant tax revenues from the increased employment and the increased allocation that we are making.<br/><br/>The other &euro;12 million is to focus on IDA Ireland's regional property programme, which has been a significant part of our new approach to regional development.  IDA Ireland has set ambitious targets for winning additional projects, including a more ambitious property programme.  Specifically, the &euro;12 million will see the construction of three advance technology buildings in Sligo, Castlebar and Tralee.  There will also be large site infrastructure upgrades in Dundalk and Sligo and some strategic site acquisitions in the mid-west and north west.  This work will help to strengthen the magnets within the regions for attracting new investment and assist IDA Ireland in achieving its targets.<br/><br/>Regarding the programme for research in third level institutions, PRTLI, the additional &euro;25 million will help to pay off the State's commitment under the PRTLI's cycle 5.  It will also benefit the Exchequer in various ways, including by assisting quicker European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, claim submissions by Ireland, as the PRTLI is co-funded under the 2007-13 ERDF programme, which is still administratively live.  This will create new business head room capacity for future capital provisions by our Department by effectively paying off the PRTLI mortgage sooner.  It will also help the cashflow capacity of some colleges, enabling them to complete projects and move on to new ones.  This is pertinent for the institutes of technology in Dublin and Cork.<br/><br/>Regarding performance indicators, which do not specifically relate to this Supplementary Estimate <i>per se</i>, I am aware that the committee is seeking to improve and smarten the quality of indicators.  My Department is working with the committee's officials to try to secure better performance indicators that will provide more meaningful material for members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-01a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1071" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2015120100002#C00200"><p>I welcome the Minister and his officials.  We will start with subhead A5 on IDA Ireland and commend its people on their work, in particular the team in the field abroad.  Those people are doing a fantastic job.  I will drill down into some of the specifics on the regional property investment.  Three locations are before us, but were other locations considered and not progressed?  What were the specific advantages of these three locations over others?</p> <p>  The Minister fleshed out a certain phrase, namely, "securing strategic sites".  Is this from a legal point of view, for example, title, or is it from the point of view of investing in site security?  The third option is new sites.  What will the breakdown in expenditure be between securing strategic sites and upgrading existing IDA Ireland business parks?</p> <p>  Of the grants to industry, how much has been repaid this year by client companies that did not reach their targets or fulfil their agreements?</p> <p>  The international media's response to the events of the past week regarding Pfizer and Allergan has been negative and uneducated.  Have IDA Ireland's feelers detected any negative reaction?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-01a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2015120100002#C00300"><p>I am sorry, but I did not catch all of that.</p></speech>

Much of the commentary has been negative and uneducated.  Has IDA Ireland picked up on any impact in terms of investments?</p> <p>  I also have questions on subhead B4.  May I ask them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-01a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1099" speakername="Marcella Corcoran Kennedy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2015120100002#D00050"><p>Yes, if the Deputy wishes to do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-01a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1071" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2015120100002#D00100"><p>I have a general question.  Earlier this year, a damning letter signed by the senior members of the research community in Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, was sent to the Department.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy English, has put a great deal of effort since then into addressing the issues raised in that letter.  Will the Minister give an update on the relationships with the Department at present?  Have the concerns that were expressed in letter to which I refer been addressed in the Estimates? </p> <p>  Finally, if it is at all possible, I encourage the Minister to work with members to try to reach agreement on the performance indicators because that would be a very good legacy for this committee to leave behind.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-01a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2015120100002#D00200"><p>On the first issue, other locations were considered.  Essentially, 12 locations in total were selected by IDA Ireland.  There are one or two proposals for each of the regions.  All of the regions outside Dublin have locations, which were selected on the basis of their effectiveness in the context of attracting IDA Ireland investors.  This is the first venture in IDA Ireland's return to providing advance construction.  The infrastructure is being located in areas with sectoral strengths, a labour pool that can be marketed as an effective magnet, access to education network and so on.  IDA Ireland has a matrix against which it sought to select locations.  While it has outlined a certain number of locations, it has not closed off the possibility of additional ones.  As I recall it, approximately 30% of the total amount of money is being assigned to these other locations.  The distinction between upgrading and securing sites is as the Deputy outlined, upgrading is strengthening the existing base of property to make it more accessible to market whereas the other could be looking at new assets for the continuing regional programme.  This programme is part of the regional strategy.  Overall success in this area will depend on a number of elements.  We will be seeking to work with local authorities to create better support.  We will also be seeking to work with the institutes of technology to have a regional skills strategies which will be part of the marketing tool that will be used by IDA Ireland to win investment.  A good deal of the other material in the regional plans is designed to bolster the capacity of the regions to win business.  This is not a stand-alone instrument with regard to pursuing the 30% to 40% increase.  The repayment by clients typically runs to the order of &euro;2 million per year.  I do not think we have a specific figure for the year to date but we will see if such data are available.</p> <p>  The issue in regard to Pfizer-Allergan essentially relates to US tax law and instances where companies have decided to make certain decisions about their strategic location.  Both companies have a substantial presence in Ireland.  IDA Ireland does not encourage inversions in any form and it does not expect that this announcement will have an adverse impact on its capacity to win projects for Ireland.  This has been a feature of the landscape for quite some time.  Obviously, attention is heightened in the present electoral phase in the US.  Clearly, there are issues in American tax law, which, as the Deputy knows, have caused concern.  There has not been much change in US tax law in spite of the acknowledgement that there is a problem.</p><p> The Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, has done considerable work in dealing with the letter from the research community of SFI.  To some degree it was based on some misunderstanding of what they were seeking to do.  Today, an additional &euro;5.5 million is being provided in the Supplementary Estimates, specifically to support the research community in building the required infrastructural capacity and to accomplish high quality STEM workers.  The Government is developing an innovation strategy which will be published, which is being steered through by the Minister of State.  The Supplementary Estimate is definitively a help in term of creating the new business friendly capacity into the future for the research funding.  Discussions are ongoing with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the new science strategy funding capacity out to 2020.  Today's announcement is a significant help in that regard.  </p><p> I am very interested in performance indicators.  We publish wider indicators than can fit into the Revised Estimates Volume, REV.  The REV is a fairly constrained document in which we only have little boxes to fill.  We provide much more detailed information in Ireland Stat.  Perhaps when we progress the dialogue we can use the wider indicators.  We have sought to take on board the view of the committee in September in the ones we are submitting to the REV, which is currently under development.  Obviously the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has a key role in deciding what goes into the REV.  We work within a framework which they have created more widely, but I am very happy to share with the committee the sort of dashboard of indicators that we publish and track.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-01a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1110" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2015120100002#E00300"><p>I welcome the Minister and his officials.  I compliment IDA Ireland on its success in 2015 and indeed in the past number of years in job creation and also the plans for the regional facilities which are certainly very welcome.</p> <p>  I wish to raise a number of questions on the table in the briefing note on the percentage of investment projects to be outside Dublin and Cork.  There were targets for 50% in 2013 and 2014, which were not quite reached, but there was no target set for 2015.  Will the Minister explain the basis of that?</p> <p>  IDA Ireland has received requests for a large number of large grant payments from companies that have completed investment projects.  Does the Minister consider this as evidence of expansion and job creation?  Does he have any concerns in relation to the Estimates for 2016?  Will this be replicated in 2016 as well?</p> <p>  I addressed a question to Enterprise Ireland on &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta when it came before the committee.  I know that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s is not under the Minister's remit, but does IDA Ireland have a supportive relationship with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s?  I know that Enterprise Ireland said it had a relationship in respect of research.  I wonder if IDA Ireland has a role as well?  I am concerned about it.  I fully support the increases in the budget for IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, but &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is being left behind to a degree.  I know it is not the Minister's brief, but it needs to be raised at Cabinet.  There needs to be extra capital funding to ensure we secure jobs in the Gaeltacht area which is also important to the Irish language.</p><p>Is there any evidence the IDA is being hampered by planning laws compared to other European countries?  Are we more liable to challenges and delays in planning compared to other European countries, and could it have an impact on job creation?  Have the IDA or Enterprise Ireland raised it with the Minister regarding major projects?</p><p> On subhead B5, I welcome the projects listed, including two in NUI Galway, namely Advancing Medicine Through Discovery and a new research building for arts, humanities and social sciences, to cost over &euro;2.4 million.  How are the projects evaluated regarding jobs potential and their impact on job creation?  Is there very stringent oversight of the programmes by the Minister&rsquo;s Department?  There are several programmes, totalling some &euro;23.5 million, which I welcome.  What is the Department&rsquo;s role in evaluating them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-01a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2015120100002#F00200"><p>The 50% target applied to the previous five year plan and it was very clear it had not been realised.  To be fair to the IDA, there had been a progressive improvement in the proportion of projects that were won outside Dublin and Cork, as shown in the table.  From 30% in 2013, it increased to 37% in 2014.  I recall that it was lower than 30% in 2012.  In the new approach, the IDA took a different view and said it would strengthen each individual region in terms of the regional management structure and the flow of information between the regions and their IDA offices overseas, which it has strengthened with additional staff and liaison, and that it would set a new target of a 30% to 40% increase in the projects won.  It developed a different strategy with more tools in the locker.  To complement this, we devised the regional enterprise strategy, to try to get more of the local players involved and make a more coherent offer in terms of winning additional FDI.</p> <p>  The target going through will be the projects won in the years ahead rather than the 50% target outside Cork.  Each of the regions will be individually examined.  This is a more stretched target in many ways and is also more relevant, in that each region can assess how it is doing.  There is a monitoring committee within each region, with both private and public sector participation, which will seek to review how we are doing.</p> <p>  The earlier call-down is an indicator of the health of projects, the quicker ramp-up of project and, perhaps, the sectoral mix whereby we will get a different profile of projects that will have a quicker drawdown on cash.  Overall, there is a higher percentage drawdown than anticipated.  The provision we make in 2015 is a weighted average of approvals over a number of years with a certain assumed drawdown.  The profile has scrunched up, and this is the cause.  To some degree, bringing it forward may ease pressures later.  With the healthy pipeline, we are considering an increase in the provision for 2016 and are continuing to talk to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform about the possibilities of pressure arising there.</p> <p>  Regarding &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, we have very good relations among the family of agencies.  One of my goals in the regional enterprise strategy is to break down the silos that exist between Departments and agencies, and get a catalyst going at regional level to see projects that are of value being progressed by joint effort.  While we do not have a capital allocation goal for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, we would support projects it is developing, where possible, and the IDA sometimes assists with specific project grants.</p><p>The IDA has not given any particular signal that planning laws, challenges or delays, as the Deputy said, are a problem.  I think he knows there are concerns in his constituency about the provision of a particular road.  IDA and local authority officials are working on that.  Overall, one of the areas where Ireland has been weak in terms of competitiveness evaluations has been the speed of planning permits and construction permissions.  It is an area that deserves attention as we move on.  It is one of the areas that comes up each year when we examine where we stand against our competitors.  It is certainly something I will seek to address through this closer alliance with local authorities to work towards shared objectives.  It is to be hoped that will help to negotiate some of these planning delays more quickly.  That is part of the purpose.</p><p> The PRTLI is essentially about capital equipment and beefing up the capital capacity of the institutes of education.  The HEA administers that on our behalf.  In terms of evaluation, it is difficult to turn investment in a particular piece of equipment into a job profile, but we work hard on that.  Within Enterprise Ireland, we have a group called Knowledge Transfer Ireland which is working to establish how our assets, including our intellectual property and licences, can be more quickly transferred into business and on into employment.  They are doing an evaluation of how well we do it.  They will provide a framework within which we can look at the performance of different institutes of education and one hopes that will provide us with policy insight into how we can sweat the assets more effectively.  As the committee knows, Science Foundation Ireland has become more discerning in its allocation of science money where it must not only have excellent science but come through a second gateway which is potential impact on areas where we have a competitive advantage and the ability to win joint funding from the private sector.  We have more intermediate steps as to the effectiveness of these institutions rather than being able to say how much we put in and the job impact at the other end of the funnel.</p></speech>

The funds for the IDA will no doubt help to realise the regional aspects of the Action Plan for Jobs.  To see the additional funding going into Tyndall, Science Foundation Ireland and the third level institutions is also excellent.  I thank the Minister and his officials for attending.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-01a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1010" speakername="Joanna Tuffy" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED22015120100002#C00300"><p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, and the officials from her Department.  We are meeting to consider the Supplementary Estimate for Vote 37 - Social Protection for an amount of &euro;299 million.  For these items under discussion the committee has an opportunity to review the additional allocations now being sought on an item by item basis, focus on the reason these additional allocations are now being sought by the Department of Social Protection, and review the targets set for the relevant items, the resources already made available for these items and the outputs and impact of the activities concerned.  I invite the Minister to make some brief opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-01a.31" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED22015120100002#C00400"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to present a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Social Protection.  I propose to briefly outline the overall expected financial position of the Department post the budget and the main reasons for the Supplementary Estimate.</p> <p>  I am seeking a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;299 million for 2015.  This is necessary for two reasons, first, to part-fund the Christmas bonus costing &euro;198 million for around 1.25 million recipients and, second, to fund payments to pensioners and other recipients normally due on New Year's Day, 1 January 2016, to be paid in 2015 at a cost of &euro;127 million.  These two elements, when added together, are greater than the Supplementary Estimate being sought.</p> <p>  Overall expenditure on the Department's schemes, services and administration in 2015 is expected to be &euro;19,894 million.  This will be &euro;516 million or 2.7% more than provided for in the original 2015 Revised Estimates.  As I mentioned, &euro;198 million is required for the payment of the Christmas bonus, &euro;127 million is required to advance payments due to pensioners on 1 January 2016 to 2015, with the remaining &euro;190 million due to higher expenditure on a number of schemes, as detailed in the Supplementary Estimate briefing template supplied to the committee secretariat.</p> <p>  Income from PRSI receipts during 2015 will result in Social Insurance Fund income in 2015 of an estimated &euro;8,439 million.  This will be over &euro;200 million or 2.5% ahead of profile and will be &euro;548 million or 6.9% ahead of the position in 2014.</p> <p>  Before making provision for the Christmas bonus and advance payments to recipients of Social Insurance Fund schemes, the net position of expenditure on the fund is on target when compared to the 2015 Revised Estimate.  Approximately &euro;200 million of the Department&rsquo;s additional spending requirement in 2015 will be required to fund the Christmas bonus and advance pay day to Social Insurance Fund scheme recipients.  This additional expenditure will be funded directly or indirectly from the higher PRSI receipts we are now receiving as a result of more people at work.</p> <p>  In this regard, it is worth noting that income from the Social Insurance Fund has increased from &euro;6.7 billion in 2010 to more than &euro;8.4 billion in 2015, an increase of &euro;1.7 billion or 25.8%.</p> <p>  The current account deficit of the Social Insurance Fund peaked at &euro;2.75 billion in 2010 and will have fallen to &euro;180 million in 2015.    The 2016 budget Estimate has provided for a surplus of &euro;215 million in 2016, the first such surplus since 2007.</p><p>The live register is expected to average around 345,000 in 2015.  This is a reduction of 40,000 on the average for 2014 or 100,000 better than the average for 2011.  An additional &euro;120.1 million is being sought for jobseeker's allowance in the Supplementary Estimate.  However, &euro;15.9 million of this will be offset by an expected underspend on jobseeker's benefit.  Some &euro;32.3 million is needed to pay the Christmas bonus and &euro;11.6 million is required to advance the payments due to jobseeker's on 1 January 2016 to an earlier date in December 2015.  The remaining additional funding is required for higher recipients due to a higher average live register outturn of 345,000 in 2015 than the average of 337,000 in the 2015 Rev financial allocation. </p><p> The 2015 Supplementary Estimate referred by the D&aacute;il and the briefing provided to committee members lists the schemes for which additional sums have been sought as well as some underspends.  We can go through the position of the individual schemes as required during this hearing.</p><p> To conclude, I hope my opening statement has given members a good overview of the Department's expenditure in 2015 and the reasons underlying the necessity to seek a Supplementary Estimate.  The schemes and services operated by the Department benefit everybody in society, either directly or indirectly.  The Christmas bonus will be a boost for low income welfare recipients, pensioners, retired people and carers in particular as well as people with a disability but it will also provide a boost to the domestic economy.</p><p> I look forward to discussing the Supplementary Estimate of &euro;299 million with the committee. </p></speech>

I understand the reasons for it and I do not oppose it.  I have a number of general questions.</p> <p>  There is a large under-estimate in respect of the jobseeker's figures, nearly 7,500 people.  Was that a surprise?  </p> <p>  There is significant under-estimate for the overall figure for the number of people in receipt of lone parent's allowance, almost 3,400 more than anticipated at a cost of &euro;55.32 million.  Does that mean that the movement from welfare to work, which is supposed to occur among lone parents is not actually happening?  </p> <p>  The second part of the Estimate deals with the underspend.  There is an underspend of &euro;7.350 million on the family dividend.  If memory serves me correctly, the projected expenditure for the family dividend was of the order of &euro;22 million or thereabouts, that would mean that one in three people who should be entitled to take up the family dividend has not taken it up.  Is there some reason for that?</p> <p>  I noted over the weekend a number of statements, one in particular by the Taoiseach, in which he referred to an extra payment, which the Government is planning to make to low income people to encourage them away from welfare and into work.  Members will be aware of the family income supplement.  The family dividend also falls into that category.  Is the Taoiseach referring to the family dividend or is a new third payment envisaged?  Would the Minister know about that?</p> <p>  My final question is a general one which might be more relevant for other Departments, which immediately spring to mind.  As the Minister will know the rules have been changed and this is the last year for Supplementary Estimates, so should there be an over-spend next year, over and above what is anticipated what will happen?  Will there be a substitute for this process?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-01a.35" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED22015120100002#D00400"><p>I can only assume the absence of the rest of the Opposition is because by and large they are happy enough with the very positive changes in social welfare and they have left it in the good hands of Deputy O'Dea to speak for all of them.  Many of the changes we made are positive for many people.</p> <p>  The additional money that is being sought for the jobseeker's allowance is &euro;120.11 million but this is offset by an expected underspend of &euro;15.9 million on jobseeker's benefit.  The net figure is &euro;104.2 million.  Some &euro;32 million of the &euro;104 million is the payment of the Christmas bonus for people on jobseeker's payments.  Some &euro;11.6 million is for advance payments due to some of the recipients of jobseeker's allowance and benefit who would be paid on Friday, 1 January but the payment has been brought forward a day earlier to Thursday, 31 December.  The balance of &euro;60.3 million is due to higher numbers of jobseekers getting a payment and other factors such as higher average payment values.</p> <p>  The Deputy probably knows it from his own constituency that people who emigrated have been returning home, for example people who have been in Australia for two or three years.  In many cases they were involved in construction.  I know that in rural areas people might not get work immediately, they may have recourse for some period provided they satisfy the habitual residence condition, HRC, to jobseeker's and they may well qualify on income grounds.</p> <p>  The 2015 Revised Estimates Volume, REV, made a financial provision for an average live register of 337,000 but the outturn is expected to be somewhat higher because of returning emigrants.  The figure will be approximately 6,700 higher than the provision in the 2015 REV, but I think there is a positive element because from my experience of going around the country, it encompasses a number of people coming home.  Members may be aware of the Australian system of visas, where people will have exhausted their period at the end of two years.</p> <p>  There are 40,000 fewer people than the outturn in 2014 and 100,000 fewer than 2011, when the live register averaged 445,000.  In fact today we have the CSO estimated figures for unemployment at the end of November, which is 191,000.  Given where we started in these discussions some years ago, when everybody was forecasting that the Irish economy could hit an unemployment figure of 500,000, it is really positive news. </p> <p>  Expenditure on jobseeker's will have fallen from just over &euro;3.9 billion in 2011 to just over &euro;3.1 billion in 2015.  That is a reduction of &euro;783 million or 20.1%.  On the one-parent family payment, the extra &euro;63.3 million, some &euro;7 million is required to pay the Christmas bonus, &euro;8.3 million is due to the freezing of the earnings disregard for one-family payments at the 2014 level of &euro;90 from January 2015 - members may remember I introduced that in legislation earlier in the year.  Some &euro;14.5 million is due to the extension of the special provision for carers to those caring for another adult.  It was always extended to people caring for children, but in discussion at committee meetings, we extended it to people caring for adults.</p><p>Those recipients remain on the one-parent family payment, while continuing to receive the carer's allowance at half rate.  This provision applies until the youngest child is 16 years of age.  Some &euro;29 million is due to approximately 5,000 fewer people than expected having transferred to the jobseeker's transitional payment on 2 July 2015.  In other words, the Estimate provided for 19,000 but only 14,000 people transferred.  The &euro;9.2 million is due to higher average payment values for those remaining on the one-parent family payment after July 2015.  This is because recipients whose youngest children are younger than seven years of age are less likely to be working or they work less than those with older children.  The remaining recipients are, therefore, likely to have less means.  This is offset by &euro;4.7 million arising from various offsetting factors.  </p><p> The number of one-parent family recipients that transitioned from the scheme in July, at 25,500, was less than the estimated 29,400.  In addition to the extension of the carer's special provision, this is due to a number of factors, including cases where lone parents had a child under the age threshold but had not made this known to their local offices, customers who are mid-way through a full-time course of education who are eligible to remain on one-parent family payment until such time as they complete their courses and special provision for customers in receipt of a blind pension which allows them to remain on one-parent family payment until their youngest child is 16 years of age.  As noted by the Deputy, there has been a significant increase in family income supplement, FIS, arising from the reforms introduced in July.  This has resulted in additional expenditure on FIS of approximately &euro;630,000 per week to end July and approximately &euro;760,000 per week up to end October.  The impact on FIS could be approximately &euro;40 million in a full year but I always anticipated that many people, once they transitioned through the reforms, would benefit from a significant increase in income.  </p><p> The increase in the number of lone parents availing of FIS is a positive outcome of the reforms as this indicates that the people involved have increased their working hours or found employment.  As of end November, approximately 7,200 former lone parent recipients are in receipt of the back-to-work family dividend, out of a total back-to-work family claim load of approximately 10,200.  There were 10,760 qualified child beneficiaries associated with these recipients.  The majority of former lone parent payment recipients are now in receipt of the back-to-work dividend and family income supplement.  Members who are familiar with individual cases in this area will know that these people have received a significant boost to their incomes.  I introduced this reform because I want the emphasis to be on people, once their children reach a certain age, being able to take up education and employment and boost their incomes.  I think this is a view shared across Government, including by the Taoiseach.</p><p> On 1 January next the minimum wage will increase.  Changes have also been made to the step-effects of PRSI such that all the benefits will be to the income earner.  We have also increased the FIS allowance by &euro;5 in respect of a first child and &euro;10 in respect of a second and subsequent children.  From January, the earnings of the families about which we are now speaking, many of whom are on low wages, should increase significantly.   I think that is good.  Provision of &euro;30 million is also made for the back-to-work family dividend, which has proven very popular.  There are now over 10,000 in receipt of this payment which we introduced in May.  I am satisfied that people and employers are aware of this scheme and that many people are now taking it up.  It is very beneficial.  This cohort of people will also benefit from the increases in child benefit and, more than likely, from some of the changes to the USC, in particular the raising of the threshold in the case of those who work part-time.</p></speech>

People in Ballyfermot have said to me that they did not expect an increase in their entitlements so quickly.  It is appropriate that this is acknowledged and that the T&aacute;naiste and her staff are commended in that regard.</p></speech>

I spent last Saturday in Thomas Street in the inner city.  Despite that it was a miserable day the mood of stall holders and customers in the market was very positive, many of them looking forward to getting the increased Christmas bonus.  The reason for this positivity among people is the fact that they are now beginning to recoup much of the money they lost over the last number of years.</p> <p>  I received a telephone call this morning from a young man in the 18 to 24 year age group who was told at his local post office that he is not eligible for the Christmas bonus because he has not been in receipt for social protection benefits for 50 months.  Is that correct?  If it is, I was not aware of that.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-01a.39" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED22015120100002#E00400"><p>First, I thank Deputy Conaghan for his comments.  On carer's benefits and restoration of the respite care grant, which I am pleased to have been able to provide for, expenditure on carers in 2012 was &euro;772 million.  Expenditure in this regard for this year was &euro;866 million.  It is estimated that expenditure in this area will be approximately &euro;911 million, which is close to &euro;1 billion.  This was an issue of much debate during the early lifetime of this Government.  In 2011, there were 50,600 carers in receipt of the carer's allowance.  This year there were 60,000 carers in receipt of the carer's allowance, which is a 20% increase in the number of carers in Ireland during the term of office of this Government.</p> <p>  Members will recall that when I took up my position as T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, many problems were being experienced in relation to the IT platforms through which applications and payments for people such as carers are processed.  Following a streamlining of these measures the number of people in receipt of carer's allowance has been increasing steadily every year and is now, as I said, 20% higher.  In regard to domiciliary care allowance, while previously there were 23,900 people in receipt of this payment in respect of children this year the number of recipients increased to 27,990, which is an increase of approximately 4,000.  There was much commentary at that time, although not by anybody present here today, to the effect that people were, somehow or other, being prevented from accessing the domiciliary care or carer's allowances.  As I have just indicated, the number of recipients in respect of both payments has increased. </p> <p>  Members will be aware that the respite care grant is also being restored, which I welcome, and will now be called the carer support grant, the reason for which is based on the fact that many of the recipients are caring for people with whom they are living and are spending the grant on those people.  In other cases, it is spent, without a doubt, on respite for either the person being cared for or the carer.</p><p>We are just going to call it the carer's support grant from now on.  The number of people receiving this payment has increased from 76,700 to 90,550.  There was a very significant increase in the numbers between 2011 and 2015.  I assure those who know of cases involving people who should apply for carer's allowance or domiciliary care allowance that the new systems have worked very well.  We are getting more people through by using these systems.</p></speech>

The Christmas bonus is paid under the same terms and conditions under which it has always been paid.  It is paid to long-term recipients of social welfare payments.  This means it covers the full range of social welfare payments.  Obviously, people associate it most with pensioners and retired people, but it is also paid to carers, lone parents, people on disability and people who are long-term unemployed.  There is no restriction on the age at which people can receive the bonus, but they have to be in receipt of a social welfare payment for more than 15 months.  For example, a young person who transfers from the domiciliary care allowance, which is paid to his or her parents, to a disability payment at the age of 16 immediately qualifies for the bonus because he or she is deemed to have been on a long-term social welfare payment.</p></speech>

This will also apply to paternity leave in the future.  They are the principal payments out of the Social Insurance Fund.  It is extremely important for the future stability of the fund, which is going to be there for people, that we bring it back into balance and eliminate the deficit.  I have given some figures in respect of carers.  Every year, we put aside an additional amount of approximately &euro;200 million to cater for the increase in the number of people qualifying for payments like retirement payments, in particular, and the payments made to widows.  This means we can say to such people with assurance that the deficit in the fund, which was just under &euro;2.8 billion, has now been reduced to some &euro;180 million.  I anticipate on the basis of current expectations that when we get the final figure for December, it will be much lower than that.  Obviously, as I said earlier, some of that is being used for the Christmas bonus.  The social insurance forecast for next year is extremely good.  There are challenges ahead as the number of people of pension age increases and those who come into retirement happily live a lot longer.  Obviously, that is something we will need to address over the years ahead.  To that end, I have been proposing the supplementary pension for people in work and I am anxious to make provision for that.</p></speech>

I would like to be fair to the Department of Social Protection by giving it credit as one of the Departments to have achieved the greatest transformation over the period of this Government.  Unfortunately, the Minister does not need me to tell her that neither her nor her Department gets sufficient credit in the national media.  I think the Department has made incredible steps.  If one looks at the Pathways to Work document, one will see a huge list of significant, tangible and real achievements that have been made and steps that are being taken.  I was talking to a young man of about 21 years of age the other day.  I told him that as he is not on any payment, he would be entitled to jobseeker's allowance.  When I advised him to make such an application, he said "do not talk to me, it would not be worth my while, I could not be doing with it at all".  I asked him why not and reminded him that he was entitled to it.  I suggested to him that he might as well get on the allowance so that we could get him on a scheme, but he said "no, they would wreck your head".  He said that some of his friends who are on unemployment benefit are having their heads wrecked with schemes and activation measures.  I said that what he saw as a challenge was really an opportunity to get off the live register.  The figures speak for themselves.  The steps introduced by the Government under the Pathways to Work scheme have shifted over 61,000 people from the long-term live register.  I congratulate the Minister on that figure, which speaks for itself.</p> <p>  I want to ask the Minister about some of the schemes that have been mentioned, including the community employment scheme, T&uacute;s and Gateway.  The biggest issue regarding these schemes that I have to deal with as a politician on the ground relates to people wanting to extend their stays on these schemes.  There is not a week that goes by without my sending a letter to the Minister or someone else looking for people's schemes to be extended.  Of course it is not possible to extend them and I understand why that is the case.  I think there is an overarching issue here.  The Gateway scheme, which was very much derided when it was introduced by those who suggested it was akin to slave labour, is hugely popular.</p></speech>

The only difference is that the Gateway scheme is managed by the councils and the community employment scheme is managed by private companies.  There is a cohort of people who were victims of the downturn in the economy and lost their jobs on building sites, etc., when they were their late 40s or early 50s.  Five, six or seven years on, there is no realistic prospect of them getting back into the workplace.  As they are finding it hard to find work, they really appreciate the existence of these schemes.  They are happy to contribute to and be part of something.  There is a real scarcity of places on these schemes.  Does the Department of Social Protection have any plans to extend the capacity of the existing schemes or develop new schemes to cater for people in their 50s and early 60s?  Many people in this age group do not see themselves getting back into the workplace, and understandably so in some instances.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-01a.48" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED22015120100002#F00900"><p>We keep all of the schemes constantly under review.  We will set out our aims and ambitions when we are launching the next Pathways to Work programme within the next week or two.  I appreciate that the composition of the schemes has changed to take account of two groups that need to be focused on - younger people under the age of 25 and older people who lost their jobs at the height of the difficulties, as mentioned by Deputy Daly, and are finding it difficult to get other jobs.  We have some proposals on how to give better opportunities to such people.</p> <p>  I wish to stress another aspect of the community employment scheme and the other schemes.  Sometimes economists do not understand that such schemes provide significant levels of service to people in certain rural and urban communities, particularly in areas that might be less economically well off.  I refer, for example, to the impact of various schemes, such as the rural social scheme, on areas like Ballyhoura.  The use of such schemes by strong community management teams has had a positive effect.  I notice that in my own constituency, for example.  I must give credit to Limerick, as I have done previously, because it was really the pioneer of the Gateway schemes in the aftermath of the awful floods a couple of years ago.  I compliment the foresight of the management in Limerick County Council on giving many young men, in particular, including many in the area around King's Island who had not been working, an opportunity to take part in community employment and similar schemes.  That was where Gateway was launched.  It has proven extremely popular ever since.  Now that a number of local authorities are beginning to recruit - I understand this includes the council in Limerick - I am glad to note that some of those who are being taken on as general operatives have worked on the Gateway scheme.</p><p>Essentially, they have the 12 or 22 months of experience that they can cite as their best reference working with the council.  I thank also the people at council level throughout the country who have been involved in the scheme.  I was out with my own people in Fingal County Council recently and some of the people working on the Gateway scheme.  Much of the work is on historic parks and gardens.  A huge number of skills are being learned and developed.  The scheme is positively received by the local community and people are happy to be involved in something that is benefitting their local community.  While we are reviewing all the schemes, I am conscious of older people.  We did not have the resources up to now because the focus was to get people who were unemployed some experience that would get them back into work, but we have revamped the whole child care and care element of community employment to include a training module.  I would like to see more of that on more of the schemes.  T&uacute;s has also been very popular.  The transition of people on T&uacute;s, which is a one-year scheme, to work has been surprisingly positive, given that some of the people have been out of work for a while.</p></speech>

One of the savings, which is in pay, is &euro;3 million.  It states that one of the factors giving rise to the saving or underspend is slower-than-expected filling of vacancies.  What is the issue there?  One would have thought that in the current climate it would not be difficult to fill vacancies.  How is that affecting the workload of the people who are there at present?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-01a.53" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED22015120100002#G00500"><p>It is anticipated that there will be an underspend of &euro;3 million in the Department's budget at the end of the year under this heading.  This is because the Department was unable to source staff to fill critical posts that became vacant, primarily due to retirements.  It is anticipated that about 170 staff will have retired by the end of this year and due to the moratorium on recruitment there were no panels from which to source staff.  However, I am happy to say that following a number of Public Appointments Service competitions earlier this year, staff are now becoming available.  We got the go-ahead from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in April.  Filling the posts from the external panels was not easy.  As one will appreciate, even last April a lot of graduates were applying for some of the jobs but by the time the panel came to be appointed many of those people had already found work.  It is an issue in public service recruitment that the panel process, while it is very fair, it can be very lengthy.  Obviously, if people are waiting for a long time and something else comes up, they may well take it.  It is an issue generally across public service recruitment.</p></speech>

We propose to continue them on an ongoing basis.  The employment control framework figure at the end of the year is 6,350, and we also have 20 people from the Garda and 218 people working on the public services card, which gives a total of 6,588.  The actual number at the end of October was 6,550.  Even now we are recruiting in or around another 40 people.  We expect that process to be ongoing.</p></speech>

Is it that there was an overestimate for these?</p></speech>

The original Estimate for JobPath for 2015 was &euro;12 million.  At the time it was thought that JobPath would commence earlier in 2015 than turned out to be the case.  There were many complications around contracts, tendering and so on.  Provision was made for a more aggressive roll-out schedule, with multiple locations going live over a shorter period.  The contracts were signed on 5 June and the roll-out of services commenced on a soft launch basis in mid-July because that coincided with the holiday period.  The soft launch approach was agreed in consultation with JobPath companies to allow more time to secure properties, recruit their staff and develop systems and procedures.  The later start date and the soft launch roll-out has resulted in fewer fees falling due for payment in 2015.  Currently, JobPath services are being provided to jobseekers from 32 departmental locations across the country, and some 5,000 jobseekers have been referred to JobPath so far, a significant number given that it meant setting up office points at 32 locations.  We expect that will continue in 2016 and will be completed then.  Obviously, the actual cost of JobPath will be determined by the number of jobseekers who are referred and the number who gain sustained employment.  The contingency provision in the Department's accounts was more than &euro;5 million.  So far we have not needed any of it, and it does not appear as though we will, although these may be famous last words.</p></speech>

The review was carried out not long after I came into office, so it was at the height of the employment difficulties.  Much of it was based on the then unemployment figures.  The deficit in the fund had grown alarmingly at the beginning of our term, up to nearly &euro;2.8 billion.  We started the process of getting people back to work.  After a period, if not immediately, anyone who gets back to work begins to pay PRSI, as does his or her employer, and people who go into self-employment pay their self-employment contribution.  Once the balance is changed between people on the live register and people going back to work, which is what we are doing now, it has an enormous tonic effect on the Social Insurance Fund.  Members will recall that when the troika presented its forecast of the position for this year it did not forecast anything as good as the outturn we have had.  It still anticipated cuts, if I remember correctly, of about &euro;1 billion this year.  It anticipated interest costs of &euro;11 billion this year, but we have got that down to less than &euro;7 billion.  Its forecast for unemployment was far worse than what we have actually achieved.  The people doing the actuarial review would have been influenced, obviously, by those forecasts.  The actuarial review will commence next year, as required by legislation.  As we are coming into an improving period, it will show those improvements but it will also reference the fact that we are spending &euro;200 million a year - that is, &euro;1 billion every five years - for the extra retired people who have a retirement pension.</p><p>That is &euro;1 billion every five years for the extra retired people who have a retirement pension.  That will not change.  In fact, if anything the cost of that will increase.  We also have to factor in what I hope will be rate increases for pensioners.  We were able to provide a rate increase this year of &euro;3 per week which is the first rate increase since 2009.  We were also able to bring back the Christmas bonus, again the first time since 2009.  Also pensioners of a certain age or of limited income who receive the fuel allowance will also get an additional &euro;2.50 per week from 1 January.  It is quite a significant onward cost.  Obviously, quite a few pensioners are carers.  Carers will also receive the respite care grant which will be reinstated at &euro;1,700.  I anticipate that as economic progress continues we will continue to provide - that is my ambition - for rate increases for pensioners so that will be a charge on the fund.  We must remember that money is spent largely in Ireland in the domestic economy.  This is good in terms of retail businesses and services businesses in particular.</p></speech>

This will bring my overall capital envelope this year to more than &euro;1.07 billion.  This additional funding will further support our public transport system, allow for much needed maintenance of our road network and facilitate the speedier roll-out of a number of key projects.</p><p>The &euro;100 million breaks down as follows: &euro;60 million<b></b>is being allocated to the public transport investment programme.  Of this &euro;29 million is being allocated for rail fleet maintenance, &euro;9 million for safety works, maintenance and renewal of the heavy rail network nationwide, &euro;20 million for the provision of public service obligation, PSO, buses for the Dublin Bus fleet, and close to &euro;2 million for cycle measures in the greater Dublin area.  Some &euro;34 million<b></b>is being allocated to the roads programme.  This will target critical remedial works, maintenance and strengthening of the road network at national, regional and local level, where funding has been severely constrained since the crisis began. </p><p>This spend has a wide geographic spread and will have positive economic impact.  Of this, &euro;10 million has been allocated to pavement works on our national road network, and &euro;24 million will go towards regional and local roads, which will allow the upgrading of 350 km of sub-standard road pavement to be brought up to a high standard.  Some &euro;3 million<b></b>will be allocated to complete the Mullingar&ndash;Athlone greenway, &euro;1 million to tourism related projects, &euro;800,000<b></b>will be allocated to the national indoor arena and &euro;260,000<b></b>to procure drug testing devices and progress work on the third payment option for fixed charge notices.</p><p>As this committee is only too aware, the level of funding for roads and public transport has fallen well below comparable international standards.  From a peak of &euro;3 billion or 1.6% of national income in 2008 to a historic low of &euro;850 million, 0.5% of national income in 2014, it is evident to all who travel across the country that investment in road maintenance and strengthening is an urgent priority.  This additional investment will bring the overall capital investment programme in roads to &euro;610 million this year.  We need this to make the road network safer and to support economic development.  Funds are also being provided for road safety measures.</p><p>As we build on the progress we have been making in recent years, more people are returning to work.  This is, indeed, great news.  However, it is also resulting in a rise in congestion levels in certain areas.  This threatens to slow economic activity and has a negative impact on people's living standards.  Today&rsquo;s funding will support the renewal and expansion of our bus fleet, which will improve reliability; enhance rail journey times and expand the bike share scheme, all of which will combat congestion and help facilitate further growth.  It will bring total capital investment in public transport this year to almost &euro;340 million.</p><p>From 2016 onwards, we have agreed a capital plan which provides close to &euro;10 billion in funding over seven years for land transport investment, moving us from an annual investment figure of around &euro;1 billion this year to &euro;1.93 billion in 2022.  This is a clear signal that we are addressing the funding needs which I outlined earlier.  We must continue to make choices.  We must have priorities.  These include a return to the necessary levels of investment, a major transport project for north Dublin and a schedule of investment to expand and improve the road network around Ireland.  It is predicated on three priorities of maintaining and upgrading our existing transport network, targeting urban congestion and improving connectivity around the country, particularly to key seaports and airports. </p><p>In respect of tourism, I am delighted that the additional &euro;3 million investment in the Mullingar to Athlone greenway will complete this phase of a more ambitious Dublin to Galway greenway to a high standard.  The Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland&rsquo;s ancient east initiatives are key platforms to build and enhance the visitor experience and &euro;1 million of investment will be made in signage to enhance both of these experiences.  Investment will also be made in development of other tourism capital development priorities such as the &quot;Ulysses Centre&quot; - University College Dublin&rsquo;s development of an international literary centre in Newman House on St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green, Dublin, the Dublin discovery trail in Dublin and the Connemara cultural centre in Rosmuc.  It will also fund feasibility studies on the development of facilities at a number of discovery points on the Wild Atlantic Way. </p><p>Some additional funding for the national indoor arena will enable us to accelerate the completion of this project.  Once complete, the arena will comprise a national indoor athletics training centre, a national indoor training centre, and a national gymnastics training centre.  Work on the project commenced in February 2015, with completion scheduled for November 2016. </p><p>The Supplementary Estimate also includes a technical amendment which allows the Department to receive approximately &euro;14 million in development levies from the Rail Procurement Agency and channel it back out through the National Transport Authority for Luas network related costs.  The effect of this is to increase the expenditure under the B8 Public Transport subhead without increasing the Exchequer contribution. </p><p>I recommend this Supplementary Estimate to the committee for its consideration and approval.  I am happy to answer any queries Members may have on the components of the Supplementary Estimate. </p></speech>

It is primarily delivered by the ESB and great progress has been made.  We have just under 1,000 recharging points across the country and approximately 97% of all of our targets for the delivery of recharging points have been met.</p> <p>  The challenge facing us is the number of vehicles using the points.  For a variety of reasons, only half of the number of cars that we estimated would be purchased are using the recharging points.  Often, there is great interest in and demand for transport options but we do not have the infrastructure.  In this case, we have the infrastructure but, partly because of price, but more significantly because of the length of journey that some of these vehicles can make, the uptake has not been as large as we had hoped.  However, the quality of vehicle is already changing.  As it does, we must consider how to drive the use of electric vehicles even further.  Meeting the challenge of fulfilling our stringent climate change commitments will be more difficult unless there is a step change in the use of these vehicles.</p></speech>

I have every reason to believe that can be as successful as other places, primarily because I am aware of the congestion difficulties the city currently faces.</p></speech>

It refers to the national indoor arena and paying a portion of its costs for this year.  It is a project that is already well under way.  We have limited time available to us, and many other competing demands on our time, but the progress the National Sports Campus is making is brilliant and is worth-----</p></speech>

The National Indoor Arena is flying up and those building it have done a brilliant job.  That will be complete by the end of next year.  That can be set that alongside what is already there, like the National Indoor Diving Centre, the National Equestrian Centre and the brilliant playing pitches for football, rugby and GAA teams.  By the end of next year it will be a fantastic area for sporting activity.  I am very pleased it recently won an award from the Irish Sports Federation to recognise that.</p></speech>

I take the Deputy's point.  It highlights the need for us to now drive awareness of everything that is in Abbotstown.  Many people are aware of the National Aquatic Centre, which I visited a couple of weeks ago.  I saw the national diving championships, which were brilliant.  On top of that, there is an incredible array of world-class facilities.  It was called the Bertie bowl for a while, and then became the National Aquatic Centre.  What is now there exceeds any of that.  I recently appointed the new board of Sport Ireland.  I told it one of the jobs I wanted it to do was to determine how it could increase the awareness and profile of everything that is there because it is a fantastic national facility.</p></speech>

Ireland's Ancient East is a concept that has been launched, but we now need to replicate the kind of signage that is in place for the Wild Atlantic Way and develop it for Ireland's Ancient East.  Obviously, that is focused outside of Dublin.</p></speech>

Some scenic routes in isolated coastal areas were omitted from the original map and plan.  They involve coastal routes in isolated areas such as Cloghane in the Dingle peninsula.  It was a major omission to leave it out because it is a naturally scenic area.  It has been bypassed.  There are other areas other such areas around the country, such as Cromane, west of Killorglin.  I do not think we are maximising the benefits such areas can offer.</p><p>Will these will be looked at again in the interim review?</p></speech>

We had a recent discussion on this matter in the tourism leadership group which looks at how we support the development of tourism in Ireland.  One of the things we will consider, and the next Government should do, is to re-engage with the communities located alongside the Wild Atlantic Way as we did when the concept was initially launched to see what further ideas and actions can take the concept onto the next stage.  Part of all of that is the development of loops.  These are routes off the Wild Atlantic Way to take tourists to new parts of the relevant counties or regions.  Perhaps that can be used to address the point Deputy Fleming made.  I must note that these things will always be predicated on the availability of funding because all of these developments cost money.  The Wild Atlantic Way is not static or fixed in terms of how we will execute it.  While the region itself will not change, anything we can do with loops, blue ways and green ways is the way to keep the concept growing in the coming years.</p></speech>
