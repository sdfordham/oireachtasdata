I am accompanied by Mr. Patrick Kenny who is on my right.  As the Chairman said, Mr. Kenny is a member of the authority and also the director of the cartels division, which looks after the criminal enforcement side of our activity.  On my left hand side is Mr. John Evans, who is the manager of the monopolies division, which looks after the civil enforcement side.</p><p>  We are very happy to have the opportunity to explain the mission and role of the Competition Authority and to explain to the committee our activities in the areas of grocery supply and retailing.</p><p>  Our mission is to ensure that markets work well for Irish consumers, for business and for the economy as a whole.  Our focus is on ensuring that the competitive process works to respond to the needs and tastes of Irish consumers.  Increasingly in these tough times, as members have heard repeatedly in the sessions over the past few weeks, consumers are very focused on value for money.</p><p>  Competition plays a key role in improving the competitiveness of the economy and when speaking about competition we are speaking about more than costs.  Some people make their purchases based primarily on costs but competition is partly about that but is also about our ability to foster innovation, to improve quality and to achieve sustainable improvements in living standards and job opportunities for all.  This leads to greater choice, increased innovation and quality, lower prices to both business and consumers and of course to increased employment.</p><p>  Our role is to promote competition in the economy and for enforcing Irish and EU competition law.  We do so by taking action to deter anti-competitive behaviour.  A key role is the investigation of anti-competitive practices such as price fixing or other anti-competitive agreements or abusive conduct by firms that are dominant in the market.  Let me mention, that in one area we are different from competition authorities in other member states.  Our role is to investigate and either to make referrals to the Director of Public Prosecutions or to take a case before the courts.  We do not take decisions ourselves on breaches of the law, which is not our role but the role of the courts.  In some ways that is different from competition authorities in many other member states.  We also have responsibility for merger control in the State and this has been a very active area in the food and grocery sector in the past few years, including Glanbia's acquisition of Dawn Dairies and Golden Vale in 2011 and at the retail level we also reviewed and approved the take over by the Musgrave Group of Superquinn in 2011.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-16a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Karen O'Leary" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013071600004#D00200"><p>My colleague, John Shine, and I would like to thank the committee for the opportunity to contribute to it today and we hope to make a productive and positive contribution to its ongoing deliberations.  I intend to outline the statutory remit and role of the National Consumer Agency and to provide some information on our previous work and activities relevant to the grocery sector.</p><p>  The National Consumer Agency is the independent State body with responsibility for the enforcement of consumer law.  As a statutory body, our remit and functions are established by law, principally the Consumer Protection Act, 2007.  This Act, which transposed the EU unfair commercial practices directive is a maximum harmonisation directive, which means it limits our functions to the relationship between traders and consumers acting outside of their business trade or profession.  We carry out our functions within this context - which is somewhat different to how the Competition Authority carries out its functions.  Our mission is to protect consumers and to help bring about a situation where they are empowered to make well-informed decisions in fair and competitive markets.  We have a clear statutory mandate to serve and represent the interests of consumers. </p><p>  Since our establishment in 2007, the environment for consumers in Ireland has been transformed by the financial crisis and subsequent economic difficulties.  The impact this has had on consumers and their spending patterns has been dramatic, across all sectors, including the grocery sector.  I will expand on this point later.</p><p>  In summary, the work of the National Consumer Agency can be described as promoting consumer welfare by enforcing consumer law and advocating on consumer issues.  We provide a one-stop consumer information and education service via our websites, consumer helpline and public awareness activities.  We also have specific responsibilities in regard to the safety of consumer products and personal finance information and education.  As I mentioned, our statutory remit and focus is exclusively on the experiences of consumers in Ireland.  Therefore, we have no role in the business to business or supply chain relationship. </p><p>  The National Consumer Agency has a broad mandate and remit and an ever-increasing number of consumer issues compete for our resources.  We must, therefore, make choices in regard to what we do and how we do it in order to be effective.  Our decision-making is based on an assessment of consumer detriment and identifying where we can make the greatest impact.  Given the option of two competing issues, we prioritise the issue where we will have the best opportunity to mitigate the most consumer detriment.  We gather information through our direct contact with consumers.  Our consumer helpline received over 58,000 contacts from consumers last year.  We also acquire knowledge through our systematic market monitoring programme, direct market surveillance activity, media reports and information received from other agencies in Ireland and across the EU.</p><p>  The frequency and speed at which new issues arise requires us to be flexible and to react quickly.  Information is then evaluated and processed to identify the source and size of the problem, in particular the scale of consumer detriment, primarily financial, but not exclusively, and whether a potential breach of consumer law has occurred.   Our subsequent interventions are evidence based and are focused on the areas where we can make the greatest impact.  They often involve a number of complementary approaches across three pillars of activity, enforcement, advocacy and information-education for consumers. </p><p>  In cases where there is a potential breach of consumer law, a more formal process is required and we take into account the likely detriment experienced by consumers, the nature of the evidence that is available, whether additional evidence needs to be gathered, previous trader behaviour and any past actions, possible motives and the level of knowledge of the trader.  We may look for voluntary compliance where that is the most effective and efficient approach or use disruption to interrupt a practice where formal enforcement may take too long or cost too much.  However, in situations where formal enforcement action is appropriate, we will not hesitate to act and we have a number of options available.</p><p>  Our mandate is broad in that it crosses various sectors in which consumers operate, including the grocery sector.  As with all sectors, one of our main objectives is to ensure price transparency.  Consumers should know the price of a product or service before they buy it.  This is important so that consumers can make informed decisions.  It also helps to foster competition as consumers can use this information to choose where they take their business, which encourages businesses to compete with each other.  We carry out compliance blitzes to ensure that traders are complying with pricing legislation.  In 2012, we carried out visits to 349 traders nationwide, including a significant number in the grocery sector.  We also investigate complaints from consumers to establish if there are breaches of the Consumer Protection Act and if enforcement action should be taken.</p><p>  We carried out eight surveys on grocery prices between 2007 and 2011.  In our last survey, we found high levels of price matching among the four major grocery retailers.  In other words, the difference between the prices charged for branded products across the board was very low.</p></speech>

Before I invite committee members to speak, I would like to inform the committee that I have an apology from Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  Today's meeting is clashing with a previous commitment.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill is also in the Seanad at the moment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-16a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1001" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013071600005#E00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations today.  In her submission, Ms Goggins stated that there were two elements of the 2006 Act that deal with the retail sector.  She stated that it only applied if there was an anti-competitive object as part of those.  My view is that it would be quite limited in terms of the questions being asked of the retail multiples by committee members over the last few months.  I presume somebody can ask for a supplier to contribute to the cost of a promotion that would not necessarily be anti-competitive.  The supplier is supplying that person and is not excluding anybody else.  While it may be illegal, it may not be illegal under the 2006 Act.  I would like Ms Goggins to expand on that.  When they were here, the representatives of the multiples were very strong in stating that the 2006 Act provides a mechanism for anybody who wants to make a complaint or raise an issue about any illegal practices that may be going on within their businesses.  Lo and behold, nobody has made a complaint so everybody is very happy with what is happening.  From looking at the presentation, it seems quite limited in what could be examined by the Competition Authority.  Perhaps Ms Goggins could expand on that.</p><p>  Ms Goggins also states that codes of practice are not always fit for purpose and do not solve the problems they were intended to solve.  Are there examples of codes of practice that are fit for purpose and codes that have failed as well?  That would be interesting for the committee's work.  Ms Goggins also states that the code of practice would impose significant compliance costs.  The representatives of the retail multiples in here over the last few months spoke very eloquently about how compliant they are and how much they spend on being compliant as things stand.  It was very difficult to get an idea from them as to where this extra cost would come from.  If they are already so compliant, it seems that there would not be significant extra costs in complying with a code of practice if it was brought in.  They failed to my satisfaction to give concrete details of what these compliance costs would be and how they would impact on their business.  Perhaps the Competition Authority might have some knowledge on that.</p><p>  My next question is for the Competition Authority again.  One of the issues that has come up in this committee is the price that primary suppliers are paid by creameries and the price paid in the supermarket for liquid milk.  Would it be anti-competitive to set a minimum price for the primary producer of a commodity or a product?  Would there be competition law problems with that if it was decided it was in the common good to have a level price for a product made by a producer?</p><p>  My final question is for the National Consumer Agency.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-16a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/968" speakername="Pat Deering" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013071600006#F00200"><p>I welcome our guests here today.  Over the past few months we have had detailed discussion with many large multiples and all the shareholders involved in this issue.  Like Deputy Pringle, I am not convinced by the arguments some of the multiples have made regarding the issues that seem to come up regularly.  Three players in the grocery sector dominate 70% of the market, Tesco, Dunne&rsquo;s and Super Valu.  That seems very uncompetitive to me.  Do the witnesses have a view on that or do they think it is healthy?  If not, where do they think we should be going?</p><p>  Groceries in Ireland seem to cost 17% or 18% more than the average price in 27 other countries.  That is a substantial percentage above the average in other EU countries.  If the Irish market is very competitive how come the prices are 17% higher than everywhere else?</p><p>  The National Consumer Agency said it received very few complaints in 2006.  Is there a reason for the absence of complaints?  Suppliers in particular are very much afraid to complain.  Last week I told the Northern Ireland Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development about a particular supplier which I had visited in my constituency in the past couple of weeks.  It supplies 55% of a certain product in the country to a certain supermarket, a substantial amount of product to supply, and it would be afraid to make a complaint.  It told me that it has to pay money up-front in order to get onto the shelves of that particular supermarket.  It specified that there was one particular supermarket above the rest that would look for extra money.  I understand that is a very delicate matter.  Do we need to get to the bottom of some issues?  Why should a supplier have to pay extra money?  At the end of the day the consumer pays.  That ties into my point about our grocery costs being 17% higher than those anywhere else in the EU.  This is an issue that needs to be addressed.  We have had a very worthwhile discussion over the past couple of months with almost all the people involved, with one exception, who did not grace us with her presence.  We have to deal with what we did get.</p><p>  Codes of practice are the kernel of the matter.  There has been an independent adjudicator in place in England for a very short time.  Does the National Consumer Agency have any indication how that is working out and would it be in regular contact with its counterparts on the other side of the pond about that system?  There has been a great deal of talk about whether it should be a voluntary or a statutory code.  Does the National Consumer Agency think we should go down the voluntary road?  I think anything that is voluntary will not happen.  It needs to be mandatory.  What is the agency&rsquo;s view on that matter?</p><p>  Deputy Pringle mentioned the compliance cost and some of the multiples reminded us several times that they have a very good structure in place whereby they are able to assess everything.  In view of the fact that it is in place there should not be an extra large cost involved.  Where does the National Consumer Agency see the compliance costs?</p><p>  The horsemeat issue earlier in the year could have been a disaster for the country.  We discussed that at length at the time.  There is a view that one reason for this problem is that it is a cheaper product that is similar to the main product which companies thought they were buying.  Is that also a result of competition forcing down the price?  Perhaps because of the times we are in when money is scarce the general consumer looks for value for money at the expense of quality.  We did not know what we were getting in the horsemeat and we still do not know in some cases.  Does the Competition Authority have a view on that issue?  Are we losing out because times are difficult and costs are being forced down at the expense of quality?  Likewise liquid milk, an area in which I have a personal interest: the price to the producer in recent years has been similar while the price to the consumer has risen gradually.  There may have been a small rise in recent times but it would appear that milk is being used as a loss leader in most outlets.  Does the Competition Authority agree or am I talking rubbish?  To Joe Public who produces the milk that appears to be the case.  It is left to one side and used as a special offer to draw the customer in to buy something else.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-16a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/977" speakername="Michael McNamara" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013071600006#F00300"><p>How many prosecutions were taken in 2010, 2011, and 2012 and of those prosecutions how many were successful?  How many raids were carried out with regard to investigations of possible irregularities in the food and grocery sectors and who was raided in those years?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-16a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/980" speakername="Tom Barry" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013071600006#F00400"><p>I welcome the witnesses here today.  This is an issue close to my heart.  The multiples have the financial strength which protects them against the primary producer.  I believe they need to display their profits here because when they deal with their suppliers in many cases they ask them to open up their books.  There is a double standard.  They dissect the books of their suppliers and decide if the supplier is entitled to any profit and if so how much.  The State, however, does not know what is going on.  This is double dealing and I do not like it.  These are realities.</p><p>  I hope everybody goes home today and remembers the word "potholing".  I am not talking about Cork County Council sorting out a few holes in the road.  This refers to a supplier selling a particular product and getting maybe &euro;100,000 a month.  Then its accounts show a dip for a particular month when it gets paid &euro;50,000 and the buyer says it is filling a financial pothole and will get back to the supplier.  The margins are tight enough in these contracts that this type of practice should not go on but it is going on.  Market support is a kind phrase for hello money.  There are many others.  This is the elephant in the room.  We are discussing these very serious issues which are crippling the primary producers in a country where agriculture is one of the main income streams.  We have to deal with this.  Obviously the multiples do not have the moral backbone to deal with it.  Some are better than others and it is wrong to castigate everybody.</p><p>  I do the shopping quite regularly and I agree with the witnesses that there are little or no price differences in branded products.  I am one of those who go to several multiples for items which are better quality in some than in others.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-16a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1169" speakername="Mary Ann O'Brien" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013071600007#G00200"><p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their contributions.  Deputy Deering and Deputy Barry have raised most of my points so I will be brief.  I have spoken confidentially to a few small suppliers.  I am a supplier and I employ 110 people.  I know how difficult it is for suppliers.  I have a lot of friends in the food industry because I have been in business for 21 years.  Some of the people I spoke to confidentially said that listing fees are still in operation but the language has changed.  Humans are very creative and it is no longer called "hello money" or a listing fee.  Deputy Barry referred to pot-holing but I have not come across that myself although I have been asked for it by English multiples as recently as last year.  When their accounts do not meet their shareholders' requirements at the end of the year they ask their suppliers for contributions.  However, I have never been asked for that by an Irish company.  Who has the money to take a full page advertisement in the Sunday newspapers?  I wonder who pays for those adverts.  One of the suppliers to whom I spoke had been told that if their product was to be promoted it would be put on a lovely coloured page in the Sunday Independent and there would be a cost.  This is the practice.</p><p>  Has the Competition Authority considered having a focus group, an internal bunker focus group of 20 to 40 small suppliers?  They could feed information to the authority in greater detail than the committee can provide.  The issue of horsemeat has been well covered.  No supplier wants to be driven down to that level.  Another issue which must be faced is the advertisement of low-cost alcohol.  I have a 19 year old son so I know all about it.  I do not drink beer or cider as I prefer wine but I am surprised at the cheap prices of those drinks.  The word, "footfall" is a favourite of the multiples.  Cheap beer or a tin of sweets - Roses, I think - at Christmas are regarded as footfallers; they are designed to get the consumers to walk in the door of the supermarket and they are then captive.  I had an audit last week which was carried out by an Australian retailer.  It is easy for me because my business is 80% export.  The practices are the same all over the world.  They looked at my books and studied the percentage taken by each customer.  I have an open book costing system so they can see my suppliers.  As a Deputy said, the one-way street is unfair. I am a very small player with just a few random comments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-16a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Isolde Goggin" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013071600007#G00300"><p>Quite a few topics for discussion and some very interesting points were raised.  I will begin with the points raised by Deputy Pringle.  The 2006 Act amended the 2002 Competition Act.  He is correct that it has a limiting clause.  That is a difference between competition law and unfair trading practices law.  We will always start with the consumer and that is where the object or effect clause comes in.  When examining practices that are forbidden by our legislation we always start with the question of what will be the effect on the consumer.  Practices with the object or effect of preventing, restricting or distorting competition are those that harm consumers.  Practices that affect relationships within the supply chain above that are not really the target of competition law.  In a sense that is why the issue about codes of practice and other ways of treating it has arisen so widely in Europe.  Competition authorities in general believe that their aim is to see what happens in markets and that markets operate to allow consumers to exercise choice but within the limits of regulation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-16a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/980" speakername="Tom Barry" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013071600008#H00200"><p>I apologise, I was not very clear.  My point was that when farmers were getting 26 cent per litre the branded product was selling for &euro;1.49 for 2 litres.  However, when the price to farmers collapsed to 19 cent per litre, at a time when they were losing their shirts, the price to the consumer did not, as it should have, drop to approximately &euro;1 per 2 litres.  The multiples did not pass on that saving to consumers.  They certainly did not pay it back to distressed suppliers in a spirit of sharing the burden.  They were happy to pocket the difference, to the satisfaction of their shareholders.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-16a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Isolde Goggin" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013071600008#H00300"><p>Apologies, I misunderstood the issue the Deputy was raising.  I take his point.  We would always come back with the answer that there should be greater competition at the retail level.  I noted a claim by a witness who appeared before a previous meeting of the committee that the Competition Authority had said that everything is hunky dory in the retail sector.  That is not what we said.  We observed that greater competition had caused prices to fall - this was in 2009 when there was a great deal of concern about people crossing the Border to shop and the price disparity between North and South - but we also identified many areas within the sector where there was scope for much stronger competition.</p><p>  Deputy Deering asked whether we would describe the grocery sector as competitive.</p></speech>

I suggest that the position is probably even worse than that as a result of the geographic profile of the different retailers.  SuperValu is predominantly based in rural areas, although it does have stores in urban areas.  As a result, there are between two and two and a half big players in the most urbanised areas and really only one big player covering the rural areas.  The figure of 70% probably overstates the degree of competition.</p></speech>

Ireland is 18% above the food average for the EU 27, 12% above the average for the EU 15 and 4% above the average for the UK.  That is not good.  The price differential has decreased considerably and this is partly due to people becoming more price sensitive and shopping around.  In 2008 we were 34% above the average for the EU 27 and 62% above that for the UK.  We identified a number of reasons for the disparity and these included the cost of doing business - including energy prices, rates, etc. - and consumer incomes and tastes.  At that time there was major resistance to own-brand products and a huge adherence to established brands.  People perceived the former as somewhat inferior.  Two other reasons for the disparity were the level of competition - there certainly could be greater competition in the sector - and regulation.</p><p>  One of the most astonishing aspects of the issue relating to horsemeat was how many people were obtaining a cut despite the low prices being paid.  When the matter was investigated and efforts were made to trace those who had been involved in trading this product at some point, what emerged was extraordinary.  This is the reason why the NCA and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland must be involved and why strict regulation is required.  There can be no rowing back in that regard.</p><p>  Senator Mary Ann O'Brien inquired about confidentiality.  In the context of the latter, there is a tension between people who want to address the committee and what can actually be done.  If we want to introduce penalties as well as a process of naming and shaming, then matters will end up in court.  This is the difficulty.  People have spoken to us in private and have been prepared to go as far as to say that certain practices have occurred.  However, when it comes to moving matters along, we need to be able to confront people with the evidence.  This has been the difficulty for us.  I will now ask Mr. Patrick Kenny to comment.</p></speech>

The level of enforcement activity has been ramped up in recent years.  I understand ten searches were conducted last year.  Most of these related to cartels.  In the context of this sector, we normally do not announce what we are doing unless the people involved confirm that something is happening.

That is not just confined to this sector.  People will complain but then they will not put pen to paper in order to provide us with the basis to pursue matters.  People are often very reluctant - in the context of both the criminal and civil cases - to come forward.  There are other areas of law in respect of which the National Consumer Agency can compel people to come forward.  However, the Competition Authority currently does not have that power.</p></speech>

That is one of the limitations in the Act.  As already stated, the other limitation is evidential.  Actually it is not so much a limitation of the Act, rather it is the way in which we do business here which leads to cases ending up before the courts.  If one does not have the evidence to go to court, one is limited in terms of other possible options.  The National Consumer Agency has a broader range of sanctions at its disposal than is available under competition law.  When it comes to competition law, it is court or nothing.  There are other naming-and-shaming sanctions which can be imposed elsewhere.</p></speech>

It has been well flagged that this is an issue about which people are becoming exercised.  Ms Goggin outlined more recent statistics which show that the differential is narrowing.  Forf&aacute;s produced a report on this matter.  The Deputy asked whether it is justified, which is a very fair question.  There are two issues which arise.  First, it has narrowed - which is good - and, second, the justification for it outlined by the industry relates to a higher cost of doing business here.  The latter has been substantiated but not to the extent of the differential.  It is narrowing and what we feel happens in markets of this nature is that there is supplier and retailer behaviour and then there is consumer behaviour.  Where the two actually interact is where one gets the end price.  Ms Goggin also referred to other matters such as resistance to the discount multiples - such as Lidl and Aldi - when they first entered the market.  Something of a stigma attached to these retailers but that has now gone away completely and most of us understand that.  Our research has shown a very big shift in consumer shopping behaviour.</p></speech>

The Consumer Protection Act provides for protection again misleading activity in a range of contexts, including regarding the origin of the product.  That Act is horizontal in its scope in that it is intended to cover all sorts of issues, products and services.  Our agency is not active in the food labelling area as there is a plethora of specific legislation covering this area  already in place, which is being enforced by the Depart of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, HSE inspectors and so on.  I understand, further legislation will be introduced in this area as the European Commission is working on a regulatory impact assessment with a view to bringing forward further specific requirements before the end of this year.</p><p>  In the context of food labelling, the agency's focus is on the business or consumer relationship.  The problems in the horsemeat scandal existed further back in the supply chain.  If the agency was to examine that issue, we would focus on the relationship between the retailer and the consumer rather than anywhere else in the supply chain.  In the horsemeat scandal, it is clear that the problems existed significantly further back in the supply change rather than at the point of the consumer interaction.</p></speech>

I thank the delegates from both organisations for coming in.</p><p>  On the issue of "hello money" and all the various descriptions of that, the irony is that the large companies know they can get away with it.  They realise the shortcomings and they know that it will take somebody to stand up to this.  The knowledge of the situation is making this issue much worse in reality despite however much legislation we have on this area.  As one of the witnesses said, unless somebody stands up in court, nothing will change.  It seems that particularly affects many Irish food producers who would be small operators.  Many large retailers would say that they are very pro-Irish and that they want lots of Irish products on their shelves but is that really the case?  While we seek to support and encourage customers to buy Irish and encourage indigenous food production, the moment the producers' products arrive at the retailers, those producers are hugely disadvantaged because they will not be able to compete at a level because they are not operating on an equal footing, as the witness said, with the larger food producers and will not be able to get a fair whack, so to speak.  While I appreciate the authority's dilemma regarding the legislation and the fact that people will not go to court, do the witnesses have any other offering of a solution given that this must frustrate them also?  Clearly, it  frustrates them all day, every day.  Do they have a suggestion of their own or from another country that would help us to deal with what is a very clear issue?</p><p>  On Ms Goggin's statement on the statutory code, I carefully read the language she used and it seems that while it is written in a fairly neutral fashion, namely, that such codes are not always fit for purpose and do not solve the problems they were intended to solve, it is quite a weighted comment, and from what I have read, I believe she is unhappy with the prospect of such a code.  Perhaps I am wrong in reading that into the statement.  She said the authority made a submission to the Department but she did not say what response it got from the Department in 2011.  While clearly she is saying that the authority will be diligent in putting this into place if it is asked to do so, I feel her heart is not in it because she does not believe in it, which is fine.  If that is the case, what would she say the authority ought to do?  She said in one of the responses that the authority will wait and see what works and what does not work from what will emerge from the Commission's work.  If she does not believe it will work, what does the authority believe will work?  That is her area of expertise, it is not mine and I do not claim to be an expert on it.</p><p>  I wish to ask about a consumer-related matter.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-16a.71" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Isolde Goggin" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013071600011#L00900"><p>My understanding is that the grocery code of practice is now Government policy.  It was in the programme for Government.  That decision is done and dusted and it is being provided for in legislation.  If we are collectively given the job we will go for it.  It is not practicable to delay until the European Commission has necessarily done and dusted everything.  I say that because there will be more evidence at that stage about what does and does not work.  That is why we suggested the possibility of building a review period into the legislation because a year or two down the road one might have more solid evidence as to how one would get over these kinds of problems.</p><p>  At the time we made the submissions there was no response except that the policy subsequently comes out and is developed.  There are no individual responses to submissions because it is a public consultation to which we were submitting.  We were trying to look at ways of making it more effective and giving it teeth.  Among the suggestions we had was that if we carry out an enforcement under the 2006 Act one could apply for a declaration that a certain practice is illegal and get an injunction to stop people doing it again.  If a private company that is affected by an unfair trading practice takes a court action it can get damages.  We suggested that it be considered that double damages would be given because it would give more of an incentive for people to get over their reluctance.  No retaliatory delisting is likely to be an element of a code of practice.  As Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe said, people use language in different ways and people can describe things in different ways, so there is always a possibility that something might happen and not be identified.</p><p>  We looked at the possibility of limiting exposure to costs for plaintiffs in private actions.  One could imagine that for a smaller supplier going up against a much larger retailer or a small retailer taking on a large supplier the cost of a private court action could be substantial.  Another issue that has since been solved under the Competition (Amendment) Act 2011 related to the notion that if the Competition Authority took a case then someone could go straight in to seek follow-on damages without having to prove the entire case all over again.  As the lawyers say, it would be a <i>res judicata</i>.  At that stage the suggestions we were making were aimed at strengthening the existing legislation rather than the code of practice.  I am sorry to say I do not have a good solution to the question of confidentiality versus having teeth.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-16a.72" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Karen O'Leary" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013071600011#L01000"><p>On Senator O'Keeffe&rsquo;s comment about suggestions, in 2009 when there was a consultation on the code, the National Consumer Agency made a suggestion to use similar provisions to those in the current unfair commercial practices directive, which is only consumer to business or business to consumer.  The suggestion we made was that it would be reformed in a business to business context because it gives a range of enforcement tools which are proportionate to the breaches.  That depends very much on how it works in the supply chain because when we take enforcement action, as Ms Goggin mentioned, we have a range of tools that we can use which are very powerful.  Going to court is costly and it takes time.  Where it should be done, we do it, but we must be careful about how we assign resources.  We do have some powers to enforce fines and also compliance notices.  Such instruments lead to enforcement and are not costly.  Again, we can do that on foot of complaints.  Once the two organisations are merged and assuming the combined organisation gets a role in a grocery code it is about how to enforce what we need to enforce.  I echo what Ms Goggin said, once we are merged and we have the job, it will be done to the best of our ability.  Our only concern is that it can be done well and that the intention of it can lead to the right impact.  That is what we want to see.  We did suggest that at the time because we felt that it could provide a solution.</p><p>  The other point that is interesting is that there is a statutory instrument relating to unfair terms in consumer contracts.  It does what it says on the tin.  It sets out that in <i>pro forma</i> contracts where a business gives a contract to a consumer on a take it or leave it basis there is a power imbalance.  Increasingly, consumers are assigning contracts for stuff they did not have to provide contracts for previously, for energy, financial services and telecoms.  We have the power to seek to have some of those terms overturned if, on balance, they are unfair to the consumer.  Using that in a business to business context might also require legislative change.  It would require the introduction of a new statutory instrument.  I was reminded of that when Ms Goggin referred to slapping a 300 page contract in front of someone.  I agree with her that if the code says everything must be in writing, that is fine but it does not address a big player and a small player and in fact it could make it worse for some.  The instrument that is used in order to protect consumers in that context is unfair terms in consumer contracts regulations, which do not mean that every term must be pro-consumer but it means that the totality of the contract must be fair.  It also makes provision for excessive transfer of risk or limitation of liability where the trader accepts no liability even when it should.  Those are two things that might help when we are talking about application.</p><p>  In response to the question on horsemeat, two things are important to understand.  The legislation we apply is horizontal as Mr. Shine said.  What that means is it applies to every sector and every practice where it is a business to consumer.  It is quite broad and it is an instrument that can be very powerful in certain situations and in other situations it is not as suitable.  In a lot of sectors there is sector-specific legislation.  Financial services is a big one where the Central Bank has a sectoral role in consumer protection.  Another area is telecoms where ComReg has a certain element of consumer protection within its overall mandate and also as an energy regulator.  The consumer is at the top and one has sectoral regulators.  There are some rules that are specific to food and they are better dealt with under the sectoral regulator.</p></speech>

There is a difference between an Irish product and an Irish brand.  For instance, we have several brands of Irish tea but we do not grow tea in this country.  It is a question of what is Irish, and it very much depends on the claim being made about the product.  Potentially that is something that would be covered by the Consumer Protection Act but we will be examining the extent to which consumers are being misled regarding the claims being made about the product as distinct from the brand ownership.  In theory it is an issue the Consumer Protection Act could examine.  It is not an area about which we get many complaints.  Off the top of my head, the complaints we had in recent years related to other products.  For instance, we had an issue in the past regarding hand-knitted Aran jumpers that apparently were being hand-knitted in China.  We would examine issues like that but it very much depends on the circumstances.  In the grocery area in particular, moving away from the meat side, on ambient products the distinction would be between the Irish brand and the actual product itself.</p></speech>

One would want a magnifying glass with one, never mind a calculator.  I smiled when she mentioned nappies because I would be something of an expert in that area.  One can buy the large box that hardly fits into the back of the car.  They are dearer than buying the small boxes but the manufacturers know one cannot carry all the little boxes out to the car because they fall, whereas they should be cheaper when they are not even taken out of the box.</p><p>  I am glad to hear the consumers are not driving this agenda because that is not the case.  What irritates me are the "Product of Ireland" and "Produced in Ireland" labels.  Both are in green packaging but one stating it is produced here.  It appears both of them have been made in Ireland.  I had the pleasure of buying a bag of sugar labelled "Product of Ireland", which are still being sold in the multiples.  That is a subject close to my heart.  Neither the bag nor the sugar is produced in Ireland but apparently it is poured into the bag here.  That is nonsense of the highest degree.  When we have a sugar industry here again we will have to compete against that.  That is one issue.</p><p>  Regarding our lines on imports, there was a feeling in the tillage industry, which is minor but important and in which I am involved, that if there was enough water in Cork Port, Foynes or any other port we did not need a tillage industry because all the product could come from overseas.  That was the view until last year when we found ourselves in the midst of a fodder crisis.  For many people in the centre of Dublin a fodder crisis would have only hit home when the dog nuts were not available in the multiples.  However, for those of us living in the rural areas it was incredibly important.  We need to protect our native industries, which is not being done.  </p><p>  A tipping point will be reached here because food prices may get very high if we do not protect our fragile food industry.  It is fragile because in a sense our agriculture industry has held back a rise in inflation for almost 20 years.  When I got out of milk production almost 20 years ago the price of a litre of milk was 26 or 27 pence a litre or &pound;1 a gallon.  It was still close to that price a while ago.  We cannot continue to absorb those costs.  When this correction is made it will be sudden and painful, and the consumer will pay for it.  Unfortunately, they will not thank us for our inaction at this time.</p><p>  Does Mr. Kenny believe there is a place for a legal support agency for small and medium enterprises that do not have the resources for these huge contract documents about which he spoke?  I have come across that in my business.  It is frightening when one has to sit across a team of perhaps six or seven people all of whom are experts in their own areas, they hand one a document and one is wondering what to do with it.  It is another area we need to examine.  I ask Mr. Kenny for his opinions on that.</p></speech>

It has not been reported, and it would be in their interests not to report or confirm it, that one of the multiples to which Deputy McNamara referred either has not been proceeded against with the same gusto or is immune from the Competition Act, and they are the people who perhaps could organise a cartel.

Going back to what was said here earlier, it does indicate that the Competition Authority itself is aware of people coming to it confidentially who are concerned about dominance.

Ms Goggin said that in 2012 the Competition Authority carried out visits to 349 traders.  I wanted to clarify if this was done on the authority's own activation.  Was the Competition Authority concentrating on one sort of trader as against another?  Why were 349 traders visited?  Is the authority being pushed to the pin of its collar with 349 such cases or would it like to do more?</p><p>  Ms Goggin also talked about the grocery price surveys between 2007 and 2011 and the high level of price matching.  I wonder what the situation is now.  Is the Competition Authority not in a position to carry out that work and, if so, is it an issue of resources?  Some of what we are hearing does not concern resources but, as Ms Goggin said, it rather concerns the legislation's limitations.  Some of this might be to do with resources, although I am not sure.  This is her chance to say if that is so.</p></speech>

That was in the context of price differentials with the North.  I note Ms Goggin said the retailers have stated that everything in the garden is rosy.  She pointed out that there were problems nonetheless.  Does the Competition Authority monitor the retail sector on an ongoing basis, looking at developments and trends?  Or does the authority operate on the basis of a major investigative report, as happened in 2009?  If so, when can we expect the next report on the retail sector?</p></speech>

Do the authority's officials meet with them monthly or annually?  Does the authority ever discuss this big issue that everybody talks about?  Is it ever discussed?</p></speech>

To an extent, what I am going to say is related to the fact that some of these issues are being examined on a Europe-wide industry level.  I appreciate what has been said but it is important to remember that the Germans, French, Danish and everybody else have the same instinct to protect their native industries.  Given the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, competition law has an important role to play in keeping markets open for our exports.  At the end of the day, we are a small exporting nation and we need access to markets.</p><p>    Some things could be of concern regarding one of our large export markets.  If one has a capacity for a lot of co-ordination at producer level, which is provided for in the milk package, one can get a small number of very big groups of producers at that level.  There are fairly rigid codes of practice tying those producers to retailers and one has a very concentrated retail sector.  It is concentrated here but it tends to be concentrated elsewhere as well.  In Germany, four retailers have 85% of the market.  In Sweden, three retailers have 80% while in Denmark there are three retailers with 90%.</p><p>  If there is a common European-wide system of regulation, it is important that we should be able to get in there as well.  I am not saying that we should throw the Irish consumer off the sledge, but it is important that our producers can also get access to retailers in other countries.  The system should not be tied up unnecessarily by long-term contracts.</p><p>  A legal support agency for SMEs was mentioned, but I have never thought about it.  It is an interesting idea and we would like to go away and think about it.  </p><p>  As regards monitoring sectors, we have interaction with sectors on an ongoing basis but we do not have a systematic way of sitting down and talking to people.  I think the Deputy was talking about putting moral pressure on them, but it is difficult to do that when one has an enforcement side going on.  We tend to do one big study every so often.  In 2009, it was groceries, while at the moment we are looking at ports which is obviously an important input cost both for imports and exports.  We are hoping to report on that by the end of the year.  </p><p>  We are happy about our resource situation at the moment.  Between 2007 and 2011 we lost a lot of people when our staff numbers went down.  Thankfully, however, we were given sanction to recruit ten extra people, which was great.  They are all on board now.</p><p>  We tend to examine one sector at a time.  We can of course consider re-examining the grocery sector but at the moment our interaction with it would be in terms of advocacy.  The kinds of things we are doing now include the code of practice and ongoing enforcement issues which we cannot discuss.  Mergers also arise all the time and there has been quite a bit of activity on that over the last while.</p></speech>

The National Consumer Agency was established in 2007 and took over functions from the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, plus a host of other new functions given to it by the Consumer Protection Act.  At the time, there was a constant on-the-road inspectorate, which was thought to be inefficient and had less managerial oversight than it could have had.  I cannot take any credit for this because I was not there.  It was pulled back and we thought we needed to ensure two main objectives.  First, it is important for traders to know that we are out there so they are aware that they will get a visit at some stage.  Second, consumers must have confidence in their spending.  Obviously, consumer confidence in spending matters for recovery.</p></speech>

It is appropriate the two agencies were the ones that concluded our hearings on the code of conduct for the grocery sector.  They are both involved in protecting the public interest.  This has got a European dimension to it now as there has been a response by retailers for a voluntary code at European level.</p><p>  There are still concerns that voluntary will not work.  It seems odd that we accept Fair Trade products benefit the supplier from a less developed country, as well as the consumer.  Why can we not adopt the same approach of fair trade for the domestic producer?  Waters have been muddied by claims that a code will be expensive.  Arrangements, however, can be put in place for dominant players and smaller suppliers.  Retail Excellence Ireland stated smaller retailers are at the behest of the dominant large suppliers.</p><p>  While the principle is simple, greed is getting in the way.  Margins are being taken by some involved who pretend they have the best interests of the consumer at heart when it is at someone else&rsquo;s expense.  I know of cases of retailers telling processors what their product will cost.  At all times the margin is kept by the retailer.  This is not addressed by the legislation in place.  It is not in the best interest of the consumer.  Deputy Tom Barry highlighted the case that when milk prices for farmers fell through the floor, the same high prices were maintained in the shops.  There is a milk price war going on.  Another dimension to it is that much of the product is being sourced north of the Border.  The concern is that Ireland may be left without a secure supply of fresh milk.  Considering we export it, there is a certain irony in that.</p><p>  On foot of these meetings, we will establish a small working group of committee members to prepare a report and, hopefully, publish it by the end of September.  That is a tight deadline given the August break here.  We hope the consumer and competition Bill, when it is published, will have the benefit of our findings and recommendations.</p><p>  We cannot fight major multiple retailers in a publicity battle.  However, we can lay bare the facts of pricing despite the gloss that is put on the issue at times.  We are not trying to score points with these hearings, just to expose the facts.  We are trying to protect the consumer, the processor and the primary producer at all stages.  It is called fair trade and fair play.</p></speech>

The report covers the period from July to December last year.  We will also review the progress made during Ireland's Presidency of the EU, with emphasis on Single Market measures, product safety and market surveillance, and SME competitiveness and financing.</p><p>  The Minister was here last week and we congratulated him and the team for the great work done during the six-month Presidency.  We are very conscious of the workload the officials of the Department had on their desks in the last six months and probably before that as well.  It is recognised that a great job was done and that the Department's area was very significant during the Presidency.  On behalf of the committee, I want to thank the officials of the Department for that extra work and congratulate them on the job done for Ireland, which we appreciate.</p><p>  I welcome the Secretary General, Mr. John Murphy, who will make the presentation.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I ask the Secretary General to make his presentation, which will be followed by a question and answer session.</p></speech>

I am joined here today by my colleagues, Mr. Philip Kelly, assistant secretary, corporate services, EU affairs and trade policy; Mr. Tommy Murray, principal officer, EU affairs and internal market; Mr. Gerry Monks, principal officer, trade policy unit; Mr. Pat Kelly, assistant principal officer, Office of Science and Technology; and Mr. Paul Cullen, principal officer, labour affairs unit.</p><p>  I want to acknowledge and comment on the Department's significant contribution to the recent successful EU Presidency.  I thank the Chairman for his remarks on behalf of the committee and I would be happy to convey those back to the staff.  There were a number of notable achievements under the remit of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in the jobs, enterprise, trade, competitiveness and innovation area.  Chief among these, for example, was the consensus by EU Trade Ministers on the mandate to enable the Commission to begin talks on an EU-US transatlantic trade and investment partnership, the agreement on the new &euro;70 billion research and development programme, known as Horizon 2020, the agreement on the accounting directive, the signing of the agreement on a Unified Patent Court by 25 participating member states, as well as the agreement on the Commission's new state aid modernisation proposals.</p></speech>

I also compliment the Secretary General on his report.</p><p>  I wish to raise specific issues.  The youth guarantee may be the most important legacy of our Presidency.  Mr. Murphy mentioned that most of the resources would need to come from national budgets.  What is the EU bringing to the equation?  What will his Department's role be?  He stated that rolling out the guarantee is for the Department of Social Protection, but what responsibility will his Department have in that roll-out?</p><p>  Will Mr. Murphy confirm that we will need a referendum in respect of the unitary patent system?  Has there been any discussion of when that referendum will be held?  My understanding is that the referendum is ready, but I have heard no word of it being included among the forthcoming referendums in the autumn.  If so many benefits are to arise from the system, one would assume that the Department would be anxious to move to a referendum as quickly as possible.</p><p>  Mr. Murphy's comments on public procurement were made in the context of removing blockages in the Single Market.  From this committee, Deputy Lawlor and others, Mr. Murphy will know that our concern about public procurement relates to the manner in which it is being rolled out in Ireland, particularly by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, as an anti-Irish SME programme.  Tenders are rolled out in large blocks and Irish SMEs are not given the chance to get involved, losing them job creation opportunities.  Will the developments make it easier for Irish companies to access public procurement, thereby maintaining or creating jobs in Ireland?</p><p>  Horizon 2020 and the Programme for the Competitiveness of enterprises and SMEs, COSME, are welcome.  We have one year of influence left in terms of Horizon 2020, given Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn's presence.  What plans does the Department have in place to tie down some specifics?  A great deal of work is under way in Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, and the Department's science wing.  Some good announcements have been made.</p><p>  We raised the issue of state aid modernisation with the Minister via parliamentary questions last week.  The activity in what are called "C" regions will have a particular impact on Ireland.  Will Mr. Murphy confirm for the record what this will mean?  A great deal of work was done by the Department and the Minister to bring Commissioner Almunia down from the cliff again, given his initial proposals.  Will the modernisation have implications for the way in which the IDA engages in its operations?  It will not kick in until this time next year, but one assumes that the IDA is in preparation mode.</p><p>  The Minister has set up a group of what he called seven dynamic people in the sector to advise on the Entrepreneurship 2020 Action Plan.  Will their work feed into our contribution to the 2020 action plan?  In light of the work done by the Cypriot Presidency on the proposal for quotas for women on boards, I wish to point out that only one woman was appointed to the group of seven.  Will Mr. Murphy outline the quota proposals agreed under the Cypriot Presidency and highlighted by him?</p></speech>

If we are transferring sovereignty from the Irish courts to an international court then it is not an EU institution and, therefore, is not covered by Article 29 of the Constitution that provides for certain things to be done under the EU rubric.  Work needs to be done on the specification for the court and so on and it would be necessary to have that done before a referendum is held.</p><p>  As the committee will know, there are a number of possible referendums, including one that we are certain of this September.  The unified patent court referendum is likely to take place in the latter half of 2014.  Such timing would allow for the degree of certainty that one needs to operate the court.  It would also enable the Government to take a number of decisions that are relevant to the court before the overall matter of the jurisdiction is put to a referendum.  </p><p>  We have discussed public procurement issues before.  Deputy Calleary mentioned that the public procurement policy is a matter for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Recently it appointed a new chief procurement officer.  As I have mentioned here before, there are conflicting policy objectives.  There is definitely a need to ensure we have efficiency in public procurement which often means a focus on saving money, economies of scale, etc.</p><p>  The other policy objective that we particularly focus on is ensuring there is as much openness to SMEs and Irish firms as possible in the public procurement market.  We are often quoted statistics to the effect that a very high percentage of public procurement contracts go to Irish firms, most of which are SMEs, certainly if one uses the European definition.  On the other hand, there is a fair bit of anecdotal evidence on particular types of tenders and people feel that the conditions of the tender exclude them.</p><p>  The focus of our interaction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has been on ways to get better SME involvement.  Let me give an example.  We examine restrictive clauses in public procurement tenders to do with insurance bonds, for example, and things like that.  If the clauses are set at too high a level firms can be excluded.  We also focus on facilitating SMEs in order for them to come forward with innovative solutions rather than over specify what needs to be provided.  We try to encourage people to come forward with solutions.  We have worked with Enterprise Ireland and a range of actors in the public sector to advance that agenda and will continue to do so.</p><p>  The public procurement directives relevant to this discussion were about simplifying administrative procedures and facilitating the use of e-procurement.  The EU spends approximately &euro;2 trillion per annum on public procurement which is a huge amount of money and about 19% of EU GDP.  If we are serious about opening up the Single Market then there are significant opportunities in procurement.  We work closely with Enterprise Ireland, for example, and help companies to internationalise, identify and avail of opportunities.  Turnover requirements have been explicitly limited to twice the size of a contract.  Therefore, one should not set very high levels of turnover that SMEs cannot meet, it is possible to divide contracts into smaller lots and there will be detailed monitoring by the Commission on SME participation.</p><p>  I understand Deputy Calleary referred to the Commission's definition of SMEs.  Is that less than 500 or 250 employees?  </p></speech>

There is a lot of work going on.  We have focused, in particular, on certain critical administrative aspects of Horizon 2020 that could act as a barrier to participation in smaller countries like Ireland.  Some member states favoured a more complex set of arrangements for funding that would benefit large research institutions at the expense of smaller ones and make funding more difficult.  Let us say one tries to put together a consortium comprising a number of institutes.  In that case we would be anxious to ensure that the funding arrangements are as straightforward as possible to better facilitate smaller member states, Ireland in particular.  There is a lot of work being done.  First, we must maximise our potential for funding under the existing programme that has not finished yet.  Second, we want to be ready to hit the ground running when Horizon 2020 comes on stream.</p><p>  I shall respond to the question about state aid modernisation.  Aid in the "C" regions is extremely important to several member states, including Ireland.  There are two critical issues.  First, will aid be available.  Second, if so is it only available for new products or enterprises.  A significant part of IDA Ireland's work is to retain, build and help existing multinationals to change their product plans or processes and so on in order to stay ahead of the competition.  Therefore, it was important to get some modifications to facilitate aid for existing enterprises provided it was for new products or processes.  We have achieved significant success in that regard.  Where an issue arises IDA Ireland will have to ensure that it can work with people to develop their proposals in a way that meets requirements.</p><p>  Finally, an entrepreneurship strategy was mentioned.  We are developing an entrepreneurship strategy at present.</p></speech>

Again I too commend them on their role during the Presidency.</p><p>  The overarching theme of the presentation is to promote sustainable economic growth and jobs.  We all accept that and want to see it realised.  There is an obvious relationship between economic growth and job creation.  If we are to reach the very modest job creation targets which the Department has set, we must see improved growth figures in this State and across Europe.  My view is that economic growth has not been great in Europe in the past six months.  It certainly has not been great in this State.  I met the troika on behalf of my party when they were in town last week.  It was of the view that the figures for the first quarter of this year and the early indications of the first half of this year were negative.  That creates a problem.  If we are not achieving real sustainable economic growth, it is unlikely we will reach job creation targets.  That is important.  While growth is the overarching objective, the reality in Europe unfortunately is different.</p><p>  In regard to Horizon 2020, my understanding is that the State's overall target for spending was 3% of GDP.  Are we reaching that percentage?  What percentage are we currently achieving?  The Secretary General also referred to Horizon 2020 and that SME participation in relevant areas should be increased from 15% to 20%.  What are we achieving at present?  We need to have the baseline figures so that we can benchmark them against the objectives.  Are we realising our targets?  I believe we should support the small and medium sized enterprises in the area of research and development and accessing EU and global markets.  Much work remains to be done in that area.  If we are to set targets, we need to have a sense of the present position.</p><p>  The proposed equity facility for growth phase investment was referred to in the opening statement.  Will this equity facility be over or below the interest rate of current bank lending?  We had a problem with the micro-enterprise loan fund.  Unfortunately, the take-up rate in some regions was low.  From the discussions I had with the enterprise boards across the south east region, among the issue raised was that the scheme was not attractive enough as the interest rates were too high.  We need to get that right.  If we are to introduce schemes designed to help SMEs, they must be attractive and relevant and the take up rate among SMEs should be at a proper level so that they avail of the supports being given to them.</p><p>  The youth guarantee is one of the major achievements of the Presidency but we need to see it rolled out and add value not only in regard to training and education but job opportunities for people.  There is a tendency for us to fall back on education and training when the jobs are not there but our focus must be on jobs.  If the youth guarantee is rolled out have we any indication of the time frame for people getting a job and having a genuine career pathway when they participate in a youth guarantee scheme?  I am sure the Secretary General will be aware that this committee published a substantial report on the youth guarantee, as did the Joint Committee on European Affairs.  Have the officials studied that report and considered the raft of recommendation we would have made which would underpin the Department's approach to rolling out its programme?</p><p>  Is there greater scope for state aid for manufacturing industries?  A related issue is regional aid.  I am aware that the maps and guidelines for regional aid are being re-examined.  I am from the south east and I make no apologies for continuously raising the fact that the region is under performing with high unemployment levels.  When I look at the regional aid guidelines, the south east as a sub-region should be on a par with the BMW region.  Is that being considered?</p><p>  Notwithstanding the gender imbalance of the delegation, there is a need to do more in terms of women entrepreneurs and do what we can to help and assist them, especially  we need to look at intervention and supports at the early level.  We need strategies to target young people.</p><p>  My final point - I made this point to the Minister when he has appeared before the committee - is that the Department must work in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills to look at second and third level education and to foster a spirit of creativity and innovation.  While we are all going for the immediate wins, we need to focus on the long term so as to ensure there is a generation of young people who are geared to innovation and creativity.  There is a role for the Department of Jobs, Enterprise  and Innovation to work with the Department of Education and Skills on this as well.</p></speech>

We meet the criteria at the level of assistant secretary, principal officer and assistant principal and in fact at every other grade, but not at Secretary General level, as I am more than 40% male.  The 40% representation of women is met, but that is not the composition of the delegation today.</p><p>  On the targets of the different percentages of GDP, there are a number of different targets for research and development.  The goal we set for the Europe 2020 strategy is to improve the conditions for research and development with the aim of raising combined public and private investment levels to 2.5% of GNP, which is about 2% of GDP by 2020.  Our national reform programme of 2012 indicates that underlying assumption remains valid and that progress is on track.  The latest available data shows that the research intensity rate for 2011 is estimated at 2.2% of GNP.</p></speech>

GNP is a different way of calculating it and the target mentioned may be the Department's target, but what I was talking about was the target of Horizon 2020, which was 3% of GDP.  Where do we stand in that context?  In GDP terms, what percentage are we realising?</p></speech>

That is a percentage of funding, but I do not have a figure with me now with regard to what percentage of our funding now has come from SMEs.  If we look at the &euro;70 billion for Horizon 2020 over the years, the 15% to 20% would give &euro;7.6 billion in 2011 prices; it is quite complicated.  There are a number of elements of the programme where there is specific reference to participation of SMEs.  Perhaps one of my colleagues would like to deal with this in more detail.</p></speech>

The target for the current framework programme had been 15%, but we wanted to push that up and we pushed it up successfully, with the support of other member states.  Ireland led this and we got the percentage up to a 20% target.  This means there are now specific SME-friendly instruments in the next programme - Horizon 2020 - which will ensure greater participation of SMEs.  We saw this as important to assist indigenous industry.  There is plenty there for the larger companies, but we wanted to do more for the SME sector in particular.</p></speech>

That information is available.  Based on previous information we got from Enterprise Ireland, I can inform members that Ireland is one of the leading countries, if not the foremost, in terms of SME participation in framework programmes.  I will be happy to get the details on this and to provide it to members.</p></speech>

This is not something that will be done in isolation from other measures that are being developed by the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Education and Skills.  Significant work is being done under the Pathways to Work programme, which operates to complement what we are doing in the Action Plan for Jobs.  Reform and restructuring of employment services is taking place through Intreo and a particular objective is to get better linkages between persons on the live register, employers and other opportunities.</p><p>  The intention of the youth guarantee is that it will build on existing measures, including the full range of activation measures in other schemes, to offer eligible categories of education, training or employment.  Significant work is also being done by the Department of Education and Skills in developing SOLAS, the further education and training authority.  The legislation for this was passed recently.  I am going from this meeting to a meeting between the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Minister for Education and Skills, where we will look at the strategy that will be developed for SOLAS and the role we envisage for employers so that they are brought into it.  Members may have seen, for example, that when JobsPlus was being launched, it was important that we had employers involved.  In the south east we had an interesting example of this.  There, a new company developed an important programme, in partnership between the employer and F&Aacute;S, to retrain people who had lost their jobs in TalkTalk.  This is the kind of programme we want to consider, along with other initiatives, so that when we are building a range of measures under the youth guarantee, we can ensure enterprise is plugged into that and the programme does not just become a course with nothing following on from it.</p><p>  With regard to state aid and the regional aid maps, coverage is a significant issue.  We have managed to retain and slightly increase the proportion of Ireland's population that can be covered under regional aid maps.  The percentage covered will increase to approximately 51.4% of the population.  This is only a marginal increase, but we had faced a potential reduction at one stage.  It is important to avoid a reduction.  State aid is a matter that must be considered and it is a matter for Government to decide on it in due course.  I have no doubt every region in the country will make its case, including the south east.  I think I have covered all the issues raised by the Senator.</p></speech>

I am fascinated by the report itself.  It is the sort of report that should be presented before an EU committee rather than an Irish committee.  I was elected by Irish people and I would prefer to have seen much more about what the Department is doing in this country to follow the policies laid down by the Government and to have got a report on those policies, rather than the overall EU report we have got.</p></speech>

We have spoken about procurement on a number of occasions.  How much work has been done by the Department with regard to the definition of an SME within Europe?  The figure of 250 employees was mentioned, but here in Ireland we would consider a company with 50 employees as an SME.  In the context of EU procurement rules we must follow, has the Department worked hard to convince the EU of the different set of circumstances in Ireland?  In the context of procurement, will Mr. Murphy comment on the fact that it is a Swedish company that is running the Irish procurement website?  What impact does this have on Irish companies in the context of being able to access some of the tenders on offer?</p><p>  With regard to women entrepreneurs, last year a fund was set aside for these.  </p></speech>

I commend them on the role they played during the EU Presidency.  I agree with the concerns expressed by other speakers on public procurement.  Are there any recent examples of Ireland being granted allowances under the state aid policy?  Is there an equal interpretation of those rules across the EU?  Is there an appetite for relaxation of those rules, considering the jobs crisis, or are they more open to abuse in light of the jobs crisis in many countries?  The Secretary General mentioned the loan facility of the competitiveness council and the targeting of financial support for SMEs.  Can he expand on the operation of this?</p><p>  My final question is about the EU-US transatlantic trade and investment partnership.  I presume that the agrisector would be included in those trade talks.  The importation of US agricultural products would be a concern because of the different regime that they have in respect of the use of hormones and the use of BST for milk production.  I would be concerned that if there was no proper labelling, we could have food scares that were similar to those which we had in the past.  We have made great strides in Europe over the decades on traceability, quality product and hormone free beef, so perhaps the Secretary General might expand on these issues.</p></speech>

The report does what it says on the tin.  It is specifically about developments at EU level.  If a member state goes into a Presidency with a perspective that it is going to use it as six months to pursue policies of that member state, then that is a very risky approach to take.  It is quite likely to result in it not being a very effective Presidency.  We have sought to take the agenda as it has evolved up to our Presidency, to identify those parts of it that are most critical from an EU and from an Irish point of view, and to progress those, but we also do the day job, which is the regular run-of-the-mill EU work that a Presidency must manage efficiently.  If that is not done, we will not get success in areas of higher priority.</p></speech>

We only get the Secretary General in every six months and we like to deal with issues in our own Department and what they are pursuing, rather than on the EU Presidency and our role in that.  It may have been a misinterpretation of what I meant.  I welcome the fact that the Secretary General will come back here in the next couple of weeks to address us on what we are doing.</p></speech>

We identified the trade area, especially an EU-US mandate, as something that would be very significant for the EU but also for Ireland.  The Taoiseach, our own Minister and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade invested a lot of time and effort in ensuring that we gave it the priority that it needed at political level, and at Council and working group level, and we delivered an important result.  That will be a difficult negotiation, and Deputy Kyne referenced a couple of areas that might be contentious, such as agriculture.  Based on previous experience, that will be a long and complex negotiation.  Perhaps one of my colleagues will comment on the agricultural element.</p></speech>

Deputy Lawlor asked what we have been trying to do to reduce our definition of an SME for procurement purposes from 250 employees.  That 250 is an EU-wide definition.  It does not mean that one has to have 250 employees.  In our national policies we focus on much smaller firms across a range of programmes, for example, Enterprise Ireland operates with smaller firms.  We generally use a figure of 50 as a defining point.</p></speech>

The same issue applies across many member states where a very large proportion of firms are quite small.  That is not the case just in Ireland.</p><p>  The Deputy referred to the youth guarantee.  As I said earlier, the Department of Social Protection is the lead Department for this.  It will have the job of co-ordinating the preparation of a youth guarantee set of proposals for adoption by Government by the end of this year, with a view to ensuring that we can put the measures in place and draw down the funding.  The portion of the EU funding that comes through the European Social Fund requires matching funding on a 50:50 basis.  Therefore, any measures under that will have to feature in the estimates process in the normal way and will have to be eligible for ESF funding in order to draw down that money.</p><p>  The EIB funding to which the Deputy referred is essentially a loan facility, not grant aid.  I do not have the detail of its precise terms.  I do not think they have been worked out yet.  We will certainly be anxious to ensure that they are as advantageous as possible.</p><p>  Before he left, Senator Cullinane raised a question about the interest rate available under various loan facilities and whether they are advantageous or high.  The problem with instruments such as the credit guarantee or the micro-finance loan fund is that by definition they are for firms that would not qualify for funding from banks and there is a risk premium associated with that.  One cannot ignore that risk premium because if one were to seek to do so one would be giving illegal state aid so it must be given on a basis that meets those requirements.</p><p>  Deputy Kyne asked whether there are recent examples of State aid.  I am not sure what exactly he meant.</p></speech>

I congratulate them all on the great work they did during the Irish Presidency.  It was outstanding.</p><p>  If the figure for Horizon 2020 and research and development is 1.8% of GDP, how much in monetary terms is the Department spending per year and how is it planned to get that up to 3% over the next few years?  We all agree that is of huge importance.  Much of the research and development investment for small companies is coming through the innovation vouchers from Enterprise Ireland.  According to some of the feedback I get that is quite bureaucratic for both the universities and the businesses involved.  Could we look at this in another way, whereby we would give a payment to universities which would have to reach a certain target?  That might be more appropriate than for a small business to try to work through the bureaucracy and the university.</p><p>  I missed, or did not understand exactly, the point about venture capital.  How is that going to operate in real life, for example, how will we increase the level of venture capital for somebody running a business?  There was much talk earlier about female entrepreneurship.  There is significant activity in this area, and has been for the past few years.  It may not yet be quantified in reports but Enterprise Ireland has a very dedicated team working for female entrepreneurship and finds it quite challenging.  Its staff are on the ground every month trying to get activity going but women view entrepreneurship and risk very differently from men.  That seems to be a challenge for Enterprise Ireland.  The Cork Institute of Technology runs the PINC programme which has been very successful.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-16a.187" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1023" speakername="John Lyons" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013071600010#J01300"><p>By way of preface, I was quite involved in the youth guarantee before I came in here so I probably know a little bit more than most people about it.  We all seem to use this phrase now but there is an onus on everybody to get involved in understanding the concept.  At the moment Ireland is only trialling and testing how such a concept could be applied.  Although there are figures for the amount of money that will be available, the most important thing is to trial and test a concept that can be adapted to the Irish environment and people.</p><p>  The witnesses here today are not on the proposed steering group that has been set up to oversee the implementation of the youth guarantee scheme and, unless that is a mistake in the press release, I would advise revisiting that decision.  Since coming into Leinster House my understanding has been that the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation focuses on creating the environment for work to happen and the Department of Social Protection focuses on providing and upskilling the people who will work in that environment.  That is a fine and happy medium but there does not seem to be any bridge between the two.  I do not know what is at play there.  There are two excellent documents, Pathways to Work and Action Plan for Jobs but it is very hard to see where they are intertwined.  For the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to say it will support the Department of Social Protection in the roll-out of the youth guarantee scheme is not enough.  There are talented people in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, six of whom are sitting across from me now, plus many others, who probably have ideas that will not be heard or sought if they are not on the steering group.</p><p>  I know that the Department of Education and Skills and the new SOLAS will play a part but the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has an innovative part to play in the roll-out of the youth guarantee scheme.  I do not know what that is but the Department is not mentioned in the press release that was issued on 3 July.  That expertise is much needed.  For whatever reason the two Departments do not appear to be as intertwined as they should be.  That needs to change if we are genuinely concerned about having an appropriate youth guarantee scheme in Ireland.</p></speech>

We are involved in the preliminary meetings of the steering group.  I have not seen the press release to which the Deputy refers.  However, I assure the Deputy that we are involved.  On the broader point, there is significant collaboration and there needs to be.  Labour activation measures must be complemented by actions taken under the broad rubric of enterprise policy.  They cannot be in two separate silos.  For example, the Action Plan for Jobs specifically cross-references Pathways for Work.  One of the disruptive reforms, one of those measures to specifically change how things are done, is JobsPlus.  At the initiative of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Government has ensured that we identified some significant players in the private sector who will become champions for each of these reforms, including for JobsPlus.  We believed it was very important that enterprise should become more directly involved in labour market activation measures so that these are not seen as something out there for young people or the long-term unemployed and which have nothing to do with enterprise.  We wanted to change that mindset.  Equally, we want enterprise to be more involved in the strategy for SOLAS and in the role of Intreo.  We will pursue this policy further and deepen the connection when we are developing the action plan for jobs for 2014.  I can assure the Deputy the Department is involved in drawing up the proposals for the youth guarantee scheme.</p></speech>

Deputy Collins asked about the composition of 1.8% of GDP.  Gross expenditure and research and development is known as the GERD measure.  There are several different measures.  The figure for 2010 was &euro;2.8 billion which is 1.8% of GDP, of which business contributed &euro;1.9 billion, the government sector directly contributed &euro;90 million, the higher education sector which is largely public funding was &euro;800 million and a small amount for the private non-profit sector.  These figures are adjusted every year.  It gets rather complicated after a while.  We will endeavour to find more up-to-date figures for 2011.</p></speech>

There might be an easier way of delivering the &euro;5,000.  Perhaps if the universities had a particular target, the entrepreneurs could deal directly with them and then the universities could target it differently.  I am sure there are more conversations needed.  In general, the innovation vouchers have been successful but I thought that was a useful piece of information.</p></speech>

At a very strategic level there is a significant difference between the way new enterprises are financed in Europe compared to the United States, for example.  In the United States, while bank funding is important at early stages in businesses, non-bank financing, venture capital equity, for example, provides a much higher proportion of enterprise funding and is a very definite engine of growth.  Bank financing everywhere tends to be risk-averse.  What we have been looking to do both in Ireland - because of our particular circumstances with our banks - but also more broadly at European level, between ourselves and our colleagues in the Department of Finance, is to look at ways in which European financial instruments can support more non-bank financing as well as putting in place guarantee measures and other measures that will facilitate more bank financing, particularly for SMEs.  The capital was increased by &euro;10 billion and part of that is designed to increase the level of venture capital funding.  We already have a range of programmes and Enterprise Ireland is directly involved in many of these.  The State puts some money up and issues calls for the private sector to put up money and investments can then be made in the new businesses or in the expansion of existing businesses.  If the Deputy requires further information I will be happy to provide it.</p></speech>

The people with over &euro;10 million are usually funded quite easily.  Enterprise Ireland seems to be filling the space under that quite well with the &euro;750,000.  This seems to have been a significant problem even long before the Celtic tiger.  The companies usually end up going to the US and the first requirement there will be for the company to relocate to the US.  We are losing potentially viable businesses in great numbers.  Could it be possible to set up a venture capital programme and for the State to take an equity stake in businesses in partnership with other players in the market?</p></speech>

The committee spent a lot of time scrutinising that directive and I ask what the current situation is.  With regard to the EU Patent Court, is there a concern that we could lose expertise in the country?  It has been brought to our attention from legal experts that if the EU Patent Court is based in the UK and not here, in the long run this could become difficult for Irish businesses wishing to access the expertise required to challenge a patent ruling or to register a patent.  If the Secretary General wishes, he can provide the information later.</p><p>  I compliment the work done on the youth guarantee scheme and Pathways to Work scheme.  It is important that the enterprise side of the Department should play a role in this regard.  The committee recognises the speed at which the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, has brought this issue to European level but a cross-departmental initiative is needed in order to make it work.  It is clear that the pilot stage will need to be completed in order to draw down the funding for 2014 and 2015.  Certain projects may need to be reclassified, renamed, in order to come under the guarantee.  The focus must be on youth.</p><p>  There is a necessity for the business community to link in with Intreo.  I am concerned that this is not really happening as yet.  There have been delays in the opening of Intreo offices because of accommodation issues.  The Pathways to Work document is excellent when taken in conjunction with the action plan for jobs but these projects need to be driven and pushed.  Businesses must be encouraged to tap into those projects through the influence of local chambers of commerce.  We need to have business engage with social protection.  This is not happening, in my view.  Perhaps the Department could encourage and drive that connection.  We are often told that local businesses are unsuccessful in finding employees.  However, I accept that on investigation there is not always proof of this statement.  We need to tell businesses that we expect them to engage with the services.  I commend the JobsPlus scheme.  Other services are there to help employers employ staff.  We need to put that message out there.</p></speech>

I understand the Chairman wrote to the Minister about this issue and received a detailed reply.  I do not have much to add as we are only in the early stages of working out what needs to be put in place.  The question of whether there is sufficient existing and potential patent work in Ireland to justify seeking to have a local court is one that will require further consideration by Government, including by our colleagues in the Department of Justice and Equality.  On the face of it, it seems a fairly tall order given that we generally see only two or three cases per year and 50 is the type of scale we would probably need to justify such a request.  There is a suggestion that there might potentially be a lot of work which would not necessarily end up in cases.  That, however, is a difficult argument to sustain.  We have not worked out our position on this.</p></speech>

Ireland has done quite well out of that programme.  At one of the meetings of the committee which took place at Dublin Castle during the Presidency, we had a detailed discussion on Horizon 2020 and how beneficial it has been for Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland has been particularly effective in its role in this regard.  Is there an implication in the reduction to &euro;70 billion that Ireland stands to lose out on funding under the initiative?</p></speech>

We worked very hard to protect the budget in the context of the MFF and were very successful in that regard.  In terms of what we can expect to achieve under Horizon 2020, we would be looking to increase our take from approximately &euro;600 million under the existing programme to close to &euro;1 billion in the next round.  I am reluctant to describe it as a target because there is a lot of work remaining to be done.  That, however, is the order of magnitude we have in mind.</p></speech>

I wish to advise members of the usual warning about mobile phones as they interfere with the broadcast.  Apologies have been received from Senator Denis Landy, who is detained in the Seanad.</p><p>  We will now have a discussion with Mr. Conor Newman, Chairman Designate of the Heritage Council.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas le Mr. Newman as bheith i l&aacute;thair.</p><p>  I must read out a procedural point regarding the Defamation Act, which is for all witnesses.  I wish to draw witnesses' attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if a witness is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in regard to a particular matter and continues to do so, the witness is entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I wish to advise the witness also that the opening statement and any other documents the witness has submitted to the committee may be published on the committee website after the meeting.</p><p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>  I am delighted to have the opportunity to welcome Mr. Newman to the committee to discuss the work of the Heritage Council.  Mr. Newman has been designated as chair of the council.  It is not his first term and therefore he has a particular experience in that regard.  I look forward to the interesting exchange he will have with the committee.</p><p>  I note from the Heritage Council website that it takes an integrated approach to heritage, with responsibilities that include both its cultural and its natural aspects.  I would like Mr. Newman to expand on that and give the committee some insight in terms of the way that mission statement can be extrapolated.  The website states also that the heritage Acts provide a definition of &quot;heritage&quot; and its spread is truly comprehensive as it includes monuments, archaeological objects, heritage objects such as art, industrial works, documents, genealogical records, architectural heritage, flora, fauna, wildlife habitats, landscapes and seascapes; the list is almost endless.  It is a wide range of responsibility on which Mr. Newman can expand in terms of the resources available to the council and what that means.  We are in an era where we are almost driven demented by fiscal-speak in terms of constraints on resources but it is important that we take stock of our heritage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-16a.219" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor Newman" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013071600004#C00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for this opportunity to address them.  In particular, I thank the Chairman for his opening words.  I could not have put it better myself.  As the Chairman mentioned, I have been chairman of the Heritage Council for the past five years so I have an intimate knowledge of it.  In summary, I have steered it in the past year and a half through a successful critical review.  The Heritage Council, along with quite a number of bodies, was reviewed thoroughly by the Department and we have come out of that with a clean bill of health.  Perhaps most importantly in the context of today's meeting, I have steered the Heritage Council through the development of the current strategic plan which runs from 2012 to 2016 so, in a way, my fingerprints and those of the board are all over the strategic plan and it is perhaps not a bad place to start.</p><p>  Before we begin, and I will develop some of the themes the Chairman has asked me to develop as I go through my presentation, I will introduce myself more directly to the committee.  I am a senior lecturer in archaeology at the School of Geography and Archaeology at NUI Galway where I have worked since 1996.  My main interests include the archaeology of royal sites and landscapes, most notably Tara, and I am currently co-directing an international project on the life and legacy of St. Columbanus, not to be confused with St. Columcille.  Columbanus is the saint who made the major foundations in France and Italy at Bobbio where he died in 615.  The Chairman was on Garnish Island recently, while I have recently been in Bobbio.  There is a very strong sense of the permanence, durability and impact of Irish culture not just on our shores but elsewhere.  The Heritage Council is very aware that this is part of our public face or &quot;shop window&quot;.  Archaeology is one of the cornerstones of heritage in Ireland with the result that my day job at NUI Galway and my position at the Heritage Council converge to the benefit of both.</p><p>  The Heritage Council pre-dates its establishment as a statutory body in 1995 by about six years and so has played a central role in Irish heritage management, development and promotion for almost a quarter of a century so it is very much on the landscape.  It has been a privilege to be associated with it for the past five years and to be considered for re-appointment.  What I find so interesting is how the Heritage Council has managed to shape itself to the different ways people express, celebrate and value their heritage and to its extraordinary diversity.  The body I was appointed to five years ago seemed at first sight to have evolved in a way that appeared quite organic but which I came to realise was actually very deliberate.  It is a bottom-up organisation that has carefully mapped itself onto the phenomenon of living history.  There is almost a tautology in that living history is like a contradiction in terms.  It makes it very special and peculiar because of the nature of past and present converging in what we call heritage.  For a phenomenon that is so ethereal, the strength of the ties between people and their heritage is remarkably strong and resilient, as the Chairman noted, probably because they are so personal and speak to communal values.  Our common heritage is what makes us who we are when we meet together as communities.  Yet it is also a remarkably fragile phenomenon and requires a light and sensitive touch, which is why the bottom-up approach is so important.  Perhaps we can develop this later on in the questions-and-answers session.  The Heritage Council has developed networks and support mechanisms that allow individuals and communities to care for and promote their own heritage not just in line with international standards but regularly setting them.  For example, in the past six months, a major delegation from Kosovo came to visit the Heritage Council with a view to replicating it in Kosovo.  At the time, I was supervising a Master's student from Kosovo who was funded by the European Commission as part of its efforts to help them rebuild their heritage infrastructure in war-torn Kosovo.  It is quite interesting to see that the Heritage Council is an organisation that other countries are looking to replicate.  As the Chairman mentioned at the start, one of the unique attributes of the Heritage Council is the combination of natural and cultural heritage.  The fact is that they cannot be separated.  The man cannot be taken from bog but I would argue that the bog cannot be taken from the man.  We shape the landscapes around us and they in turn shape who we are.  It is that combination that makes a visitor to our shores very aware that they are in Ireland.  It is not just the people and their accent and language.  It is the entire ambience that is created by the place we have created, warts and all, good and bad.  The Heritage Council is one of the most networked statutory bodies, reaching into every parish in the country.  That networking and the need for that type of networking given the phenomenon that is living history was one of the things singled out for commendation in the critical review.  It was recognised from the start that this is eminently suited to the peculiarities of heritage.  It is not an approach that can be replicated at Departmental level.  In other words, a civil service <i>per se</i> would find it difficult to replicate that type of networking.  Our connections go from other State bodies right down to individuals.  That grouping of associations makes the work very interesting but complex and specialised at the same time.</p><p>  Networks aside, one of the functions of the Heritage Council that I regard as particularly important is the development of policy.  The Heritage Council has been an engine room of policy development concerning Irish heritage since its inception and I am glad to see that the critical review identified this as a core function.  In respect of the wide purview or gaze of the Heritage Council, the Chairman mentioned the almost dizzying amount of things that can be categorised as heritage.  Standing back from that and with that as its remit gives the Heritage Council a perspective across natural and cultural heritage and a type of expertise that is unique.  It positions it really well to develop and recommend policy initiatives.  One that the committee has undoubtedly been aware of is the development of a national landscape strategy.  This is urgent because it speaks to a type of joined-up thinking about every aspect of the Irish landscape.  If we achieve this, and I have every confidence we will, it will be a major milestone in the maturation of the governance of the Irish landscape and will be a box ticked in terms of our commitments as a signatory to the European Landscape Convention, which is a very important document.  Many other countries are ahead of us on this curve and have developed what are called landscape observatories.  This is something the Heritage Council is developing as I speak.  I have already said that I have a particular in landscapes albeit archaeological ones but it is not possible to distinguish archaeological landscapes from all the other types of landscapes.  Consequently, my interest specifically in landscape has meant that over the past number of years, I have been heavily committed to and involved in the development of the proposals coming from the Heritage Council in the direction of landscape feeding into the national landscape strategy.  We are developing a viewer which will capture all the basic data that decision and policy makers need on the landscape - the state of the landscape - and I expect that this will be delivered within the next year.  </p><p>  One of the pitfalls of being so networked, however, is dissipation of profile.   Due to the fact that the Heritage Council's philosophy focuses on support and capacity-building, so much of the work of the council occurs below the radar screen.  Success for the Heritage Council is when a community identifies an aspect of its heritage that it wishes to promote, revive, enjoy and share and if we can help it achieve that, that is a success for us.  They are small building blocks but they make a big difference to people's lives.</p></speech>

It is quite difficult to pin down one aspect because the remit is so wide, so I will just ask some questions to tease out the issues.</p><p>  Mr. Newman referred to the Heritage Council's sectoral role and the heritage network.  I am very interested in this because, clearly, some aspects are very fragmented.  Mr. Newman would obviously have a role in terms of the archives.  Anyone having experience of either formal or informal records can see there is a huge missed opportunity in this regard.  For example, even the railway records are a substantial set of records which are maintained by a voluntary archivist, and then there are the major archives maintained by the General Register Office, GRO.  How would Mr. Newman envisage pulling all of that together or is this possible?  Would money be available from the Ireland Fund of from philanthropy?  This is not just about our heritage for those living on the island but it is also very much that those records belong to the people who emigrated and who want to reconnect with that sense of place that can be created when they find a location to which they are connected.  There is a huge opportunity but we are not exploiting it, except in a piecemeal way.  For example, the GRO records could be a very good census substitute if they were searchable online, and this is an opportunity that could be cost-neutral.</p><p>  Reference was made to the work of the Irish Walled Towns Network.  The history of the walled towns is fascinating but it has largely gone unnoticed up to the recent past.  Does the Heritage Council have other initiatives which would be packageable in the same way as that network?  It is useful to see what can be done but what we have not been able do because of the lack of funding.  I am shocked by the reduction in the amount of money available to the Heritage Council as I had not realised it was that much.</p><p>  With regard to the area of planning and the national landscape strategy, during the Celtic tiger madness it was a rearguard action to try to keep things that were worth keeping, and I found myself in that position on several occasions.  In terms of getting people to buy into the landscape strategy, how does the Heritage Council develop policy whereby people actually value something in its own right before it gets rezoned because there is a lovely landscape or a gorgeous building?  Will there be engagement in that policy formation in a wider sense?  Clearly, if one develops a landscape strategy, there will be limitations, and it is these limitations that often come into conflict.</p><p>  I was very impressed with the number of people employed.  When one thinks of the Guinness Hop Store and the Cliffs of Moher centre in County Clare, we can see why there would be both private and public sector employment.  I am curious about the engagement with philanthropy and the prospects for the Ireland Fund, as well as the potential for developing the sectoral role to a greater extent.</p></speech>

From his CV, he appears to be eminently qualified.  Given the value the county councils' heritage officers bring to their role of raising awareness of heritage, in particular the various surveys they have conducted, I am anxious about the question of funding.  I know they did outsanding work in the past and I would like to see them retained, so I hope every effort is made to do that.</p><p> Heritage Week is a fantastic opportunity for the wider public to think about their heritage.  With regard to the schools, we have perhaps lost a little of the value that should be placed on our heritage and perhaps our young people do not value enough what we have.  What are Mr. Newman's thoughts on how we move forward with this, rather than just teaching history, given there is so much more to it?</p><p>  The national landscape strategy should have been published by now.  What are the reasons for the delay?  There should be a sense of urgency when we look at the evolving requirements for renewable and wind energy, the memorandum of understanding between Ireland and Britain and the plans in that regard.  I would like to hear Mr. Newman's thoughts on that.</p></speech>

On the future of the archives, Ireland has a very mixed track record of looking after its archives, and some of them are literally rotting before our very eyes while others are in an excellent state of preservation.  We are fortunate we live in an age where digital technology allows us to digitise so much so much of our archives, and in particular to digitise them in searchable ways.  For example, a number of projects are going on in the Digital Hub or with regard to digital humanities.  At this stage, the technology is available to us and it is a question of personnel and resources, which obviously boils down to money.  We need to be able to harness those in a way that does not damage the archive itself but turns it into a digital format in a way that is accessible.</p><p>  There are obviously difficulties with the integration of all of those different digital formats.  For example, we all have old computers and disks at home that we can no longer use because of their obsolescence.  It is an ongoing commitment.  Digitising an archive is not the end of the job; in fact, it is the beginning of a long-term commitment.  If we are going to go down that road in Ireland, which we already have done to some extent, we have to do it with our eyes open as to the long-term commitment.</p><p>  The Deputy is right to point out the interest in the archives of all kinds of bodies, from the religious orders down to organisations like railway societies and so on.  There is an extraordinary compendium of information out there and an amazingly diverse audience of interest all over the world.  It is ironic that people often become more interested in their roots and history when they leave these shores, as they are at the moment in their droves, than when they are on them.  There is an opportunity there for philanthropic investment in archives.  The Heritage Council is actively looking at this at the moment.  We have just established a working group to look into the whole area of alternative avenues of funding, partly as a reaction to the huge cutbacks we have suffered in recent years but partly also because it is a way of getting a bigger buy-in from a wider audience.  If I have not fully answered the Deputy's question, we can come back to it.</p><p>  I thank Deputy Murphy for mentioning the Irish Walled Towns Network.  It is a network of towns in Ireland that started life as, or at least at one point in their history became, walled medieval towns.  We tend not to think we have them in Ireland, and we tend to visit them when we are on holidays in France.  However, we have walled towns in Ireland, including some quite spectacular ones.  It is very important they are looked after and even creating a network in and of itself has raised the profile of towns and what it is one has to do to preserve the sense that one is in a walled town.  A walled town has a very particular sense.  There is a sense of being outside it, because one is extra-mural, and then inside it.  The way that spatial development and planning happens both inside and outside the walled town is terrifically important to the maintenance or recreation of the ambience of a walled town.</p><p>  Deputy Murphy asked whether we have other rabbits in the hat, as it were, that we can pull out and that would be networked in that sort of way.  At the moment, no, we do not, although I am sure the Deputy is aware of the pilot project in Rindoon, County Roscommon, which involves an extraordinarily well-preserved deserted medieval town.</p></speech>

There has been an interrelationship between people and the landscape since the earliest times and regrettably many monuments, such as ring forts, have been destroyed in some parts of our country.  The management of our heritage depends very much on public awareness and education giving people an insight into what should be preserved and how to properly conserve our landscape.  Mr. Newman spoke about Heritage Week, which has been a great success and has been running for the past ten years.  However, it does not seem to change.</p></speech>

Bearing this in mind and speaking personally or on behalf of the council, will Mr. Newman outline how important is the preservation of bogs to our heritage?</p><p>  One of the problems with the subject of heritage is that it seems to overlap various Departments and bodies, for example, the OPW, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, and the Heritage Council.  Mr. Newman referred to cutbacks and how he would like the council to have more money.  We all wish we could be in a position to provide more, but can the council achieve better value for money?  In some cases, bureaucracy and excessive regulation are applied to local communities that are undertaking projects.  Local councils' heritage officers do a great deal of valuable work, but there are many areas that they do not reach.  I have in mind Loughmore Castle and St. Cronan's Church in Roscrea, where a wall was dangerously close to falling down.  For a community to preserve the buildings in question, they would need to engage in-----</p></speech>

Local communities have suffered cutbacks as well.  Could the Heritage Council make it easier for communities and people to engage in projects?  Many valuable or worthwhile monuments, buildings and so on are falling down, but there is no money to preserve them.  Local communities can help, but they are prevented from doing so by excessive regulations that lead to heavy costs.  This deters them from undertaking preservation projects.  Could the Heritage Council take a more commonsensical approach?</p><p>  I do not want to rehearse other members' comments.  As Mr. Newman sets out in his role, does he have a specific project in mind?  How would he like to be remembered when his time on the council comes to an end?</p></speech>

I wish to take this opportunity to wish Mr. Newman well in his role.  His curriculum vitae speaks for itself and highlights a life dedicated to protecting and learning about our heritage.  I am glad that we have opportunities like this to discuss appointments, as members are afforded the chance to ask questions and consider appointees' suitability.  It is a transparent and appropriate approach.  Previously, the Minister appointed numerous people who had not even expressed a formal interest.</p><p>  I wish to address the cutbacks in funding and grants for the Heritage Council.  Will the grant schemes ever be reinstated and is there a timeframe for same?  Would the implementation of the Hunt report on further education and training have ramifications for the area of heritage, particularly in terms of employees?  What is Mr. Newman's opinion of medieval festivals and their economic value to communities?</p></speech>

Committee members are always welcome to visit the Heritage Council offices in Kilkenny.  We would be delighted to have any or all committee members visit.  Should the committee decide to dedicate a day to that visit, it would be music to our ears.</p><p>  Deputy McLellan raised concerns about the funding of the Heritage Council.  We are also concerned because our funding has been drastically cut.  We lost a great deal of ground in 2009.  Our budget was cut by upwards of 70% in 2009 and we have not recovered.  Part of the reason we have not recovered is the background economic crisis in the country.  As I have mentioned in my presentation, the problem is that we are beginning to lose ground.  If one looks at the natural resources in Ireland we have a mosaic that we have not looked after with the degree of urgency we need to.  The Heritage Council has a very small staff and a modest budget, with which it does amazing work.  I say that as a private individual not biased by my role as chairperson.  We need more funding in order to be able to continue the work we are doing.  There is an enormous appetite among the public and we are not able to service it.  If there is anything this committee can do to help lobby for more funding - the reinstatement of our grants programme for 2014 would be a major step forward in that regard - it would be very welcome.</p><p>  The Hunt report on Further Education and Training was raised.  I mentioned already that we need to introduce heritage as a concept in and of itself.  The integrated thinking that is represented by the word &quot;heritage&quot; itself is something that we need to bring into our education system.  As a person who works in the third level education sector, one of the things I see among first year student coming to college is that they tend to think in silos, they think in terms of biology as distinct from history as distinct from English.  They do not cross-pollinate that knowledge in the way that is needed at third level, and not just at third level but as a society we need to be able to cross-pollinate from things we know in one arena into another so that we do not make the mistakes that we have made in the past.</p><p>  I live near Athenry which has a famous medieval festival.  They are important and there is a company that specialised in equipping people with all the gear, right down to the weaponry they might need.  They will also rent out a horse for the day.  They are very important and they are part and parcel of what the Irish Walled Towns Network is trying to promote.  They are good for people and are good for tourism.</p><p>  Deputy Coonan was interested in the preservation of bogs and the importance to our heritage of our peatlands.  The Heritage Council has made a presentation in this regard to the National Peatlands Strategy in April 2011.  We speak from the perspective of heritage and we rely on others to speak from other perspectives <i>per se</i>.  To come back to the adage, &quot;You can take a man out of the bog, but you can't take the bog out of the man&quot;, we have some extraordinary peatlands.  Our ancestors have had to deal with peatlands in lots of different ways, both from a cultural point of view, from a religious and mythological points of view.  There is enormous archaeological potential in our peatlands that we are not looking after to the extent that we might.  There is of course the living heritage of the bogs.  It is terribly important that we do not lose sight of that.  While there is a biodiversity imperative, and the management of the water base and so on is of great importance, but so also is the living heritage of our peatlands as well.  A balanced approach which recognises the heritage value but also the biodiversity and scientific value of our peatlands is the way forward.</p><p>  My answer will be similar to the answer I gave in respect of the national landscape strategy, it will take time.  This is something that will have to be thought about, people need to educated much more about what the peatlands are.  When people talk about biodiversity and ecological services, one may ask what does that mean?  Every third mouthful of food we eat has been pollinated by an insect.  When members are driving back to their homes, count how many insects are plastered onto the windscreen of the car and I wager one will find that it is a fraction of what it was ten years ago.  We are losing our insects because we are losing our habitats.  Insects pollinate the fruits we grow.  This may sound like a green agenda, but my point is that biodiversity is actually critical to our species.  We cannot differentiate ourselves from the natural ecology.  We rely on it.  Our bogs are very important in that regard, to the extent, that a group of people in Holland use their own personal finance to buy Irish bogs and donate them to the Irish people.  I am not sure if members are aware of that.  All the bogs in Holland have been lost and these people know the consequences and they know we have bogs in Ireland.  They research them, they buy them and then present them but with conditions that they are to be enjoyed but are not to be tampered with.  </p><p>  I was asked if heritage overlaps with too many different things and whether better value for money could be gained if excessive regulations were relaxed.  That is a complex debate and I am not sure we have the time to go into this issue.  Let me return to the principle of shared stewardship, which is very important.  It is very important to have regulation.  The authenticity of the heritage resource, and the preservation of that authenticity is very important, it cannot be a facade but must be truly authentic.  That is why professionals are brought to bear on this.  Not all of it is rocket science and consequently I would like to see a situation evolve over the next decade or so where there is greater public participation in the conservation of our heritage.  If that were the case, then we would find ourselves in step with the most recent of the European conventions on cultural heritage, the so-called Faro Convention, which is a short document.  Its appeal to professionals lies in its acknowledgement of the fact that their work in cultural heritage is public property and consequently if one is privileged to be qualified to work in it one must do so in a way that the public good, which involves participation, is manifestly clear.  </p><p>  I was asked about how I would like to be remembered.  I would like to be remembered as the person who might have been able to claw back some of the financial losses that the Heritage Council has suffered during the course of the past five years so that we can begin to reclaim some of that ground and service the communities around the countryside.  One of the things I have found most extraordinary in the past five years of travelling around the countryside, wearing my hat as Chairman of the Heritage Council is the number of people in every second townland who has benefited from the work of the Heritage Council.</p></speech>

I have a question with regard to the Heritage Council and the relationship between it and local authorities.  Many local authorities have heritage officers.  What does Mr. Newman see as their future role with regard to the Heritage Council and the local authorities?  Also, what is the Heritage Council budget for the year?</p></speech>

The funding comes in three tranches, one of which is the Vote.  Some &euro;1.5 million comes from the environment fund, but this year that was less than &euro;1 million.  We also get some money from the National Parks and Wildlife Service in respect of the operations of the national biodiversity data centre in Waterford.  Our funding situation is critical.  As I mentioned, we had to cancel our grants programme for this year, but we cannot sustain that.  Our priority for 2013 was to try to preserve the infrastructure we had put in place, such as the national biodiversity data centre discovery programme and so on.  If we lose those, we will not see them back in our lifetime.  Also, there are 70 jobs directly associated with that.  It is much more difficult to calculate the number of jobs that are influenced or affected by our grants programme.  We felt the grants programme could probably, just about, withstand one year of cancellation, but not two.  Otherwise, we begin to lose people's confidence and momentum.  We cannot afford for that to happen into the future.</p><p>  With regard to local authority heritage officers, we have a tug of war of love between the county councils and ourselves because we pay part of the salary of the heritage officers, on a sliding scale.  When a county council takes on a heritage officer, we pay the bulk of the salary, but as the years pass, the ratio changes and eventually they become funded 75% by the county council or local authority and 25% by the Heritage Council.  Most heritage officers have been in place for a number of years now and they are well embedded and regarded by the county managers.  Any of the county managers I have met over the years have nothing but praise for their heritage officers and the work they do.  They are a very committed bunch of people and have an interesting range of qualifications, everything from archaeology to botany.  There is also an anthropologist among them.  They work well as a group and we are very careful to ensure they have ongoing training at the Heritage Council and that they get together regularly so they can exchange ideas.  I think the future is very bright for the heritage officers.  We are deeply committed to that programme and would like to grow the portfolio if we could.</p></speech>

Before we begin, I would like to comment on last week's proceedings.  As members are aware, Deputy Lucinda Creighton is no longer our Minister of State.  I think we can agree that she was a fantastic Minister of State.  During the course of Ireland's EU Presidency, she travelled 120,000 miles to 44 different countries on behalf of our country.  She was always willing to come before this committee and she gave of her time very generously.  I am sure I can speak of behalf of the whole committee when I wish her well and thank her for her services to the committee.  Her departure means that we have also lost one of our own members.  Deputy Paschal Donohoe has been appointed as Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs.  I have known him since 2007, when we served in the Seanad together, and I am delighted for him and his family.  He will make an excellent Minister of State.  It is a subject he knows much about, as we know from his membership of this committee.  I look forward to seeing him back in front of this committee as Minister of State in the near future, once he settles into the role.  On behalf of the committee, I wish the new Minister of State the very best in his new position.</p></speech>

She was exemplary in her work during the Presidency.  I believe it has been a success only because of her work.  She laid the foundation before the Presidency and continued that work during it.  Unfortunately, this issue arose, but she will be back and I wish her well.  She can take a break for the moment.  Deputy Donohoe has served his time here and he will make an extremely good Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs.  I hope he has time, because at the moment he is sub-director of elections for the abolition of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, which is a post that does not even exist because the Bill has not gone through yet.  The President has to sign the Bill and then they might have a campaign, but it is a bit premature.  It is like ordering the grave diggers to work when the corpse is still quite warm.</p></speech>

I fully agree that she did a tremendous job and developed a good knowledge of European issues, established many useful contacts throughout Europe and became influential in that area.</p><p>  I congratulate our colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Donohoe, and wish him well.

She spent a lot of time travelling the length and breadth of Europe but she also spent a lot of time in the European Parliament, talking to MEPs and understanding the issues facing them.  On one occasion she spent 11 hours in our hemicycle, which deserves much thanks.  That was a task of endurance in itself.</p><p>  I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Paschal Donohoe.  I served with him on Dublin City Council and I know he will make an excellent Minister of State.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-16a.271" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1076" speakername="Dominic Hannigan" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013071600003#B00800"><p>We now move on to the main item on today&rsquo;s agenda.  On behalf of the committee I am delighted to welcome to the meeting Mr. David Kitching, policy adviser at the Foundation for European Progressive Studies, FEPS.  Mr. Kitching has travelled from Brussels to be here with us and we are very grateful to him for that.  FEPS is a leading Brussels-based think tank which aims to develop progressive thinking and strengthen the socialist, social democratic, labour and democratic progressive ideas in the European Union and indeed throughout Europe.  It is close to the Party of European Socialists, PES, of which many of us here are members, but it is nonetheless an independent body.</p><p>  Today&rsquo;s meeting is another in a series on the issue of the future of the European Union.  In recent months we have debated widely on how to secure democratic legitimacy and accountability and we are keen to explore with Mr. Kitching the views of the FEPS on how national parliaments can underpin democratic legitimacy in the European Union context.</p><p>  Before we begin, I remind members of the long-standing ruling to the effect that members should not comment on or make charges against a person by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if a witness is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in regard to a particular matter and continues to do so, the witness is entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of his evidence.  The witness is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and is asked to respect the parliamentary practice that, where possible, he should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>  I invite Mr. Kitching to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

While I represent the Foundation for European Progressive Studies I happen to be an Irish citizen too.  As a result I take this meeting very seriously and hope that I can offer a perspective that might be of some use to the committee.  I will begin by addressing matters of economic, budgetary and fiscal co-ordination, followed by the political angle.  If it is acceptable to the committee, I will save the commentary on the situation of the United Kingdom until the discussion afterwards.</p><p>  It is interesting that the committee&rsquo;s invitation made direct reference to the European semester process, a cycle of economic and fiscal policy co-ordination in existence since 2010.  The objective is to ensure sound finances, foster growth and prevent macro-economic imbalances.  Even this process raises issues about legitimacy and accountability in terms of the lines that can be crossed by partners in areas such as surveillance and other kinds of intervention.  Indeed, many proposals for budgetary co-ordination cite the potential for central authorities to veto certain national legislation.  This is often linked to the restrictive rule that national deficits should not exceed 3% of GDP.  Adherence would be maintained through a mix of financial sanctions, default mechanisms and debt mutualisation as a carrot.  When it comes to the use of mechanisms such as eurobonds, national governments need to decide the level of control they are willing to cede in the interests of efficiency.  The economic structures of the European Union are affected by sensitive political questions regarding the most legitimate level of co-ordination for each type of legislation.  As one would expect, there are radically different perspectives on where these lines should be drawn.</p><p>  Decision-making on economic, budgetary and fiscal co-ordination requires the appropriate institutional mechanisms.  At present, the ECB is very limited in its capacity to improve things due to its focus predominantly on monetary stability.  Monetary targets focus on inflation but the ECB needs real targets, with a focus on economic and social outcomes such as tackling unemployment.  A more active ECB with the ability to issue bonds to cover state debt could be a huge help in this regard.  Monetary stability is vitally important but it should be accompanied by a more ambitious strategy for full employment and increase in demand.  To achieve this, the ECB and the EU require significant structural and institutional changes in the long term.  In particular, it is time to make the ECB politically accountable, thereby removing its independent status.  The European Investment Bank is another facility whose lending scope could be widened.  It has great potential to increase employment and demand through project bonds and targeted investment.  Many of the proposals for a stronger political union require a larger EU budget and even the potential for the creation of a supranational finance ministry.  Once again, the corresponding loss of fiscal control at national level might be a bridge too far in many member states.</p><p>  In Ireland, it is necessary for us to develop a coherent perspective on our institutional preferences in the European Union.  I understand the considerable effort that went into the referendum campaign on the fiscal compact treaty and the political pressure to pass it.  At the time FEPS research indicated that the treaty could prove damaging in the long term because it narrowly constrains the capacity of national governments to use fiscal policy as a counter-cyclical mechanism at times of crisis.  When we need to boost public investment we may not have the necessary tools in future crises.</p><p>  I will turn now to political integration.  Suggestions for integration initiatives abound in Brussels.  The most noticeable proposal of recent years, in media terms at least, has been the introduction of a directly-elected President of the European Commission.  Of course, the secrecy in which the president is chosen must end.  At the moment it is more akin to a papal conclave than an electoral process.  On a continent dominated by parliamentary democracy, a US style presidential election seems slightly incongruous.  A more realistic option could be indirect elections through the process of the European Parliament elections.  In this sense, in next year&rsquo;s European Parliament elections, following a proposal from the Party of European Socialists in 2009, the main European political parties have agreed to select top candidates or their preferred option as the Commission president and they will campaign with them on the ground in the member states, in an effort to give a broader political mandate to, and link between, the European Parliament and the Commission.  Other proposals from Brussels, such as transnational party lists or others, aim to deepen political integration but they require significant treaty changes for measures that are merely cosmetic.</p><p>  In Brussels, I have always argued that treaty changes can be difficult but if they are unavoidable, we must make them count.  Measures to enhance living standards across the EU are bound to have more legitimating outcomes than fanciful daydreams.  Any suggestions proposed by FEPS would require new treaties, especially those requiring institutional transformation, such as changing deficit rules or a proposed employment and stability pact.  It is also very important that the politicisation of Europe is evident at member state level.</p></speech>

It is important to examine what has happened in the past 50 to 60 years in an attempt to identify the positive aspects which may be of value in the future.  There is a tendency to throw away the things of the past and to start from scratch as if the institutions had failed.  Many institutions have failed not by virtue of the institutions themselves, but because of the people who worked in them.  That is not a reference to Mr. Kitching's institution.</p><p>  Mr. Kitching referred to the transnational party lists, which in my view have a distinct disadvantage for a small country such as Ireland.  I do not like the list system anyway at the best of times and I have a problem with transnational party lists.  </p><p> The European Parliament has gained in strength and influence and national parliaments are allegedly gaining in strength and influence in the framing of future European policy.  How can those two points be reconciled?  A growth in the power and influence of national parliaments will strengthen renationalisation which is not in the interests of European progress or integration or the progress of the European project.  At the same time, the influence of the larger countries is strengthening considerably in the European Parliament, both in numerical strength and influence, by virtue of the gains deriving from the Lisbon treaty.  Where do small countries stand in that situation?  For example, Ireland will lose another MEP even though we have a small number of them.  The loss of one or two MEPs would have a minimal effect in the case of a large country - even the loss of ten MEPs would be minuscule - except when it comes to votes in the Parliament.  Where does this leave Ireland?  We need to be cautious about setting aside what has served us well over the past 50 years.</p><p>   I refer to the need for economic stimuli in the current climate.  We must be prepared to recognise the sacrifices made by people in this country and also throughout Europe.  All European people have suffered as a result of the economic downturn.  However, what is now deemed to be Keynesian economics was found in the 1930s and 1940s to lead to inflation which was a significantly undermining feature in the development and stabilisation of economies.  Is this the right time for such a policy?</p><p>  This is not intended as a political point but in 1977, in the midst of an economic crisis, it was deemed appropriate to re-inflate the economy, put more money in people's pockets and generate spending in the commercial sector, in order to lift the economy.  In fact, this was the wrong policy because it had the direct opposite effect; it broke the economy and set back its recovery by at least ten years.  That re-inflation of the economy caused unnecessary inflation.  House prices alone inflated dramatically during that period to such an extent that the Government of the day decided to remove house prices from the consumer price index.  </p><p>  Keynes was supposed to be the hero of the 1930s and 1940s but it was Galbraith who came forward with the suggestion that strict price controls were essential to control inflation which would swallow up any stimulus and drive an economy deeper into the red.</p></speech>

I have been privileged to meet him and to hear him speak on a previous occasion.  I belong to the school of thought in the debate on further and deeper economic and monetary union which is firmly of the view that economic and monetary union is not possible until social union is achieved, that there must be a social pillar to support economic and monetary union.  Otherwise, as Mr. Kitching said in his presentation, people's living standards will be at risk and citizens will be treated merely as consumers.  The notion of achieving a truly social union is the only way to ensure a political commitment from the citizens in order to bring us towards the deeper economic and monetary union.  As Mr. Kitching points out, the European Investment Bank could be a significant player in the effort to stimulate investment.  Ireland is hoping to avail of the European Investment Bank to fund education projects.  Even when EIB funding is available, it is still offset against our deficit and our expenditure.  In order for Ireland to use EIB funding to leverage social investment, it must be regarded as a social investment rather than expenditure.</p></speech>

On the issue of indirect versus direct elections to the role of Commission President, it has heretofore been a prerogative of smaller countries to assume that role.  Does Mr. Kitching envisage a situation where a difficulty might arise as a consequence of one of the large blocs seeking to impose a candidate from one of the economic powerhouses?  Has he identified regional as between, for example, northern versus southern blocs or eastern versus western blocs in terms of the choices to be made?</p><p>  I concur with previous speakers regarding the reduction in the number of MEPs.  I appreciate the need for a cap, but does Mr. Kitching believe there is a danger that a reduction in a member state's contingent of representatives in the European Parliament, particularly in the case of small countries like Ireland, might lead to a corresponding reduction in the relevance of Europe for citizens, or at least a perception thereof?  On the question of democratic accountability, would Mr. Kitching say that national politicians have a tendency to blame too many of our ills on Europe in the context of various directives, regulations, policies and so on?</p><p>  The Chairman indicated that Mr. Kitching is from the socialist or left side of the political spectrum, which is fine.  Given that so many countries have experienced major economic problems in recent sides, regardless of their governments' political stripes, would Mr. Kitching agree that the problems we are facing, across Europe and indeed across the world, transcend the broad left-right divide?</p></speech>

One of the factors we have found is that people want to see some type of social dimension to Europe's reaction to the crisis.  It was interesting to hear the Vice President of the Commission, Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efčovič, speaking last week about the need to extend the debate from a focus on political and economic union to include a social dimension.  He mentioned that consideration is being given to introducing social indicators, on issues such as employability, long-term unemployment and child poverty, against which countries' performance would be assessed.  Does Mr. Kitching have any views on how such an initiative might develop in the coming months and years?</p><p>  Will he expand on how he sees the European elections being fought at a trans-European level?  What types of messages does he expect will be common in all member states during the election campaign?</p></speech>

There have undoubtedly been major achievements.  The point I was making, however, is that one can see a certain ossification of the project in the sense that there is a level of complacency within what might be called the Brussels bubble.  People there are far removed from the realities of everyday life in their member states.  Their discussions are all with people who broadly agree with them, even across political divisions.  It is a cosy consensus way of living.  It is also very dangerous because it creates a huge chasm between the people who work within the system and those who are subject to it, namely, citizens across the European Union.  Unless we address these fundamental issues of elitism and the counter-reaction of populism, the entire project is in grave danger.</p><p>  It is in this context, that I am focusing on the social and economic elements.  When we consider the problems of inflation that occurred in the past we can see that there was a significant change in policy direction from the 1970s onwards.  The policy priorities moved away from employment and social initiatives towards the maintenance of stability.  Some commentators have linked the shift to the problems which followed the Maastricht treaty, when there was a huge speculative attack on the British pound and the lira, in particular, which led to the reliance on the Deutsche mark as the basis of the euro.  As a result, the German preference for the social market economy came to dominate and, with that, German fears of inflation, which are more severe than in most other countries.  As a result, we have seen slower growth, less job security and higher levels of unemployment, particularly among young people and the less skilled.  These are issues which endanger the overall achievements of the European project.  If we have that level of dissatisfaction, there is eventually going to be a backlash.</p><p>  The issue was raised of the relative strength of the European Parliament compared with national parliaments and how that might play out in the coming years.  The ideal situation would be for each national parliament to have a certain degree of oversight in terms of how the legislative process is conducted.  There is a trade-off, however, if we want to ensure legislation is efficient and effective in a Union of 28 member states.  The principle of subsidiarity within the European legislative process has been broadly successful in that every point of legislation is decided at its most appropriate level within the overall system.</p></speech>

I misjudged the traffic and was delayed as a result.  I have been able to interpret the thrust of Mr. Kitching's presentation from the questions which have been posed by members and the replies he has provided.</p><p>  If the Chairman will indulge me, I wish to offer my warm congratulations to our colleague, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, who has been promoted to the position of Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs.  The Minister of State is a person of outstanding ability and integrity.  He certainly has the capacity to do the job he has been given.  Commitment will not be an issue for him.  I also wish to pay tribute to and thank the former Minister of State, Deputy Lucinda Creighton, for her absolute commitment and dedication to this committee.  I also thank her for the thoroughness of her presentations to us and the painstaking lengths she went to when providing replies to our questions.  Deputy Creighton performed outstandingly well before this committee and her work with us merits commendation.  We trust that what she has done will set the template for Deputy Donohoe in his new Ministry.</p><p>  Does Mr. Kitching see his foundation having an involvement, either in terms of carrying out research or from the point of view of direct intervention, in dealing with the threat relating to the United Kingdom leaving the EU?  If the United Kingdom leaves, it would have grave implications for the European project in the context of its various social and political objectives.  Such an eventuality would also have grave implications for this country on foot of its special relationship with the United Kingdom in the context of trade, culture, etc.  The United Kingdom leaving would be bad news for Ireland and the EU.  It would also be bad news for the United Kingdom itself.  Can FEPS produce any useful research which might inform the debate on this matter and tilt it against withdrawal?  Is it in a position to have a more active involvement and how does it read the situation as it currently stands?  Has the foundation carried out any initial research on the matter?</p><p>  I agree with all of the points made in respect of the EIB, particularly that which states that up to now we have been concentrating on stabilisation, recovery and regaining ground that was lost.  It was quite reasonable that this should have been the position for a number of years but it is vital that we should now move to the job creation and stimulus phase of the EIB's work.  In that context, the youth guarantee is important.  In the future, the way the EU will be evaluated by the UK, which is currently contemplating withdrawal, and by its citizenry will be how it deals with the horrific problem of unemployment across all member states.  There is no greater indictment of the European project than the level of unemployment which obtains at present.  This matter must be addressed and the youth guarantee and the various job initiatives are extremely important in that context.</p><p>  Ms Emer Costello, MEP, made a point with regard to the social pillar and care of the elderly.  I am of the view that there is tremendous potential to create employment in this sphere.  It is clear that the population in this country is ageing and that there is a need to make provision for elder care.  One would not need to carry out market research or any other form of analysis to discover that older people prefer to be treated, live in and access services from their own homes.  We also know that they want to live in their homes either with their families or independently.  Carers can play an enormous role in this regard.  If steps were taken across Europe to make the job of carers more attractive and have it classified as a valued and respected profession, this would assist us in achieving a number of objectives.  As a result of such a move, older people could remain in their homes, the pressure on care institutions and the cost for states would be reduced and unemployment could be tackled.  I am aware of many people who are in low-paid jobs who would love to stay at home and care for their relatives.  If they were allowed to do this, it would give rise to vacancies in various areas of low-paid employment.  The people to whom I have spoken about this matter are not all in low-paid employment but invariably that is the case.  There is massive potential for allowing people who want to care for their elderly relatives to remain at home, thereby creating vacancies in the labour market.  This is the type of project the EIB could reasonably pursue or support.</p><p>  Will Mr. Kitching comment on the concept of a banking union?  I am aware that he considers this matter from a socialist perspective - which is not a difficulty and which gives matters an extra dimension - whereas we tend to see it from a slightly different one.  Is he of the view that banking union is achievable and would it offer a panacea for many of our ills?</p></speech>

We have had witnesses from think tanks previously.  In so far as someone comes from a think tank, it does force us to think deeply.  I am conscious that my colleague, Ms Emer Costello, MEP, is present.  It should be obligatory on those of us who are members of the committee to understand the European Union structures.  Perhaps those of us who have not gone to Europe should be compelled to do so as part of the membership of this committee.</p></speech>

I am the first to admit that, in our attempts to examine democratic legitimacy and accountability in the EU, as parliamentarians we must start to look at our own legitimacy and imagery in the eyes of the electorate right across Europe.  It seems to me that we are trying to address the issue of legitimacy and accountability not only for the European Union but also for our own national parliaments.  In Europe, we have the swinging pendulum electoral process.  Whoever is in gets knocked out and whoever is out gets in.  That does not seem to be based on sharp political analysis but on an instinctive human desire to have a better quality of life which national governments are not providing right across the board.</p><p>  The question is whether we should start trying to make the European Union more legitimate in the eyes of our constituents or if we have to do it in reverse.  Do we have to get our constituents right across Europe to understand the role of the national parliament in its relationship with its citizens in order to ensure support for the greater parliament, namely, the European Parliament?</p><p>  That brings me to the point of the election, which might be controversial.  In the past we looked at France and Germany and the United Kingdom to some degree as the big strong boys, and the perception was that everyone who was smaller in terms of population or economic strength was inferior in many ways.  We must build the trust of all the economically weaker, smaller countries to attain equal status throughout Europe.  The reason I say that is because sometimes people in small countries think that the big boys are always bad.  In this country, the Germans are seen as the big baddies.  It is easy to speak through a megaphone on a platform and shout that it is all the fault of the Germans when people conveniently forget the role that is played by the national parliament.  It is not all the fault of the Germans.  In fact, it is questionable how much of the fault lies with Germany.</p><p>  As to how we create a link between the electorate in this country, Spain or anywhere else when it comes to an election for European parliamentarians, MEPs, I invite Mr. Kitching to elaborate further on the current thinking.  We in the Labour Party will put forward Ms Costello as our candidate.  She will be represented in the poll as a Labour Party candidate seeking election.  There is a gap in the thinking then as to whether she behaves as an independent Irish Labour Party MEP.  She does not.  There is an important role that should be developed within the European context.  We must be exposed more in these elections to the party affiliations, the role of parties, Commissioners and others who represent us in Europe.  We need to identify faces.</p><p>  UKIP is one political group that engages in Irish politics and further afield.  It comes to this country and seizes the limelight.  There are other oddball individuals whom I will not mention who take a particular stance.  Why is there not a <i>quid pro quo</i> from the European political elite to engage more with the national electorate on issues such as this?  We tend to cry wolf.  I note that 12 EU member states have lost one seat each, so we are not alone, and that Germany has lost three seats.</p></speech>

The United Kingdom&rsquo;s relationship with continental Europe has historically been complicated.  If one goes to the root of discourse over national identity, Britain has historically defined itself in opposition to continental Europe up until the past 100 years or so.  That tendency still exists.  One thing that worries me about the current development of the UKIP narrative on the idea of British independence is how short-sighted it is.  The demographics do not quite hold up in the sense that people who adopt the UKIP angle on issues with which it concerns itself, namely, euroscepticism, immigration and certain types of welfare, tend to be more towards the older end of the scale.  That indicates that younger Britons are less eurosceptic.  They are less concerned about-----</p></speech>

In terms of intergenerational conflict in the UK, this seems to be the last sting of the baby boomer generation.  I am not trying to be nasty, but it was the generation that benefited from the most benign economic conditions that ever existed in the UK in terms of new educational opportunities, employment and the food people were fed.  It is a generation that transferred a huge amount of debt onto subsequent generations.  Now there is the potential that the baby boomers will remove Britain from the whole European project, although in whatever capacity it might stay in the European Economic Area.  However, it will not be so easy for the UK to get back in.</p><p>  In terms of this country and how we fit into the whole narrative, I do not know if they have even thought about the effect it would have on Northern Ireland.  When people look at what went on up there, one refers to PEACE funds and the cash cows that came in.  I have often wondered about the comparison of the Sunningdale agreement with the Good Friday Agreement.  The latter was described by the SDLP as Sunningdale for slow learners.  Sunningdale was written at a time when both countries had just become members of the EEC and did not have much experience of the concept of shared sovereignty, of borders being more porous, and of sovereignty not following the Westphalian concept of the absolute border.  If we take that forward to 1998 when one had two countries much more at ease with such concepts, I do not think one can decouple that from the experience of European Union membership.  I wonder what effect a United Kingdom withdrawal from Europe would have on Northern Ireland even though there are strong eurosceptic elements in Northern Ireland as well.  There are many other aspects of internal British politics that would be malignly affected by any such move.</p><p>  The European Union itself would lose out because my experience in Brussels is that British officials who buy into the European project tend to be some of the most practically minded policy makers one meets in Europe.  Brussels itself would lose out on the manner in which it conducts its business.  A huge number of them would lose their jobs because one cannot work in the Commission unless one is from a state which has membership of the European Union.  I hope for their own sake that British people do not choose to exit because in the long run it will damage a lot of people, not just them.</p></speech>

We are not a campaigning organisation.  Legally, we are not allowed to campaign, but we can present research which has its obvious bias; no one makes any bones about that.  We cannot campaign directly in any referendum but we have conducted research on the prospect of remaining or leaving, and how it will affect matters in Britain.  It is targeted predominantly at a British audience.</p><p>  Regarding Deputy Eric Byrne's comments, legitimacy is not only an issue at European level.  There is a problem of malaise and disillusion with institutions at every level from local democracy to any type of international institution.  Part of me wonders if the sense of a political narrative is gone from politics.  People describe dysfunction in terms that are misleadingly ethical.  A harsh welfare cut is described as a hard choice.  A tax evader is an innovator.  The way in which language is coloured and the way political discourse has been reduced to spin and a game of public relations is hugely damaging to politics.  </p><p>  I wish to quote from the late Tony Judt's final book.  In a highly critical piece on political leadership since the 1990s, he stated: "Convinced there is little they can do, they do little."  There is a feeling of impotence and the idea that politics has been superseded by unaccountable elements, whether that be from financial institutions or, even at European level, the technocratic image of the European Commission and other agencies.  All the members have mandates directly from their constituents but if people believe that is superseded by something that is unaccountable - a mysterious market or a technocratic official - it will damage it.  That is not just a question for people in Brussels; it is a question for every capital across the world.</p><p>  On the big strong boys, so to speak, and putting trust in weaker countries, there are mutual interests among smaller states when it comes to certain institutional matters but these have often been superseded by short-term interest.  The smaller triple A countries will go along with the preferences of the larger countries.</p><p>  The Deputy referred to personalisation and people needing to see the faces of Commissioners rather than those of UKIP members.  It always helps to be able to put a face to the people who make the decisions that affect their lives.  The point I was trying to make when I discussed the problems of elitism in certain quarters in Brussels, and this is not universal, is that it appears there has been a level of disengagement.  That might be due partly to the fact that in media terms there has not been the evolution of a sufficient European public sphere in the sense that comments can sometimes be made in Brussels and aside from in one's own member state, they will not go back to other people.  Someone from the Socialists and Democrats Group in the European Parliament elected from a list in Austria can say something and no one in Ireland will hear about it, unless it is specifically to do with Ireland or is controversial at a wider level.</p><p>  In terms of those type of links between national parliaments and the European Parliament, one of the conundrums is that while people are directly answerable to the local electorate, which is positive in terms of democratic legitimacy, there is little incentive to talk about Europe.  When any member is interviewed by journalists as they go about their business here, it will not always be relevant to their overall prospect to talk about Europe.  That is understandable but I do not know how to change it.</p></speech>

It is not a panacea.  As we have seen already today, we face many problems but in terms of having an economic and monetary union, we talk about social union being a key pillar of all of that.  The idea that banks can supersede or operate outside a system of regulation is hugely problematic.  A banking union alone will not deal with everything but we would like to see a situation where the instruments I suggested earlier such as the European Investment Bank could also guarantee a certain amount of lending, even from the private banks, for specific categories of investment - youth unemployment or training schemes, graduate start-ups and so on.</p></speech>

I agree that much could be done, viewing this as a source of employment.  We also need to think of the social rights of the elderly themselves.  It is a better outcome to be able to stay in one's home and that is usually people's preference anyway.  </p><p>  As regards what is the best level at which to administer that, or what is the best source of funding, that is another matter.

I will defer our discussion on correspondence and other business of the committee until next Thursday morning, which will be a regular Thursday meeting.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  This meeting has been requested by Deputies &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and Mitchell O'Connor regarding cochlear implants.  I welcome Ms Deanna Cairns, Ms Amie Connor, Mr. Shay Kearns, Ms Denise Martin and Ms Danielle Ryan.  We are pleased that they could attend at short notice.  They met the Minister just beforehand.  They have been campaigning for bilateral cochlear ear implants.  The committee will give them a good and fair hearing as part of their series of meetings this afternoon.</p><p>  I remind witnesses of the provisions regarding privilege in respect of the evidence that they are to give to the committee.  If they are directed to cease giving evidence in regard to a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice and rulings of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise nor make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I invite Mr. Kearns to make his opening remarks.  We have received a copy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-16a.336" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Shay Kearns" time="17:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013071600003#B00100"><p>My apologies for the delay.  I, along with parents of children with cochlear implants, am here to discuss the topic of bilateral cochlear implantation in Ireland, particularly with regard to children born with hearing loss.   A cochlear implant is a technology that provides people who are born with hearing loss, or who have damaged hearing nerves in their inner ears, through tiny hair-like fibres that transmit sounds into brain waves.  It is implanted into the inner ear and enables people to regain a level of hearing that allows them to speak and to hear what is being said to them.</p><p>  Ireland's implant programme was set up in 1995 and is linked to a group of 28 cochlear implant centres located between Ireland, Northern Ireland and the UK.  The centres are governed by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, NICE, medical guidelines.  In 2009 the NICE issued a report that supported the provision of bilateral implantation as a minimum standard for implant recipients.  As of today, Ireland's cochlear implant centre is the only one of the 28 centres that does not provide a bilateral implantation programme.</p><p>  The standard practice of bilateral implantation stretches beyond Ireland and across the world.  To put the matter in perspective I shall give an extensive list of some of the countries within Europe that provide a bilateral programme.  These include the UK, Norway, Denmark, France, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Holland, Belgium and Spain, as well as countries further afield such as Iceland, Australia and the US, and, in particular, as near as Belfast in Northern Ireland.  </p><p>  The NICE guideline recommendation in 2009 included a request to review the bilateral programme.  A review was completed in 2012 and its results were issued in April 2013 which favoured a bilateral implantation programme.  The most evident results were in the areas of sound localisation, speech perception and a general higher quality of life.</p><p>  Let us consider a child trying to distinguish what his or her teacher is saying in a noisy classroom and, as an adult, moving to a working environment yet still struggling to localise or perceive sounds.  For a child to progress and reach his or her potential, enter employment and give back to the State, a second implant is very important.  The issue is about more than simple hearing.  It is about providing these children with the opportunity to reach their potential, integrate into mainstream society and make a positive contribution to the State.</p><p>  The April results highlighted the urgency with which second implants should be provided.  Children will gain the greatest benefit if they receive a second implant within the first four to five years.  That is critical because the hearing nerve must be stimulated.  A single implant stimulates the hearing nerve on one side but the hearing nerve on the other side may become redundant.  The benefit to be gained from a second implant within four to five years reduces with each passing day.  A person can go from an ability to distinguish what people say word for word to just hearing a mumbled sound, so time is of the essence.</p><p>  I am speaking here about sequential implants, where one follows the other.  Simultaneous implantation means two implants are provided at the same time.  The easiest thing to do would be to roll out a simultaneous implantation programme and ignore sequential implantation.</p><p>  I wish to point out that sequential implants are very important.  At present, 350 children qualify for sequential implantation and it is expected that between 200 and 240 may avail of it.  The remainder fall into a number of different categories.  As I said before, adults may not want a second implant because their window of opportunity has passed and they will not benefit from the procedure.  Time is not on our side.</p><p>  On many occasions the lead consultants for cochlear implants in Ireland have requested support for the roll-out of a bilateral programme.  Due to longer waiting lists and an increased number of families involved, parents have voiced their concerns and support.  I am glad to say that the consultants, Dr. Laura Viani and Dr. Gary Norman, together with senior members of the HSE, led by Ms Laverne McGuinness, have engaged positively with parents and have worked  towards a solution.  That is significant because three different parties were involved and conflict can arise when multiple parties are engaged in negotiations.  However, in all of the meetings that we had with the HSE and the consultants, everybody agreed that the programme needs to happen and move forward.</p><p>  Following the meetings a business case was compiled based on a report.  The HSE agreed to bring over two specialists from the UK, Professor Gerry O'Donoghue and Ms Julie Brinton, who assisted in the roll-out of the UK and France bilateral programmes.  They have ratified what Irish consultants have said and identified what needs to be done.  The business case has been submitted.  My group has come here today to lend our support.  We want action taken as soon as possible.  We also wish to highlight the urgency of the programme.  The backlog will continue to grow as long as the matter is not addressed.  Staffing levels in Ireland's implant centre are a fifth of those in a comparable implant centre in the UK that covers a similar headcount.  Equipment is being provided by parents through private fund-raising.</p><p>  Recently the HSE rolled out the successful newborn hearing test screening that will identify children with hearing loss.  I know how effective the scheme is from personal experience.  My six-week-old daughter was born on a Friday and underwent the newborn hearing test the next day, Saturday.  It is important to follow the test with follow-on care in order to give children an opportunity to move forward and reach their potential.  There is no point in identifying them today but leaving them to enter an inadequate system.</p><p>  The solution is simple and everybody wants to reach the same destination.  We need the committee to lend its support to the business case and secure approval and funding in order to allow consultants to get on with what they do best, their job.  There is the statistic that 90% of deaf children are born to hearing parents and each child will probably be the first deaf person his or her parents have met.  Therefore, one can be sure those parents will raise this issue continually.  After I leave this office they will be back here knocking on the door.  </p><p>  Deafness can happen to anyone.  Little did I know three years ago that I would be seated here to talk about cochlear implants to the committee.  These are normal children with a sensory loss that can be treated.  A cochlear implant is a wonderful piece of technology and the children have an opportunity to receive them.  An implant is a wonderful gift that the Government can provide to children.  I ask the committee to lend its support to the business case and push it through.</p></speech>

The rest of the delegation can contribute during the question and answer session.  I call Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in first because he must soon go to the D&aacute;il Chamber.</p></speech>

I thank them for coming to meet us.  It is important that the delegation knows that this meeting has been specially convened purely to accommodate it.  The committee has had a very heavy workload over the past number of months and I pay tribute to all of my committee colleagues, of all political opinions, for their hard work.  I can assure Mr. Kearns that he is talking to people who have open minds and hearts on this issue.</p><p>  It is timely for us to meet the delegation immediately after it met the Minister for Health.  Recently, across the floor of the D&aacute;il, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and the Minister for Health acknowledged that we had won the case that we had presented in terms of the inclusion for provision of the scheme in the 2014 budgetary arrangements.  I hope the delegation will be able to confirm that the funding is still on track following its meeting with the Minister a short time ago.  We want to be sure that our efforts have complimented those of the delegation.  If it has concerns or fears that it has not had certainty that its needs will be met then the committee needs to reflect on that, and we will.  We must focus on delivering the funding and the business plan as soon as possible. </p></speech>

I echo Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's comment that the witnesses are preaching to the converted.  I am not breaking any confidence by saying that in private session everybody has been very supportive of the Happy New Ear campaign.</p><p>  Like Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, I wonder how the business case made by the group has been received.  Do they believe the backlog will be dealt with?  When we last met, there was talk of grouping of children.  Group 1 comprised about 65 children aged five years.  I am trying to imagine how long a child must wait for the implant.</p><p>  A mailing to members outlined the case of a girl who had an implant which failed and then had to undergo surgery to remove the failed implant and have it replaced with a new one.  This mother spoke of her daughter being traumatised and not allowing her out of sight.  That left her in silence for at best five weeks.  We know that one can only switch on the implant four weeks after surgery.  We also know that a child must readapt to all the sounds, as the electrodes will not hit the exact same point.  What a person may know as the sound of a bouncing ball behind him or her is now a sound that he or she must relearn.  I had not realised that.  I am very conscious that of the children with a single implant, a failed implant or none, many are living in silence.  I would like to hear a more detailed response on this issue.  I am getting more sceptical and I wonder if there is a clear plan to deal with the backlog and ensure the children will get the implants they need.</p></speech>

I have a number of brief questions, as most of my questions have already been asked by other members.</p><p>  Mr. Shay Kearns mentioned the introduction of the newborn screening test for hearing.  That is a great step forward, but we need to be able to say with confidence to the parents who have children with identified hearing difficulties that there is a clear pathway for treatment and that the children will receive treatment by a specified date.  It is important that this be put in place.  My next question - I know it was addressed during the presentation in the AV room - is the ongoing debate on the bilateral approach and the potential impact of the use of stem cell research and reactivating the nerve at some future date.  My view is that we must deal with the here and now and do something for the children whose chances of recovery are decreasing every day.  We need to act quickly.</p></speech>

As others have said, there is cross-party support for the case they are making.  It is important that the budget funding for next year is allocated.  I too would like to hear their response to the continuing problem of bilateral treatment.</p><p>  Could they outline the failure rate of the implants?  Is it the case that implants do not work for some children?  If that is the case, is there another method or process for these children?</p></speech>

It is very important that children are given the opportunity to reach their full potential.  Since the national cochlear implant programme commenced 17 years ago, more than 700 patients have had the operation, with an average of 90 operations each year, comprising 42 children and 48 adults being operated on each year. Previously there was a problem in that the Minister would not meet us, but Deputy James Reilly, the Minister for Health, gave a commitment at the previous meeting a few months ago to meet with the members, and I am delighted that he honoured it.  He has given a full commitment to look after this problem.  Finance is an issue, and I hope the witnesses had a fruitful meeting and that things went well for the Happy New Ear campaign.  Let me assure the witnesses that this cross-party committee is here to help them.</p></speech>

Blessed is Mr. Shay Kearns among women.  The implant is the most amazing piece of technology and provides the gift of sound.  For those of us who have the gifts of hearing and speech, it is very hard to imagine what it would be like to live without them.  Did I pick up the figure correctly that 250 children or perhaps more had hearing difficulties?</p></speech>

What age group would undergo surgery?  If there is a cohort of young people already in the system, how are they being dealt with?  I was not at the previous presentation but I would be very interested to learn what the Minister had to say to the delegates.</p><p>  We do not normally reconvene a meeting to meet groups on an<i> ad hoc</i> basis, but I am glad we did so because Mr. Kearns made a very interesting presentation.</p></speech>

He is a very busy man and we appreciate getting time with him.  His response was not negative and the business case has been presented to him.  He said he wanted to make it happen, but no commitment was given to say it would happen.  Of course, he must review the business case.</p></speech>

Our concern is what the best care is for our children.  We are also concerned for any recipient of a cochlear implant in Ireland, because that is linked to what we are discussing here.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked about the business case and the different options.  I do not know the full details as we have not seen the business case.  However, I know many different avenues were discussed and we were asked for our input.  We pointed out that time is of the essence.  The consultants in Beaumont Hospital have committed to do any amount of surgeries per week to clear the backlog.  They want to clear the backlog and they feel uncomfortable that best medical practice, as outlined in the medical guidelines, is not being carried out.  There are various options, such as travel and time.  The issue of time is significant, particularly for children.  Within our campaign group, which is five or six years old now, a number of children are approaching the age where they need to get the implant as soon as possible.  </p><p>  Deputy Naughten asked a question about stem cells.  A question every parent asks is whether this is the best option.  This decision must be based on the information to hand.  Stem cell technology may never get to a point at which it can be offered widely to patients.  Therefore, at the moment, a cochlear implant is the best solution for hearing loss for anybody.  If it is not done within a certain window or timeframe, that opportunity is lost.  </p></speech>

Does it depend on each child?</p></speech>

It depends on each case, but it has been proven that if the hearing nerve is not stimulated within six to seven years - a report issued in the UK this year says four to five years - there is significant loss in benefit of a cochlear implant.  This can range from being able to hear clearly what I am saying now to just hearing a mumbling sound, but not understanding it.  The person is aware there is a sound, but has no understanding of what the sound is.</p></speech>

We are between seven and ten years behind on cochlear implants, so I cannot see stem cell research having an impact.  It is only research currently, but if it produces results and comes into play, I do not see Ireland being the first to take it up.  I believe our children will be well into their 50s before the research produces results that can be taken up.  Therefore, I do not see stem cell research as relevant to our children.  In years to come, if it is the best option and has been fully researched and proven, that is a route deaf children could take.  At the moment, and for the foreseeable future, cochlear implants are the best option available to our children.</p></speech>

As Mr. Kearns mentioned, the auditory hair cells in our kids' ears are damaged.  The research is only being carried out on mice currently and while researchers can grow the hair cells, they cannot stop the growth in them.  Therefore, it is a long way away from even being tested on humans.  We must decide that our children need to hear through both ears now, not in 30 or 40 years.</p></speech>

As recently as April this year, a UK study underlined the benefit of a bilateral programme.  The issue that this is a piece of technology that can break down was raised.  Perhaps Ms Cairns will say a few words on that.</p></speech>

He was left as he was for two years and made no progress and they decided to remove it.  I found the hardest decision I had to make was to agree to change the implant, but it was not.  His surgery went well and was so much easier than the first time.  However, Billy then had to wait from four to five weeks for the swelling to reduce before his implant could be switched on.  That was the hardest part.  I had to telephone Beaumont after two and a half weeks to plead for it to be switched back on.  He went from being a happy child who played with his toys to one who signed to me they were broken and became aggressive.  I put him back into preschool, thinking that would improve his behaviour, but the staff were crying and telling me he was a different child and was lashing out at others.</p><p>  When our children had their first implant, they were profoundly deaf and knew no different.  The process was harder on the parents.  However, Billy had been profoundly deaf, then had an implant and had hearing, and then his implant was removed.  I could not explain that to him.  If he was a normal child, I could tell him he could have it back, but it was impossible to explain to him that he had to wait three more weeks.  That was the hardest thing for me.  If he had had his second ear done, he would not have had to return to silence for that time.  We do not realise how much these children rely on their implant until it is taken away.  I would not like anybody else to go through what we did.</p></speech>

One of the options is to travel to the UK.  If it comes down to time - for example, if my child is five and I am told it will be five years before he gets his implant - there is no question that I will travel in order to get it sooner.  However, this is not ideal.  All of us here would say we would prefer to have it done in Ireland.  Having one ear treated in Ireland and another treated in another jurisdiction raises issues.  Tuning is one of the major issues, particularly if one implant centre is responsible for one implant and another responsible for the second.  There is also an issue with parents having to travel to both centres, particularly considering the number of days they need to do so.  That is an enormous task but it has been done.  Parents have done this privately but it is not ideal.</p></speech>

The costs of all of these will be examined and based on the pros and cons, one of the business plans will be selected, one that will suit both the hospital and the HSE funding-wise.  We must take into account that if they provide options for us to travel and if this would make it easier for the backlog to be cleared so that the simultaneous programme can be started and got working properly, we are all willing to make the sacrifice and travel, but obviously that is not the best option for us.</p></speech>

Everyone here is very supportive of their cause.  Given that our nearest neighbours all tend to use bilateral cochlear implants, the question of best practice surely arises in terms of how medical equipment is procured and what medical equipment is provided.  How does the HSE ensure it is in line with international best practice?  Has any calculation been made on the long-term cost to the State of assisting people with impaired hearing in terms of additional services, supports and assistance - resources that might be avoided were bilateral cochlear implants provided at a young age?</p></speech>

It is a mechanical device, just like an iPod or whatever, and so these things break down eventually.  There is no mechanical device in the home that will not break down.</p></speech>

Perhaps this is on the fringe, but I think I can recall some kind of opposition to the idea of cochlear implants, and not one that I would have bought into at the time.  It was more like a quasi-political opposition by folks in the hearing-impaired community.  I thought at the time that it was a very unwise line to be following.  Has that been sorted out?</p><p>  One of the things which reduces waiting lists in the HSE and in many other health services is private insurance for many patients.

The backlog is made up solely of sequential implantation cases, so that is people who have already received an implant.  The usual cycle from the point of identification of hearing loss to the point of implant is about one year.  During that year there is a long assessment process.  An implant is a once-off procedure and an irreversible surgery.  The consultants have to be 100% sure that the child's hearing loss is permanent, is severe to profound, and that the child will not gain enough benefits from hearing aids to give them the ability to speak.  The assessment takes nine months.</p></speech>

There is a high rate of depression among deaf children and deaf adults because they are socially excluded.  Our children could be socially excluded if they cannot speak to people in a work environment, and we do not want that to arise.  This will save the State a lot of money eventually.</p></speech>

We are looking for the right care to be provided by the State.  Money is irrelevant for us.  It is not a number.  It is a standard of care that needs to be addressed.  I understand that there are financial constraints, especially in the current climate, but if we review the business case, I do not think the number is outlandish.  It is a very achievable goal.  We should not be committed to a certain number.  It is all about the care.</p></speech>

As Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in said, as a committee we do not normally meet delegations but in this case, given the exceptional situation and the importance of the matter we are discussing, we decided to hold this special meeting on the issue, which happened to coincide with the delegation's meeting with the Minister.  We hope it will bear fruit for its campaign.  It has our support and the committee will advocate for it on a cross-party basis with the Minister, the Department and the HSE.</p></speech>
