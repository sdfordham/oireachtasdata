Agreed.  On matters arising, the note circulated to members last night outlined the options available to us to examine the issue of public sector allowances in the short timeframe between now and the budget.  The proposal is that the committee should concentrate on the big allowances in terms of cost and application.  It is suggested that in order to get a balanced view of these payments the committee should give the trade union movement an opportunity to make a presentation and that in this context, the ICTU be invited to make a presentation.  We could start with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and use the information provided in the business cases, together with information supplied by Accounting Officers, to stress-test the main allowances, covering the bulk of the figure of &euro;1.4 billion.  A timeframe is suggested that would see a report published two weeks from the budget.  The committee will appoint a rapporteur to assist members in dealing with this issue in the light of the massive amount of paperwork that will be involved.  We agreed to this proposal last week.  Is the committee happy to proceed on the basis of this outline proposal?</p></speech>

The Chairman stated it was important to bring in the ICTU for this reason.  Will one appearance by the ICTU, given the numerous sittings planned, allow for the level of balance and variety of opinion required to make for a successful investigation?  By the time the ICTU appears before us, our hearing with the Department of Education and Skills, which acounts for the highest expenditure, will have taken place almost a fortnight before.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-04a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Clerk to the Committee" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012100400003#B01500"><p>This is just an indicative plan.  If members want to invite the ICTU before we begin to examine the allowances, that is a matter for the committee to decide.  We have not yet approached the Departments to agree to the dates, but we will be outlining our timeframe to them.  Would Deputy Paschal Donohoe prefer to bring in the ICTU beforehand?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-04a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012100400003#B01600"><p>I am simply asking the question.  In respect of the hearing on the figure of &euro;600 million spent in the education sector, should we not get the perspective of employees as part of that session?  Similarly in the case of the Defence Forces, should the representative group which issued a statement this week on allowances be included in that session?</p></speech>

The purpose in setting out the timetable is to obtain these views in order that we can change or reconstruct the timetable for it to be as inclusive as possible, given the time constraints involved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-04a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012100400003#B01800"><p>I am asking whether we can be inclusive in a different and better way.  It would be a pity if, after investing a lot of time in this process, some group complains it never had the chance to express their points of view.  Allowing the collective body to appear at only one session in the middle of our investigation to present its views might mean that those affected by our hearings will ask at the end when are they going to be given an opportunity to contribute.  Perhaps we might consider including representatives of the unions in each of our sessions in order that they can make their case and we can ask them questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-04a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012100400003#B01900"><p>That sounds like a good idea.</p></speech>

In regard to logistics, it appears that our hearings will take place over a period of 11 days.  For how long is it proposed that we should sit on each of these days?  Our hearings have to be structured and inclusive.  The briefing by the Minister will use up one day, while our private meetings will use up two.  We will have only five days of public hearings.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-04a.31" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1060" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012100400003#B02600"><p>I am not proposing anything.  I am asking about the logistics in terms of the number of hours we will sit.  Will we sit all day?  It is important that we be inclusive, as the time period involved is relatively short.</p> <p>I seek information on the logistics.  While I obviously will defer to the other committee members, I think it should be intensive and over a short period.  It should be perceived that the committee is doing a substantial body of work.  Obviously, members have other issues to which they must attend but by the time the Department of Education and Skills appears before the committee, members should be getting down to the nitty-gritty.  By that stage, they probably should have dispensed with some of the elements as being core and they then should be in a position to do the body of work on those issues that are up for discussion.  Has consideration been given to how long the committee will sit on any one day?  Second, as Deputy Donohoe noted, consideration should be given to the type of witnesses to appear before the committee.  My inclination is it should be very intensive and over a short time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-04a.33" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012100400004#C00200"><p>The views expressed this morning can be taken into account in terms of how these meetings can be set up.  As to how long we sit or how long it takes, it will depend on the witnesses, the volume of information and the depth of the discussions.  However, bearing in mind members' remarks this morning, we can adjust the schedule and can deal with the question of being as inclusive as possible.  We can factor that into the schedule.  Arising from our previous meeting, we must also include the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission because we need to hear from it.  While I will ask the clerk to look at it again, this is how it will work in principle.  As for the other aspects we have discussed, such as the hours, what it will entail and how the meeting and hearing itself will pan out, we can discuss them again as we build on the work the clerk has done to date.</p></speech>

Deputy Donohoe touched on the point that the representatives of Garda members and Defence Forces personnel are not covered by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and consequently must appear separately.  Second, I believe the committee should meet in the week the D&aacute;il is not scheduled to sit because I believe members must finish their work considerably more than a week earlier as, in truth, I believe the Estimates will have gone to the Bundestag, through the troika, before Wednesday, 21 November.  There is no point in members discussing something here during the last week in November when they might be reading about it a week earlier through the European press.  If members seek to have an input into the forthcoming budget and Estimates process, they will need to have completed their work by 14 November.  I suggest they should make up that week by sitting once or twice in the week in which the D&aacute;il is not scheduled to sit.</p></speech>

The purpose of this exercise this morning was to elicit members' views and because the D&aacute;il is not scheduled to sit, we simply factored that in.</p></speech>

This committee has received a lot of correspondence on this issue and I note that, in one letter recently received, the correspondent expresses the belief this committee's handling of the correspondent's case should be investigated by the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, as the correspondent considers the committee has gone out of its way to cover up for misappropriation and, as they term it, "inappropriation" of citizens' money.  This allegation has been made against this committee and I believe members now have no option other than to forward the committee's entire file of all correspondence it has received to the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation in light of what has been written.  The committee should let that organisation examine it because it is an allegation of fraud.</p></speech>

I believe we should put it down as a specific item in respect of the Department itself in order that we can deal with the expenditure, the questions raised and the attitude of the Department to that expenditure.  It is important not to lose sight of it.</p><p>  The second item that concerns me is the school transport system and the number of complaints I receive regarding that system and the cost thereof.  I note the recent allocation by the Government to Bus &Eacute;ireann of &euro;32 million.  How do we audit the actual expenditure of those funds as distinct from their allocation from the Department to Bus &Eacute;ireann.  How do we know for what it is being spent?  In other words, have the accounts of either Bus &Eacute;ireann or Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann been examined to the extent that the waste and so on has been removed and there is a need for this money or are we simply giving the aforementioned companies the money?  Who accounts for it and how does it come before this committee?</p></speech>

Under an agreement between the Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann, a methodology is used to calculate the amount due.  This system has been in place since the 1970s.  I am not aware that it has been updated since.  I was planning to look at the methodology for it.  As I understand it, the calculations are audited.  The payments are based on a report prepared by independent auditors and submitted to the Department.  I am not aware of the details of the recent payment.  I do not know whether it was a stage payment in amounts provided for, or whether it was an additional payment.</p></speech>

I am concerned about whether the accounts have been examined to the extent that the company is running efficiently and well.  Is the State exposed to these payments being made when the company gets into trouble or its accounts are in difficulty?  Is it the case that in such circumstances, the money is just asked for?  How is the money actually accounted for?  How do we know what the company is doing with the money?  Is it going into the school transport system or the general public transport system?  Is it distorting the market for the independent operators?  Are Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Bus &Eacute;ireann being given an unfair advantage when they are given this money?  A range of issues needs to be raised in this respect.  There is public concern about it.  We should be taking an interest in it, as the moneys involved are substantial.</p></speech>

If a grant is given to a body for general purposes, it may form part of its funding and there may be a difficulty in following this precise amount of money to an end purpose.  If a specific grant of &euro;100 million is provided for a capital project, however, one would be expect it to be spent on that project.  It is a little more difficult to follow a grant provided for general purposes by way of an audit trail.</p></speech>

What happens in terms of the questions raised by Deputy Shane Ross?  It is a concern.  A document that I do not have to hand brought my attention to the purchase for $9 million of carriages which were later not used.  When such issues come to our attention, we need to be able to get answers.  I suggest that in addition to what Mr. McCarthy is going to do, we should send a transcript of the proceedings of this meeting to the Accounting Officer in the Department and ask for an overview from that side also.  That would enable us to pursue the matter, if necessary.</p><p>  Over a number of meetings a number of Deputies mentioned the &euro;91 million spent at Poolbeg to date.  The committee has not yet received the type of report on this matter that I would have expected from the Department.  When we asked for such a report, we called for the matter to be taken up by the Accounting Officer and the local government auditors.  I remind the Accounting Officer that a commitment was given that this would happen.  We are expecting a report and concerned about the &euro;91 million figure.  We require explanations in this regard.  That reflects the views of a number of members of the committee who raised the matter.</p></speech>

I think the matter falls directly within the remit of the committee.  It is our job to ensure taxpayers' money is spent in the manner in which it was expected to be spent.  Even though approximately &euro;7 billion in taxpayers' money has been given to AIB for the purposes of mortgage write-downs, according to figures in the public domain, we are seeing a second increase of this nature.  Ideally, we would bring in those involved, but I am conscious of the demands of our work programme.  Can we write to the Secretary General of the Department of Finance to get clarity on the exact purpose of the money given to AIB?  Was a specific amount provided for the write-down of mortgages?  If so, has that money been used?</p> <p>It is not too dissimilar from the CIE situation.  I have a deep suspicion, as I think all mortgage holders do, that what has happened is that the money that was given for the purpose of writing down mortgages has just been put into a black hole within AIB and it now continues to hike up the variable interest rate.  Can we try to get some clarity on this?  We had a lengthy discussion with the Secretary General of the Department of Finance, but there is no clarity in the minds of the public as to the use to which this money has been put.  It is taxpayers' money.</p></speech>

It is also the primary State funding authority for the universities, institutes of technology and certain other designated higher education institutions.  The authority's expenditure and disbursements to higher education institutions in 2011 amounted to a total of &euro;1.37 billion.  Recurrent grants to institutions accounted for &euro;1.2 billion, or approximately 88% of the total expenditure.  Other significant distributions related to capital grants of some &euro;48 million and research grants amounting to &euro;95 million.  It should be noted that the Department of Education and Skills also disburses capital grants to the institutes of technology.</p><p>  The HEA received a clear audit opinion in respect of the 2011 financial statements.  However, the certificate draws attention to the existence of balances held in the pension control accounts in five of the universities, which they treat as liabilities due to the authority.  The background to the accounts is dealt with in the special report.</p><p>  The pension control balances contribute to the large cash balances of over &euro;700 million held by the institutions, at the end of the academic year 2011, in commercial bank accounts, which are dealt with in the special report.  It concludes that it may be worthwhile reviewing the State's wider treasury management policy and considering the merits of providing for a sweeping-up of surplus funding in third level institutions and other State bodies.  The HEA informed us that it was taking steps to slow the flow of funding to the institutions around the year end.  Last week, Deputy Fleming asked if we could get an update to 2012.  The end of year for the universities was 30 September, so it was not feasible to have something ready for the Deputy.  However, I will provide an update as soon as possible.</p><p>  Control over remuneration levels and employee numbers are matters shared between the authority and the Department.  Both were involved in oversight of the employment control framework for the higher education sector introduced in July 2009 and updated on a number of occasions thereafter.  Overall, the restrictions resulted in a reduction in staff numbers within the third level education sector by an estimated 7.3% between the end of 2008 and the end of 2010.  Over the same period, full-time student numbers increased by an estimated 10.5%.  Only one of the institutions concerned, Trinity College Dublin, was identified as not having kept within the terms of the framework.</p><p>  Rates of remuneration of staff of universities are subject to the approval of the Minister under the terms of the Universities Act 1997.  The fact that there were payments in excess of the approved levels for many senior staff was reported upon in an earlier special report.  I outlined last week the exercise undertaken by the Department and the HEA to identify the amounts involved over the period June 2005 to February 2011, to provide them with the basis for deciding what action to take on recoupment.</p> <p>A validation procedure undertaken by staff in my office found that the excess payments amounted to a total of the order of &euro;8 million but there were some cases where there was uncertainty or dispute about the approved level of remuneration.  I understand the chief executive of the authority has provided the committee with an update on the final amounts in respect of which recoupment action is proposed.  </p><p> Another issue raised in the report related to the non-consolidation in the annual financial statements of the results of subsidiary companies of some institutes of technology.  This reduces the comparability of accounts across the sector.  The HEA has indicated that all institutes that have subsidiaries will be required to prepare consolidated financial statements for financial years from 2012-13 on.  The report also drew attention to a number of situations where subsidiaries were in receipt of significant funding from their parent institutions to meet accumulated deficits and where there were transfers from institutions to fundraising foundations, which are accounted for as stand-alone entities whose results are not consolidated.  The report noted that the HEA has been engaged in updating the codes of governance for higher education bodies.  We understand that the codes will include revised provisions in respect of the governance of subsidiaries.  Changes in the code may also be relevant in respect of other matters reported on in the special report, such as remuneration of presidents of institutions and expenses payments.</p></speech>

In considering the report and in preparing for our meeting today with the committee, two principal considerations were uppermost in our minds.  First, the collective responsibility of higher education institutions and relevant Government departments and agencies to secure maximum return for State investment in higher education and, second, the importance of positioning the sector to make the maximum contribution possible to economic recovery and future growth.</p><p>  We have provided a detailed brief to the committee.  It may be somewhat long but we felt that the issues required the fullest background and explanation and I hope the brief has achieved that.  I do not intend to deal with the issues in any great detail in this opening statement but in the interests of ensuring the best use of time, I will focus on three areas in particular.  Obviously, I and my colleagues are available to answer any questions members of the committee may have.  </p><p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General has raised issues relating to the treatment of cash balances and to treasury management in the institutions.  Specifically, the report asks whether there is a case for reviewing the State's wider treasury management policy.  The report also noted that any such review would need to take account of the return to the institutions, the impact on the banking system, as well as the level of Government borrowing.  The HEA is entirely open to such a review.  It is relevant to note that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is considering the issue of treasury management generally.  In addition, it is also relevant for the committee to note that in respect of the higher education sector, the HEA met the National Treasury Management Agency in February of this year to discuss whether there are immediate opportunities for NTMA to manage cash balances for the institutions.  Arising from that meeting it was clear that the existing arrangements of higher education institutions are significantly better than those which the NTMA would be able to offer.  However, it is important to note that we will keep the situation under review as will the institutions themselves, in order to ensure that if opportunities arise or circumstances change, then these are exploited.</p><p>  More generally, I would like to comment on the issue of the level of cash balances in the sector.  I wish to emphasise that cash balances are not equivalent to surpluses and do not in any sense imply an over-funded system.  The balances represent cash holdings of the institutions at a point in time, arising from a variety of sources.  We have set that out in more detail in our background briefing.  As it happens, the date on which the Comptroller and Auditor General's report is based is the time when cash balances are particularly high, that is, September.  Our own analysis shows that much of the cash in place is committed against current and future liabilities.  Examples would include moneys that are ring-fenced for requirements such as pension liabilities, as mentioned by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Another example is funds put aside to meet future liabilities from section 843 developments, where capital projects were undertaken in partnership with private developers, on the basis that the institutions would purchase assets at a specified future time.  In addition, I would ask the committee to have regard for the fact that higher education institutions, as complex organisations, need to hold certain levels of cash to ensure that salaries and other liabilities are met in a timely way and that opportunities that arise can be exploited.  The provision of upfront funding for research activity is also essential.  </p><p>  As a general rule, the advice to the HEA from an expert group on the issue was to the effect that up to 60 days worth of cash is necessary to enable higher education institutions to operate effectively and prudently.  The committee should also note that we are not just discussing cash balances that arise from public funds.  Some 40% or thereabouts of the income of higher education institutions comes from non-Exchequer sources, a very positive situation which is very much to be encouraged.  The HEA has been alert to excessive cash balances.  To address the situation in so far as funds allocated by the HEA are concerned, we have slowed down funding transfers to higher education institutions to take account of cash flows by rescheduling core grant and fee payments and having much stricter payment arrangements for PRTLI projects.  Arrangements have also been put in place to facilitate the payment of the student contribution in two instalments.  These have all reduced the amount of cash in the system at any one time and will have an ongoing impact in that regard.  We will continue to monitor the situation and in addition, it is worth noting that the Department of Education and Skills and the HEA are considering the issue of the payment of research funding in advance and how that can be dealt with in the context of cash balances.  This will require consultation with a range of government agencies and Departments.</p><p>  I will now move on to the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General in relation to Waterford Institute of Technology.  The report notes that there were failures of control in certain aspects of the operation of the institute, specifically in the office of president.  The report also notes that the institute has recognised these failures and put in place new control mechanisms to address this.  The HEA agrees fully with the conclusions of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is very disappointing when failures of this kind are identified, to say the least.  On the other hand, the fact that they are identified demonstrates that, taken together, the full suite of control and accountability measures do work to identify and remedy failures.  Failures of this kind also prompt the accountable bodies - the governing bodies and the HEA for instance - to look again at how systems can be revised and reformed.  Apart from the cost of the failures themselves, a greater cost would be that we fail to learn the lessons when these situations arise.  </p><p>  In response to the situation in Waterford Institute of Technology, the HEA contacted all the other institutes to ensure that the appropriate controls, so deficient - and identified as being deficient - in Waterford, were in place and fully operational.  We understand that the detailed arrangements vary across the institutes, but I can assure the committee that we are satisfied that appropriate controls are now in place.  We are considering whether there would be value in requiring a consistent approach across the entire system and whether that would be practical.  The committee should also note that such measures are in place within an accountability and control environment that includes legislative responsibilities, accountability to this committee, internal audit arrangements, audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General, as well as an agreed code of governance which sets out a comprehensive approach to the treatment of issues such as financial controls, risk management, accountability and transparency.  Robust processes and systems combined with constant vigilance, regular reviews of processes and procedures and prompt reaction to any failures are key components of an effective accountability and control system.  </p><p>  The committee has, at a previous meeting, dealt in detail with the issue of unauthorised allowances.  I hope today that I can assure members that the matter has been dealt with in a satisfactory way.  Allowances have stopped, a recurrence of such payments will not arise and the matter has been brought to a conclusion in a way that underlines the seriousness with which both the HEA and the Department and Skills view the issue, without further jeopardising a difficult funding situation in the universities or damaging the quality of the student experience.</p></speech>

Your opening statement almost ignores the detail of what happened in Waterford Institute of Technology and I am somewhat taken aback by that.  Did you take the time to review any of the detail of our meeting of last week?  Are you not absolutely shocked by the type of expenditure by the president's office, as explained to us last week and as detailed in the various reports which were presented to the committee?</p><p>  In your opening statement, Mr. Boland, you said "It is very disappointing when failures of this kind are identified".  </p> <p>You further stated that the full suite of control and accountability measures work to identify and remedy failures.  However, it took ten years for them to work.  This went on for ten years.  What was taking place in the Higher Education Authority such that you did not find them?  What was taking place in the HEA such that it's oversight of Waterford Institute of Technology did not work?  Did the HEA examine the expenditure?  Did the HEA examine the infamous flight from Waterford to Dublin?  Can the HEA explain what the consultant was working on with the Department of Education and Skills, why he was in WIT and why was it was necessary to fly him or to transport him in that way from Waterford to Dublin?  What action has the HEA taken in respect of WIT?  What meetings have taken place with WIT to investigate these figures?</p><p> In the opening statement you said that robust processes and systems combined with constant vigilance and regular reviews of processes and procedures as well as a prompt reaction to any failures were key components of an effective accountability and control system.  Do you accept that the HEA had none of these over ten years?  Will you explain to the committee how this happened in WIT?</p><p> Another thing that surprises me is the consistent approach of which you speak.  I would have expected this to be the norm in the way the HEA examines the spend in each of the universities or institutes and that the HEA would insist on it.  This is taxpayers' money.  It is a scarce resource and I would expect a better response in terms of controls from now on and a better explanation of what happened in the past as well.</p></speech>

Naturally, I read the transcript of the of the proceedings last week.  I cannot say I was shocked because we already knew the details.  We already knew these details because upon the matter becoming public through a freedom of information request we wrote to the institute of technology and asked for details and for the institute to carry out a thorough inquiry into what the various allegations related to.

It was immediately after the freedom of information request, which was submitted in March.  On 17 May 2011 we wrote to Waterford Institute of Technology asking for details of the situation.  The institute reported to us in July and we found the report to be unsatisfactory.  We had asked WIT for details relating to several questions.  We asked whether any of the expenditure was used for purposes other than that of the institute; whether any of the expenditure fell outside normal processes for expenditure control, including tendering; whether, if any such expenditure did occur, the system of financial control and review in the institute allowed such expenditure to occur; about the specific controls in place in respect of expenditure incurred by the office of the president; whether any appropriate measures have been taken to improve systems of internal control; and about other actions that the governing body proposed to take in this matter.</p><p>  We received a report, often referred to as the first Deloitte report, in response to these issues.  We took the view that the report did not deal with a range of issues in sufficient detail.  As a result of several meetings and telephone conversations with the authorities in the institute a second report was commissioned and, I understand, is more or less complete now but its publication has been delayed for legal reasons.  However, we have asked the institution to press forward with the publication of the report and with making that report available to the HEA and the Department unless there are specific legal reasons why this cannot be done.  We moved quickly to establish the nature and extent of the problem.  In particular we were keen to ensure that the institute moved rapidly towards putting in place the type of controls, specifically in respect of the office of president, which were necessary.  On that point we sought to respond reasonably quickly.</p><p>  The question the chairman raised about what the HEA did and why this happened or was allowed to happen over ten years is a little more difficult to answer, but I do not mean that in an evasive way.  The HEA is part of a system of accountability and control in respect of public funding and expenditure in the higher education system.  The system includes the institutions and the chief officer and the governing bodies have specific functions under legislation.  The system includes a code of governance and deals with issues relating to internal audit committees and the way in which these committees interact with the governing body of the institutes to ensure an accountability culture in each of the institutes.  It is at this level that the detail of issues arise in respect of accountability.  The Higher Education Authority has a significant role to ensure appropriate procedures and processes are in place in institutions and that they work.  It keeps the situation under review and develops alternative solutions when and if difficulties are identified.  The HEA has put in place a code of governance for the institutes and the universities which is altogether consistent with the code of governance for State agencies.  We review the accounts of the institutions on an annual basis and there are a range of other audits and account reviews that takes place.  Apart from the institutional responsibilities and those of the HEA there are responsibilities for the Comptroller and Auditor General and this committee.</p><p>  Given our mandate and resources, amounting to some 58 staff, it is not practical for the HEA, to be able to interrogate the detail of the accounts of institutions.  That is, properly, a function of the chief officer, who is the accountable person, and the governing body along with their combined internal control procedures.  It would be wrong for the HEA to try to take to itself the capacity to do that work.  The HEA would be unable to do it and we would be taking on a responsibility that ultimately we could not deliver on.  Further, we would be absolving the institutions and the management of the institutions from their statutory and fiduciary responsibilities for the moneys they receive.</p><p>  One objective of the HEA is to create a climate of accountability in the institutions whereby they understand that they are accountable first and foremost.  It is not possible for an agency such as the HEA to surface the type of detail that arose in this case.  However, it is possible and it is our responsibility when the need arises to act as quickly as possible to ensure that whatever required systems reforms are carried out.</p></speech>

The HEA audit committee signed off on the accounts and the WIT governing body signed off on the accounts.  The only person to raise it was Mr. McFeely.  He was here last week.  It surprises me that the HEA did not uncover some of the difficulties in WIT during the course of the past ten years.  You have referred to accountability and transparency and a culture of audit and so on but that did not exist in WIT.  We refer to the office of the president of WIT as part of this spend.  I understand the figures used last week were between &euro;30,000 and &euro;165,000.</p> <p>Surely, that was a line in the accounts that would have startled anyone with an eye for that kind of expenditure. </p></speech>

Surely a question should been asked about it, but it was not raised.  I do not expect the HEA to know every single detail and to get down to that level of management.  I do, however, expect it to take its oversight role so seriously that WIT understands clearly what is expected of it.  It is clear from this ten year period that management completely ignored any effort by the HEA, if an effort was made, to get it to perform properly.</p><p>  Rather than refer to the single department or president, have you looked at the audit committee, the governing body, the role of Mr. McFeely and the attempt he made to advise on some of the errors that were going on or the spend that was being made, and what was the outcome of that inquiry? </p><p>  I asked you about specific spend relating to that flight, for example.  It is extraordinary that someone would have signed off on transport of that kind and at that level of cost.  I believe the figure was &euro;4,200.  Did you investigate that?  What was the consultant working on that caused him to be in Waterford and caused this transport to be provided to get him back to Dublin?  I understand he did not ask for it but that it was provided.  </p><p>  This committee has a right to know that in order to understand what exactly was going on and where and who fell down in the process, because someone did, indeed, fall down.  I remind you that a ten year period had elapsed.  When you wrote on 17 May 2011, a ten year period had gone by before anything was uncovered.  A substantial amount of money is involved, from &euro;30,000 to &euro;635,000.</p></speech>

I fully anticipated the question and I hope to help the committee as best I can in all of these issues.</p><p>  It is somewhat overstating the situation to say that for ten years the system of control and accountability in Waterford Institute of Technology had broken down or did not exist.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's office has said WIT is, by and large, a well-run organisation.  There can be no question but that there was a breakdown of accountability and control in respect of one area of expenditure.  One can call that disappointing or shocking, but it certainly should not have occurred.   </p><p>  Without wishing to limit its importance, no system of control can guarantee against human failure, or human ingenuity to get around the controls.  In the first instance, the job of an institute of technology is to ensure that the processes are as foolproof as possible and that they are regularly reviewed.  It is our job to ensure that is happening.  It is said we waited ten years.  In fairness to the HEA, we did not know this was happening, nor could we have known, until April or May 2011.  That is the reality in which we are operating.</p><p>  With regard to Dr. Port, I understand that, as of yesterday, there is new information on that situation.  As far as I can recall, the HEA knew nothing about the presence, or not, of Dr. Port in Waterford.  We knew he had been appointed by the Department of Education and Science to do a review of issues regarding the application for university status.  We knew nothing, however, of his comings and goings and had no involvement in them.  That is as much as we were involved in it.  Obviously, we had no knowledge at all of the chartering of private jets to bring him to meetings.</p><p>  I have been given a note relating to the flights which, if I may, I will read into the record.<blockquote>During the course of the institute's meeting with the Public Accounts Committee on Thursday 27 September, the institute's response relied upon the information included in the Deloitte report.  This report stated, based on clarification by the former president, that this transaction related to the charter of a plane to transport a visitor from Waterford to Dublin.  This view has been further reinforced by the statement of the former chairman on 28 September 2012, in which he confirmed the plane was chartered to fly Dr. Jim Port from Waterford to Dublin and stated that, &quot;he was comfortable authorising and, indeed, organising it at the time&quot;.  <br /><br />  Based upon your query [that is the query of this committee] we have further investigated the matter.  The following has come to light.  An invoice for the sum of &euro;4,200 was approved for payment by both the former president and the former chairman.  The invoice refers to a flight on 29 June 2007, which is at odds with the timing of the trip made by Dr. Port in March 2007.  The narrative on the invoice states that it related to the hire of aircraft and pilot for a return flight from Filton, England, to Dublin, including all landing and handling charges at Filton airport and Dublin Airport.  When the invoice was presented for payment the institute's finance office queried this transaction in relation to origin, cost and detail.  The president's office confirmed that it was in order to pay.  <br /><br />  Based on the information to hand, it would appear that the invoice did not relate to a trip from Waterford to Dublin, but a different trip.  The institute is currently investigating this matter further and has been in contact with representatives of the airline involved and is awaiting their response.  The invoice for the Waterford to Dublin flight in March 2007 amounted to &euro;769.56.  Until further information can be obtained in relation to both invoices, only the former president and the former chair can fully clarify the matter.</blockquote></p></speech>

In February 2007, the Minister appointed Dr. Jim Port, of JM Consulting, to conduct a preliminary examination of the application, having regard, first, to the national strategy for the development of Irish higher education, second, to implications for regional development in the south east in the context of the national strategy and, third, to any likely implications for the overall structure of higher education in Ireland.  Dr. Port submitted his report to the Department on 31 July 2007, we published it in February 2008 and it is available on the Department's website.</p><p>  That was his particular role.  Part of his undertaking of that role was a visit to WIT to meet various stakeholders.  We understand he was given the agenda for whom he was to meet during that visit by the officers of WIT.  We have tried to contact Dr. Port since the last meeting of the PAC and we have not been able to do so.  We are working, therefore, on the basis of understandings, what we have on the files and whatever information our own officers have.</p> <p>However, we will be seeking to speak further to Dr. Port.  I understand that Waterford Institute of Technology has also been seeking to speak to him.  The Department of Education and Skills - at the time known as the Department of Education and Science - paid the invoices provided by Dr. Port for all his travel to and from Bristol of which the Department was aware.  This included his travel to Waterford for the visit which was organised by WIT.  The Department was not aware that there was any private transport involved.  As a result of examining the agenda for the visit, there was more than just Dr. Port in Waterford at one time of the day and in Dublin at a later time in the day.  Unless different transport was involved, the president and the chair of WIT could well have been transported as well.  Because we have not spoken to Dr. Port, we do not know who may or may not have been on the flight.  We were not aware of the privately organised flight.  From what we understand, Filton in England is close to where Dr. Port lives.  He would have had a series of meetings during the preparation and finalisation of his report.</p><p> We were aware that a meeting was being arranged with the then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern.  Our files indicate that the Department did not know.  We understand that Waterford was seeking to arrange this meeting and we are not sure whether this was at president level or at governing body level.  We know from our files that on 26 June, Dr. Port told us the meeting was still arranged.  We learned either the day before or the morning of the meeting - we are not quite sure because we have been unable to contact Dr. Port - that the meeting was going ahead.  We sent some briefing material to the Taoiseach for the meeting.  I spoke to the assistant secretary general involved.  She does not recall whether it was just prior to the meeting or subsequently that she would have learned there had been a privately acquired aircraft involved in transporting Dr. Port.  It would not have occurred to us that it had been organised or paid for by WIT.  We were working on the understanding that it was privately provided.  We did not pay any travel and subsistence for Dr. Port for the meeting on 29 June.</p><p> The statement which Mr. Boland read to the committee a few minutes ago is a briefing note which, we understand, WIT provided to the Comptroller and Auditor General late yesterday.  The Department was informed by WIT two days ago about the various invoices.  We asked for details which were provided.  Because we have been unable to contact Dr. Port, we have been unable to verify the details from his point of view.  However, he would not have been involved in requesting flights as these would have been organised on his behalf.</p></speech>

I have not spoken to Deloitte &amp;amp; Touche but one of the points that was made in their report, as I recall, is the speed at which they carried out the particular piece of work.  They regarded it as a preliminary - I will not say, quick and dirty - but rather a preliminary review of the expenditure and done under pressure of time and that this may or may not explain this issue.</p></speech>

I do not care what time pressure they were under.  They had a job to do.  They should have forensically examined the matter and this expenditure should have come to light.  That is my view.</p></speech>

If the attitude was one of zero tolerance for this kind of expenditure, then we might not be here today.  However, we are here.  It is surprising that as we ask simple questions, we are discovering the existence of further flights and further costs.  That is the difficulty for this committee in this hearing.  We are not getting the full facts upfront, either from WIT or by way of Deloitte &amp;amp; Touche which was paid &euro;25,600 and which it seems will run up a tab of &euro;64,000.  Who was the chairman of the governing body of WIT in 2007?</p></speech>

I think it was one of the Deputies who raised the question.  It was by reference to the Deloitte report, which states that Bell Airways "charter of a plane to transport a visitor from Waterford to Dublin in 2007" cost &euro;4,200.  After the meeting I asked to see the invoice in respect of that expenditure.  The invoice that was produced relates to a flight in June of that year.  We drew that fact to the attention of WIT.  I do not believe that the president understood last week that there were a number of flights.  It was in the context of responding to us, when we queried the invoice for the June flight - which involves an amount of &euro;4,200 - that the institute discovered that there was an earlier flight as well.  That is what kicked matters off.  At the meeting, the president did not know there was a second flight.</p></speech>

So what happened is that the representatives from WIT informed the committee about one flight and they then presented an invoice to the Comptroller and Auditor General's office.

We understand from WIT that it was the former president who confirmed that the invoice which turned out to be for the June flights was for a March flight.  We understand that this is why the initial mix-up happened.  In addition, the former chairman, in a statement which was issued publicly on Thursday of last week, confirmed it was that flight.  I think there was a misunderstanding around that issue.  WIT only found the invoice for the March flight yesterday afternoon.</p></speech>

I refer to the fact that the invoices relating to the president of an institute of technology hiring a private jet were mixed up.  I reiterate that this beggars belief.  At our previous meeting, those present stated that they had got to the bottom of what was going on and that everything had been flushed out.  However, we have now discovered that there was a second flight - which gave rise to an additional cost - and that this was organised and paid for by the same person.  Information relating to this flight did not arise on foot of last week's testimony but - I do not doubt the bona fides of anyone across the table from me in this regard - it has emerged at this meeting as a result of questions asked by members.  In addition, information relating to this matter was not presented to the committee.</p></speech>

As part of the work Dr. Port was undertaking coming to a conclusion, the Taoiseach, we understand, wished to be briefed about the outcome and about where the report was going.  The status of Waterford Institute of Technology was a major political issue, particularly in the context of what this report would say.  We understand that the meeting was being arranged by Waterford Institute of Technology at a senior level or at governing body level.  We do not know the precise date.  We know when the meeting took place but from our records we cannot state when it was confirmed.  We know that on 26 June it had not been arranged because we have an e-mail on our records from Dr. Port saying that he understood it was to take place soon but that no arrangement had been made.

How can he reconcile that with the detail we are hearing today regarding the use of jets and the other expenditure that was described last week?  Does he really believe that the HEA should not have known about it?</p></speech>

The "should not have known" phrase relates to what would be the role of an agency like the HEA and, from a purely practical point of view, it cannot dig down into that level of detail of all the accounts of 30 institutions spending somewhere in the order &euro;2.5 billion.  There has to be an appropriate division of labour and responsibility in this space and the first line of responsibility has to be, and is as a matter of law, with the institution, its chief officer and its governing body.  Of course when the HEA becomes aware of something like this, we have an obligation to act and interrogate to establish what happened and to look at systems and how they failed but we do not have that role in terms of interrogating the detailed accounts of an institution.  We could not have it.  We would require a great deal of resources to do it.  There would be an excessive duplication of effort there.</p></speech>

All of them are good processes.  I do not have the entire detail in front of me but we can provide it for the committee.  The only issue is whether there would be value in having a single process that involves a signature or review by various officials.  That is what I mean.  It is more a question of whether this can be done efficiently and effectively or the extent to which it can be improved.  I have the list of processes here; my colleague, Feargal Costello, has just provided it and we can provide it to the committee rather than going through it but there are different arrangements.</p></speech>

As this is the first time I have seen his statement, I do not think I can comment on it.  I will conclude my questioning for the time being.  Do we have the invoice?</p></speech>

Perhaps we should move on to something else.</p><p>  My first question is for Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; and Mr. Boland.  In February of this year, there was a new memorandum of understanding between the Department of Education and Skills and the Higher Education Authority.  Why was there a new one?  Was there one previously?  If so, what is the difference between the two?  Is this matter in any way influenced by issues that arose in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General?</p></speech>

It is now considered good practice &ndash; I can see why &ndash; for Departments to have clear arrangements with their agencies with regard to their respective roles and responsibilities, and the way in which an agency is to work with the Department.</p></speech>

Some of the issues pertaining to the third level colleges arose in the 2010 audit.</p><p>  Consider the position in which we found ourselves early this year.  Obviously, the Department was fully aware of what was coming through the system prior to the special report of the Comptroller and Auditor General being produced by way of the annual audit and concerns being expressed.  The officials will understand why people would be concerned.  Did the Department just wash its hands of the money the minute it wrote the cheque for &euro;1.2 billion if it had no memorandum of understanding?  I am not suggesting there was anything untoward but I find it unacceptable that a Department, including its Accounting Officer, would hand over &euro;1.2 billion of taxpayers' money to any organisation, be it another State body or otherwise, without a formal written memorandum of understanding outlining who is responsible and the roles and obligations of each party.  Is this normal?  Perhaps the Comptroller and Auditor General might advise us whether there would be a memorandum of understanding between the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the NRA, for example?  I refer to bodies that receive massive sums of taxpayers' money without even a formal agreement in place.  I ask the delegates to comment on that.</p></speech>

We are going through a process of developing various memoranda of understanding of agencies in line with good practice.  It is not that we are questioning the practice of the past and that we did not have very regular and detailed meetings with the HEA and a regular exchange of information.  We felt it would be very helpful to capture the various roles and responsibilities clearly.  For example, the HSE would be operating in the context of the code of governance for State agencies and making regular statements to both the Comptroller and Auditor General and ourselves.  We felt it would be helpful, however, to capture generally an overall picture in the memorandum of understanding.  It would have had regard to all our interaction with the HEA and, in particular, to the system of governance and accountability and the sorts of issues that would regularly arise in audits of the Comptroller and Auditor General or in considerations of the Committee of Public Accounts.  It was not specially aimed at addressing those concerns; it was a general working relationship.  It also arose in part out of the developing situation pertaining to the changing role of the HEA in the national strategy for higher education and its implementation.  We are developing that further and are in discussions with the HEA on its changing role and how it can be best placed to develop that role further in the context of the role the Government envisages for it.</p></speech>

Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; has highlighted to me what I regard to be across-the-board issues, not specific ones.</p><p>  The audited accounts refer to a figure of &euro;1.2 billion in Government funding for 2011.  The figure was the same the year before.  A formal memorandum of understanding was not in place between the Department and the HSE.  Can Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; list the other agencies in respect of which a memorandum of understanding has been completed or is in the process of completion?  I ask that the committee write formally to every Accounting Officer asking for details of those organisations that have a written memorandum of understanding with the Department in circumstances where those organisations are receiving large amounts of funds.</p><p>  I am shocked to hear that, up to some days ago, there was no memorandum of understanding in place governing the &euro;1.2 billion in taxpayers' money.  I am concerned that this is being repeated across other Departments and that they are only now beginning to address the matter.  I would like to know what other gaps were or are in the system and the dates of the agreements.  We need to know the agreements are in place.  While the Department feels a memorandum of understanding is a good idea, it was not acted upon before 28 April this year.  I am not suggesting for a minute there was anything wrong in how the Department did its business but it should understand how we, as members of a public accounts committee, would be unhappy that large amounts of money are going from Accounting Officers without written memoranda of understanding.  Do the delegates understand my point?  They concur with it because-----</p></speech>

The Deputy should not criticise us for improving our relationships and accountability relationships.  These things are developing over time.  To be fair to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, it is considering trying to develop a standard template for these sorts of relationships.  We are slightly ahead of the curve on this matter with the HEA.  As the various accountability mechanisms evolve - the work of this committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General is very helpful in that regard - and as we consider addendums to existing codes of practice and articulating relationships more formally, we will always be adding on the accountability mechanisms.</p> <p>We would not say that we did not have an understood relationship prior to when the MOU was signed, but that this copperfastens it formally.</p></speech>

In addition, the Department would send us a detailed letter each year on the allocation and we would account for that.  The memorandum is more to do with our relationship in terms of governance than it is necessarily about accountability for the &euro;1.2 billion.</p></speech>

The HEA has annual accounts and there are internal financial controls on page one.  I would have expected the Department to have internal financial control mechanisms in place.  I am pleased the system is in place now but I am surprised to hear it has not always been in place.</p><p>  I had a quick glance at the memorandum.  The Department's function, among others, is to hold the HEA to account in the performance of its functions.  Will Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; tell me how it does that?</p><p>  My second question relates to the liaison agreement on page 7.  It states that the Secretary General will meet the CEO and the chairman of the HEA on at least two occasions each year.  I accept there will be other communications as well.  Does that formal process happen and where and when did it happen?</p><p>  We have received the annual financial statement from the HEA, which we are examining today.  We are looking at more than one particular flight, in case someone thought that was the sole concern of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The sum of &euro;1.2 billion is at issue.  I would hate to lose sight of the larger amount while we were talking about other important items.  Is the annual report of the HEA scheduled for publication tomorrow or in the coming days?  I do not refer to the financial statement but to the annual report.</p></speech>

It would have been useful if we could have been given a draft of the report a day or two ago even though it will not be published until tomorrow.  The same issue arose with the National Asset Management Agency earlier in the summer.  It attended a meeting and its annual financial statement was being published a few days after its annual visit.  It would have been helpful to the committee to have read about the HEA&rsquo;s activities for 2011.</p><p>  We must ensure that in future when bodies appear before the committee that we have copies of the most recently published annual report.  If the report dates to some time ago, then we should be furnished with a draft of more up-to-date information.  There might be details in the report tomorrow that we might like to discuss if we were aware of them but we do not have the opportunity.  My point is a general one.</p></speech>

I would like to get a pen picture, which I am sure Mr. Boland has, of the budget for each of the third level colleges, the number of students - specifying whether undergraduate or postgraduate - the number of staff - specifying whether teaching, research and other staff - and the student-teacher ratio and employment outcomes.  The HEA should be able to provide such information.  If it is available I would like to hear about the outcome from the &euro;1.2 billion investment and whether it results in good employment and career prospects.

I accept it is only a small part of it, but up to now the local authorities have paid student support grants to third level institutes.  Now, we have this new organisation that we all know as SUSI &ndash; Student Universal Support Ireland.  I have been dealing with it on behalf of constituents.  I understand it will make its payment to the third level colleges in ten monthly instalments, as opposed to the big lump sums local authorities made.  The new approach is a far better way.  Local authorities will be making cash payments to the third level colleges.  Student Universal Support Ireland will be making payments to them also, and the HEA will be making payments.  This is probably why large sums of cash are received.  It would be better if the Department of Education and Skills were responsible.  Most of the money comes from the delegates' budget.  Payments to local authorities, through the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, are spread out over the year.  Bearing in mind the Department's cash flow management and the cost to the Exchequer - I am not suggesting that having cash means having a surplus - I believe it would be better, in terms of the overall management of the State's cash position, if the money were allocated in a more even way.  Other arms of the State are paying overdraft interest.  I am sure the HSE and local authorities are doing so, while, on the other hand, the delegates' organisation is earning interest.  The cash flow requirement needs to be managed a little better.</p><p>  With regard to bank concessions to the third level colleges, the figure for 2008-09 was &euro;9.4 million, that for 2009-10 was &euro;11 million and that for 2010-11 was &euro;9.9 million.  What are the figures for the last academic year, 2011-12, and the current year?  The delegation should know given that they provide funding.  They should try to find the figure and send it on to us.  They should know it in order to manage cash flow and ensure unnecessary sums of money are not being allocated that could be used somewhere else by another Department.</p></speech>

It can be done and there should be more management of moneys from all sources.  It is a matter of allowing organisations to have cash to assist them in their operations and not creating circumstances in which there might be excessive cash, whatever the quantum might be.</p></speech>

Many of them are audited.  Through the delegates or the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, can a full list of subsidiaries, a list of every one of the third level institutions, be sent to us along with the last dates of audit?  I do not know whether subsidiaries are audited by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General or whether some are audited externally.  What was the name of the public auditor if it was not the Comptroller and Auditor General?  I am always concerned that some subsidiary has run amok and that we will hear about it in two years.  I would like to know that.  We are hearing today about occurrences a few years ago.  There is obviously something occurring this year that we will not hear about for two more years.

On the issue of accountability, the formal accountability is a request for an annual letter where we seek assurance of compliance with the code of practice in respect of a range of matters.  In addition, it is seen through the irregular interactions and meeting with the chair at least twice a year as part of that.  I was trying to think it through and I definitely have met the chief executive and the chair at least three times since I have been in the job.  I believe we will meet again next week.  Moreover, I have been at other meetings with the chair and the chief executive when the Minister has been present.  I am just talking about those meetings at which I have been.  We have regular meetings and that is an important part of our interaction.  To be fair to the chair of the HEA, he puts a lot of effort into the engagement.  We are at a key time of change in the higher education sector and he is a lead figure in terms of putting in the work and the engagement and in leading the HEA in the important work regarding the landscape document and so on.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for the documentation they have just circulated to members.  A couple of points came to mind and in the interim, I have had a chance to look at the Deloitte &amp;amp; Touche report.  It makes specific reference to travel in respect of the Bell Airways charter of a plane to transport a visitor from Waterford to Dublin in 2007 for &euro;4,200.  That payment was entered in the accounts under the miscellaneous heading.  That was not the appropriate place for such an expense.  I suggest to Mr. Boland that in future, the HEA should seek an analysis of miscellaneous expenditure in any account it receives.  It is the first heading one should look at because if one examines the trend in the relevant years, the actual miscellaneous figure was &euro;58,000 in 2008 and &euro;27,000 in 2007.  The question is whether that payment was tucked in there.</p><p>  Second, I refer to the invoices with which members have been provided and I have read Mr. Redmond O'Donoghue's statement.  Basically, this makes reference to how it pertained to Dr. Port's stay in terms of WIT seeking university status.  First, it appears to me as though there were two and not three flights.  The invoice to Bell Airways is in respect of a flight taken on 31 March.  That was the invoice date and the invoice is No. 198.  It was invoiced to Fewer Harrington Lawlor &amp;amp; Partners, which is a firm of architects and planners.  It was referenced to Kieran Byrne, the former president of WIT.  That invoice was then sent by Fewer Harrington Lawlor &amp;amp; Partners as a single payment advice to WIT for the attention of Kieran Byrne.  As far as I can ascertain, this is the same payment and the same flight and it was a trip to Dublin with reference to Nicholas Fewer.  Did that flight involve Dr. Jim Port at all?  I seek clarification in this regard.  That Bel Airways invoice of 31 March was not to WIT but to Fewer Harrington Lawlor &amp;amp; Partners, which obviously was doing work for WIT.  The Fewer Harrington Lawlor &amp;amp; Partners invoice that went to WIT was for the attention of Kieran Byrne and was signed off by Kieran Byrne only and was dated 11 May.  Then there was a cheque requisition on 15 May for that particular payment.</p><p>  As for the infamous &euro;4,200 flight, there is an invoice from Bell Airways with no date on it.  It is addressed to no one as there is no addressee on the invoice.  It simply refers to flight on 29 June 2007, hire of aircraft and pilot for return flight from Filton, England to Dublin, including all handling and landing charges at Filton and Dublin Airport, &euro;4,200.  It does not give a date, as one normally would expect with an invoice, does not give an addressee as to whom the invoice was sent and does not state when the invoice was paid.  It is signed off by Kieran Byrne and what looks to me like P. O'Donoghue.  While I am open to correction, it looks like it was signed off by the former chairman.</p><p>  I seek clarification on this issue.  While people might say it is not huge in the context of the overall budget, in the context of controls and generally, when one looks at the other aspects regarding the use of moneys within the former president's office, it must be open to question.  The Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills should provide members with an overview with regard to the period in question.  He should indicate who was paying Dr. Port's consultancy fee and to whom was he reporting?  Was he reporting to the Secretary General of the then Department of Education and Science or to the Minister for Education and Science?  Who was Minister for Education and Science at the time?  Alternatively, was Dr. Port reporting to the President of WIT?  Was the Secretary General aware of this flight?  Does he have concerns about it?  It appears as though there was a flight on 20 March and then a second flight on 29 June.  The Secretary General should outline who he understands to have been on the flight and for how long Dr. Port was here.</p> <p>To whom did Dr. Jim Port report?  Was it in the gift of the former president of Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, to provide this flight?  There is significant confusion around this and it does a disservice to WIT and to the Department of Education and Skills.  Will Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; give me a flavour on this?  Will Mr. Boland give his views on this too?</p></speech>

There was a general press release issued not going to the Comptroller and Auditor General and there were people under the impression that the Committee of Public Accounts would be provided with a document, which was read out here today and of which Mr. Boland and the Secretary General had no prior knowledge.  Does the HEA have concerns that it is being bypassed in the process and that, in terms of governance issues here, it is being made a fool of?</p></speech>

The HEA is meeting Dr. Port.  Has the HEA sought meetings with Professor Byrne and with the former chair of WIT?  This is straightforward, it is about a couple of invoices.  The issue can probably be dealt with in quick fashion.  Can we get an assurance here today that the Department and the HEA will pursue this and get clarity on it rather than it running into a continuous series of reports?</p></speech>

We are very disappointed that the Deloitte report has not been completed.  To be fair to WIT, those concerned have been endeavouring to go back through the relevant records and have tried to get as much to us and to the Comptroller and Auditor General as possible in advance of the meeting.  To be fair to them, I do not think they had any intention to mislead the Committee of Public Accounts.  They probably just forgot to send it on to the committee.  I do not think there was a deliberate intention.  They were trying to get as much information to us as possible in advance.</p></speech>

Effectively, it is a matter of pressing a button on a screen and sending an e-mail with a couple of attachments.  The problem is that we get bogged down in process here.  As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, all I want is that we get an assurance that both the HEA and the Department will look with vigour to seek meetings with Dr. Port, who can bring clarity.  They will be meeting WIT, which I accept is under a different management structure.  I want assurances that they would have meetings and get to the bottom of this on behalf of the taxpayer.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, I did not call first on Deputy Donohue because I was shocked by it not addressing the issues.  I based the questions in my contribution on the information that we had at that time.  We were not aware of the statement that Mr. Boland then read out; nobody was.  The other matter of which we were not aware - we must be balanced here in regard to Professor Byrne - was the invoices and the press statement from a press release of last week, which were presented to the committee following a request from Deputies Donohue and O'Donnell.  It would have helped us in how we framed our questions, and might have taken some of the frustration and anger out of the exchanges and the debate, had we been told, as the press release indicates, that the then chairman, Mr. Redmond O'Donoghue, had authorised and, indeed, organised the trips at the time.  That, to me, is significant information because up to now we were talking about the spend from the president's office and how he conducted the business at WIT.  It needs to be put on record that in this particular statement there is significant information which shows that the expenditure on this item was not only at the whim of the president and was not only something that was being done, but was authorised and organised by the chairman.  That is what the statement says.  I have just had time to look at it and read it.</p><p>  The second matter I want to clarify is that during the course of the exchange I asked the clerk to the committee to double-check on the e-mails that would have come in to the committee.  Earlier, we stated that we received no indication from the president, Dr. Ruaidhr&iacute; Neavyn as to what was going on or what we were to be informed of.</p></speech>

It is not addressed to anyone.  It states:<blockquote>I wish to make a correction to a mis-statement in a report referred to at the PAC hearing on 27/9/12.  The report in question, produced by Deloitte, indicates that WIT paid an invoice to Bell Airways in respect of the charter of a plane to transport a visitor from Waterford to Dublin in June, 2007, at a cost of &euro;4,200.  Upon further investigation it appears that the invoice relates to a return flight from Filton, England, to Dublin.<br />The invoice for the Waterford to Dublin flight in March, 2007, amounted to &euro;769.56.<br />This has only come to my attention since the 1st of October.<br />Yours sincerely<br />Dr. Ruaidhri Neavyn<br />President, WIT.</blockquote>That is the only communication that we received and it was not obvious to the clerk to the committee because it came to a general e-mail box.  That is all we received.</p></speech>

It does not alter the key point.  The key cost here is a flight from Filton, England to Dublin.  The former chair, Dr. O'Donoghue, speaks only specifically about the flight from Waterford to Dublin.  In summary, will both the HEA and the Department speak to the personnel to get clarity on this and advise the committee accordingly?</p></speech>

I want to check the HEA's view on their point that they are losing out to universities across the world in terms of being able retain and hire staff based on the pay structures, not necessarily the cap of &euro;200,000 but the limits of pay within certain levels of academics, for example, a level below professor, dean and senior lecturers, and they sought flexibility in this area.  It is obviously a topic that has come up for discussion.</p> <p>Is there validity to the claim?  Dr. Brady and the provost of Trinity College Dublin, Dr. Prendergast, certainly had strong opinions on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-04a.451" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Boland" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012100400018#R00200"><p>There is some merit in the point they make.  By and large our academic staff are quite well paid by reference to other systems, with the probable exceptions of our nearest neighbour, Australia and the United States.  As matters stand, pay in universities is governed by the same procedures as pay in the broader public sector.  The HEA is in the process of investigating the sustainability of funding in higher education.  Sustainability is not just a question of how to get more money and where to put it.  It is also a question of how it is used.  In that context, one of the areas we want to explore is industrial relations matters and human resource management to find out how we might quantify the kind of flexibility universities and institutes could be given and how this might impact on their capacity to manage their resources.  As matters stand, they have the same flexibility in the overall structure of public sector pay as the Secretary General of a Department or the chief executive of the HEA, that is, none.</p></speech>

The issue arising for the two university heads is not as much the total amount of money available to them to allocate to wages as the lack of flexibility in that parcel for retaining staff.  That appears to chime with what Mr. Boland has said in regard to the lack of flexibility in the various wage gradients for university heads to reward and recognise individuals.  Is that issue being examined in context of the study to which he referred?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-04a.453" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Boland" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012100400018#R00400"><p>I want to correct myself in that there is a small degree of flexibility.  Universities can, through what is known as a departures framework, appoint individuals at higher levels if they are what we might call high flyers.  However, its use is very limited - we are speaking about a handful of people across the sector - and it is monitored closely by the HEA.  The issue of flexibility has to be considered in the overall scheme of the public service but Government policy for the public service is not a subject I am qualified to discuss.  However desirable it may be, I imagine it would be difficult to create this type of flexibility in one part of the public service without impacting on other parts.  On a purely personal basis, I have no doubt that value could be found through this kind of flexibility but it might be difficult to achieve because of the environment in which it arises.</p></speech>

We are clearly operating in a challenging environment in terms of public sector expenditure on staffing.  In that context, universities have been raising certain issues with us in recent years but, equally, concerns have been expressed about universities making payments they were not entitled to make.  These matters were examined in reports by the Comptroller and Auditor General and have been considered in this committee.  We have addressed the issues arising and earlier this week the Minister for Education and Skills published a draft Bill to ensure that where a university is making a payment beyond the amount authorised the Minister may order an investigation and make directions.</p></speech>

I do not think the evidence to that effect is overwhelming but certainly that is happening in some cases.  To use the phrase again, high flyers are more likely to be attracted away from Ireland.  However, people also go to other jurisdictions for other reasons.  An individual may leave Ireland because the laboratory facilities or the team members potentially available somewhere else are much better.  It is not simply a question of vast numbers of academics travelling around the world in pursuit of higher salaries.  By and large there is a reasonable level of stability.  At the top notch level to which the presidents were referring, the capacity of Ireland to attract individuals is limited but we have nonetheless attracted and retained a number of high quality people.  It is not a black and white story but I still see value in granting flexibility to universities and institutes in the area of pay given that it accounts for three quarters of their resources.  I am, however, aware of the complex environment in which that would arise.</p></speech>

Further clarity is needed on the invoice for &euro;4,200 in terms of the date it was issued, to whom it was issued, details of the flight, when it was paid, how it was approved and the passengers on the flight.  WIT has a good academic name but this issue needs to be concluded for the sake of its students and academic staff.  The second report by Deloitte &amp;amp; Touche needs to be published and I expect the same in respect of the Grant Thornton report so that the institute can get on with its work.  I would like the matter to be concluded speedily and I note the undertaking to keep the committee updated over a short period of time.</p></speech>

I suspect the flight from Filton involved an aircraft that was sourced in England.  I do not imagine Bell sent an aircraft to Filton to fly to Dublin.  As Bell Airways is part of a much larger group, it may not have operated the aircraft itself.  The company which supplied the aircraft may have invoiced Bell, which simply passed on a summary invoice.  I ask the witnesses to investigate whether Bell received a background invoice from the company which operated the flight from Filton to Dublin and back.</p></speech>

We had a meeting last week during which we were assured we had got to the bottom of everything in terms of understanding what happens.  Not only did we find out that we are not, but it is then communicated in such a way that it comes to the committee at the last minute and, in effect, a third party - the witnesses present today - had to communicate it to us.  When dealing with an issue such as this, the process of how we see it being resolved is very important.  I have a strong sense that this has not been managed in a way that gives respect to the committee and the work we are trying to do particularly in light of assurances we received last week that this was drawing to a close.  I regret that today's witnesses had to give the information to us given that they received it at the same time the committee did.  In effect they are in the firing line for questions from us when that should have happened last week.  The real source of disappointment for me is the breakdown in how it has been handled rather than just the money itself.  That is why it is very important for us to find an answer to these questions here.  The way this has come to light is very unsatisfactory for us and also for the witnesses.</p></speech>

There was an exchange about the attractiveness of Irish third level institutions and so on.  I do not think mention was made of the framework provisions that exist for exceptional payments to be made in exceptional cases.  In terms of the work we have done here in presenting payments in excess of ministerially approved levels, framework agreement cases are excluded because they are actually approved within the framework context.  I think in the discussion last week, the provost was making the point about trying to attract people into administration and management posts rather than into academic posts.

Universities have come under a much stricter control system since the introduction of the Universities Act 1997.  It takes time for an institution that is used to doing a thing in a particular way to understand and knuckle down to controls that may be alien to it.  To a certain extent that may be part of the background to the confusion about the Waterford Institute of Technology case and dealing with the committee.</p><p>  Deputy Fleming's point about getting a sectoral view and having an overview of what we are doing with the money is a very important point and we will keep pushing that idea of focusing on what bodies are achieving with the money.  That is why we have tried on a number of occasions to produce reports that try to give a sectoral view and identify sectoral issues.  I suppose the individual difficulties in individual institutions will be the test of where those systems need to be further enhanced.  Hopefully they will contribute to feedback to the HEA and the Department on areas in which controls need to be strengthened.</p></speech>

In light of the children's referendum, childhood obesity and being overweight must be factored into the issue of child protection.  It is well accepted that children are growing up in hostile, toxic environments where obesity is concerned.  As the committee has received a number of presentations, including many graphs and statistics, I will be statistic light this morning.</p><p>  Unfortunately, one in five children in preschool is overweight or obese.  This is the 2012 figure and increases to one in four in terms of eight year olds.  The first communion is a milestone for children.  One in four children requires clothes that are larger than what would have been required some years ago.  Data from the late 1940s bring the issue into sharp focus, in that 14 year olds have gained 8 in. in height but are three stone heavier than their 1940s counterparts.  This disproportionate increase in weight is a large physical burden.</p><p>  We are in relative denial.  According to research, parents and society in general are accepting of children being overweight, &quot;generously sized&quot; or so on.  We do not recognise the issue.  There is clear evidence that obesity and being overweight track into adulthood.  One tends not to grow out of it.  If one is overweight or obese at ten years of age, one is twice as likely to be overweight or obese as an adult.  It is a real problem.</p><p>  Thanks to our new investigative facilities and the current level of technology, we know that children begin depositing fat and calcium in their arteries from the time they become overweight.  It is not confined to 50 year olds, 60 year olds and 70 year olds.  We are also finding overweight children as young as ten years of age with high blood pressure.  The terms &quot;overweight&quot; and &quot;obesity&quot; are not interchangeable, as they form part of a spectrum, but we tend to view obesity rather than overweight as being serious.  If a child is overweight, metabolic damage is being done to his or her system.  Of overweight children in the US, 50% show clear evidence of a metabolic syndrome, which is essentially pre-diabetes.  In Ireland, 9% of overweight 12 year olds have pre-diabetes.  Concrete evidence shows that there is nothing benign about being overweight as a child.</p><p>  Parenthood in general is a blame game, particularly so in the case of overweight children.  Is industry, parenting or something else to blame?  The information clearly points to society.  Genetics play a part, but we are over-reliant on this excuse.  Genes are switched on by environments.  If one is not exposed to certain environmental factors such as high-energy foods or inactivity, one's genetic predispositions will be less expressed.  This is an important consideration.</p><p>  There is some good news, in that early intervention and family intervention have been shown to work.  It is not down to the child alone and one cannot just send a child on a programme.  A change in or development of lifestyle is necessary.  Many statistics support this viewpoint.<br /><i>safe</i>food has adopted a practical, evidence-based and realistic approach to the issues of healthy eating and tackling obesity.  Our mass media campaigns, our work in schools and the evidence base we have built through commissioning certain forms of research comprise an approach that is based on science, provides parents and others with practical tips and tries to influence policy, which is the reason we are at this meeting.</p><p>  The challenges are significant.  This is not a sprint, as there is no quick-fix solution.  It is a long-term project.  The goals set by the World Health Organization, WHO, and our European counterparts involve halting the increase.  We are not discussing something so dramatic as having a healthy childhood generation within three years.  After we have halted the increase, we will decrease the levels to what they were in 2000.  Most of us would consider that as being only yesterday.</p><p>  We are fighting the denial and stigma associated with this issue, as well as the fact that parents and society attach blame to the terms &quot;overweight&quot; and &quot;obese&quot;, which they perceive as being harsh.  A challenge for us is to produce information and campaigns that engage, are adequately hard-hitting and do not alienate people from the realities of the situation.</p><p>  Ireland possesses no exemplars of the final challenge facing <i>safe</i>food.  We are familiar with the economic situation.  There is no simple solution.  The basis of our work is energy balance, that is, changing the amount of high-energy food that is available everywhere and is marketed to children and changing what occurs in schools and homes.</p><p>  We have collectively been sitting on the sidelines or getting overexcited about individual pieces of research or advances in treatment methods, for example, diabetes drugs or bariatric surgery.  These merely manage the few, in that they only help a relatively small number of individuals who have extremely established diseases.  Although this is exciting, appeals in the short term and allows waiting lists for treatment to be discussed, we are giving it undue focus instead of concentrating on overweight children, the number of whom would fill the Aviva Stadium and Croke Park together.  By focusing on a minute number of children, we are neglecting prevention and wellness for the others.</p><p>  We do not have absolute answers - it would be dishonest and misleading of me to claim otherwise - but we have a pathway that will help.</p> <p>I urge the committee to put more due emphasis on prevention and wellness at the expense, perhaps, of treating the few.</p></speech>

We have sent the committee documentation and we encourage questions but we are here to make the point for schools and their children to have less sugar.  We have been told by some eminent doctors, especially in the US, that sugar is now more hurtful to people than tobacco, which is a frightening prospect.  People must back that up as it cannot just be left as a statement.</p><p>  The World Health Organisation provides some general statistics and there is also the promotion of healthy diets and physical activity in school.  Fat versus sugar forms the basis of a new health debate.  Dr. Robert Lustig is an eminent physician in the US who has come up with wonderful material on this issue.  Calorie for calorie, sugar makes us fatter than any other food.  Sugar-free schools in Sweden, Denmark and the USA have undergone many studies, with results indicating that pupils become more healthy and attentive in such schools.  Statistics back up these findings.</p><p>  We recognise that diet is not the only element to consider and children must also be more aware of physical activity.  We do not want to keep hammering about not having sugar as everything is okay in moderation.  Nevertheless, we are here to explain how a sugar-free diet makes everybody healthier.  We must start in the schools, as there is now a tendency towards having vending machines in them.  They are perhaps not as regulated as they should be.  There is a facility, if required, to place vending machines with only sugar-free products in schools, and we can explain that process later.</p><p>  We invite questions, which we will answer as best we can.  We know the committee's time is very important and we will do our best to help promote sugar-free diets.</p></speech>

We all know that if we eat healthy food and exercise a little bit more, we would diminish weight and obesity problems more rapidly.  The difficulty is getting people to do that.  Professor Donal O'Shea has campaigned for a long time for us to address the serious issue of obesity in the general population and in children specifically.</p><p>  The witnesses indicated there is no single solution but we must start somewhere.  Do the schools have a role and what role should we have in terms of legislation, particularly with regard to sugar or fat taxes?  Where could a start be made in addressing childhood obesity in particular?  Some teachers have indicated to me that a difficulty they have in some communities is that the art or skill of cooking healthy foods is so diminished, parents are incapable of cooking food properly.  Processed food is often fed to children.  Where could the committee start in promoting and addressing the issue?</p></speech>

The opening remarks from Dr. Foley-Nolan in the context of other looming events were well made and taken.  To follow Deputy Kelleher's remarks, this is an holistic response and we cannot seek to place the burden of responsibility on the school environment.  There should be a very clear and definite parental responsibility, as these are the people most critically involved in determining a child's diet.  There has been a significant change in lifestyles in recent years but there is a need to continue to emphasise the important legacy that parents give to children in terms of general health and well-being.  This does not just concern academic achievement or other interests that seem to have taken a much greater importance than well-being, which is the critical factor.</p><p>  It is important to acknowledge that significant voluntary work is done by sporting organisations around the country, and as a parent, I acknowledge what I see in my own community from a variety of sporting organisations.  They are providing an opportunity that most certainly was not there in my time and for decades after my involvement in sport.  Wonderful work is done, which should be acknowledged, and the issue should be a balance of all the elements.</p><p>  I pay tribute to the initiatives taken by <i>safe</i>food, particularly the Stop the Spread initiative, which merits recognition this morning.  I know it is not directly a part of our engagement at this meeting but I am concerned that this campaign, for some time, has been in hiatus or parked because of the intervention of the corresponding Minister in the Department responsible for health north of the Border.  Some 12 months a review was sought of <i>safe</i>food's role in the issue of nutrition and related matters, including childhood obesity.  Will the witnesses share the current position and has the review got under way?  Given that the Stop the Spread initiative was significant and award winning in terms of marketing impact, is it expected that the project will be completed and that <i>safe</i>food can continue as one of the six cross-Border implementation bodies to continue with its broad remit, as it had up to the end of 2011 at least?</p></speech>

This is a very important subject, which is really a ticking time bomb.  It concerns health and life expectancy as well as complications down the road.</p> <p>There are huge costs involved in dealing initially with the issue of people being overweight and obese and the complications from that down the road.  I welcome the practical way put forward to halt the rise in the levels of obesity, to try to decrease the levels and to deal with the stigma associated with it.  As previous speakers have said, this needs to be done on an holistic basis across the board.  The approach needs to take account of lifestyle, healthy eating, fitness, outdoor activity, parental responsibility and education in schools.  All these areas need to be rolled into one, as it were, in the approach to this problem.  Do the witnesses consider that the campaign run by Road Safety Authority, which has been very successful, could be used as a template for the introduction of a campaign to deal with this subject?</p></speech>

The main reason we are dealing with this issue is to make people aware of the damage that being overweight and obese can do to one's health.  It is important to show people how they can combat this problem.  Obesity levels in Ireland have risen dramatically in the past 20 years.  In the 1990s, only one in ten Irish men was obese, and the level today is put officially at one in four.  In the same period, the level of obesity among women has risen from 13% to 21%.  The fact of being overweight and obesity are now the most common childhood disorders in Europe.  Of all five to 12 year olds, one in ten is overweight and a further one in ten is obese.  In total, 22% of five to 12 year olds are now overweight or obese.  One in five Irish teenagers aged between 13 and 17 is overweight or obese, with 11% being overweight and 8% being obese.  There has been a significant increase in teenage obesity since 1990, with an eightfold increase in males, from 1% to 8%, and a twofold increase in females, from 3% to 6%.  Obesity and being overweight are defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that may impair health.</p><p>  It is important that witnesses who appear before the committee tell us the truth, the facts and figures, and that is the reason the witnesses are before the committee today.  In terms of whatever information they give the committee, I ask that they know that it is 100% correct.</p></speech>

I compliment <i>Safefood</i> on the tremendous work it is doing and on the marketing campaigns in which it has been involved and which are ingenious.  Such work needs to be continue to be done and supported.  My question, which is related to that, is on the marketing, advertising and packaging of food.  Many food products are advertised as healthy foods but they have a very high sugar content or a food product may be advertised as being 95% fat free, which means it has 5% fat content.  If one is lucky enough to find a food product that is low in sugar and fat content, one will find that it probably contains about one third of the total recommended daily salt content.  My question is how the consumer can choose foods, processed foods mainly, in a sensible and straightforward manner because one would nearly want a degree in nutrition to work out exactly what is in some of these foods.  One finds what appears to be a health food product but it transpires it is not healthy and some of the foods that are not marketed as healthy are far healthier than the ones being marketed and promoted as such.  How can that challenge be addressed?</p></speech>

I join the Chairman and members in welcoming our guests.  This is a very important issue.  It has often been said that when we have healthy children, we have a healthy society, and I go a long way in agreeing with that.  I have a great interest in this subject because my background is in the area of fitness and sport and my specialist qualification is in the area of child and teenage fitness, not only physical fitness but fitness of body and mind.</p><p>  I am sure the witnesses would agree it is important to get the balance right between having a healthy diet and, on the output side, more regular exercise, an area in which I have great interest.  I notice that, increasingly, more local authorities, including my own, about which I am delighted, are rolling out the provision of more equipment in our parks which is free for people to use.</p><p>  I was interested in what Mr. Duffy said about the sugar-free school project.  I would keen to find out more about it in terms of the research he has done on it throughout Europe.  I suggest that time might be provided to discuss that issue alone.  The idea is one I am sure we as legislators would be pleased to take on board and we could examine how the committee and the D&aacute;il could promote it in the community.  I would be interested in exchanging details with Mr. Duffy in order that we could interact on that issue.</p></speech>

They mentioned the school programmes and I would be interested to hear their opinion on introducing a school programme - similar to the programme under which a green flag being is awarded to environmentally friendly schools - under which recognition would be awarded to schools that are health conscious from the point of view of promoting healthy eating as well as exercise.  The witnesses might also give their opinions on the introduction of a sugar tax or junk food tax.  Would they consider that to be beneficial?  The money collected from it could be ring-fenced for the promotion of healthy eating.</p><p>  This problem is prevalent in low income families, lone parents and disadvantaged families, and people are facing cutbacks in terms of their discretionary spend, be they in the area of social welfare with the proposed cutback in children's allowance or other areas.  What are the witnesses' opinions on how this problem can be counteracted?  There is a perception that it is more expensive to eat healthily than it is to eat junk food which, in that way at least, one can afford to feed one's children.  Unfortunately, in the current climate, sometimes people have no choice but to buy cheap food because it is better than no food and people do not have the money to buy proper food.</p></speech>

If nothing else, can I implore the members to be aware it is incumbent on us to examine forensically children's school lunchboxes?  The food children bring to school at a very early age is highly improper.  I implore the members to ensure parents - because this starts with the parents - know what they are putting into their children's lunchboxes.  That is very important.  We in the South tend not to provide meals for schools while meals are sometimes provided for schools in the North.  It is up to the parents to put into their children's lunchboxes what we believe would be right and proper and also that schools provide the right food via a tuck shop or vending machine.  This is very important but we need to educate people.  Sugar is killing our children and I implore this committee, as of today, to please recognise that.</p></speech>

One of the most important things is that people need to count carbohydrates, although I know it is hard work.  I have a daughter with diabetes and all the time need to count the carbohydrates for her to know exactly how many doses of insulin she needs.  The more carbohydrates one needs, the more insulin one needs.  When one eats more food, the body processes more insulin and if one does not process all of the carbohydrates, they will be stored as fat.  That is the reason we are fat.  Reducing carbohydrates is the most important message of all. </p><p>  It is important to show from an early age in schools how to cook and eat.  Cadburys is producing a new chocolate bar with less than 100 calories and it will sell for 50p in Northern Ireland.  It states it will be brilliant because people will be slimmer.  That is false because all of these products contain more sugar.  When there is less fat in a product, there is more sugar to make it more tasty.  It is exactly the same in the case of salt and fat content.  What we have to do is to reduce the intake of sugar of children in order that real sugar comes from vegetables.  They will be processed better and one will have real sugar rather than the sugar contained in processed foods.</p></speech>

It would be handy if it were; therefore, it is inaccurate and false - this has been shown over and over again - to say the problem involves one nutrient.  We spoke a lot about parents and schools and they are important, but the food environment is crucial.  Saying people should have wills of iron when they go to a supermarket is not realistic.  We have to work with industry in having less processed food and having less temptation on every corner in order that people are given an even chance to purchase what is reasonable.  The mumbo jumbo about adding this and that and less of this and the other to processed food is not based on science.</p></speech>

These are the superfoods, as the Chairman said.  However, it is not easy to counteract the marketing budgets of these industries.  There are parallels with the tobacco industry and so on.  They are also plying us with statements about products that they claim are healthy because they do not contain as much as X, although they contain more of Y and are convenient.  For example, what could be more convenient: a chocolate, an apple or a potato?</p><p>  Deputy Billy Kelleher referred to cooking skills and so on.  The issue also arises from what children are seeing in the home or supermarket.  If one walks into a supermarket, one almost needs an extra coat because there are so many rows of frozen readymade meals and other products.  These items are being plied to us and our job is to counteract this as much as possible.  </p><p>  We spoke about the next phases.  The Minister for Health has brought together in his Department a special action group on obesity, SAGO, of which <i>safe</i>food is a member.  We always worked closely with the other organisations, but there is greater cohesion, which is welcome.  I ask the committee not to get hung up on one simple answer.  What we are talking about is a sustained approach on which we have been working on the past few years and on which SAGO is now working.</p><p>  There is room for a Government statement on the matter.  Several members referred to a sugar, sweet and beverage tax.  It would not solve the world's problem, but there is evidence to show that it would have an impact.  It would also be a statement from the Government to the population and industry that we need to get our act together and that this is a serious matter.</p></speech>

How can this mindset be changed?  As Deputy Robert Troy mentioned, a sugar tax would act as a barrier.  In saying one size does not fit all, how does one fit all the pieces to make it healthier for all of us to live and become sugar free in so far as we can, while allowing us the freedom to make our own choices?  If I decide in the morning to buy ten Mars bars, that is my choice.</p></speech>

I am sorry I was not present for the entire presentation.  </p><p>  I am a doctor and practise cancer medicine.  In our field in the past decade there has been a greatly increased focus on diet and obesity.  It is now appreciated that it is one of the great unappreciated risk factors for a number of cancers.  Statistics have emerged which show that if there was a substantial reduction in the obesity rate, there would also be a substantial reduction in the incidence of cancer.  Surprisingly, I have also seen data that indicate that if one has cancer, the chances that one will do better with treatment are higher if one is not obese.</p> <p>It could be argued that it is, after smoking, the second biggest cancer risk factor our population is facing.  The key factors appear to be calorie and fat intake and its metabolic effect on us.  I speak with some personal authority in this regard because three or four years ago I made a concerted effort to talk to people about weight and counsel them in a big way.  This is something cancer doctors often skip over.  Of course, the fact that there are so few of us does not help, but it does work.  Recommendations from doctors carry more authority than something seen in an advertisement on television.  We need a major increase in emphasis on nutritional education in our medical schools, of which we have so many.  We should try to do this.</p><p> I am now 25 kg lighter than I was ten years ago.  I had reached a crossroads in my life and decided it was unhealthy to be so heavy.  In fact, a brave young woman who was a patient of mine and a triathlete and raising funds for us said to me, "You know, you are very overweight.  I don't know if you are going to save my life, but I am going to save yours."  She forced me into a programme of exercise and diet.  Sadly, she is no longer with us.  Anne Burns was a wonderful woman whom I recall crying when I told her she could not take part in the run in a triathlon because she had secondaries in her spine.  She was an extraordinary woman about whom we have spoken in public on many occasions. </p><p> The lesson I learned which may not sit with what the delegates are saying is that there is really no food that is dangerous if we eat it in moderation and that no food is safe if eaten to excess.  Simply banning salt, sugar or chips would not work.  We must get the message across that the total volume, multiplied by the number of calories, and the efficiency with which we absorb food are what make the difference.  I am a scientist and hate being unscientific, but I have observed that many of my patients who are middle-aged ladies with breast cancer and have weight problems never eat sugar.  They made a decision to give up sugar in tea and coffee and do not eat cake or chocolates, but they cannot understand why they are fat.  When I ask what they have for dinner, they tell me they eat healthily and have a little chicken and potatoes.  I then discover they are having a great bowl of carbohydrates - either potato, rice or pasta.  </p><p> We have a much bigger job on our hands.  I have not got my head straight on whether we should have a sugar tax or a fat tax.  I am not sure about this.</p></speech>

However, part of me thinks that if someone is responsible, not terribly well off and likes to take their kids out once a week for a meal at McDonalds, that is not so bad.  The problem is with people who are doing it on a daily basis or three times a week and are not giving their kids a balanced diet.  Why should we punish the person who has an occasional hamburger by making him or her pay more for something that is not causing a problem?</p><p>  The main thing we need is educational and health intervention.  The presentations contain pictures of people having their waists measured.  We need to start doing this for schoolchildren.  We need to take in children for nurse-led health screening where they will be weighed and measured and if they have a clearly defined obesity problem, the alarm should go off and there should be interventions.  We need this and an educational job on our professions.</p></speech>

They examined the lifestyle of the family and discovered that the child who was aged 16 years and very overweight did not get up until 2 p.m.  When the doctor advised what the family needed to do, they simply did not want to hear it.  There seems to be a problem where some parents insist that it is everyone else's problem but their own, no matter how much information is put before them.  They cannot accept that the issue is not only one of food but also of exercise and lifestyle.  Schools are proactive, but parents need to be convinced that they must be involved at an early stage to make sure the problem does not reach the stage where medical advice is required.  There seems to be a problem in getting that information through to children and parents.</p></speech>

Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred to the Stop the Spread campaign.  There is a lull, which is a source of professional disappointment and we hope the matter will be sorted out as quickly as possible.  The next phase we were planning was to work on increasing parents' awareness of childhood obesity.  We started with adults because adult obesity is less contentious.   </p><p>  This brings us back to Senator Colm Burke's point.  This is a delicate and sensitive issue and it is easy to see education and responsibility as the solutions.  A person who has had a heart attack or a diagnosis of a serious illness will be much more amenable to lifestyle changes.  No one wants to be told his or her beautiful eight year old or preschooler who is a little overweight has a health problem.  This does not come easy for parents.  We need to normalise the measuring of weight and waist sizes in order that it is not seen as a criticism or an insult.  It should be the same as having a child's eyes checked.</p></speech>

I know there are programmes on food awareness in the community and tackling food on a low income.  At what age is it appropriate to go into a school and say action needs to be taken?</p></speech>

Those community and preschool programmes are conditioning parents to see that they need to be health aware in the same way as they need to be aware of children's hearing.  Everyone knows a hearing problem will affect a child's speech and learning at school, but health awareness is still under the radar.  We are working towards its normalisation, and then screening.  They have to be hand in hand.</p></speech>

I live on my own and do not cook for myself.  I eat in a carvery, buy a pizza or fast food or have a sandwich.  There are families who are on the move 24 hours a day and seven days a week.  How do we tell them they must cook and be health aware?  Everyone is busy now, no matter what he or she does.  I agree that families must be convinced of the need to eat healthily, but some parents simply do not get it.  How do we make that happen?</p></speech>

We need to give people choice.  A child will choose a Mars bar over a sugar free bar, unless the healthier item is at the right price point, tastes good and we give it to them where they can get it.

Does Dr. Foley-Nolan have any concern that the possibility of causing eating disorders through being conscious of weight made people shy away from the issue of addressing children's weight?  I have a personal professional perspective on this.  I think we became neurotic about dealing with the subject of weight, especially with young girls but also with young boys, in case we drove them towards anorexia.  Does Dr. Foley-Nolan have a comment on this?  Was that a valid concern, because I have my doubts about it?</p></speech>

We considered it when we were conducting the Stop the Spread campaign.  It was aimed at adults, but, like lots of television programmes aimed at adults, it did not stop children watching and thinking.</p> <p>We did a lot of research on whether there was evidence that educational and awareness programmes were promoting or in any way triggering eating disorders and the evidence is that it is not an issue.  One of the other challenges we have is that parents of teenage girls or girls going into puberty, in particular, tend to shy away from this.  The fear has probably been overstated.  Basically, eating disorders are a psychological issue.  All the excellent voluntary agencies and support agencies say that it is a control issue that will come out in this way.  It is another thing we must work with.  We are working with the voluntary agencies and get them to check out the things we say to ensure they are happy with them and see them as positive and constructive rather than negative in any way.</p></speech>

I have two children aged seven and five.  My children cook for me on most days.  I showed them how.  Playing with food is a game as well.  One of the things one can do is spend 15 or 20 minutes in the school once a week to show children how to make dinner.  When they come home they can cook for the parents.  Trust me, it is not hard to do.</p><p>  Second, sugar-free schools not a solution, but will help.  This has been proven in Sweden, Hungary and Russia which have been doing these types of things.  It has dramatically reduced obesity in children, the visits to the school nurse were reduced, disciplinary problems were reduced, there was improvement in test scores and lower absenteeism rates.  Another thing is eating sandwiches and pizzas all the time.  That is all carbohydrates.  The more carbohydrates one eats, the more fat one gets.  There is no fat in Coca Cola - it is sugar.  What will happen if one drinks plenty of Coca Cola?  One will obviously get fat.  That is a problem for the American people.</p></speech>

I do not see schools as a market for it primarily.  It is, perhaps, for people with diabetes.  One is still talking about all processed carbohydrates.  It is not as if one has food that has some fibre in it such as fruit.  If one eats sweet things in the United States, although they might be low in sugar or sugar-free, they are even sweeter than they are here.  In a way, therefore, one is substituting one sweet for another, albeit that it no longer has the calories in it.</p></speech>

Whether protein supplements are a challenge is a different subject.  While they are inextricably linked, the issue is to try to divide cosmetics from health.  There is the appearance issue, but that can be played on to some extent to encourage positive behaviour.  On the other hand, certainly from a parental and health service point of view, our focus would always be on the health issues.  Confidence comes into it, and looking and feeling well are important.
