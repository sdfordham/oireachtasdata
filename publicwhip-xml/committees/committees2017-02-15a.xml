Deputy Mattie McGrath has also indicated that he might be unable to attend. </p><p>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Dara Murphy.  Ongoing strong engagement between the committee and the Minister of State is very important and we appreciate the time he dedicates to working with us.  Many committee members had the chance to meet him when we were in Brussels last week, but it is also helpful to have a formal discussion about the work of the General Affairs Council, as well as other key developments on the European agenda.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>I invite the Minister of State to make his opening remarks, after which I will open the meeting to questions from members.  I again thank the Minister of State for taking time out to be here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1282" speakername="Dara Murphy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017021500002#A00300"><p>Thank you, Chairman, for your expression of thanks.  I acknowledge the strong diplomatic presence at the meeting.  I also thank you, Chairman, for your recent assistance in providing a pair for me which was very important and also for the excellent job you did two weeks ago when virtually every committee member was in Brussels.  I am more than happy to answer questions and make my statement, but, equally, I am interested in hearing the observations of members following their meetings.  I am aware, for example, that Senator Terry Leyden was in Valletta recently.  There is very good engagement with the committee.  I am delighted to be back before it and appreciate the agreement of members to having a slightly shorter format.  Many of us will attend the Taoiseach's keynote address this afternoon entitled, Ireland at the Heart of a Changing European Union, which will take place in little over an hour.  I will keep my intervention a little more brief than usual to allow time for interaction.</p> <p>  There have been two General Affairs Council meetings since my last appearance before the committee.  The first of the General Affairs Councils I attended and the first under the Maltese Presidency was held in Valletta on 23 and 24 January.  There were two agenda items, the first of which was on the Maltese Presidency's priorities - migration, the Single Market, security, social inclusion, Europe's neighbourhood and maritime issues.  We very much support these priorities.  We strongly believe they are realistic and achievable and address most of the key challenges facing the European Union.</p> <p>  Of the six priorities, the Maltese highlighted migration as being the No. 1 priority.  The migration crisis may have faded to a certain extent from the media headlines in recent months, but it is far from being resolved.  On the contrary, it remains one of the biggest challenges facing the European Union.  A total of 180,000 migrants entered the Union last year via the central Mediterranean route - essentially from Libya to Italy.  Behind this headline figure, sadly, hundreds drowned and many lives were shattered.  Migration will and must remain high on the EU agenda for the foreseeable future and the March European Council which will involve Heads of State and Government will address it again, as it has done continuously since the crisis developed in the spring of 2015.</p> <p>  The second item on the agenda of the January General Affairs Council was the future of Europe.  To frame discussions, the Maltese Presidency produced a short paper highlighting the need for citizens' trust to be re-established in the European project and for the delivery of a realistic agenda focused on practical issues.</p><p>Ireland strongly supports this approach.  We want to see the Bratislava process which was launched in the aftermath of the British referendum and the focus of President Tusk's informal summit of Heads of State and Government held in the Slovakian capital in September concentrate on practical issues which improve the lives of citizens through measures such as increased investment and the creation of more job opportunities.  Progress in implementing the Single Market, in particular, the digital Single Market, will be of vital importance in achieving this goal.</p><p> On 3 February the leaders of the 27 member states had another meeting to discuss what they envisaged for the Rome summit on 25 March, which will mark the 60th anniversary of the birth of the European Union when the Treaty of Rome was signed.  While no written conclusions emerged from the meeting, as I indicated, it broadly agreed that this was not the time for bold new initiatives, still less consideration of treaty change.  However, it was also agreed that we had to work on existing priorities in a much more energised fashion.  Given the ever-changing geopolitical landscape, there was also a strong view that the importance of the European Union in protecting and promoting European values internally and globally had to be prioritised. </p><p> The Commission indicated that it viewed the March European Council as being about consolidation and restoring the security of citizens from both internal and external challenges.  At the meeting I stated that, from Ireland&rsquo;s viewpoint, the March European Council would be an important step in refocusing the European Union.  As we are all aware, there are a myriad of items competing for attention.  However, we must also ensure adequate attention is given to economic issues.  Sometimes, given the capacity of people to focus on other key matters, there is a danger that these bread and butter issues will become marginalised.  They remain, however, issues of immediate concern to citizens and addressing them would improve their lives.  If we want to seriously address the gap which many EU citizens see between the European Union and the lives they lead, this is a pragmatic way of doing so and showing the link.  I hope the next meeting of the European Council will provide a tangible demonstration of the European Union's determination to focus on and deliver measures that will improve the lives of European citizens in a concrete and specific manner.</p><p> To be clear, the decision making will take place at a political and at European Council level between the 27 member states.  While there will be some additional meetings, the General Affairs Council will meet on a monthly basis and our ambassador will be involved in weekly meetings of the working group which will also have officials from Ireland in attendance.  The various groups in Ireland will meet perhaps twice each week.  There will, therefore, be a high level of engagement.  Having met Ambassador Kelleher and some of our team of officials in the Permanent Representation in Brussels, I hope the Chairman is satisfied with their level of expertise and engagement.</p><p> Given the way in which politics in Europe works, I restate the very important role the political groups in the European Parliament will play.  The group to which the Fine Gael Party belongs, the European People's Party, has a role, as do the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, ALDE, to which Fianna F&aacute;il belongs, the GUE/NGL group, the Socialist Group and Independents who also have a strong presence.</p><p> I hope the engagement by members the week before last will mark the start of a process of continued engagement.  I understand the committee will continue to be a forum European Union officials will attend.  I have visited 15 member states in recent months and one of my key objectives has been to speak to committees such as this one in other countries, not only to make Ireland's views known on key issues with respect to security, the peace process and the free movement of people but also to listen to the concerns of other countries, many of which have similar concerns to ours.  I also wish to identify possibilities for building alliances and strategic partnerships.  Many of those with whom we engage are members of other political groupings and relationships with them will be very important.  The term "green jersey" is sometimes viewed as being a little fluffy, but we should not underestimate the links and influence we have.  This will be a long game.  Changes in the governments of member states will continue to take place on a cyclical basis.</p><p> I compliment the work done by the joint committee.  I will be pleased to take questions from members and listen to observations they may have following their recent visit to Brussels.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1319" speakername="Michael Healy-Rae" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017021500002#B00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his engagement with a delegation from the committee when we visited Brussels last week.</p><p>I also thank the secretariat who organised the trip so well.  We were all well prepared.  I thank the Deputies and Senators for their commitment to the process over a couple of days.  I acknowledge the cross-party work of our MEPs and their staff in Brussels.  One often hears negativity about politicians, but they are doing their best for us in stormy waters and troubled times.  It is only right to put on the record of this committee that we acknowledge the assistance of our MEPs and their staff who are working over there on our behalf.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1390" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017021500002#C00200"><p>I congratulate the Chairman on the way he chaired the meetings in Brussels and ensured everybody from this committee had an opportunity to make their points.  Likewise, the secretariat did a fantastic job, ensuring we got 14 meetings in two days when we met quite a number of important people.</p> <p>  Until I went to Brussels I was unaware of the level of work the Minister of State had undertaken.  I compliment him on that.  His travels around the EU, his efforts to drive the Irish message home and his willingness to listen to other countries' issues are to be commended.  Unfortunately, however, that work has not been sufficiently appreciated.  I therefore wish to put on record my thanks to the Minister of State for the work he is doing.</p> <p>  I have concerns but they do not necessarily reflect on the Minister of State.  I have been saying for some time that I want Ireland to take a leadership role rather than a following one.  I could see leadership in Brussels but I cannot see it at home.  It is to be hoped that will be sorted out today.  I would like to see us lay down a number of priorities that we will want to raise during the negotiations on Brexit.  Five or six were mentioned in Brussels, but there is no point in laying down priorities unless we have solutions.  How far advanced are we in presenting not just the problems but the solutions to them?  We are all aware of the Border and trade issues, but the island of Ireland is our concern.  We have enjoyed the ability to travel throughout the 32 counties unimpeded and I do not want to see that change, Nor does the Minister of State.  There is no point in Ireland and the UK agreeing on that, however.  It is a question of how advanced we are on getting agreement from the other 26 EU member states.  That is my concern.</p> <p>  The Minister spoke about re-establishing the European project at citizen level, but there is a huge problem there.  That is because the European project has been demonised for as long as I can remember.  In the Oireachtas, we constantly blame the EU for imposing directives obliging us to do various things.  We go there to negotiate, but we must now stand up to the plate.  Water is a classic case in point.  It was sold as something the Europeans told us to do, not something we negotiated in Europe.  I will not ask the Minister of State to comment on that, but if he wishes to do so, I would be interested.</p> <p>  As we go through the Brexit process, I am concerned that we should be able to access funding for market diversification, that is, to move away from the British market where we have 41% of our agricultural output and 35% of our textile and leather industry.  I would like to see us moving that to other markets.  Is such market diversification funding available and is there such a willingness on the part of the EU?  I think it was Monsieur Barnier who suggested that they wanted to get away from derogations as they want a single policy in Europe.  However, a derogation on state aid for Monaghan Dairies was mentioned in Brussels.  That company is getting a huge proportion of its milk from across the Border.  If that stops, where does the company go?</p> <p>  Does the Minister of State know how far the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has advanced with respect to opening up new routes to Europe?  I am referring in particular to our ports and a European super-highway of heavy ferries travelling from Rosslare, Cork, Waterford, Foynes, Galway and Dublin.</p> <p>  I think I have asked enough questions of the Minister of State, as others wish to speak.  I thank him for the work he has done.  I wish him every success as he moves forward because he has a big job ahead of him.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1309" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017021500002#C00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the committee.  I still have this image in my head of the fluffy green jersey, so I wonder if the Minister of State is using the right softener.</p> <p>  This is an important issue and we are all trying to be on the same page.  We all accept there are substantial challenges facing the EU, both internally and externally.  The Minister of State has mentioned some of those challenges in this debate.</p> <p>  We all have major concerns about Brexit, so the work we carried out in Brussels was useful in that regard.  Some 15 committees were mentioned and a lot of work is going on.  We are all trying to do our best, be it privately or publicly.  Does the Minister of State have any recommendations for the committee in terms of its work, including outreach and inviting witnesses to appear before it?</p> <p>  We had quite a number of meetings in the couple of days we spent in Brussels, including talks with the European Ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly.  She spoke about the importance of transparency, which links in to the need for citizens' trust to be re-established.  Visiting various committees, one gets a sense that the issue needs to be tackled.  In this committee and others we have discussed how the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, and Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, negotiations were handled.  People had concerns about the secrecy surrounding such fundamental trade deals which impact on people's lives, not just in Europe but also around the globe.  It is important for the public to buy into such deals.</p> <p>  It is similar with the Brexit negotiations.  It is important for all of us wearing the green jersey to have an understanding of the Government's strategy.  We may disagree with, add to or subtract from that strategy but at some stage when we visit various capitals we must have a sense of where the Irish Government stands.</p> <p>  The Minister of State mentioned migration and we all accept that this is the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War.  Some 5,000 people drowned in the Mediterranean last year.  Side deals have been done with some countries, but there has already been criticism of Turkey and Libya.  Does the Minister of State see side deals as the way forward in tackling the refugee crisis?  Should we consider being more supportive of those countries on the front line of migration, particularly Greece and Italy?  Thousands of migrants are landing in those countries daily during the summer months.</p><p> I am conscious that I shall not get an opportunity anywhere else to discuss the fact that Ibahim Halawa is facing his 19th trial hearing having spent three years of his young life behind bars.  Yesterday his trial was postponed again.  We all know the circumstances behind his case and delegations have gone to Egypt.  In the first week of March the foreign Minister for Egypt will attend the EU Council meeting in Malta to discuss the ongoing situation in Egypt.  As no progress was made at the trial hearing yesterday will the Irish Government prioritise the case at the next EU Council meeting and make it clear that there can be no further normalisation of relations between Egypt and the EU while an Irish and European citizen remains in a Cairo prison?  Does the Minister of State share my view on same?</p><p> The Maltese Presidency of the EU has produced a short paper on the future of the Europe.  People have demanded that we build a progressive, prosperous and social Europe that respects sovereignty.  Has the Minister of State got a sense that this goal needs to be prioritised?  Have we learned anything from Brexit?  Even though Ireland campaigned for a remain vote it does not mean that everything is hunky-dory in the European Union.  Clearly huge problems exist that need to be addressed.</p><p> Lastly, does the Irish Government plan to publish a White Paper on Brexit?     </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1360" speakername="Se&aacute;n Haughey" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017021500002#D00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee secretariat for the work that they put into the recent visit to Brussels by the committee.  I also thank the Minister for engaging with us in Brussels and enlightening us on his work on the various issues of the day, most particularly Brexit.</p> <p>  We met important people in Brussels and people openly conveyed their views to us.  Probably one of the most important meetings, without intentionally singling anyone out, was with Michel Barnier and Guy Verhofstadt given their crucial role in Brexit negotiations.  While there was huge sympathy for and understanding of the Irish position, I took the clear message from the meetings that we had to come up with a solution, in particular a solution for the hard border question.  They threw the issues back at us by asking us to come forward with practical and workable solutions.  Is the Government working on practical solutions to this issue?  The Taoiseach informed the D&aacute;il this morning that he brought a memo to Government on the Brexit issue and there will be a big speech this afternoon in the Mansion House.  Have we moved forward with coming up with practical solutions to our particular problems to put on the negotiation table?</p> <p>  When we were in Brussels I picked up on the fact that the committees of the European Parliament, that deal with all of the sectoral issues, have to date prepared 20 reports on Brexit.  I am sure that is a very useful amount of knowledge that has been prepared by the European Parliament.  I hope that the Irish Government will tap into that information.  The committees dwell on the micro-economic issues as they manifest themselves and the reports are available and ongoing.  I am sure they will be a useful resource for Ireland in helping it to tackle this particular challenge.</p> <p>   Can the Minister of State update us on his visits to the European capitals?  The Taoiseach is visiting the Heads of Government and the Minister is visiting his equivalent throughout the member states.  The Minister of State undertook a number of visits throughout the European Union to inform the other 26 member states of our particular concerns and listen to their concerns.  Has the process been finalised?  Have we contacted everybody who needed to be contacted initially?  How is the programme going?</p> <p>  I was interested in what the Minister of State had to say about the challenges that face the European Union and the future of Europe, in particular the Bratislava process that was launched following the vote on the British referendum on 23 June.  I agree with what he said about the Irish position.  I agree that we need to concentrate on practical issues and bring forward a realistic agenda so that the citizens of Europe engage with it, fully promote it and support it.  In particular, he laid emphasis on increased investment and creating more job opportunities with which I agree.  He also mentioned the Single Market and the digital Single Market.  If we can bring forward practical solutions and Europe is seen to deliver then support for the European project will be maintained and increased.  </p> <p>  The Rome Summit will take place on 25 March, which is the 60th anniversary of the Treaties of Rome.  I presume it will be a great opportunity to return to basics and outline for all of us the values of the European Union, what it stands for and what it has prevented.  The European Union has prevented war and brought peace and stability in our time.  The summit should be used to reinforce that agenda.  I look forward to seeing that being rolled out in advance of and following the summit on 25 March.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1393" speakername="Terry Leyden" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017021500002#D00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, his officials and the representatives from the embassies here today.  I heard a great report on his visit to Brussels last week.  I had planned to go and even had my airline ticket booked but unfortunately circumstances prevented me from going.  The meetings were in very good hands and I have heard excellent reports about the meetings that took place.  At a meeting of this committee the Minister of State recommended that we travel as a group to Brussels.  His proposal was implemented by the committee and he was also able to attend as well.  As he will know, I was in Malta to represent the chair of this committee.</p> <p>  I am convinced that there should be a dedicated Brexit Minister.  I have no problem with the Minister of State taking up the role.  Like Britain, we should have a section of a Department to deal with Brexit.  The Prime Minister, Theresa May, is not the Brexit Minister and the President of the Commission does not deal with the negotiations.  I feel that the appointment of a Brexit Minister will happen in the not too distant future.  Fianna F&aacute;il has laid it on the line by appointing a spokesperson on Brexit.  We should have a one-stop-shop unit in Dublin that is dedicated to dealing with and processing everything to do with Brexit.  It would be useful for us to have a unit that an organisation like the IFA, other organisations, business people, investors or exporters could approach to discuss Brexit.  Too many people have their fingers in the pie.  It is unfair on the Taoiseach that he has to be so engaged with the minute details of Brexit.  Of course he and the Cabinet have the overall responsibility.  As I have suggested before, it would be easy to amalgamate the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is quite nonsensical in a small country like ours to have two different Departments, one dealing with raising funds while the other deals with expenditure.  The measure was introduced to satisfy the Labour Party that formed part of the last Government.  It is not a requirement for this Government but that debate is another day's work.  In terms of Brexit, it is important that anything that can be done should be done. </p> <p>  I have heard a report but I do not know whether it is accurate that the Government, or some part of the Government, is considering recreating the customs posts at the Border.  The issue was reported in some newspaper that I read in the past few days.</p><p>I am greatly concerned about that report.  That is something we should never concede at the beginning of negotiations.  We could never consider initiating it or conceding that point because we must have an open border.  I am unsure whether the people present are aware of the situation or whether the Revenue is looking at it.</p><p> Senator Craughwell made some good points.  As part of the preparation for Brexit we must increase and expand our exports to mainland Europe through France.  We have a direct route from Rosslare.  That is important.  We have roll-on, roll-off ferry facilities and the whole question of availability and speed arises.  That is in the transport area but all Departments should feed in to one major overall plan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017021500002#E00200"><p>I congratulate the Minister of State for his adroit chairmanship of the delegation and presentation to the various parties.  Likewise, I congratulate the secretariat here and all the contact people in Brussels as well as the Commissioner, Mr. Hogan, and the permanent staff there for the tremendous work they did in laying on the programme, co-ordinating it and putting it together.  I thank the Minister of State for his hospitality and for his contribution to the process as well.</p><p>Several points come to mind.  I will go through the initial part of the Minister of State's speech.  The question on migration is still live.  Sadly, it reflects on the European Union as a whole.  We all know that this is something that should have been possible to resolve in a better way, rather than the haphazard way in which it was resolved.  It is well and good for people to say we do not want immigrants or people coming ashore and so on.  The end product was that thousands of children lost their lives - they were drowned at sea - and many more starved on the way to what they thought was freedom, solace and comfort.  Whatever they were coming from, they were not running away from health, happiness and good fortune.  They were running for their lives.  Sadly, some countries in the Union saw that as a threat.  The Union, as a whole, needs to come together to recognise the need for co-ordination in such situations, rather than tempting everyone to put up the razor wire, as it were.  I know that countries in the front line are the first in line.  However, the Union has to be able to deal with the situation in a humane and amicable way.  If it does not, then it will continue to reflect badly.</p><p>The future of Europe was referenced and there is no doubt this is timely.  We hope that out of all the stress and trauma from migration, Brexit or whatever, a re-definition of the visions of Europe will re-emerge in a meaningful way that will relate to all the people of Europe.  These people live in Europe and are members of the European Union.  We are not outsiders.  We are all part of Europe and the European Union.  We need to see a recognition of that in future.</p><p>I do not agree with my colleague Senator Terry Leyden in respect of the handling of Brexit.  I believe the one-stop-shop is already in place.  Only one country has a Brexit Minister and that country is leaving the Union.  It would be dangerous to emulate that set-up and have the debate between the country leaving the Union with a specified Minister.  There is a serious danger that we could be categorised in the same way and become part and parcel of that exit strategy.  I would not advise such an approach.</p><p>We were greeted warmly by all the people we met.  We should recognise the great understanding of Ireland's unique position as an island off Europe.  Logistical issues arise and serious issues arise in so far as our future is concerned.  This is the most important time in the history of this State since we joined the European Union.  It is up to ourselves to make of it what we want.  We were encouraged to set out our stall and our list of requirements, as opposed to demands.  Mr. Barnier and Mr. Verhofstadt were vying with each other in respect of how they could be helpful.  That is a useful basis from which to operate.  There was recognition that we are not an adjunct of our next-door neighbour but an independent state.  More important, there was recognition that the European Union recognises the importance of the island of Ireland as an economic and political entity.  There was a recognition that it has worked well, that the peace agreement was sacrosanct and that it was part and parcel of our economy, North and South.  There was also recognition that we did not opt to leave the Union.  The island of Ireland did not opt to leave the Union, although others did.  It is not for us to facilitate others.  It is for us to do the best we can to facilitate the island of Ireland as an economic entity in the first instance.  That has to be borne in mind.  I believe it is borne in mind and all the indications we have received from the Minister of State and from everyone else we met was that it would be borne in mind.</p><p>It is also important to recognise that we are going to be part of the negotiations.  The country and the Taoiseach will be part of the negotiating team on behalf of the European Union.  The Minister of State will be part of the process as well.  Ireland will be part of the process as one of 27 member states.</p><p>As we stand, we have it all to play for.  Whatever emerges from the debate taking place in the coming six months or year &ndash; things will begin to gel into place at that stage &ndash; will have a fundamental and lasting effect on our country and people.  There must be recognition that the customs of the island of Ireland are important.  We are in a happy position now and we need to retain what we have become accustomed to.  We have progressed a long way in this country in the past 30 years, albeit through tough territory and in spite of many obstacles and deviations <i>en route</i>.  Everyone made a contribution to the Good Friday Agreement and the good relationship between North and South.  That is part and parcel of what must remain at the core of any discussions.  I believe that is recognised by everyone.  There is no intention of deviating from that.</p><p>We realise that we are not the only negotiators as well.  There are 26 others and we need to convince them.  I believe the Minister of State has done a good job in touring the capitals of Europe and meeting his counterparts to discuss this issue.  It is clear that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade have done likewise.  In any event, the battle is not over yet.  We need to be careful how we concentrate the argument.  We need to convince our European colleagues of the importance of the survival of the economic entity of Ireland.  Failure to do that would be a failure on the part of the European Union to recognise the integral part we now play in the Union.</p><p>Numerous things will happen quickly once Article 50 is triggered.  Currency fluctuation will take place rapidly, depending on what is said at a given time and place.  That will have a varying effect on our economy on a weekly, if not a daily, basis.  We need to do our job well and achieve what we need to achieve, as opposed to what we want to achieve.  The fundamentals are in place.  That is what we have now.  We cannot afford to lose any part of it, especially because we did not initiate this process.  We will be part and parcel of what happens as a result of the process.  Anyway, we know where we have to go and I know from our discussions with the Minister of State in the course of the meetings and ordinary business that we all recognise that much.</p></speech>

I thank the committee members for their questions and kind words.</p> <p>  I will take the comments in the order that committee members have spoken.  There is some overlap although not a great deal.  Senator Craughwell asked questions about the process and our priorities.</p><p>The process of the divorce, so to speak, has four key pillars.  We must be satisfied at this stage that issues pertaining to Ireland, such as the common travel area and the peace process, are in pillar one and will be dealt with at an early stage.  We will continue to work with the Commission to present solutions for concerns which are unique to Ireland.  It is true to say there is an appetite for us to present solutions and work is ongoing in so far as it can be, because we still have not seen the absolute nature of what the UK will present within the coming four weeks.  Work is being carried out at a very detailed level in many Departments with respect to the movement of people.  The position of everybody, including the Taoiseach, committee members and, to be fair, the British, is we do not want any impediment to the free movement of people around the island.  This is not something we consider possible to dilute in any way.  It is of extreme importance to us with regard to both sides of the Border and east and west.  There is, as committee members have heard, good understanding throughout the EU of the circumstances unique to us.</p><p> The problem we have at citizen level has been mentioned.  It is 100% correct to state we must communicate better what we do as politicians.  We must show the work we do around the table, irrespective of where we are on the political spectrum, is about the citizen.  Something I found most frustrating about the debate and referendum in the UK was continuous reference to the European Union and its institutions in the third person.  Every decision taken by the European Union had British Ministers and officials at the table, but somehow everything was everybody else's fault.  We must ensure all politicians take more account themselves.  I am a strong supporter of the European Union but it would be very silly and simplistic to suggest it is perfect.  Many people feel it can be improved, but we must try to improve it from the inside out, particularly as a small country.</p><p> We will work to support categories and sectors which may be specifically disadvantaged.  The issue of ports and new routes was mentioned.  To follow on from other questions, it is vital we build new alliances and look to diversify into new markets, irrespective of how severe the challenges will be with respect to trade, and this work is ongoing.</p><p> To respond to Deputy Crowe on what the committee can do, it should be robust when senior people are in the country.  The committee should get them to come before it, whether they are Commissioners, politicians or members of committees of other parliaments, and the committee should not just continue to go to Europe at intervals.  Something we should focus on is going before parliamentary committees.  It is of value to meet opposite numbers, Ministers and members of Government.  We did this in Bucharest and Greece several weeks ago and will do so in Hungary and Austria next week.  Through this we get a sense of where cross-party support exists on the issues we bring and our unique circumstances.  We can also pick up on the objectives of other countries. Committee members could speak to Commissioners and explain that as Independent members or as members of Sinn F&eacute;in or Fianna F&aacute;il, they agree with what the Government is doing.  Equally, there would be nothing wrong with committee members stating that in particular areas the Government could do better or that they disagree with policy.  We should embrace this.  The committee will have a very important role given the Ministers with responsibility for Europe will meet on a monthly basis to engage in the negotiations.  The committee will probably be the conduit of the information that will flow between the Ministers.</p><p> The issue of Turkey and migration is absolutely vital.  There are many concerns about the deal done with Turkey.  The &euro;3 billion is going directly to support the refugees.  We must continue to work with countries of origin and countries of transit and try to continue to remove the reasons people leave.</p><p> I could not agree more with regard to what must be the horrendous frustration of Ibrahim Halawa and his family.  We have engaged the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, and the Ceann Comhairle's office and cross-party groups have travelled out.  We have robustly stated we want him to be released and we will continue our work on this.  However, Egypt is a sovereign independent nation with a court process that is what it is.</p><p> I have met Michel Barnier on a number of occasions, the Taoiseach will meet him next week and the committee has also met him.  We will repeatedly engage with Mr. Barnier, who is well abreast through work he did previously as a Commissioner, on issues pertaining to regional policy and the Border region in Northern Ireland.  Very strong importance will be given to the deliberations on the unique elements that exist between parts of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, with respect to the common travel area.  Where we can present solutions to our partners, show they will not impact on them and get their support we should achieve success.</p><p> We are on rounds three and four with many countries with respect to visits, contacts and meetings.  The messages pertaining to our country cannot be said too often, particularly given that negotiations on common travel will take place in the first section.  We share concerns about the trade issues with many countries.  Many countries to the east of the United Kingdom have very similar concerns about exporting food into the large British market and we are working to build alliances.  We can get details on a programme of work involving me, the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, the Taoiseach and other Ministers, particularly those whose remits are most relevant.</p><p> Deputy Haughey spoke about the Rome Summit and getting back to concrete deliverable measures.  He also mentioned the digital Single Market.  Roaming charges have been removed and we have data portability, VAT simplification and copyright improvements.  They benefit all the European Union, but they really benefit small, peripheral and open economies such as ours.</p><p>That is why, at the formation of this Government, I was asked to play a co-ordinating role in the digital Single Market.  While everyone will benefit, the more remote, smaller and more open an economy is, the more such measures will help.</p><p> I like the broad range of topics covered at this committee, and Europe is a very broad church.  We almost always agree with Senator Leyden, but I do not think a Brexit Minister would work and Deputy Durkan gave a couple of reasons.  First, we have a one-stop-shop in the Department of the Taoiseach which has authority when corresponding with Departments such as Finance or Justice and Equality.  There is extra prestige and urgency when a request comes from the mother Department, as it were.  If we had that somewhere else, it might dilute the whole-of-Government approach.  Senior officials in the Department of the Taoiseach have been involved in our Presidencies and they co-ordinate whole-of-Government approaches to European Council meetings.</p><p> The second reason is more practical.  Agriculture and fisheries Ministers frequently meet in Brussels to discuss detailed aspects of fisheries policy, quotas, physical maps, jurisdiction and law.  Transport Ministers might be meeting on the same day to discuss ports or something else, but the meeting might take place in Luxembourg.  At the moment we are talking about everything together, such as the movement of goods and people, the common travel areas and institutions and other bodies, but negotiations on Brexit will be broken into chunks, such as agricultural issues, trade issues etc.  We will need this to be at the very top of the agenda of relevant Ministers.  We do not believe that abdicating responsibility from line Ministers to anybody else would be in our best interests.  I am not fully sure where the UK Brexit Minister will sit.  Boris Johnson is Foreign Secretary but its finance Minister and others will also be present.  We are not sure if the Brexit Minister will have a co-ordinating role back in the UK or whether it will be Theresa May.  It will be a full-time function of mine and my team but that will also apply to many others.</p><p> There was a question on Border posts.  We need to be clear that this was a decision of the United Kingdom.  The UK has decided to leave but we are not leaving.  We will not be the ones putting any customs posts up on this island.  We do not want them and will not initiate them.  We will be working hard to minimise the effect on our people and we will not do this work or come up with any solutions that work against our national interests.  We respect the UK's decision but we fundamentally think it was the wrong thing to do.  The UK has said it does not want to be in the Single Market but we want to be in the Single Market.  The UK has not yet told us how they propose to square the circle with respect to the customs union.</p></speech>

The UK is out of the Single Market and has a new customs arrangement.  These will present difficulties but they are not ours.  The UK will have to look very seriously at the implications.</p> <p>  Deputy Durkan said there were concerns relevant to the island of Ireland, and that is true, but we need to continue to work on the specific difficulties as the discussions evolve.  The issues show the importance of the all-Ireland civic dialogue, and we should continue with sectoral groups looking at specific concerns as they arise, sector by sector.  There will be a differentiation between the part that deals with the free movement of people and those parts dealing with the free movement of goods, services and trade, which may take a long time to establish.  This goes back to Senator Leyden's question about the customs relationship.  We do not know what that will be, but preparations are very much ongoing to consider the potential outcomes, though this should not be mistaken in any way for an acceptance that there should be restrictions.</p> <p>  If members wish to send further questions by e-mail, we will be happy to give more detail.  I apologise to Heidi Lougheed and the committee secretariat for not acknowledging the great work they did in preparing for this.</p></speech>

Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, distinguished Members of the Irish Houses of Parliament.  It is a privilege for us to be here today and to make ourselves and our knowledge and understanding available to the distinguished members of this parliamentary committee.  This is a matter of importance in Ireland.  We understand this very well.  It is also very important for the European Commission and it is also important across the European Union because water is a basic element of life and is vital for the balanced and sustainable development of our societies.</p> <p>  We are also deeply respectful of the current political process in Ireland, involving the Parliament, the Government, and large swathes of Irish society because we believe that any legal rule and obligation must be understood properly and perceived as profitable for the society in which it applies.  There is no simple obligation by constraint.  The rules must be understood, as well as their sense and the overarching objectives they serve.  There is no blind compliance and no theoretical or abstract compliance in itself.  There are objectives of societal importance and they must be understood and accepted by large majorities of our societies.</p> <p>  This is the situation in this case where several obligations and rules of the EU Water Framework Directive are at stake.  The circumstances predominating in Ireland are very important.  The EU Water Framework Directive is not intended to be applied in an abstract world.  It must be applied in the concrete circumstances of each EU member state and in this case in Ireland, with the geographical and environmental peculiarities, with the social, economic and political peculiarities and characteristics of Ireland.  We believe that the Water Framework Directive is a sufficiently flexible instrument, allowing member states to comply with its obligations while paying utmost attention to the particulars of their economies, societies and societal interests.  This is why it is called a framework and it is a directive. </p> <p>  We have been mindful of the fact that this distinguished committee has paid attention in past hearings to the challenges faced by the Irish water system, an infrastructure which is in serious need of upgrade and where the level of leakage is high.  There is clear evidence that previous water pricing policies have been ineffective in providing both the revenues to ensure the necessary levels of investment and the incentives to citizens to use water efficiently.  Ireland's non-compliance with the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive, as illustrated also by the measure taken today by the political college of the European Commission in Brussels, and with the Drinking Water Directive, are cases in point.  We have been mindful of the conclusions of the expert committee that was engaged to make some recommendations and to explore the matters for the attention of the parliamentary committee.  We have also noticed that the expert committee noted that Ireland is a long way from achieving a good status in its waters under the Water Framework Directive and that no overall improvement in water quality was recorded between 2009 and 2015.  The services of the European Commission endorse the findings of the committee which we believe are objective.</p> <p>  Against this backdrop the fundamental questions which deserve an earnest public debate and appropriate solutions are, one, how to secure equal access to good quality and healthy drinking water and good quality water services for all citizens whether vulnerable children or elderly people, rich or poor, working or unemployed.</p><p>Ensuring healthy drinking water means protecting the health of Irish citizens.  This is of paramount importance and does not apply only to the health of an abstract Irish citizen.  It applies to every individual who lives on the territory of the Republic of Ireland and benefits from water services.  The second important question is how to avoid wasteful expenses for the public purse, generated by significant leaks and malfunctions, and to address the inability to provide drinking water of sufficient quality.  I am sure Irish lawmakers and citizens have a very clear understanding of how careful spending of the public budget can lead to the utmost benefit being reaped.</p><p> A third crucial question is how to secure the smart investments required for upgrading the water sector as a public service.  The water framework directive is a flexible instrument allowing the public authorities of each EU country to ask these questions in a way that best fits the local circumstances.  Water pricing policy must comply with the cornerstone principles of cost recovery and polluter pays, but there is wide scope for adaptation to specific societal and economic circumstances.  The paramount argument in this respect is taken straight from the directive, and is that national authorities are allowed to take into account, when establishing differentiated water tariffs, the variation in economic and social conditions in their respective jurisdictions.  Therefore, there is room for social tariffs for vulnerable citizens.</p><p> The recovery of costs must ensure the water sector meets its serious needs in terms of both maintenance and investment in water and wastewater infrastructure.  In order to comply with the polluter pays principle and for the charges for excessive or wasteful use to attain their purpose, the consumption of water for normal use should be set at a reasonable level and the charges for excessive or wasteful use should be dissuasive.  This entails the ability to objectively and consistently measure the amount of water used.</p><p> The European Commission and its services remain at the disposal of Irish authorities during this hearing, after this hearing and throughout the deliberative process for any further exchanges that are necessary.</p></speech>

We are working through the recommendations of the expert commission report.  If we accept the commission's recommendation that, in the future, we should pay for normal water usage through general taxation, we would like as generous a daily allowance as possible up to the point where excessive usage kicks in.  What is the Commission's view of the expert commission's proposal?  Does it comply with Article 9 and does it fit in with the polluter pays principle?  If so, at what point would a personal allowance meet excessive usage?  We would want to give the general allowance but also stay within the confines of the water framework directive.</p> <p>  If Ireland reverts to the previous system whereby water infrastructure is funded through general taxation, what does the Commission do next?  Would we automatically face infringement proceedings?  What would the process be?  In such a scenario, can Mr. Ciobanu-Dordea give a range of possible fines the European Court of Justice could impose?  Can he outline the likely fines related to the case he referenced, in which the Commission is taking Ireland to the European Court of Justice in respect of urban wastewater?  Finally, has Ireland used or forfeited its derogation under the water framework directive in the past?</p></speech>

We are indeed here on behalf of our Commissioner, Karmenu Vella, who is in charge of environmental, fisheries and maritime affairs.  We officially represent the European Commission and are not here in a private capacity.  The Commission appreciates the findings of, and the process and analysis performed by, the expert committee.  One might wish to be more nuanced about various recommendations but it is not our purpose, at this stage of the deliberation in Ireland, to act as a review body for the recommendations of the expert committee.  We need to leave room for the experts to exchange views and for politicians to discuss the issues with the public and to deliberate.  It is not the role of the European Commission to act as a professor who reviews the debate at every stage.  We are a public authority, entrusted with specific competences, but we also have to pay attention to the principle of subsidiarity and there is room for the application of subsidiarity when applying the EU water framework directive.</p> <p>  When making a deliberation about the new system the Irish authorities should have a careful look at the broad picture.  What is Ireland's situation in terms of the provisions and quality of water services and access to services for all citizens?  Which are the positive and less positive sides of the water system in Ireland?  We have drawn the attention of the Irish authorities to a few serious shortcomings, such as the 45% leak rate.  This is significant and was also mentioned by representatives of Irish Water.</p><p>In addition, in a large number of agglomerations the secondary and tertiary treatment of urban wastewater is not appropriate to a significant extent.  Also, the need for investment in modernising the system, bringing it up to speed and making it able to expand and to provide ever finer services for a society in development are fairly significant, amounting to &euro;13 billion.  The solution that must be developed must allow for the consistent appropriate funding over a longer period of time of a system in dire need of upgrading and modernisation.</p><p> The formula that is developed is, first and foremost, in the hands of the Irish authorities but I would also draw the committee's attention to the following because it has asked about the charge for excessive usage.  We believe that one cannot discuss only such a charge and one needs to discuss also the charge for normal use.  One needs to define the objective parameters based on objective criteria on the basis of which one can establish what means normal use.  We would draw the committee's attention also to the fact that when one speaks about normal and excessive, one needs to have a reference, that is, what would be the reference, tool or instrument that would allow any careful public authority to identify who is consuming excessively and who is consuming normally on the ground.  We believe that this brings into the discussion the problem of metering.  We note that good progress was made in past years by the Irish authorities, in particular, by Irish Water, in advancing the problem of metering.</p><p> We are also aware of the public sensitivities and the concerns, and even protests, that have been expressed in Irish society against this and this is why we appreciate so much the reflection time and discussion that is being organised by the Irish authorities.  We believe that the discussion, if possible, can be run also based on objective arguments.  No public discussion is only based on objective arguments and only on facts and figures.  Emotions are also at stake and reactions and subjective aspects are hugely at stake as well, but there must be a grain of truth and some objective elements at the basis of it.  There must be an awareness that when discussing charges, as a short-cut we say, "water charges", in fact, it is not about charges for the water itself but for the water services which every citizen must enjoy to the protection of his or her health.</p><p> Of course, there is plenty of water in Ireland.  It rains a lot and the ground of Ireland is also rich in water resources, but few drink water straight from the collection of rainwater.  Nobody uses a straw to drink water from the ground.  One needs abstraction.  One needs processing, filtration and elimination of carcinogenic elements.  We are aware that ever more chemical substances are identified as having carcinogenic potential or are simply damaging to human health and the providers of water services must be able to identify, select and eliminate from the water provided such substances.  The adequate processing of urban wastewater treatment is ever more important for the economy and for the society as well.  Drinking water, as I have mentioned, and also other elements, such as compliance with the Nitrates Directives and the relationship with agricultural activities, may come into play.  I say "the relationship with agricultural activities" because there must be no opposition between the concerns for water quality and agricultural activities.  Solutions are possible in order to reconcile both interests.</p><p> The distinguished Deputy asked me also about the infringement procedures.  Certainly nobody would authorise a civil servant to say whether Ireland or whatever member state would be in infringement if it proceeds in one way or another simply because this is a prerogative of the political college of the Commission and I cannot anticipate the judgment.  Of course, there is a political judgment, but it will be based on objective elements.  I can tell the committee, because this is no matter of secrecy and no matter of discretion, there are objective elements to say that currently Ireland is not complying with the Water Framework Directive since it suspended the application of the water charges.  We believe also that as the situation evolves on different fronts of the water infrastructure, the situation becomes tighter and tighter.  There are such objective elements to making such a decision.</p><p> I am bound by the committee to be honest and draw its attention to certain matters.  In the public perception, matters get mixed up.  People say that if one sends a member state to the Court of Justice then this is for fines.  The first judgment of the Court of Justice that will declare a member state in violation of a certain rule of EU law is not a judgment that applies fines.  The member state will have 18 months from that judgment in order to present a programme of compliance and to comply with that judgment in principle, and only a second referral by the European Commission of that member state to the Court of Justice in Luxembourg will lead to fines.  Therefore, there is time before fines are applied and we believe it is in the vital interest not only of Ireland and of Irish society but of any member state, not to waste time and to litigate with the Damocles sword of the fines at the end of the road but rather to think about and act on complying.</p><p> Of course, sometimes solutions are easier at hand.  Other times a situation is more complex and more delicate, and more investments are required or certain deliberations are more difficult.  The Commission, not because it is warm-hearted but because it is its obligation to do so, understands these realities and understands the differences between the member states.  There is a single line or thread for all member states, but there are also national specificities.  We are ready to engage with the Irish authorities on any compliance path and commitment leading to lasting solutions to the water infrastructure that serve the Irish citizen.  I will stop there.</p></speech>

To lead on from the previous question, does Mr. Ciobanu-Dordea accept that we had a derogation from domestic water charges under Article 9 of the EU framework directive in 2000?  That is the first question.  Second, what is his and the Commission's definition of "established practice" as it relates to the delivery of water services and as mentioned in the Water Framework Directive?  I will move on to the river basin management plan of 2010, which Mr. Ciobanu-Dordea mentioned and which he believes constitutes the loss of the initial interpretation - if he confirms it existed - of the directive dating back to 2000.  If that is the case, is Mr. Ciobanu-Dordea implying that there is a shift in his interpretation of established practice?  What is his view on the legality of the suspension period that we are in currently?  We still feel we can meet the objectives of the Water Framework Directive with the suspension in place.  Has the Commission been in contact with the CER or the EPA about its contention, belief and opinion that we are in contravention of the EU framework directive?</p></speech>

The term "established practice" is only used in paragraph (4) of Article 9 of the Water Framework Directive and it has certain conditions attached to it.  It has a derogation from the obligations to establish a water pricing policy as in Article 9(1).  Among these conditions is the requirement that the member states report the reasons for not fully applying paragraph (1) in the river basin management plans.  We consider that Article 9(4) is applied at the moment when the river basin management plan is adopted.  That is when any recourse to this exemption should have been done, if appropriate.</p></speech>

The Commission decided to change its interpretation of it on submission of the river basin management plan, which is its right to do so if it so wishes.  We do not agree.  If there is to be an adjudication on it, it is beyond our control.  That is all I will say on it.</p> <p>  What is the Commission's interpretation of the legality of the suspension period considering that, in our opinion, it too relates back to the initial derogation and the objectives in it and our establishment of an established practice based on it being paid for out of taxation in 2000?  The Commission would question the legality of this period if it were to follow on from what Mr. Ciobanu-Dordea just said.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.92" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conleth Bradley" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FFJ2017021500002#F00700"><p>I appreciate Mr. Ciobanu-Dordea's answer, which was interesting and useful.  The objective of the Water Framework Directive, as he outlined, is about quality, not quantity.  The terms of Article 9.4 are interesting.  The reporting of the non-compliance or the derogation is in the report on the river basin management plan, but the reference to an established practice is an important point.  I am sure that Mr. Ciobanu-Dordea is not that familiar with established practice under Irish law.  There are key dates for ascertaining the established practice.  The beginning was 1962, when the Public Health (Ireland) Act 1896 was amended.  Other keystone dates are 1983, 1997, 2013 and 2016.  To ascertain established practice, one must examine the range of the established practice.  When the directive came into force, the established practice was not to charge.  As Members will know well, the history of established practice in Ireland is tied into local government and the responsibility of elected members versus the executive.  In my respectful view, it is clear that the established practice applies in the way that I have described, that being, the established practice on the key date was not to charge.</p> <p>  Mr. Ciobanu-Dordea referred to the river basin management plans.  That relates to the reportage aspect of Article 9.4.  The key phrase is "established practice".</p> <p>  I wish to mention another matter relating to Article 9.  Mr. Ciobanu-Dordea will be aware of a recent decision of the European Court of Justice, ECJ, involving a hydroelectric plan.  The Commission took Germany to the ECJ in an infringement action and lost.  Important principles arose from that case.  I accept that it was about a hydroelectric plan, but it was the first challenge under the Water Framework Directive.  That decision has been recently upheld in a case taken by the Commission against Austria, where the ECJ again confirmed what Mr. Ciobanu-Dordea has correctly set out, namely, the margin of appreciation or discretion that is given to a member state.</p> <p>  This is about quality, not quantity, and the margin of appreciation given to a member state.  It is important that the Commission be aware of this, which I am sure it is.  That margin of appreciation was emphasised in the ECJ decision.</p></speech>

This conversation is important to us, so I am fine with letting it flow because it is core to our deliberation, but if possible, can the witnesses keep comments as tight as possible?

We have never publicised that.  When this committee sought its content, we made that available to it.  We are here today to enforce that in as best a way as we can because it is our belief that the D&aacute;il may accept a recommendation from this committee to revert to a non-charging regime and allow water charges and services to be paid for by the customer, namely, the State.  We have every right to make this committee aware of the sound legal advice that backs up the contention that we have held for some time.  I did not abuse that advice by making it public.

There have been newspaper articles arguing that if we abolish domestic water charges, we will face immediate and very substantial fines from the European Court of Justice and the European Commission.  Therefore, we understand all of this is important for ourselves and the public.  I have three sets of questions for the Commission and Mr. Bradley and Mr. Kelly because I am interested in their respective views.</p> <p>  What is really crucial is that Article 9.4, as outlined, sets out two criteria.  The first is the idea of established practice, while the second is the achievement of the objectives of the directive as outlined in Article 1.  I am a little confused as to the Commission's position because between 2010 and 2014, in both public and on the record comments, it seemed to have changed its position.  I will outline what I mean by that and then seek a response.  </p> <p>  In 2010 when he was a Labour Party Member of the European Parliament Deputy Alan Kelly asked a parliamentary question of the then Commissioner and was told very clearly "where this is an established practice at the time of the adoption of the directive".  The interpretation of the part of the answer by many people is that established practice, as per the water framework directive, means whatever the established practice of the member state was at the time the directive was passed in 2000.  There is nothing in that answer that relates to whether a member state chose to invoke the derogation in its 2009 river basin management plan.  That is reinforced by a subsequent communication to Ms Lynn Boylan, MEP, from the Directorate-General for the Environment in 2014.  She asked whether it was possible to reinvoke Article 9.4, despite the fact that it had not been used in 2009.  The answer was as follows: "On the basis of-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.133" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FFJ2017021500002#G00400"><p>Yes, absolutely.  It read: "On the basis of the information reported to the Commission, Ireland has not made use of Article 9(4)" in its first river basin management plan, as we know.  It went on to state that should Ireland wish to rely on the provisions of Article 9.4 in its second river basin management plan, a justification would need to be provided in that plan, including drafts, in order that the public could effectively comment thereon.  Like all member states, if Ireland invokes Article 9.4, the Commission "shall carefully consider whether the conditions of this flexibility provision are met at that stage".  Let us fast-forward to 2016, bearing in mind that this had been the position of the Commission in all correspondence with MEPs who had asked the question between 2014 and 2016.  In 2016 the Commission started to insert a new argument.  In a reply to Ms Marian Harkin, MEP, it stated, as the representatives present have outlined, that if Ireland did not invoke Article 9.4 in its first river basin management plan, it could not do so in the second.  These were three Commission responses, in the first two of which it was very clear that established practice was whatever it was when the water framework directive was enacted and that member states could apply to invoke the provisions of Article 9.4, although there was no guarantee that its request would be granted because it would have to be assessed in the context of the second river basin management plan.  Why did the Commission change its position in 2016 from that adopted between 2010 to 2014, as outlined in the documents referenced?  </p> <p>  I will pose my other two questions now to save time.  The second issue concerns the new position of the Commission.  It does not involve invoking established practice but talks about a "clear commitment" to introduce water charges in the river basin management plan of 2009.  I am interested in knowing, from a legal point of view, whether established practice is the same as a "clear commitment" to introduce water charges.  Clearly, if this matter ends up in the European Court of Justice, that will be a relevant question and the answer to it will be one this committee will need to assess.  </p> <p>  My third question relates to the other part of Article 9.4 which refers to the objectives of Article 1 of the directive.  The directive is really about these core objectives.  That is part of the point Mr. Bradley was making.  If a member state, in its river basin management plan and its accompanying investment plan for water infrastructure, is demonstrating that it is meeting the objectives set out in Article 1 of the directive, how could it be in breach of the directive and how could enforcement proceedings be taken against it?  That is why the German case is so important.  If I understood the ruling of the European Court of Justice correctly, it stated that, notwithstanding the fact that there was not full-cost recovery or adherence to the polluter pays principle in that particular water use case, because there was no evidence that the non-charging for water use was having any negative impact in achieving the objectives of  Article 1, there was no case to be heard.  As Mr. Bradley said, that decision has been upheld in subsequent judgments.  I would like to hear the views of the delegates in that regard.</p> <p>  There are two jurisdictions that do not have in place the type of domestic funding regime the Commission clearly prefers, one of which is Scotland.  Representatives from that country outlined their rationale to the committee.  As we know, the other jurisdiction is Northern Ireland.  Are there infringement proceedings pending against either of these jurisdictions for not having the cost-recovery and polluter pays model that the delegates have outlined?  Does the Commission have any intention of bringing proceedings against them?  If not, how can it state they can do it but Ireland cannot?</p></speech>

In response to the contributions of Mr. Bradley and Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin - I also said this at the beginning of my contribution - we should go beyond the legal discussion.  This is not just a legalistic issue between attorneys and lawyers; it is about much more than that.  I am not trying to relativise the objectivity of law and the rules, but it is more than just a discussion about what is meant by established practice.  I hope my remarks will not be deemed inappropriate, but we must think about the international custom, a concept lawyers understand well.  Let us say we have a rule that has been applied for a long number of years and we have behaviour that has been repeated for a long number of years until it becomes a rule and it is considered to be a consequence of application.  If an actor or player intervenes and changes the rules, this changes the established practice.  One has it until one changes the practice.  One can then no longer claim the international customary law and-----</p></speech>

If the Commission had been applying the principles it has been applying since 2016, the reply in 2014 would have stated Ireland could not invoke Article 9.4 because it had not included it in the 2009 river basin management plan and that, therefore, it no longer had that entitlement.  However, what the Commission stated at that stage was that if Ireland was going to invoke the article, it would have to outline the reasons for so doing and that the matter would be considered in the context of the second river basin management plan.</p></speech>

It is important for members to hear the details of the case because it is ECJ case law.</p></speech>

It begins, &quot;Water is not a commercial product like any other&quot;, and goes on to refer to &quot;diverse conditions&quot;.  It continues:</p><blockquote>This Directive aims at maintaining and improving the aquatic environment in the Community.  This purpose is primarily concerned with the quality of the waters concerned ... The ultimate aim of this Directive is to achieve the elimination of priority hazardous substances and contribute to achieving concentrations in the marine environment near background values for naturally occurring substances.</blockquote> <p>The directive recognises that member states can and should look at diverse national considerations.  When the derogation in Article 9.4 of the directive was introduced, it was known colloquially as the &quot;Irish derogation&quot;.  It was introduced specifically to meet conditions in Ireland where water had not historically been charged for in this way.  When the Commission first proposed the derogation, it also proposed full cost recovery, but that was dropped during the conciliation process.  That was recognised in the German case as significant.  It is.  It is not about cost recovery.  The purpose of the directive is to improve the quality of water and deliver high quality water services.  It is not about cost recovery.  It is up to Ireland or any other country to demonstrate that it has an established practice to which large numbers of people are continuing to adhere.  That should be relatively easy in the case of Ireland because it has had this established practice.  In my view as a lawyer, a country does not cease to have an established practice.  Despite some of the comments made, I am not a member of any political party here or anywhere else.  I gave independent legal advice.  The established practice in a country will remain in place until it can successfully put something else in place.  Under the Irish system, it is subsidised from general taxation.  That is how it is seen from the point of view of the public.  People are not reaching into their pockets to pay for water.  If that is to be changed, something else has to be put in place, but nothing else has successfully been put in place.  That is why it is quite clear that the use of the derogation continues to be available to Ireland.<br/><br/>As I set out in the note I was asked to prepare for the committee, an unsuccessful attempt to change an established practice means the practice in question has not been changed.  By definition and as a matter of logic, it continues.  While it is true that the Commission may do A, B, C and D, we live in a system of democracy governed by the rule of law.  The Commission does not have its way.  If, for example, the Commission says &quot;no&quot; and means &quot;no&quot;, we have a legal system to test this under which certain procedures must be gone through.  I know from my experience of litigating before the court that it does not always agree - far from it - with the Commission.  The Commission regularly loses cases before the court.  The mere fact that the Commission is taking a particular view should not influence this committee to believe this view will prevail - far from it - because it is a long process.  The Commission has to come back, set out its position fully, notify Ireland of it, hear what Ireland has to say, take account of it and be satisfied that it impedes or compromises the purpose of the directive.  The Commission will have an uphill task on the latter consideration alone.  It is going to be rather difficult.  It would then have to satisfy the court that Ireland was in breach of the directive.  As I said, this needs to be considered in the context of basic principles and established practice.  As a lawyer, I would find it very difficult to understand how it could be said the established practice was not still in operation, given what had happened.  It is still in operation in Ireland.</p></speech>

I accept Mr. Ciobanu-Dordea's emphasis on the margin of appreciation given, but it has to be the margin of appreciation given to the member state.  It cannot be the Commission's, as it cannot have it every way.  There is either a margin of appreciation or there is not.  I said the German case involved hydroelectric issues.  The points of principle established by the European Court of Justice in that case are important.  If anybody wants to read them, they are set out in paragraphs 47 and 51 of the judgment.  These important points of principle apply to the discussion we are having.  I will summarise them.  Article 9 does not state there is an absolute requirement to bring in charges.  Article 9 which is about river basin management has to be read in the context of Articles 4, 5 and 11.  The committee can look at this later because I do not propose to go into the details of it now.  When the European Court of Justice considers these matters, it looks at them from an holistic perspective.  Mr. Ciobanu-Dordea is absolutely correct when he says this is about quality rather than quantity.  When we consider Article 9.4 of the directive which refers to "established practices", we must look at how Ireland dealt with water services from 1962 to 2016.  I will not go back to the Public Health (Ireland) Act 1878.  Everybody is looking at key dates.  When the directive was in force, charging was done by way of general taxation as an established practice.  Everyone who has worked in a local authority will know what went on between the elected members and the executive in the case of service charges.</p></speech>

There needs to be a fair reading of Article 9.4 in order that readers will not lure themselves into wrongful interpretations.  I draw the attention of the distinguished members of the committee and those who are observing the meeting to the fact that Article 9.4 makes it clear that the concept of established practice can come into play "where this does not compromise the purposes and the achievement of the objectives of this Directive".  I also draw their attention to two additional simple and clear elements of the directive.  The obligation to introduce water charges was to be met by 2010.  More importantly, the objectives of the directive were to be attained by 2015.  I want to see future river basin management plans that will show how these objectives which have not been attained were attained two years ago.  I want to see those plans.  I rest my case.</p></speech>

It is nothing personal when I say I do not believe the European Commission is respecting the political process here.  It is doing the very opposite.  I refer to the letters sent to the expert commission and the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney.  I suggest Mr. Ciobanu-Dordea's presentation was designed to state we did not have political choices.  The message is that the political choice not to have water charge made by the people through boycott and protest and in last year's general election is not legitimate and cannot be upheld without fines.</p><p>I fundamentally disagree with that.</p><p> I will go through questions one by one to try to make it more concise and in order that we do not lose them.  First, I return to the question of inconsistency.  I think two different questions were mixed up a bit in the witness's response.  Let us forget about what the Irish Government is doing in saying whether it has water charges or not.  That does not matter.  Let us forget about what we define as established practice, etc.  The difference between the answers in 2010 and 2016 is very substantial.  It does not relate to anything that the Irish Government is doing.  It relates to a different interpretation of the European Commission on article 9(4) of the water framework directive.  I seek clarity on why this changed and an admission that it did change.</p><p> The answer to Deputy Alan Kelly in 2010 was as follows: "Article 9(4) provides the possibility for Member States not to apply the provisions of Article 9(1) to a given water-use activity, where this is an established practice at the time of adoption of the directive".  That answer defines that article 9(4) kicks in "where this is an established practice at the time of adoption of the directive".  In other words, that was in 2003.  The answer given in 2016 to Marian Harkin, MEP, effectively said that the current practice is to have water charges.  We can get into a debate separately about that.  In 2010, it clearly said "at the time of adoption of the directive".  In 2016, it effectively said at the current time.  Why has that changed?</p></speech>

If I would like to be polemical with the Deputy, I would say that the Deputy thinks that every opinion that is provided upon request of the Irish authorities is an interference with the political process.  However, I do not want to be polemical and I cannot afford to be polemical with the Deputy.  Nevertheless, I still draw his attention to the fact that the Commission responded to the invitation of the Irish authorities to state our opinion, to be here as witnesses and to be interrogated.  The second answer is that we did not change any interpretation of the established practice element or of article 9(4).  The situation has evolved in time and the essential element is the fact that that concretely on the ground the practice has changed.</p></speech>

That is fine.  At least we have an acknowledgement that the answer has changed.</p> <p>  The second point relates to established practice.  Why does the Deputy think the word "established" exists in article 9(4)?  What the witness explained as established is just a matter of practice or of something changing.  If something changes over time, there is a different practice.  However, it did not just say "practice".  It said "established practice".  For example, I have never paid water charges in this country.  There are many people in this country who have never paid water charges.</p></speech>

Is it in favour of water privatisation?  Is it the case that the troika agreement with Greece included an agreement for the privatisation of two Greek public water companies in Athens and Thessaloniki?  Is it the case that the troika agreement with Portugal included the privatisation of water services?</p></speech>

They are very important ones.  The Commission is a political body but nobody is above the rule of law.  Also, in its political decisions, the Commission does not and cannot go beyond the law.  I am not aware of the details of the IMF agreement with Greece but I point the Deputy to the treaty provision that says that the property regime of the member states is not interfered with by the provision of the treaties.  We cannot impose one philosophy or another.  We do not have a doctrine in favour or against the privatisation of the water services.<br/><br/>My general point is that we bring to the committee's attention for its deliberation elements of relevance to the political judgment.  We do not impose any solution.  We are not in favour of or against water charges.  However, we point to the fact that the overwhelming majority of the continental member states of the European Union have water charges and metering in different forms and with different degrees of flexibility.  This proves that the system works.  The system is not overwhelming in terms of the financial burden for the consumer and the citizen who receives the water services.  We are bound by the reality that any <i>retour en arri&egrave;re</i>or return to the <i>status quo ante</i>will mean the return to a system that did not function properly.  I will use a comparison.  In terms of secondary urban waste water treatment, Scotland is okay up to 98% of the population.  In Ireland, that level is only 53.1% of the population.  This is only one indicator of the challenges of the system.  The committee has to make a judgment and a decision against a backdrop of these concrete elements.</p></speech>

Mr. Ciobanu-Dordea seems to be saying that if a practice has continued in a country for many years and then there is a proposal to change it, it suddenly ceases to be established practice and the proposal becomes established practice.  Why is the word "established" used?  It is not "changed practice", but "established practice".  Does the witness not take Deputy Kelly's point that if there is an established practice, it remains so until something workable is put in its place?  Clearly that has not happened in Ireland.  Without getting too far into the complexities of this, is the witness saying that to meet the objectives of article 9(4) there has to be a system of individual payment?</p><p>Reference has been made to the polluter pays principle.  If taxpayers generally are paying, then the polluter pays principle surely is satisfied.  Where does it say, imply or direct that there must be individual charging?  If that is indeed what the directive implies and if there is something in the directive that says as much, has the Commission taken any legal action against Northern Ireland?  Northern Ireland does not have an individual charging system.  Has the Commission taken any legal action against Scotland?  Are we the only people against whom legal action is being taken?  The Commission officials have said, rightly, that no one is above the law, but no one is below it either.</p><p> What is the relevance of the directive to metering?  Does the directive encompass the provision of metering or would district metering be sufficient?  Do we need any kind of metering at all?</p></speech>

Article 9.4 is an exemption to an obligation.  Exemptions have to be interpreted narrowly.  Article 9.4 provides for an exemption to an obligation to establish a water pricing policy in accordance with the cost recovery principle and the polluter pays principle, the latter principle being part of the treaty, by the way.  The exemption, therefore, needs to be interpreted narrowly.</p> <p>  The context relates to before the first river basin management plan was adopted.  We wrote that to apply Article 9.4, we believe that it must have been established practice by the time of adoption of the directive and the practice must have been consistently maintained until the adoption of the river basin management plan.  Then, in respect of that river basin management plan, the member states would have to give the reasons for not applying a water pricing policy according to the cost recovery and polluter pays principles as long as they met the objectives of the Water Framework Directive.</p> <p>  It is a pity that Mr. Murphy has left the room.  This is the sense of the addition that we made in 2010 to the established practice at the time of the adoption of the directive.  The idea was to avoid member states abolishing water charges in 2006, for example, and then claiming that the situation was established practice.  It is not a symmetrical issue.

We made our intervention on metering at the beginning in the context of the recommendations from the expert commission.  The expert commission recommends that a charge for wasteful use of water is implemented in Ireland.  It is for the country to consider how to do it.  What we are saying is that the only way to do that is to implement metering.  Metering for domestic use is general practice in the whole of the EU, with few exceptions.  The committee has invited representatives from exempted areas to give evidence to the committee recently.  This applies in Scotland, for example, as well as some parts of England and Wales and Northern Ireland as well.  The rest of the EU is using metering generally for domestic households.  It is generalised.</p> <p>  It is a well-established practice, if I may use the term, to promote conservation and to have a fair water charging system in place.  Deputy O'Dea referred to Scotland and Northern Ireland.  My colleague, Mr. Ciobanu-Dordea, referred to the need to avoid looking at the obligations of the Water Framework Directive in isolation.  Article 9 is in place to support the achievement of the objectives of the directive.  That is why, as Mr. Bradley mentioned, it is part of the programme of measures relating to water pricing policy.  I say as much because of comments relating to whether the Commission could reproach Scotland and Northern Ireland as regards the water services if they have compliance that is close to 100%.  Urban wastewater treatment directive compliance is close to 100% in those countries.  This is not the case in Ireland.</p></speech>

My question is whether, to comply with the EU directive, there is any requirement for individual metering.  The fact that it is generalised does not necessarily mean there is any requirement to have individual meters.</p> <p>  The Commission representatives are suggesting, by admitting that the Commission is not taking action against Scotland, that individual charging is not really essential under the directive to comply with the objectives of the directive.  Is that the case?</p></speech>

I thank the delegation for attending the meeting.</p> <p>  Mr. Aurel Ciobanu-Dordea said he is available to the committee for further consultation should we have any further questions later.  If he is willing, I suggest that, when we get to the point where we may have a draft proposal, we can ask Mr. Aurel Ciobanu-Dordea some questions at that stage.  If there are fines, they are decided on by the European court but are based on objective elements.  Can we run by Mr. Aurel Ciobanu-Dordea the committee's recommendations to see, from the objective facts, whether they would be in compliance with EU directives?</p> <p>  In his letter to the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, as well as in his letter to the expert group, Mr. Aurel Ciobanu-Dordea referred to the principle of the polluter pays as being fundamental to the directive.  We have heard other interpretations around this, such as we can have a derogation because of established practice.  However, I am sure we also have to comply with the fundamental intentions of the directive, part of which is the polluter pays principle.  Will Mr. Aurel Ciobanu-Dordea clarify if the polluter pays principle has to be part of any solution we come up with?  He has been clear that there is a certain amount of discretion to the member state to comply.  Ultimately, we all have to comply.</p> <p>  The expert commission report stated excessive or wasteful use of water will be discouraged by applying a tariff for such use and, therefore, is consistent with the polluter pays principle.  There is a general view in this committee, as well as in the expert report, that there should not be a charge for normal use but that there should be a charge for excessive use.  In Scotland, there is a charge for water services.  It is taken in through the household tax which varies in accordance with the size of the house.  Does that protect a country like Scotland?  Scottish Water was at the committee recently and informed us it has district metering.   It can use the information from that to pinpoint where there may be excessive use in a particular district and approach those who may be causing excessive use.  Scottish Water has a system in place to deal with excessive use and it also has a system of paying in place.</p> <p>  In my view, the Scottish situation is totally different from the Irish situation where we are proposing to have no charge whatsoever.  Is there any other way of charging for excessive use if one does not have meters?  If the outcome of this committee is that there should be a normal household free allowance, paid by the State through central taxation, but that excessive use should be paid for by the individual, then we are obviously not adopting the Scottish model because we will not have a general payment through local taxes.  Maybe that will be an option.  How can we actually comply with the polluter pays principle if we do not have meters?  Is there any other way?</p> <p>  In his presentation, Mr. Aurel Ciobanu-Dordea spoke about room for social tariffs.  Will he elaborate on this?  Does that mean allowances could be made for households with illnesses which require extra water?</p></speech>

It is normal in general in environmental practice.  It is among the environmental rules and should be part of the solution.  We would also like to point out the fact that in practice it is hard to imagine how one would identify excessive use in the absence of metering.  It would also be difficult to identify for each individual whether his or her consumption is normal, is excessive or is below the norm.  One needs metering.</p> <p>  We understood from the depositions of other regional authorities that the committee heard, as well as from our experience with other member states, that in practice there can be strategic or structured approaches.  One starts with applying district metering to identify which areas suffer most of the leaks.  Afterwards, one can tighten the net gradually until one goes into individual metering.  We acknowledge the fact that introducing district metering is a significant contribution to controlling the leaks.</p> <p>  We would also draw the committee's attention to the fact that controlling or curbing leaks is not the only purpose of this.  The level of consumption must be determined as well.  It is hard to imagine how compliance in the case of each citizen and how a level of consumption could be calculated with fair precision in the absence of metering.  We also have to be aware of the fact that consumption patterns can have common trends but also can have significant variables.  For example, one family has a swimming pool while most other families do not.  Some families might have large gardens and want to water their gardens but others cannot afford to have large gardens.  How does one distinguish between these families?  Is it fair that somebody living in a dwelling on the fifth floor of the building pays the same amount of charges as someone who has a large garden or a swimming pool?  Is that realistic?  We believe metering allows public authorities to distinguish between these different situations.  This means fairness and equality which are generally accepted principles of law.  In practice, the introduction of metering should not be politically seen as outrageous.</p><p>It recognises the individuality of each consumer.</p><p> I will come to the matter of the social tariff by confirming that there is an explicit mandate in the directive allowing for social tariffs.  If I may be allowed to add, I would say that the directive does not impose a certain level of the charges.  The level of the charges is left in the hands of the member states.  Ireland can start low and progressively advance towards higher charges.</p><p> I would like to highlight one important difference between Scotland and Ireland.  In Scotland, with its tax that is dependent on the value of the property but which is highlighted specifically on each consumer's bill, they secure full cost recovery.  They pay &pound;430 to &pound;450 a year, which is far more than was paid in Ireland when the previous system was in force.  Securing cost recovery, therefore, is an important element.  If Ireland secures cost recovery and a practical application of the polluter pays principle, many issues can be discussed but the objectives of the directive are of paramount importance.  That is why, and not wishing to soak everything in a fuzzy political discussion, we would still like to draw members' attention to the fact that a broader policy and political discussion must take place and the full picture be considered.</p></speech>

I repeat the disclaimer made at the outset that any infringement decision is a prerogative of the College of the European Commission.  However, for the current discussion I would say it is difficult to identify the arguments that would convince somebody that such an indistinct system sits well with the water framework directive.  If there are elements that can be explained properly by the Irish authorities, and I am not the oracular mouse who tells the ultimate truth, perhaps we do not see them here but it is very difficult to perceive them, and it is not <i>prima facie </i>the casethat we are seeing this.<br/><br/>We have reflected a good deal on the matter.  It is important to see how this system would secure, in a credible way and for a relatively long period of time, an investment of &euro;13 billion.  Would the Irish authorities make a commitment to make such an investment from the public purse in a short or longer amount of time?  How would the &euro;13 million be procured by the public purse?  What will happen when in three or four years time such investments will compete with other investments that are equally important to this society?  How will this be preserved in terms of the integrity of continuous investment in a safe water system that is fundamental for the health of Irish consumers.  I know the word &quot;consumers&quot; is not liked but beyond citizens, they are consumers as well, and this does not diminish their status.  They are entitled to the best, not to have halomethanes in drinking water.</p></speech>

We will have to make a judgment individually and also as a committee regarding those opinions.  I value any opinions this committee gets from either side.</p> <p>  It is clear from listening to the contributions of the Commission representatives that any reasonable and common sense reading of what they have outlined is that the Commission's position has been inconsistent, that it changed between 2010 and 2016 and, in my view, is now an openly and nakedly political position.  </p> <p>  I have two questions, and Mr. Ciobanu-Dordea might answer the first one.  Regarding the German case, the European Court of Justice held that the failure to put in place a pricing policy on a specific matter without any complaint that has resulted in a failure to meet the objectives of section 9.1 or the directive as a whole was not sufficient to establish a breach of Germany's obligations.  Am I right in taking from that that the lack of a pricing policy did not make Germany in breach of the obligations?</p> <p>  My second question is to the same three gentlemen.  Am I correct in saying that the question of full recovery of costs was in the original draft directive but it is not in the actual directive?</p></speech>

In other words, in the German case the absence of full price recovery did not render Germany in breach of the obligations.<br/><br/>With regard to whether full cost recovery was in the original proposed directive, it was, and it was withdrawn following conciliation at the Parliament.  That is recognised in the document I was looking at from the European Parliament which I will read into the record.  It is A5-2000-0214 and the relevant part states:</p><blockquote>Water pricing is a sensitive issue for number of Member States that have particular regimes for exempting certain categories of users.  However, in the conciliation the attention focused on Ireland.  It is the only member state that does not charge households according to water and sewage volume but finances these services via taxation.  At the end of the conciliation it was agreed to provide for the Member States to be able to opt out from the obligation of cost recovery if this is based on &quot;established national practices&quot;.</blockquote><p>That is why, when I spoke earlier, I spoke about it being the Irish exemption.  There was a clear recognition by all involved at the time that Ireland had an established practice.  There was acceptance that Ireland could continue to have that established practice, which is why full cost recovery was dropped from the directive as we now have it. </p></speech>

I will add that the German case, for me, emphasises the margin of appreciation in terms of cost recovery and its implementation.  Margin of appreciation is effectively the discretion given to the member state.  The decision in the German case has been criticised by leading academics, but it reinforces the outcome of the decision in the sense that it emphasises the margin of appreciation that is left to the member state.  The Commission representatives have supported this today.</p> <p>  I would finally add that it must be looked at holistically in respect of Articles 4, 9, 11 and 5.  It has to be looked at in the round and that is what the court did.</p></speech>

This is the reasoning.  This does not apply to domestic water pricing in the Germany's case because Germany has a generalised system of domestic water pricing based on metering and usually a tariff which has a fixed part and a variable part.  It has a full cost recovery obligation in its law.  I am talking about full cost recovery.</p> <p>  Legal archaeology, which we can carry out, sometimes helps us to understand and interpret what the intentions of the legislator were, but there is no hard obligation to recover 100% of costs  in the Water Framework Directive.  There is a principle of cost recovery and there is an obligation to establish cost recovery but there is some flexibility in the last paragraph of Article 9(1) which states that member state may take account of social and economic considerations and climatic conditions.  It is for Ireland to find a solid way to have a consistent system that justifies, and can achieve, the goals of the Water Framework Directive and can consistently deliver funding for the required water infrastructure. </p></speech>

At this point members are exploring three options.  In synopsis, the existing regime which includes a suspension, charges funded entirely from taxation and a scenario based on the expert commission report.  From the evolving conversation there are obviously very different perspectives on that and there are risks associated with what would be a compliant funding model.  I did not want to get into that precisely,  but simply for information I will say that the focus has been on what we said in the first river basin management plan.  We are now in the process of doing the second river basin management plan and we are close to going out to public consultation on that.  It will reflect that the Oireachtas is seized with looking at this issue at this stage, and then we will be finalising those plans.  In those final plans we, as I state, will have to set out how whatever model has been chosen following the process is in compliance.  That will have to take account the risks associated with different models, which members are informing themselves of.  That timeline is due during the course of this year and by the end of 2017 we will be finalising the second cycle river basin management plans.</p></speech>

Compliance with the Water Framework Directive is critical to this committee's ultimate recommendations and whatever policy the Government of the day will adopt.  One of my questions to Ms Graham and the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government was if a legal risk assessment been carried out with the advice of the Attorney General in respect of compliance under both the Water Services Act 2014, which I would presume had the approval of the Attorney General as it has been enacted, and under the current suspension regime?  Is she looking forward, in the river basin management plan, at further risk assessments?  That is a critical point to make.</p> <p>  Taking account of the obligation that we as policy-makers have and that we as a country have, I will ask some questions of the Commission.  With regard to consistency of how EU members are treated, are the witnesses satisfied that the Irish State is being treated consistently in terms of our obligations?  We have heard about cases being taken to the European Court of Justice, ECJ.  Are we being treated consistently?  The impression may have been given that we are being targeted in some way by the Commission.  I would like the witnesses to reassure the committee that is not the case.  Will they give their view on that?</p> <p>  What are the witnesses' views on the fairest way to treat excessive use or waste of water resources?  They have mentioned metering, but what is the view across the Commission and the EU member states?  What is generally considered the fairest way to capture and to charge, or to treat in whatever way, people that waste or use water excessively?</p> <p>  There was a lot of debate around the derogation and whether it can still be applied in Ireland's case.  Listening to the difference in views, I believe that the ECJ may well ultimately determine the outcome of that.  The Commission has made clear to the committee its view under EU law, and the delegates need not reiterate it for me.  As a member state we have bought in to the Commission as an authority and we, as committee members, should take careful cognisance of what it has said in regard to derogation.  If the current water policy regime, that is the suspension of charges, continues, is it increasingly likely that further cases will be taken to the ECJ against Ireland?  </p> <p>  A delegation from the Environmental Protection Agency is here today.  In our whole debate about water services provision it is important that the EPA, as our environmental regulator, expresses a view.  Taking account of another case taken against Ireland, where 38 urban centres around the country, large towns and cities, are now before the ECJ, is the EPA satisfied that the current Irish Water capital plan is adequate to address the issues in that case?  Would it have any concerns regarding the sustainability of those capital plans should there be changes to how they are resourced in the future?</p> <p>  We have listened to some legal opinions here today.  I welcome legal opinion, even though I might not always agree with it.  It helps to inform the debate.  Under the Water Services Act 2014, it was clear that Ireland was compliant with our obligations.  I would like to hear if the legal experts share the view that Ireland would be less likely to be compliant if water services continue to be funded from general taxation and no charge levied?  I would like to put their view on that on the record.  If they think we would continue to be compliant without charges, why do they think that would be the case? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.234" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aurel Ciobanu-Dordea" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FFJ2017021500002#O00200"><p>On the important matter of equal treatment, it might sound like a general reassurance to the committee but we have constantly paid attention, probably historically from the beginning of the institution, to this crucial matter of equal treatment.  It is important not only that member states are treated equally and fairly but that they see this fairness and equality in action.  That is why the Commission is deploying, at least in the area of the environment, particular attention to equal treatment.  Of course one has individual situations in one member state or another and then one has to deal with that particular situation but one has also general obligations defined by EU law and deadlines applicable to all member states.  In order to secure full equal treatment we are dealing with all the member states at the same time and are moving forward or on the contrary, holding back when that is necessary, cases concerning all member states for which this situation is relevant.  This represents a particular challenge.  When one has to deal with 12 or 15 cases at the same time it is not simple.  It is not a case of me writing three paragraphs on a sheet of paper and tomorrow we go to court or something like that.  As members can well imagine from the work of this Parliament and the work of any public authority, one needs to prepare things properly.  I can reassure the committee and if it is necessary we can provide examples to it - I do not know them by heart but we can provide them in writing - illustrating that we strive for equal treatment.  I think we achieve equal treatment and that we do not treat Ireland in any particular way compared with other member states.  Because certain examples have been brought here which some read as illustrative of discrimination, I have tried in my explanations to the committee to point out why the situation in Ireland is not comparable with that in Scotland or in very few other jurisdictions, principally Northern Ireland, because their performance in terms of the general efficiency of the system is different compared with the situation in Ireland and the directive points towards taking care of the broader picture.  When one makes the assessment one must pay attention to how the general system functions.  The parameters of the different engines show that the functioning is sometimes significantly different.  That is why of course the situation is significantly more challenging for Ireland but it is possible to find solutions in the framework of the directive.</p> <p>  A question was asked about what fairer way than metering exists to measure excessive use .  To the best of our knowledge, there is no other solution.  Nobody has pointed that out, although I am open to being shown by anyone what practical tool, instrument, formula or system can be put in place that is fairer than metering and that identifies the behaviour of individual citizens better than individual metering.  Let me repeat that it is perfectly understandable and acceptable to roll out a programme that like the satellite imagery narrows down - it starts with a more general image and makes it finer so that it increases the granularity.  In order to fight with most of the leaks, one can start with district measurement and thereafter increase the granularity until it rolls out a general system of individual metering.  I will stop there.  I am not sure if I have noted well all the questions that have been asked.</p> <p>  I indicated earlier that we believe the implication of the current situation, with the suspension of the water charges and the wider context of the situation, makes things of such a nature that we believe undoubtedly Ireland is not in compliance with the Water Framework Directive.  We are very much supportive of an adequate process of reflection and deliberation in Ireland that is persuasive for the majority of Irish citizens.  We hope that such a deliberation, no matter how heated it can become, and it is legitimate and understandable - it is an important societal matter - will lead to the right outcomes.  Because if people do not care about their own health, what do they care about?  If they do not agree that they deserve and require protection of their own health, what do they want more than that?  This is of paramount societal importance.</p></speech>

We have an ongoing engagement in terms of the legal issues arising from funding and compliance with the Water Framework Directive.  As models evolve, different legal and policy considerations come into play.  Without prejudice to what might become the final view when one takes into account all of those complex dimensions, the Department has formed the view at this stage that a regime in line with the Water Services Act 2014 would clearly be compliant with the Water Framework Directive.  A scenario where the domestic segment of water costs was entirely funded by taxation would, more likely than not, be found to be non-compliant with Article 9.  The approach recommended by the expert commission would potentially be compliant with the Water Framework Directive, depending on matters such as what constitutes normal usage.</p> <p>  We have obviously noted the contents of the letter from Commissioner Vella.  Ultimately, following the Oireachtas deliberations, the approach to funding compliance with Article 9 will need to be set out in the second cycle river basin management plan.  Any bundle of measures adopted or that would be considered for adoption in that regard would have to achieve the purposes and objectives of the directive, and that obviously includes things such as the promotion of sustainable water use and enhanced protection and improvement of the aquatic environment.  That involves, in substance, policy analysis as well as legal issues.  In finalising the plans we will engage on any of the legal issues arising with the Office of the Attorney General.</p></speech>

I understand the difficulty with sharing the advice of the Attorney General but what is the Department's position - I do not ask about the Minister - on derogation?  We have heard different views expressed today.  The Commission holds a very strong view, namely, that derogation no longer applies and we have heard legal opinion that it possibly does still apply.  Does the Department have a view on derogation and where we currently are in that regard?</p></speech>

It is a separate question whether we could have used it or not, but we did not use it.  Subsequently, the Water Services Act 2014 was brought in and established a charging regime.  We then moved to the second cycle plans.  I do not think that the Department has previously said that we thought we could rely on a derogation under article 9(4).</p></speech>

We have no role with regard to setting water policy, water charging, metering or related matters, so I will leave that debate to others.  On Senator Coffey's questions with regard to Irish Water and capital investment, we are focused on the delivery of safe and secure water and ultimately the protection of the environment from wastewater impacts.  That is what we focus on.  Our assessment of Irish Water is based on the achievement and delivery of those objectives.  It is very straightforward.  During the period 2014 to 2017 the EPA's remedial action list dropped below 100 supplies for the first time, and the number of people on boil water notices is now less than 5,000.  We also have national strategies in place to deal with key issues such as lead, trihalomethanes and pesticides.  Our assessment of Irish Water's plan suggests that all schemes on the current remedial action list will be removed by the end of 2020, with many scheduled for completion within the next two years.  That covers the drinking water side of things.</p> <p>  With regard to wastewater, the news is less encouraging.  We have not seen the same level of improvements and performance, and we are seeing increasing delays to the reported completion dates of projects such as the elimination of discharges of raw sewage from 43 identified sites.  Many of those schemes are now two years behind the original planned dates.  This is not new - it was in our annual report on wastewater.  We have also said that Irish Water needs a greater focus on improving operational effectiveness of its existing infrastructure, but there also must be an acceleration of investment in new infrastructure for both drinking water and wastewater treatment.  I should highlight to the committee that the EPA has been raising this since 2006, so it is not a new message.  The state of the infrastructure has been identified by us in many reports over the years.  My colleague, Gerard O'Leary, might talk about the specific points of the ambitions of the plan out to 2021.</p></speech>

I am going to read aspects of slide 17, which maps out where we were in 2014, where we were in 2016 and where we are today.</p> <p>  The existence of the boil water notice shows that the reality today is that the water quality is not good.  That has been dropping, as Ms Burke pointed out, and there is a projection to get to zero by the end of 2020.  </p> <p>  We have gone further and analysed all of the public water supplies.  We are trying to identify where the issues are likely to be tomorrow and where the water supplies are not resilient enough.  The 99 schemes currently in place represent 770,000 people who are at risk of being on some form of water restriction.  We are playing catch up on 16 years of backlog, and that is also the picture with the urban wastewater treatment directive.  Many of the deadlines were 2000 and 2005.  The year 2000 was for the larger supplies.  From the presentation it can be seen that the largest plant that we have in the country, at Ringsend, does not comply, which brings down our average.  We are running at about 50%, whereas the rest of Europe, on the basic and urban wastewater, are in the 90%+ bracket.  I am reluctant to speak too much about the stats because if Ringsend was compliant we would be in the 90% bracket as well.  However, as Ms Burke pointed out, there were 43 years when if one flushed the toilet everything went into the aquatic environment.  </p> <p>  From an EPA point of view we do not want those smaller areas left behind, because although they are small areas they have a lot of tourists.  If I was to pick one, for example where I live in Wexford, there are playgrounds in Kilmore Quay adjacent to sites where there is raw sewage.  We are keen that the job gets finished for the urban wastewater treatment directive.  There is a greater list of 124, encompassing the small and the big.  The whole preamble to the urban wastewater treatment directive was the protection of public health.  In the case of urban wastewater there are 124 areas on the list.</p></speech>

Much of the debate that we have had today is around compliance, and there is no doubt that the EPA is working in the interests of protecting human health and environment, especially with regard to water provision and water services.  It is a message for our committee, and I do not mind putting it on the record, that irrespective of where we stand on the derogation debate we have a much larger obligation to human health.  Leaving aside member state obligations aside, we have obligations to our citizens.  Much of the debate today, if we are honest about it, has been about getting off the hook in terms of charges and in terms of derogation.  What the EPA have outlined today is what the committee members should be focused on, and that is how we improve our environment, our water provision, and how they are sustained into the future with regards capital investment.</p></speech>

Article 9(4) is the derogation from article 9.  One must have an understanding of what the obligations are under article 9.  The European Court of Justice has said, and it is common case today, that charging <i>per se</i>is not the issue, because it has to be seen in a wider context.  The European Court of Justice has said that if a member state has wide discretion they also have broader obligations.  The management of the river basin comes into it.  That is the context within which to look at this.  We should sort out our understanding of article 9 and then assess whether article 9(4) kicks in.  My understanding of article 9 is that it is not dispostive of the issue of water charging.  I think that is the best way to look at it.  Perhaps that is in ease of the Senator's previous statement as well.</p></speech>

There is a wide margin of appreciation.  The question is whether Ireland can be compliant without water charges, and the answer is yes, provided that Ireland meets the objectives.  One of the core objectives is to ensure a clean water supply.  It is not prescriptive about how that is achieved or how the public finances are arranged to do that.  It could be done through general taxation, as is the established practice and as is done, for example, to some extent in Scotland.</p></speech>

We were given responsibility for drinking water and urban wastewater in 2008.  In regard to drinking water, during that period, through an intervention funded by the Department of the Environment e.coli, has been reduced in public water supply by 90%.  That intervention involved the putting in place of a chlorine monitoring alarm - which is approximately 7,000 for every public water supply - which was very difficult to do.  Some of the issues that we are dealing with now, such as trihalomethanes, require serious investment.  In regard to urban wastewater, every year we have published reports setting out where the issues are in relation to urban wastewater, to the point of frustration.  The EPA is not the economic regulator.  In our last report, for the first time after almost 20 years of publishing reports on urban wastewater, we mapped investment in our wastewater infrastructure.  That report is publicly available.  There has been a huge drop in investment in that area.  With respect, enforcement is not the issue.  We have prosecuted on four or five occasions where there have been breaches.  Systematic failure leads to infringement cases by the European Commission, such as the one announced today.  The information about which I am speaking dates back to 2013.  It is information that we have made available to the general public.  Again, with respect, the information has been available, and not only since yesterday or today.  We can deal with situations of kit malfunction but in situations where a kit has not even been installed it is a funding issue.</p></speech>

However, I would like clarification on some points.  Returning to the Scottish Water situation and a comment made earlier, which seemed to me to be enlightening in light of the Scottish Water's contribution to the committee, Scottish Water has the second most expensive water supply in Europe.  It was indicated that there was an element of compliance in what Scottish Water was doing because cost recovery is built into its charge.  It would appear to me, therefore, that in regard to a non-metered system to be in compliance with the directive a cost recovery component is essential.  This is achieved by Scottish Water and, therefore, Scotland, by way of high charges for the supply of water to everybody.  In other words, it is required to actively discriminate against people who could have lower water bills to ensure that cost recovery is built in to its charge.  Perhaps the witnesses would confirm if my understanding of that is correct.</p> <p>  On established practice, which I appreciate has been dealt with in some detail already, my understanding is that if something is established practice it is possible to have a derogation on that basis, unless the State ends that practice.  I am speaking about a sovereign state introducing legislation through its Parliament to change a practice.  It was previously an established practice in this country not to pay equal wages to men and women but we ended that practice by way of legislation.  Once a state has introduced legislation to change something it ceases to be established practice.  We move on and effectively the derogation lapses.  The references to proposals and so on were grossly misleading.  We legislated to introduce charges and we levied them.  The majority of people paid them.  I presume, regardless of what percentage of people paid and so on, when a sovereign state, through its Parliament, ends an established practice then effectively the derogation lapses.  That is my understanding of why established practice would not be possible in this context.  The witnesses may put forward a technical legal argument in that regard but as I understand it that is why established practice has lapsed in this instance.  I would also like the witnesses to respond on whether my view in this regard is correct.</p> <p>  I appreciate that any decision which initiates legal action or fines or charges against the Irish State will be, at the end of the day, a collective decision for the Commission.  However, the witnesses, as people who have held senior positions within the Commission structure for many years, must have some indication or idea of the level of fines Ireland could expect to have levied on it if found to be in breach of the directive.  In my estimation the level of fine we could expect to have levied on us would be in the millions and there would be a daily recurring fine that would be very substantial as well.  I appreciate that this will be adjudicated eventually by the European Court of Justice, with the Commission and the Irish State being the protagonists.  In other instances, I have been no friend of how the Commission does its business.  However, I believe that the opinion of witnesses, as Commission representatives, is valuable in this instance because it is not just another opinion but a real guide for us of the implications of what the Irish State could be facing.  I would welcome if the witnesses could give us some type of indication as to the real costs might be in terms if Ireland were to fall foul of the directive.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.261" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jorge Rodr&iacute;guez Romero" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FFJ2017021500002#Q00900"><p>I will address the question on Scotland and established practice and try to clarify the position.  The Scottish system is very different from any other system in the EU of which I am aware.  Under this system citizens receive a bill setting out the amount they are being charged for water, which money is paid directly to Scottish Water to enable it to operate water services to the level established by Scottish ministers and overseen by the regulator.  This system is based on full cost recovery and as a result Scotland meets the requirements of the urban wastewater treatment directive and the drinking water directive 100%.  This system is working for Scotland.  Whatever the legalities in terms of the flexibility provided for under Article 9.1 or the de facto 9.4, this system works for Scotland.  Ireland, given its situation, has to find a way to fund its water service to a level that is considered acceptable to society and the authorities, that is sustainable in the long term.  The water framework directive provides the flexibility to adapt this system to the reality of the country.</p><p>We have insisted on this quite a number of times.</p><p> On the issue of established practice, if I understood the Deputy correctly, I agree with him.  I will try to explain it again, because Deputy Healy-Rae also referred to the issue of whether we have changed our approach.  I have tried to explain why we have not changed our approach and I will try to do it again, if the Chairman allows me.  One of the conditions to apply Article 9(4) is that it is an established practice.  An established practice at the time of adoption of the directive is taken over until the adoption of the river basin management plan in 2009.  It is in that river basin management plan that the Commission receives the explanation of why the application of Article 9(4) would not prevent the member state from achieving the objectives of the directive.  This has not been applied in Ireland because Ireland, in the river basin management plan, decided to go another route.  However, this does not prevent Ireland from finding a way of providing a sustainable solution for its domestic water funding.  It should not prevent the finding of a solution that is adequate to the situation in Ireland.</p><p> I will hand over to Mr. Ciobanu-Dordea for the last question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.263" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aurel Ciobanu-Dordea" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FFJ2017021500002#R00200"><p>We cannot venture into speculating about the amounts but it is clear that it will be a significant amount if the violation is sustained in time.  It will be a significant amount and in the order of millions or perhaps more than millions.  It could be tens of millions.  One should pay attention again to the fact that this violation will be compounded by other violations that are more advanced such as those relating to the urban waste water treatment directive.  The figures would be aggregated with other cases that are also related to malfunctions of the Irish system.  In other words, if a clear and effective solution that is not expensive is identified - it does not have to be an expensive solution like the one in Scotland - and applied, this will bring enormous direct and indirect benefits to the public purse and the citizen.  It will solve the problems, bring benefits to the consumers and it will also - these are the indirect benefits - avoid or spare Ireland huge fines.</p></speech>

It is important to remember that it is acknowledged that there has been an historic lack of investment in the water infrastructure and the intent behind the charging regime was to address it.  As the economic regulator, we have to hold Irish Water to account to ensure that it delivers service improvements and reduces its costs at the same time.  I reiterate my earlier point which was that the funding must be available and secure to do that.  We cannot hold Irish Water to account for a five-year business plan if the basis for that business plan, which would be secure funding, is not available.  I wanted to reiterate that point and to follow up on the points made by the EPA.</p></speech>

Colleagues from the Commission today have emphasised that it is about quality and not quantity and they have also emphasised the margin of appreciation that is given to member states.  I respectfully suggest that paragraph 4 of Article 9 is not how the Commission categorise it but is as set out in the terms of the paragraph.  The final sentence in the paragraph provides that &quot;Member States shall report the reasons for not fully applying paragraph 1, second sentence, in the river basin management plans&quot;.  That is where the reporting requirement comes in.  The requirement is to report when the member state is going to derogate.  The key phrase, in my respectful submission, is &quot;the achievement of the objectives of [the] Directive&quot;.</p></speech>

He can, of course, respectfully suggest it, but the point I would make is that it is his legal opinion.  He obviously is entitled to give it, but the committee has to make a decision that will go to the D&aacute;il and the Oireachtas for implementation.  I believe we have to be much more conscious of the fact that, as a result of a decision that is politically expedient or anything else, we cannot put this State's finances at risk of tens of millions of euro in fines based on what might be an opinion or a decision.  As a committee, we have a very serious body of work to do.  We take it very seriously and are working on it every single week.  However, it is vitally important that the view of the Commission, which would be the initial instigator of a possible levy, be given significant weight.  The other opinions, legal or otherwise, which we receive from those who attend the committee are important.  Fundamentally, however, we must take on board in our recommendations both what we want to see politically and what are the implications and risks to our nation.</p></speech>

The OPW is responsible for a wide variety of functions with an overall budget of &euro;394 million in 2017.  The principal areas of responsibility reflect two priority areas of the Government programme - flood risk management and estate management, including the heritage estate.</p> <p> As members know, the key objectives of flood risk management is to reduce the risk of river and coastal flooding to homes and businesses and to provide flood risk information to be considered for effective planning in Ireland.  In the assessment of flood risk the OPW must consider the potential impact of climate change to ensure appropriate plans to mitigate the risk are considered.  Recognising the difficulties flooding has caused for individuals and businesses in Ireland in recent years, I am working actively to address the issues with a range of measures.</p> <p>  In relation to capital works, these complex engineering projects continue to present many challenges through the planning stage, the procurement process and the construction phase.</p><p>While it is widely acknowledged that there are long lead-in times for the delivery of flood relief projects, I am pleased to report that construction works commenced on seven major flood schemes in 2016, which means there are currently 11 schemes at construction stage.  A further seven flood schemes are programmed to commence construction in 2017.<br/><br/>The projects programmed to commence this year include Athlone, Bellurgan, Blackpool, Clonakilty, Ennis south and Templemore and the first phase of the largest flood relief scheme ever to be undertaken in the State should commence in Cork city before the end of the year.  I am aware that the people of Cork city have a particular interest in the scheme on the River Lee and to fully capture their observations, the public consultation has been extended to 16 March.<i></i>It is expected that five of the projects currently under construction will be substantially completed in 2017 thereby bringing flood protection to an additional 2,000 properties.  A further 20 projects are at various stages of planning and design stage and when completed will provide protection to several hundred properties currently at risk of flooding.  Running in tandem with these major schemes, 83 localised flood relief projects were approved under the minor works scheme in 2016, which will be undertaken directly by the local authorities in the coming year.<br/><br/>In terms of output measures, it is worth noting that the cumulative number of properties to benefit from major flood relief works completed to date is over 7,700, with an additional 6,150 properties benefitting from local authority projects.  The cumulative value of this benefit to properties, or loss avoided in economic terms, is estimated to be in the region of &euro;1.5 billion.<br/><br/>The OPW&rsquo;s strategic, evidence-based approach to flood risk management has been reinforced with the completion of the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme.  The CFRAM programme is the largest flood risk management planning programme ever undertaken in the State and has completed detailed surveys and numerical models for 300 areas at risk of flooding involving 6,700 km of watercourse and 9,400 sq. km of flood plain.  The output from the ongoing CFRAM programme is a comprehensive suite of maps for the areas at risk around the country and the consultation process with local communities regarding these maps is nearing completion.  I hope to submit the final plans for approval to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in the near future.<br/><br/>In acknowledging that structural measures may not provide the appropriate solutions in many areas, the interdepartmental flood policy co-ordination group is developing a range of policy initiatives to underpin the overall investment in managing national flood risk.  The group, of which the OPW is a member, is considering a number of prevention and mitigation measures for providing flood relief which may include schemes for individual property protection and voluntary home and farmyard relocation.<br/><br/>Following the severe flooding events in the winter of 2015 and 2016, I am pleased to report that a memorandum will go to Government for a voluntary home relocation scheme in the coming weeks.  This scheme will apply where the properties remain exposed to a high risk of flooding and the benefit of major or minor flood relief schemes will not be felt.  Initial funding has been ring-fenced this year for the scheme to be administered by my office.<br/><br/>I am aware that some members of this committee have a particular interest in ensuring that home and business owners can insure their properties against flood damage.  The most recent meeting with Insurance Ireland was held on 8 December 2016 and a further meeting has taken place since to explore the legal, technical and administrative arrangements that may allow for the further sharing of data on flood insurance cover for those 300 areas where the OPW has mapped the flood risk through the CFRAM programme.  The OPW is providing Insurance Ireland with detailed background and technical information on all completed flood relief schemes, including maps showing the extent of the area protected in the anticipation that this will allow Insurance Ireland members to offer flood insurance cover.  A further meeting with Insurance Ireland is scheduled for 8 March, which I will attend.<br/><br/>With regard to the matter of flood forecasting, I am pleased to inform members that Met &Eacute;ireann is in the process of setting up a flood forecasting centre, which will be supported by additional resources within my office, to enhance the early flood warning to those at risk of flooding.<br/><br/>On the Shannon catchment, the Shannon flood risk State agency co-ordination working group is looking at ways to enhance ongoing co-operation of all State agencies involved with the River Shannon.  A comprehensive programme of works is being developed as part of the co-ordinated approach by all State agencies involved in addressing flood risk in that catchment area, and the group is due to meet again on 21 March.<br/><br/>In terms of drainage maintenance, the OPW continues to maintain all arterial drainage schemes completed under the Arterial Drainage Act 1945.  This investment provides ongoing protection to 650,000 acres of agricultural land, infrastructure and properties through the maintenance of 11,500 km of river channel including 730 km of embankments at an annual cost of &euro;15 million.  Separately, local authorities maintain 4,600 km of river channel providing further localised flood protection.<br/><br/>The other main programme of investment for my office is estate management, which encompasses the management, maintenance and development of the State&rsquo;s property portfolio.  In recent years, with a move towards better space management, the Office of Public Works has rationalised office accommodation, surrendering over 300 leases in recent years.  However, the growing demand for space to deliver Government services will require that additional leases are taken on in 2017 and the annual Estimate will increase this year.<br/><br/>The OPW provides a shared service for the maintenance of accommodation occupied by Departments and manages construction projects on their behalf.  Some examples of these construction projects or programmes to be initiated or delivered in 2017 include<font color="#FF0000"></font>the Garda building programme, the fit out of office accommodation at Bloom House, the refurbishment of the Seanad Chamber at Leinster House, the children&rsquo;s science centre, roof works at the National Gallery and a programme of essential health and safety works under the mechanical and electrical programme.<br/><br/>It is worth noting that the OPW also has a key role to play in the delivery of services that are not directly funded by the OPW Vote.  For example, the OPW manages a comprehensive Garda major building programme and in 2015, the Government launched a capital investment plan for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the period from 2016 to 2021, which involves the major refurbishment of stations and facilities from both the OPW and the Garda Votes.  Three new divisional-regional Garda headquarters at Kevin Street, Dublin, Wexford and Galway are currently on site and will be delivered during 2017.<br/><br/>In the heritage area, I am pleased to report that the total number of recorded visitors to OPW sites at the end of December 2016 was in the region of 5.5 million.  This is an increase of some 12.8% over the 2015 attendance and reflects the increasing popularity of our heritage product nationally and internationally.  This is a key driver in terms of the economic benefit being generated for the tourism sector and receipts in this area have increased year on year to over &euro;11 million in 2016.<br/><br/>The heritage sites managed by the OPW are particularly prized by foreign visitors, a demographic targeted by F&aacute;ilte Ireland in its tourism marketing.  Understanding the needs of these visitors and planning for a targeted investment campaign to improve the sites will be a key part of the ongoing tourism investment programme which will be developed in parallel with F&aacute;ilte Ireland branding propositions such as the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East, Dublin - A Breath of Fresh Air, and a future proposition yet to emerge around the lakelands area.<br/><br/>Guided visitor services will continue to be provided by my office at 70 heritage sites nationwide in 2017 on either a seasonal or full-time basis.  One such visitor attraction that is central to the OPW tourist offering and which has featured prominently in the 2016 commemorations is Kilmainham Gaol.  Work was completed in early 2016 on the new visitor centre, which was one of the Government&rsquo;s signature 1916 commemoration projects.  The building was opened by An tUachtar&aacute;n Michael D. Higgins at Easter and now serves as the main entry point for visitors to the gaol.  The OPW heritage service will continue to develop this site as one of the country's premier tourist attractions and in the period ahead, there will be a focus on meeting a strong demand for visitors and developing further visitor offerings at the site.<br/><br/>A strategic partnership has been developed between F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Department of Arts, Heritage, Rural, Regional and Gaeltacht Affairs and the OPW regarding the tourism investment programme.  This promises to be a significant and beneficial relationship, which will bring a greater tourism focus on and investment in relevant projects within the heritage estate managed by the OPW.  The objective of the partnership is to identify projects at heritage sites that will be suitable for investment and to develop them as tourism destinations.  This year, 2017, will focus on improving existing visitor offerings at places like the Rock of Cashel, D&uacute;n Aonghasa, the C&eacute;ide Fields and Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne and creating new visitor offerings at sites like Carlingford Castle, Knowth and Altamont.<br/><br/>Additionally in this period, the OPW will also seek to engage positively with the Creative Ireland initiative, which is currently being developed and seeks to build on the success of the Ireland 2016 project in the area of the creative arts in particular.</p><p>I realise that I have referenced only a small part of the work of the OPW, which has a vast array of responsibilities.  If the committee has any questions on the office's Estimates requirements for 2017, I will be happy to take them.</p></speech>

I will start with estate management.  I also join with the Chairman in welcoming the new Chairman of the OPW.  I too worked in a previous guise with him through the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  I am delighted to see him appointed to this role.</p> <p>  It may not be possible for the Minister of State to answer my questions directly at this session.  If he cannot, I would be grateful if somebody would revert to me.  I want to raise sites like Barryscourt Castle, County Cork, Annes Grove Gardens in Castletownroche, County Cork, and Doneraile Court.  They are three key reference sites that come under the ambit of the OPW's sphere of responsibility.  I know that works are ongoing in Barryscourt Castle, for instance.  The people who use these facilities are anxious to ensure there is continuing maintenance and development.  I note the Minister of State's remarks with regard to Ireland's Ancient East and the reference to developing the heritage element of the OPW offerings.  I ask the Minister to revert to me with regard to what the plans are for those three particular sites.  The Annes Grove Gardens site, in particular, is a recent acquisition and a very valuable one in terms of its history and place in north Cork.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure that the resources are deployed in such a way as to ensure its future development.</p> <p>  I note that there has been a 12.8% increase in revenue streams.  I ask the Minister of State to delve further into how that 12.8% is arrived at in terms of attendance figures across the sites throughout the country.  It is a cumulative increase.  People like me, who represent the people of north and east Cork, would like to see how that translates to sites like Doneraile Court, Annes Grove Gardens and Barryscourt Castle, which is obviously closed at the moment.  I would be very grateful if we could get some solid information from the Minister of State on the figures as they relate to those three reference sites.  My next question is about the children's science centre.  What is the actual state of progress on that?  That is the first half of my intervention.</p> <p>  The second half of my intervention relates to Cork in particular and the proposed flood works.  I note the Minister of State said that the deadline for submissions has moved out to a date in March.  There have been some concerns raised, of which the Minister will be aware, regarding the aesthetics that this project will bring and how that will impact on the visual amenity that people enjoy on the River Lee.  Historically, on schemes like the Munster Blackwater in Fermoy as well as in Mallow, similar concerns were raised by people living within those regions.  I can understand the concerns of the people of Cork city.  I ask the Minister of State to be mindful of those concerns.  I understand a process is under way.  I ask the Minister of State to keep in mind the aesthetic value of the River Lee and to be mindful of the need to ensure the visual amenity that is there.  There are other concerns that will come into the public forum as time goes on.</p> <p>  The Minister of State mentioned small schemes.  There is still a situation arising from Storm Frank in 2015 where works are ongoing on the N25 east of Castlemartyr.  I travelled on that road the other day and work has been carried out opposite a particular property.  I do not want to name the person in question but he and his family have been very much affected by Storm Frank.  There are turloughs present in the area.  There has been no communication between the OPW and this person.  To be fair to the person in question, aesthetically, opposite his house looks a bit like a bomb site at the moment.  I do not want to inflame the situation in any way.  However, if the OPW or its agents could communicate more with the people affected in that particular region, I believe it would be a good day's work.</p> <p>  I also want to ask about the voluntary home relocation scheme.  I would like to know what criteria apply.  Do they include a person moving to an elevated site on their own property and building from scratch?  Is that one of the areas that the Minister of State is examining?  I would like to hear more about the modalities of the scheme, maybe not today, but perhaps at some future session.  In fairness to the Minister of State with regard to his engagement on the insurance issue, he has been quite proactive to my mind.  I had a meeting with the Minister of State prior to the Christmas recess.  We are perhaps still sceptical about whether Insurance Ireland will actually take on board the CFRAM process and, having done that, whether it will reflect in lower costs in the premiums of people living in areas affected by CFRAM.  That remains to be seen and I would like to hear the view of the Minister of State.</p> <p>  Many people have carried out works in smaller areas, such as Castlemartyr in County Cork, which was badly affected, and places like Midleton.  Some of those people had insurance, but others did not and had to pay out quite an amount of money to repair damaged property.  They are looking for an answer to the question of whether Insurance Ireland will realistically engage and whether a real protocol will be put in place to ensure that, once the OPW has future-proofed a particular area that is within a certain flood plain, the cost of insurance will be reduced for people in the future.  I acknowledge it is an ongoing process and I appreciate the Minister of State's engagement on it.  Those are my opening remarks.</p></speech>

It will probably remain closed until at least 2018 but it is being developed.  With regard to the Annes Grove site, it was donated to the State in 2015.  The OPW has commenced a programme of works to make the garden safe and to facilitate initial public access to sections of the garden in spring of this year.  At present, it is envisaged that pre-booked guided tours will be available for the month of May only.  As development works will be ongoing throughout the year, it is necessary from a health and safety point of view that the May tours be limited to small sizes and accompanied by a member of staff.  The site will be shown in this initial trial period as a work in progress site, but at least it is being opened up to the public and progress is being made on it.  The Deputy mentioned one other site and we will come back to him on that one.</p></speech>

It is a hardy perennial in my book.  I want to know what are the numbers as it is a site that I want to see developing.</p></speech>

The Deputy mentioned the tender for the children's science centre.  It will go out to tender by the end of this year.</p> <p>  Before I leave that point, I concur with the Deputy's idea that we need to be spreading out the numbers right throughout the area.  I have had the privilege of travelling to wonderful places around Ireland, only last week on a beautiful morning I visited venues during snowdrop week in Carlow.  This is an event that one will find no place else and it is an absolutely priceless gem.  We need to market it.  We are working with Bord F&aacute;ilte on marketing it.  This will be a help.</p> <p>  In regard to flooding and Cork city, I had the nice task of going to Cork twice.  I have announced schemes for Cork four times, so Cork is doing.  There have been some concerns about the treatment of the quays in the city scheme.  On the basis that there was a great deal of interest in it, we have extended the consultation period.  The Deputy can take that as a signal that the process is being considered.  It is important to remember that this is the single biggest project, worth &euro;140 million, that will be done in Ireland.  We hope to have work on site by the end of the year.  At the end of the day, the important thing is that we will work with the local people to find solutions to their concerns.  That is why we have engaged in consultation but I am putting the pressure on the officials and the design team to drive on with the project because we need to build the defences because of the devastation in the past.  </p> <p>  Deputy Sherlock mentioned the impact of Storm Frank on the N25.  Work is in progress.  The first port of call for somebody with an issue on that is the local authority.  If it an issue for the OPW, it will come back to the OPW, but I think the contracting authority is the local authority.</p> <p>  On the issue of the voluntary home relocation scheme, I hope to bring that proposal with the relevant criteria to Cabinet for approval.  I do not have the full detail but the Deputy mentioned the idea of somebody rebuilding a house on an elevated site.  That can be considered provided that planning permission can be obtained for it and that it meets all the planning criteria and that it is not in a flood risk area.  It will have to be through the planning process.</p></speech>

Since I have come into office we have instigated quarterly meetings with Insurance Ireland.  I acknowledge that Deputy Sherlock came to me with information and we are trying to feed it to Insurance Ireland.  There are major problems in two areas, the first of which arises in areas where we installed demountable flood defences that are to the highest international standards but the insurance companies are not prepared to insure them.  That is a difficulty.  We have answered all the insurance companies' questions in terms of the protocol for the erection, maintenance and dismantling of the flood barriers and at our next meeting we will have further discussions on them.</p> <p>  The second area of concern is that people are not able to get insurance because the maps produced by CFRAM are creating difficulties where they are indicative and they should not be used for commercial purposes.  We continue to liaise with Insurance Ireland to try to build on that.  We are working on that issue.</p></speech>

The demountable walls meet best international practice.</p></speech>

I cannot tally why that would not be accepted by Insurance Ireland or any insurance provider, if it is best international practice and these insurance houses are international insurance houses.  It seems to me that the companies are refusing point blank to insure.  That seems to be closer to the truth.  The ultimate question for people who live in areas where work has been carried out and demountable walls are in place is whether there is a power to compel the companies to provide insurance.</p></speech>

I accept the Deputy's point in respect of the scheme to which he refers and we have discussed it in detail.  I am not happy with it and will work to try to get a resolution to the situation.</p></speech>

Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it agus a chomhghleacaithe.  T&aacute; c&uacute;pla ceist agam anseo.</p> <p>  We have figures for the schemes that will progress and the schemes that are targeted.  As anybody who has been following this for a couple of years, the same schemes appear to be on the same lists year after year.  I was looking at the list from 2015, which in fairness was before the Minister of State took office, there was a target to commence seven major flood relief schemes, but none was commenced in 2015.  The target for 2016 was to commence five schemes and seven were commenced.  Is it fair to say that the seven schemes that were commenced in 2016 were the seven schemes that were to be commenced in 2015 and were not delivered?  I refer to the south Ennis scheme.  When Deputy Simon Harris was the Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW, he told the D&aacute;il the scheme would commence in 2015.  He later informed the House that he anticipated that construction would commence in 2016 and would take 18 months to complete.  Now Deputy Canney is informing us today that it will commence in 2017.  Is my description of the south Ennis scheme correct?</p></speech>

We know the scheme has not commenced and has not yet commenced at this point in time.  The same schemes have been on the list of years.  The people of Clare are sick to the teeth of it.  Am I to believe this scheme will commence quite soon, that is, will it be within a number of weeks?  Is there a chance that Deputy Canney will be before this committee again and the south Ennis scheme will be one of the schemes to commence in 2018?</p></speech>

There are competing problems in respect of funding for flood relief schemes.</p> <p>  From my background in construction, I can understand some of them because the issues relate to engineering and water and it is very hard to define the timescale.</p> <p>  I have a note that the contractor for the Ennis works is to be appointed in the first quarter of 2017.  Construction will probably start in the second or third quarter of 2017.  What I have been doing since I took up the position in the OPW is looking at how long it takes to plan a project, as the Deputy has, and the average time it has taken to bring a project from inception through to the construction stage, that is, to the day that the machinery goes on the ground, has been seven years.  That is the way it has worked.  What we are doing is looking at ways of trying to shorten that timeframe.  With the work that has been done on CFRAM to date, it will knock two years off the length of the process for the projects that have been picked.  We have changed some of the planning procedures to try to expedite the whole process and to shorten it.</p><p>We have also had some cases in which we ran into engineering problems, environmental or other issues which delayed some projects.  My commitment is to reduce the timeframe from conception to construction.  Construction is the easiest part.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that some of my questions are on projects initiated prior to the Minister of State's time in the Department.  There are officials who have been there a lot longer than he has.  This is not something new.  A private company would be able to pinpoint the problems.  It would not have stated seven schemes would start in 2015 but none of them actually started.  It would have been out of business and liquidated by the end of the year.  Can one imagine a large construction company stating it will start seven major projects and none of them starting?

There are difficulties in areas such as Fermoy, to which the Deputy referred, where there are demountable flood barriers.  Insurance Ireland looked for the protocols for the operation of these demountable barriers.  It had queries about who was responsible for putting them up, taking them down, maintenance, where they were stored, how often they were inspected and how often they were used in a dry run to make sure they were still operational.  There were more than 100 questions to be answered and all of them have been.  Insurance Ireland is now working through the answers.  We will be meeting it in March to find out where we stand on the issue.</p></speech>

The demountable flood barriers are in place and have been certified.  However, for the people affected, there has been no real progress made in dealing with the issue of insurance.  The Minister of State has been in position for nearly a year but he cannot inform the committee that he is closer to resolving the issue.  We are at a stage where Insurance Ireland has asked a series of questions and answers have been provided.  However, there has been no indication that the answers will suffice.  If Insurance Ireland is satisfied with the answers, does it mean that insurance companies will start to insure properties in these areas?  Is there any assurance the Minister of State can give to the public on his ongoing engagement with Insurance Ireland?</p></speech>

The Department of Finance regulates the insurance companies.  We cannot force them to do anything.  We just provide the information as we complete every project.  We provide certification that they have been completed.  We have also done that with the demountable flood barriers.  Insurance Ireland has received further information on protocols and we are hoping it has gone through all of it.  If there are queries, it can come back to us.  I believe it has not yet come back with any.  There is interaction between meetings.</p></speech>

Obviously, there were no premises in Dublin which could accommodate them.  I understand the legal action taken by Hibernia REIT, the owner of the building, to look for vacant possession, has since been withdrawn.  The Office of Public Works has entered into a six-year contract with Hibernia REIT, or what is now known as a vulture fund.  It will pay &euro;6 million per year for the building, on which there is a one-off arrears payment of &euro;500,000.  My 11-year old son could figure this one out.  The total cost of a &euro;6 million a year contract for six years comes to &euro;36 million, plus arrears of &euro;500,000.  Hibernia REIT bought this office from the State for &euro;70 million.  It is a shocking waste of public moneys.  The problem is that the Garda will be out on its ear in six years time.  Will the Minister of State confirm that the Office of Public Works has entered into a new a six year lease at a cost which is 22% higher?  Will he explain why a one-off arrears payment had to be made?</p><p>Will the Minister of State inform the committee what the OPW is doing to source alternative accommodation?  As the Minister of State and I know, there is no alternative accommodation in Dublin which will suit the type of nerve centre required by the garda&iacute;.  Are we looking at a fresh build?  What is happening with that?  I understand it is before the Minister of State's time but we raised the issue with the former Minister of State and asked him to intervene with NAMA to buy the building.  What has happened here is a complete waste of public money. </p></speech>

I think the number of garda&iacute; is higher than what the Deputy said but it is a moot point.  The Deputy is right that it is the most critical building in terms of the teams of people that are in it.  We have a lease on the place for the next six years so we have a window of opportunity to provide a permanent base for all the garda&iacute; that are required.  We have identified a site on which we will build a new facility.  The budget for the building of that facility is something like &euro;80 million.  Discussions are going on between the Office of Public Works, the garda&iacute; and the Department of Justice and Equality to finalise the brief for the accommodation that will be required.  That work is ongoing.  There is a five-year window with a contingency of one year to allow for a new building to be built.  When I looked at it, I said it was something we needed to do so we would not find ourselves in the same situation in five or six years time.  This is the plan that will be put in place.  We are working closely with the Department of Justice and Equality whose Vote the money will be coming from to build it.</p> <p>  The Harcourt Street building was bought by the vulture fund.  I do not know how much it paid for it.  I think it was bought in a bundle that cost &euro;200 million.  The Deputy mentioned a figure which I am not aware of.  </p></speech>

The garda&iacute; are not using all of Harcourt Street site so there is an argument to be made that if the OPW was only purchasing that part of it, it could have gotten it for less than the reported &euro;70 million.  The &euro;70 million figure is out there in the public domain and it has not been disputed.  It would cost &euro;80 million for a new build and if that figure does not increase, it is absolutely mind-boggling that &euro;36.5 million will be paid in rent over the next six years in addition to the rent we already paid to the Hibernia REIT.  This is a State building.  How could the State allow the sale of the nerve centre of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to a vulture fund?  It is unbelievable.  It is like selling Leinster House.  It is madness.</p></speech>

I will not call myself a super-sub but I hope I can engage in a positive manner.  I welcome the Minister of State and his officials, particularly Mr. Buckley who is a constituent of mine.  In the past he has been a champion of creating jobs and a great advocate for creating employment in some of the forgotten counties such as Roscommon.  I wish him well in his role.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions I want to put to the Minister.  I acknowledge that we have engaged a lot with the Minister of State and he is good at engaging.  He has visited many localities that have been devastated by flooding.  There has certainly been some movement on schemes, which I acknowledge.  I will put a number of questions to the Minister of State and his officials.  If one looks at the flood risk management programme, over a two-year period there has been a reduction of &euro;12 million.  The allocation in 2015 was over &euro;87 million but, if I am correct, the allocation for 2017 is &euro;75 million.  What is the reason for the scale of that reduction over that two-year period?  Was the full allocation drawn down over the years?</p><p>Could I have an answer to that question initially?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.356" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1260" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017021500002#G00200"><p>Initially, I can tell the Deputy, that there was a carryover of &euro;7 million from the previous year which was spent in 2016-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.357" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1342" speakername="Eugene Murphy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017021500002#G00300"><p>It was a carryover.</p></speech>

Therefore, effectively, in 2016, we spent in excess of &euro;52 million on flood relief alone, which was a record spend for flood relief specifically in any one year.  We spent the &euro;45 million plus the &euro;7.52 million.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.359" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1342" speakername="Eugene Murphy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017021500002#G00500"><p>That is fine.  There also appears to be a substantial reduction in the level of funding provided to local authorities for minor works.  Again, I will refer to a three year framework, namely, 2014, 2015 and 2016.  If we look at 2014, the allocation was &euro;9 million.  In 2015, it was &euro;16 million.  However, according to the figures I have, in 2016 it was down to &euro;3 million.  The level of funding shows a sharp decline.  If we take that same period, the number of proposed projects increased from 27 in 2014 to 55 in 2015 and to 83 in 2016.  How can those figures be reconciled?  Is it that the OPW is carrying out the works itself as opposed to funding the local authority for minor works?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.360" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1260" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017021500002#G00600"><p>To date, the amount of funding which was approved to local authorities since the scheme was introduced is &euro;37.621 million and the local authorities have drawn down &euro;30.421 million.  The value of works directly undertaken by the OPW is &euro;1.5 million.  The number of approved projects is 597 and the number of them that have been completed is 435.  The estimated number of properties that were protected is 6,153.  On average, each year there is approximately &euro;3 million being spent on minor works.  There is no reduction in the funding as such because we will fund what the local authorities seek.  In terms of what they have sought, there may have been a spike that refers back to 2014 when there was an allocation of &euro;9.34 million and the following year it was &euro;16.83 million.  However, those figures are related to storm damage.  There was a specific fund for storm damage at the time, whereas the normal minor works flood relief schemes are averaging approximately &euro;3 million per annum.  There is no reduction.  We pay out based on the funds that are applied for by the local authorities, which averages at approximately &euro;3 million per year.</p></speech>

I think it is accepted that local authorities could solve many of those problems in the short term rather than having to go through the OPW with every project.  Would it not be a good thing to consider the possibility of broadening the minor works scheme?</p></speech>

However, there are a number of things to consider, including the capacity of the local authorities themselves to carry out these works or to even get the paperwork done and into us.  More money can definitely be spent.  There is no cap on what can be spent.  My officials and I are are also reviewing the scheme itself in terms of its cost benefit and other areas to see how we can make it, one might say, more attractive.  However, there definitely is huge interest in it from the local authorities.  If they want to apply for additional moneys, that can be examined.  We are not capping the money or refusing to give money if the scheme meets the criteria.  As the Deputy stated, it is a very good scheme to get works done.  One can see from the figures that nearly 6,200 properties have been protected for very small money.</p></speech>

Coming from Galway and having visited the Roscommon area, the Minister of State knows how badly we were hit and that we are still suffering the consequences of the last storm.  Has the Minister of State specific road budgets within his Department or is it all with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport?</p></speech>

Where roads have to be raised, there is a funding mechanism in place that has been applied by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The local authorities apply for funding for it.  We do not have funding in that regard.  Our primary objective is flood relief and emergency flood relief.  That is where we work.  We do not have funding for roads.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport provide that funding to local authorities.  It also provided for special budgets last year in counties where flooding had caused damage to the roads.</p></speech>

Local businesses and schools were closed.  If we consider parts of south Roscommon around Loch Fuinseann, which is still flooded long after the heavy rainfall is gone, would it not make sense to have a budget for roads in such areas?</p></speech>

I know, for instance, that the money was provided by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport from its budgets for anywhere along Loch Fuinseann where the roads were raised.  There is money available to the local authorities for that.  People contact me, including the Deputy, about getting works done here and there in terms of flood relief, which is my Department's responsibility.  It would be like asking the Department of Health to build a road because we cannot get into the ambulance to the house.  It does not do that and I cannot do that.  I do not have a budget for it.  We do not get a budget for it and we do not have the expertise that the local authorities have to construct roads or reconstruct them.  Our expertise is in the area of flood and flood relief.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that the Minister of State has taken a keen interest in examining with the OPW ways to possibly relieve some of the flooding issues, particularly along the River Shannon basin.  However, the Minister of State states:</p><blockquote>In terms of drainage maintenance, the OPW continues to maintain all arterial drainage schemes completed under the 1945 Arterial Drainage Act.  This investment provides ongoing protection to 650,000 acres of agricultural land, infrastructure and properties through the maintenance of 11,500 km of river channel including 730 km of embankments at an annual cost of &euro;15 million.  Separately, local authorities maintain 4,600 km of river channel providing further localised flood protection.</blockquote> <p>I put it to the Minister of State and his officials that there is in many respects a reluctance to deal with the issue of drainage.</p></speech>

We have spent money on the River Boyne, the River Glyde in Monaghan, the River Inny, the River Brosna, the Broadmeadow River, the River Corrib, the River Moy, in Donegal - the Deputy is gone but we did spend money there - on the Boyle River, the River Bonnet, the River Feale, the River Maine, the River Deel, Shannon embankments - the River Maigue, Shannon embankments - north and south, the Mulkear River, the Groody River, and in Killimer, Nenagh River, and Dunmanway.  Ongoing maintenance has been done year on year in all of these areas, where we have a legal responsibility.  In other areas, the local authorities have responsibility.  In some areas, the responsibility is with the repairing owners.  We have prepared some information for the repairing owners on how they can deal with their areas.</p> <p>  I know what the Deputy is thinking, which is that there are those who say that this is all about channel maintenance.  However, what we are doing on the River Shannon at the moment is unprecedented.  Waterways Ireland and the OPW, in consultation with the National Parks and Wildlife Service have machines clearing areas down in Madden Island and up again on the Shannon above, in Carrick on Shannon and in Mountcampbell.  Both sides, between Leitrim County Council and Roscommon County Council, are working together.</p><p>What we are doing within the Shannon Group is to prepare a template that we will be able to replicate in other areas where we have difficulties with channel clearing.  We are preparing that at the moment.  When carrying out channel clearing, we are working in SACs most of the time so we have to be very sensitive to what we do.  We are working on that.  </p></speech>

Bord na M&oacute;na has major works in the localities right along the River Shannon in Roscommon, Longford, and Offaly.  Has the Minister of State had any discussions with Bord na M&oacute;na about a possible dredging scheme to remove some of that silt from the Shannon?  I am sure the Minister of State will agree that capacity has been taken up by the build-up of silt and other things on the Shannon.  We need to get a dredging and drainage programme going as quickly as possible.  Have we brought Bord na M&oacute;na on board?  Is there any possibility of it coming on board, even on a pilot basis, to remove some of that silt?</p></speech>

It is part of the Shannon Group.  It is part of the agreement to put the maintenance programme in place which, as I said earlier, is unprecedented.  A working group has been put together to identify works we can do fairly easily and works which would take longer as a result of having to get consent and because of the environment and the Habitats Directive.  Bord na M&oacute;na is part of that.  I met representatives of Bord na M&oacute;na last year and they are very co-operative.  They very much want to make sure we bring a maintenance programme forward.  They also suggested that over the winter the low boglands could be used as attenuation ponds, so water could be flooded into them if required.  Bord na M&oacute;na is definitely on board.  All of the stakeholders involved in the Shannon are signed up to working together to bring in a maintenance programme.</p> <p>  We talk about Bord na M&oacute;na and silt in the Shannon.  I have looked at it and there are other areas where silt is coming in from private bogs.  That has to be looked at.  Over the years, things were done but now Bord na M&oacute;na works under a regime and what they can and cannot put into the Shannon is being controlled by the EPA.   I raised that in my first meeting with the Shannon Group.   </p> <p>  The other issue is the pilot schemes on water levels on Lough Allen, Lough Ree and Lough Derg.  It shows the Shannon Group has mettle.  It has demonstrated its mettle and that it is working with intent to get things done.  It has been a success this winter and is being monitored on an ongoing basis.  All of the local groups have recognised that things are being done in a co-operative way.  The local groups in Carrick-on-Shannon, the groups we met at the conference in Athlone and the groups in Ballinasloe are also very co-operative.</p></speech>

Previously, as the Minister of State, I and others know, the OPW has referred to the legal and contractual difficulties it may run into in delivering flood relief schemes.  I am sure the Minister of State will agree this is a very relevant issue.  Are we still dealing with legal and contractual problems with any of the works we are trying to carry out?</p></speech>

We have to work within all of that and we have to work within the law.  In the Office of Public Works all of the agencies that are involved, such as the National Parks and Wildlife Service, are co-operating very well with us.  The intent there is to get works done.  We are not being legally challenged but we have to work within the law so we will not be legally challenged and projects will not be held up.  It may take longer to get the project to where we need to get it but we will avoid a situation like the one we had in Galway city, where the outer bypass has been delayed ten years because it ended up in the European courts.  In the Office of Public Works, we make sure we work with the agencies to get around the issues so we can get a successful conclusion to projects without having a legal challenge.</p></speech>

Is there a possibility of a drainage scheme for land owners?  As the Minister of State knows, many landowners cannot afford to carry out necessary drainage works.  I have no doubt this is an issue in flooding.  Is there any intention of bringing into being a scheme that could alleviate some flooding difficulties that occur because farmers cannot drain the drains that are close to major roads?  Europe tells me this is not a problem.  There is no problem with small drainage schemes that will alleviate flooding.  Is it something that is on the Minister of State's radar?</p></speech>

It will advise farmers on what they can and cannot do in terms of their own banks of land beside the rivers.  The biggest difficulty of the farmers I speak to is not the cost but the fact they do not know how to go about getting the permissions to do it.  We are working on trying to get that in place.  The concern of the farmers I have met is to make sure they keep the water going so it does not flood their land.  They have a vested interest in it and have never said they want money to do it.  What they have asked about it how to go about doing it and where to go.  There is a plethora of agencies they may have to satisfy and we are trying to give them the guidance and help them so they can do the work.</p></speech>

One of the difficulties we have with the home relocation scheme is trying to identify exactly the quantity we are dealing with.  At this stage, having talked to the local authorities and gotten back as much information as we can on the potential relocation units we might have, we could be talking about a &euro;90 million budget in total.  We have a &euro;2 million budget to get the scheme up and running and we will look for further funding in 2018 and 2019 to continue with the relocation scheme.</p></speech>

It has been carried out, funded by the OPW through the county council, but the appropriate permissions were not given by the National Parks and Wildlife Service and others for a particular section of the work in time for all of the work to be completed.  The part that could be completed is completed but the silting up of the river is having an impact and is now rising over the non-return valves.  Is there a possibility that either the Office of Public Works or the council will inspect it?  Could funding be provided for the part that was not completed?  It is causing serious problems with the eye of the bridges and the channel itself.  There is a huge overgrowth now which is of concern to those who live in Callan.  It is also a problem for the scheme.</p><p>The silt is now having a negative impact on the infrastructure that has been put in by the scheme.  What happens in such a case?  How quickly would it take the OPW to sanction the work that is required or is that the way the Minister of State would have to go with it?</p></speech>

It is the River Nore flood relief scheme, which had its issues with cost but which was a fantastic scheme to watch being delivered.  The trucks were going up and down the bed of the river, etc.  It was a great engineering achievement.</p> <p>  Downriver the OPW facilitated some properties by granting them funds to prepare their own flood relief in terms of the impact of the major works that were carried out at the city.  In recent flooding, those works were washed away.  Businesses were destroyed to the point where they had to be started again from scratch.  I refer to Brett sawmills in Kilkenny which has been there for 100 years.  It was so badly affected it is now hugely difficult to rebuild it because there is no insurance.  I am merely asking what, if anything, the OPW can do to assist in that business because of the flooding.</p></speech>

I have two questions on visitor centres and the spreading of numbers.  As visitors come to Ireland and are attracted by Kilkenny Castle or the other heritage sites that we spoke about earlier, what plan has the Minister of State in place for the impact of Brexit on visitor numbers?  Is there an engagement with the tourism promotion of these sites?  Has the Minister of State conducted any analysis as to how these sites might be affected by it and deal with the issue, perhaps, of a drop in numbers?</p></speech>

While a good deal of our visitors come from England, if the Brexit brings borders with different exchanges or whatever, there could be difficulties.  Under Brexit, each Department and agency, including Bord F&aacute;ilte, is looking at the implications for visitor numbers coming to Ireland.  Bord F&aacute;ilte is involved in the promotion.  What we are doing is ensuring we work with Bord F&aacute;ilte in promotion and also ensuring the facilities are fit for purpose when people come to visit.</p></speech>

We spoke earlier about the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East and Dublin.  Bord F&aacute;ilte is conducting a review of the idea of the midlands and the lakelands being developed as another tourist brand.  We have a lot of gems which I have seen which I did not know about before I became Minister of State and which are not on the coast or down the Ireland's Ancient East route.  They are in Offaly, Carlow, Kilkenny and east Galway.  We need to promote all of them to showcase that we have something different.  It is about marketing.</p></speech>

This brings me to the point on a visit by the OPW to a location in Jerpoint in Kilkenny, which is privately owned.  It is the burial ground of St. Nicholas.  It is the best example in Europe of the layout of a town.  It is completely under grass but it has been presented in a way that one can identify the streets, the types of buildings and the river crossings.  I wonder what grants are in place to assist the owner of that type of property at least to maintain it in order that those who are visiting on coach tours are able to access the property with appropriate walkways, etc., because now there are restrictions on those who come by bus and yet it is a promotion of a county location rather than the central location.  What kind of grants or funding are available to assist people?  While significant money is not made out of these sites, it is so important for the State to ensure they are presented properly.</p></speech>

I mentioned to the Minister of State and his officials prior to the meeting about the possibility that the OPW would take a lead role in a project which I will outline.  It is the desire of Kilkenny people that we would acknowledge the hand-over of the castle, which has made such a significant difference to Kilkenny city, county, the region and the country as a whole, from the Butler family to the castle restoration committee, most of whom are now dead but there is one surviving member.  That is part of the history of the castle.  Perhaps as part of the presentation of that more recent history some arrangement could be made to explain the delivery of the castle, as it were, to the State.  It was given for a nominal sum of money, possibly &pound;5, but it has made such a difference to the city and county that the OPW should take the initiative and honour those who were involved and the fact that the transaction took place in such a reasonable way for such a major piece of land.  S&eacute;amus Pattison, a former Ceann Comhairle, often reminded me that in the course of the 1960s the Heinz company was going to apply to the local authority for a factory on the castle site.  Thank God that did not happen because it is worth substantially more to the city than a factory would have been.  I thank the Minister of State for his involvement in Kilkenny Castle.</p></speech>

As members know, the Department was restructured in 2016 around two directorates &ndash; the economic and fiscal directorate and the finance and banking directorate.  This structure remains largely unchanged in 2017.  There are a number of divisions in each directorate and I will briefly set out the key outputs from each of those divisions.</p> <p>  The EU and international division deals with the cross-departmental co-ordination of EU policy and with the development and implementation of strategies at European Union, euro area and international levels in regard to economic, fiscal and financial policy formulation.  It manages the EU budgetary process and EU economic governance.  It also builds relationships through Ireland's diplomatic network and ensures that the Minister and Department are fully apprised of EU and international developments.</p> <p>  The UK decision to leave the EU will result in major challenges for Ireland, as a small open economy with very strong economic ties to the UK.  It is one of our most important domestic and EU-level issues.  In addition to the priority of addressing the economic impacts, Ireland's key priorities are our economy, Northern Ireland, the common travel area and the future of the EU itself.  Government work has been ongoing since well before the referendum vote in the UK.  Since then, preparations have been intensified across all areas of Government to best safeguard Ireland's interests and to minimise any adverse impacts on our economy and on the free movement of people, goods and services on these islands.</p> <p>  A Brexit unit has been established within my Department and it is responsible for the co-ordination of the Department's contribution to the overall Government response on Brexit, preparation for the upcoming negotiations on the UK's withdrawal from the EU, and the future relationship; ongoing cross-departmental and interdepartmental consultation contributing to a whole-of-government response; and liaison with the Central Bank of Ireland, the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, and other agencies, as appropriate.</p><p> We know that, as result of our close economic ties, there are challenges to be met, as was highlighted by further macroeconomic analysis undertaken in November 2016 as part of the joint Department of Finance-Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, research agreement.  The best and most immediate policy within the Government's control to counter the likely negative economic impacts of Brexit is to prudently manage the public finances to ensure that Ireland's economy continues to remain competitive in the face of future economic headwinds.  In that regard, budget 2017 contained a number of prudential budgetary policy measures that will help our economy prepare for Brexit.  Additionally, the last budget, budget 2017, laid out an extensive range of policies targeted at the most exposed sectors, including measures to support small and medium enterprises, SMEs, entrepreneurship, agrifood and Irish exporters.  These measures are an important step in mitigating the impacts on the Irish economy from the economic implications of Brexit.  Furthermore, where Brexit presents potential opportunities, we will seek to maximise these.  For example, I refer to the area of financial services, where the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has responsibility for the IFS 2020 strategy that will build on and compete for mobile international investment in the international financial services, IFS, sector.  There are undoubtedly opportunities for financial services firms to locate here as Ireland remains a committed member of the European Union and the Single Market. </p><p> The EU financial services division of the Department continues to represent national interests in a European and international context.  During 2016 the division made an extensive contribution towards Council agreement on a range of financial services dossiers, including the anti-money laundering directive and the European venture capital funds regulation. </p><p> The Department's review of policy in the insurance sector was also initiated in 2016 in consultation with the Central Bank of Ireland, other Departments and agencies and external stakeholders.  In July 2016, a joint report on the review of the framework for motor insurance compensation in Ireland was published and work on the implementation of that report is already under way. </p><p> The international financial institutions division provides the primary interface with, and management of, Ireland&rsquo;s shareholder interests and obligations in a number of international financial institutions, including the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank Group, and the European Investment Bank.  The opening of the European Investment Bank&rsquo;s new office in Dublin in December 2016 was an important milestone for that bank and will serve to underpin and build upon the strong relationship that already exists between the bank and its counterparts in Ireland. </p><p> Small and medium enterprises, SMEs, make up the vast majority of businesses in Ireland and account for approximately seven in every ten jobs.  The latest Department of Finance credit demand survey for the period April to September 2016 indicates that while demand for credit remains subdued, trading conditions for SMEs remain broadly favourable despite the significant economic uncertainties.  Profitability also remains high with 87% of the SMEs reporting they had made a profit or had broken even in the last six months. </p><p> The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, continues to make low-cost, flexible finance available to SMEs across all sectors of the economy and all regions of the country.  To the end of September 2016, over 10,600 SMEs, operating across all business and economic sectors of the Irish economy, have benefitted from &euro;458 million of SBCI loans. </p><p> The financial stability group, FSG, established in January 2017, replaced the principals group as a forum for senior officials in the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and the NTMA to monitor and discuss financial stability risks facing the Irish economy.  The FSG will have a more forward-looking mandate, which is appropriate as the financial system moves from crisis management and the resolution phase into a growth phase. </p><p> My Department also constantly monitors and reviews the consumer protection frameworks that are in place in the area of financial services including, in 2016, the implementation of the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015.  Under this Act, relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes issued by the Central Bank of Ireland. </p><p> Another very important issue is the Central Bank tracker mortgage examination.  The Government is fully aware of the seriousness of this matter.  It is essential that affected customers receive acknowledgement for the harm they have suffered from lenders, and appropriate redress and compensation packages are put in place.  Therefore, the Government is committed to supporting the Central Bank in its independent examination of this matter in order to ensure a prompt and transparent conclusion.</p><p> Central Bank figures contained in its residential mortgage arrears and repossessions statistics to the end of the third quarter of 2016 show that progress continues to be made on mortgage arrears.  The number of mortgage accounts in arrears for principal dwelling houses, PDH, has declined for the last 13 quarters. A total of 121,140 PDH accounts were also classified as restructured, of which 88% were reported to be meeting the terms of their arrangement. </p><p> Throughout 2016, officials in my Department continued work on our strategy to monetise the State&rsquo;s remaining investments in the banks.  Given its size, our immediate strategy prioritises the return on our AIB investment as the next milestone with disposal strategies for Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB kept under review.  We have received strong advice that a stock market initial public offering, IPO, is best way to optimise the return from AIB, with the earliest possible IPO window being the second quarter of 2017.  We intend to be ready to avail of this window and recently appointed three firms from our panel of advisers to form the core of our selling syndicate.  The appointment of these firms as advisers does not signal any intention or obligation for us to proceed with a transaction, which will be subject to a number of factors, including favourable market conditions.</p><p> In the budget 2017 income tax package I provided, for the third year in succession, for reductions in marginal tax rates for low and middle income earners.  The Government&rsquo;s policy of phasing out the universal social charge, USC, over time, as resources allow, will increase take-home pay for taxpayers, increasing their spending power and allowing for consumer confidence to generate positive knock-on effects for businesses and jobs in the domestic economy.</p><p> The well-established economic recovery is maintaining momentum.  Gross domestic product, GDP, grew by 6.9% in the third quarter on an annual basis.  As a result, the annual average GDP growth rate was 4.7% in the first three quarters of 2016.  Encouragingly, the exporting sector appears to be holding up reasonably well despite the weakness in sterling.  Recovery is perhaps most clearly evident in the labour market with annual employment having increased in each of the last 16 quarters, representing an increase of over 194,000 jobs since the low point in 2012.  The number of people in employment has exceeded the 2 million mark since the second quarter of 2016 and is now at its highest level since the fourth quarter of 2008 - though with a more sustainable composition.   While the indicators for domestic activity are encouraging, the international outlook underlines the need for caution supported by prudent economic and fiscal policies.  Notwithstanding this, my Department is forecasting real GDP growth of 3.5% this year and 3.4% in 2018. </p><p> Public finances also continue to move in the right direction, with significant progress being made on the general government deficit.  As members are aware, Ireland exited the excessive deficit procedure during 2016.  Underpinned by a growing economy, the hard-won improvements in our public finances provide a sustainable budgetary platform upon which funding for the provision of public services can be provided in the years ahead.  The most recent bond sale, in which &euro;1.25 billion was raised through auction at yields of 0.088% and 1.026%, demonstrates that international investors have confidence in the Irish economy and its continued growth.</p><p>The market reaction to our management of the public finances has been positive but it is vital we sustain our progress.  We must guard against complacency, maintain our prudent management of the public finances and continue with competitiveness oriented policies.</p><p> The funding allocation sought for the finance group of Votes for 2017 totals &euro;389 million which compares to a 2016 Vote group total of &euro;379 million.  This represents an increase of &euro;10.3 million or 3%.  The primary driver of this increase is the provision of a &euro;10 million increase for the Office of the Revenue Commissioners relating to increasing staff numbers and other staff costs, which I will address later.</p><p> The allocation sought for the Department of Finance Vote in 2017 is &euro;39.47 million, of which some &euro;10 million is provided for a fuel grant scheme for disabled drivers.  Leaving this scheme aside, my Department's allocation provides for the administrative and non-administrative costs of the Department.  The majority of this, some 61%, is provided to cover salaries and allowances, with a further &euro;6 million, 20%, to cover facilities and non-pay administrative costs.  The remaining &euro;5 million is provided to cover the legal, advisory and committee costs necessary to support my Department in the proactive delivery of its remit.</p><p> The allocation for Vote 8 is for the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  This is an independent, constitutional office which has several responsibilities including controlling the release of funds for public services as approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, auditing public accounts, undertaking independent examinations on the management and use of public resources, and reporting the results of the work to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's public audit role covers 290 sets of financial statements and accounts produced by public bodies.  Together, those bodies have financial transactions which total over &euro;200 billion of public money each year.  The allocation for this office in 2017 is &euro;6.915 million, which is broadly unchanged from 2016.</p><p> Vote 9 is for the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  They have requested a budget allocation of &euro;331 million, an increase of &euro;10 million or 3% on the 2016 net Estimate.  Nearly three quarters of the budget is related to payroll for an employment ceiling of just over 6,000 officers.  The Office of the Revenue Commissioners plays a vital role in our economy by collecting taxes and duties due to the State.  In 2016, Revenue collected a record &euro;47.9 billion for the Exchequer.  In its recently published Statement of Strategy 2017-2019, Revenue is committed to two key strategic pillars, which are to provide a service to support compliance and to confront non-compliance.</p><p> In 2016, Revenue continued to support taxpayers in meeting their tax and duty obligations.  Almost 2.1 million payments were made through the Revenue online service, ROS, an increase of 8% on 2015.  The use of electronic business and PAYE self-service channels continued to increase in 2016.  Almost 1.4 million customs declarations were processed by the automated entry processing system, an increase of 7% on 2015.  During 2016, Revenue extended their electronic service channels through the introduction of RevPay which facilitates online payments for non-ROS customers, as well as jobs and pensions with a new online facility which allows first-time employees to register for tax online.  In the annual report published by the World Bank last November, Ireland was once again ranked first among EU countries, and fifth worldwide, for ease of paying taxes.  Looking forward, a key priority for Revenue will be the fundamental redesign and modernisation of the PAYE system, which I announced on budget day.  Non-compliance with tax and duty obligations is an ever present challenge and those who engage in evasion can expect a robust response from Revenue.  Through targeted and risk focused compliance interventions, Revenue continued to pursue those who do not meet their tax and duty obligations, as well as detecting those involved in tax evasion, shadow economy and smuggling activities.</p><p> In 2016, the yield from Revenue's audit and compliance interventions was &euro;555 million and there were 17 criminal convictions for serious tax and duty offences.  There were also 1,672 summary convictions with a total of &euro;5.1 million imposed in fines, as well as the publication of 372 settlements on the list of tax defaulters.  Revenue has also introduced a new data analysis system to its debt management operation which facilitates sophisticated case base segmentation and compliance tracking.  This allows for quicker intervention in non-compliant cases.</p><p> Tackling tax evasion is an important element of Revenue's non-compliance focus.  In my Budget Statement, I announced significant changes to the disclosure regime for Revenue audit.  From 1 May 2017, tax defaulters who use offshore facilities to hide income, accounts or other assets will no longer have the facility to make a voluntary disclosure.  This means that those who do not come forward before the end of April will face penalties of up to 100% of the tax evaded, publication in the list of tax defaulters and potentially criminal prosecution.</p><p> In strengthening our commitment in tackling non-compliance, the 2017 Estimates provides for an additional &euro;5 million to the Revenue Commissioners for increasing staff resources by 50 full-time equivalents on audit and investigation activities, as well as enhancing ICT systems capacity for data matching and data analytics.  This will lead to a direct increase in tax and duties yield from compliance interventions.</p><p> In other areas, Revenue continues to assist and support the Department of Finance in the formulation and implementation of tax policy.  Revenue also has a key role and is actively involved in cross-departmental discussions on the implications of Brexit.  Additional funding has also been allocated to the Revenue Commissioners to deal with challenges associated with Brexit.  The Government's position is clear in that we want the closest possible trading relationship with the UK.  In that regard, a key priority is to ensure the continued free flow of trade on the island and the need to avoid a hard Border.  The Revenue Commissioners are actively engaged examining a range of scenarios to support Ireland's stated objectives.  In this regard, the Estimate makes provision to increase Revenue staff by 40 full-time equivalents.</p><p> On Vote 10, the new Tax Appeals Commission, formerly the Office of the Appeal Commissioners, the Commission requested a budget allocation of &euro;1.605 million, a net increase of &euro;165,000, or 11% on the 2016 net Estimate.  The increase in the 2017 Estimate is to provide for the Commission to continue to advance its programme of modernisation and reform, as well as to address its caseload in an efficient and effective manner.  Specifically, the increase is largely accounted for by the need to provide for a significant number of additional personnel, including temporary commissioners and support staff, to deal with a large number of open appeal cases transferred from Revenue to the Tax Appeals Commission in 2016, as well as completing an ICT development programme for the commission necessitated by it becoming an independent statutory body.  With regard to the latter, an amount of spending originally anticipated for 2016 in respect of the provision of an electronic case management system is now expected to fall into 2017.</p><p> I thank members for their attention and I commend the Estimates for the finance group of Votes to the committee.  An unexpected meeting has come up for me some time after 4 p.m.  Accordingly, at some stage, and with the permission of the committee, I may be replaced by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.</p></speech>

A report appeared in the media today &ndash; I imagine the Minister is aware of it &ndash; suggesting the Revenue Commissioners have identified several locations along the Border, including in my county of Donegal, that would be areas of examination and identification for checkpoints for what are called red and green channels.  It is also stated that the M1 motorway between Dublin and Belfast is to be an area of considerable focus for customs officials should a hard border be needed.  Can the Minister confirm whether the Revenue officials are engaged in such activity and scoping work?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.446" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017021500002#O00700"><p>The Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, among his other responsibilities, has responsibility for the Customs services.  If Deputy Doherty is talking about the free movement of goods, it is an issue for Customs; whereas the free movement of people is more of an issue for the immigration authorities, with the chain of responsibility going back to the Department of Justice and Equality.</p> <p>  I had a discussion with the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners about how the Customs Service operates.  With your permission, Acting Chairman, I will take a few minutes to give the committee an insight.  The best insight arises from the procedure for goods from Third World countries coming in to Ireland rather than from European Union countries.  This is the worst case scenario if there is no deal with the UK.  Arrangements will have the status of Third World countries under the World Trade Organization.  At present, Revenue operates a colour coded channel system if goods are coming in from a Third World country.  The colours are green, orange and red.  Let us suppose something is coming from the Americas.  Everything has to be transferred electronically to the Customs in advance.  The procedure is that 92% of the goods are cleared in advance electronically.  They simply go through when the containers come in, without a check.  Goods in the orange zone may be subject to an electronic request for a manifest of what might be in individual containers, but there would not be a physical check of them.  The actual physical checking is less than 2%.</p> <p>  Let us suppose the UK ended up with a status operating under World Trade Organization rules.  That would be the template under which the Customs would operate.  However, given the large amount of trade we undertake with the UK and the large amount of imports received from the UK, volumes would change.</p> <p>  The Revenue is undertaking contingency planning, but it has not been directed from a policy point of view in any respect.  It would be prudent for the Revenue to consider the options, but that is all Revenue is doing at the moment.</p> <p>  The Taoiseach is speaking in the D&aacute;il this afternoon on Europe and Brexit.  The Taoiseach has enunciated the Government position on several occasions, saying that we want no hard border and no inhibition to the flow of goods and services across the Border.  From a Government policy point of view, we do not envisage Customs activity on the Border.  However, it will depend on where the negotiations go.  The British have a similar view.  They want free movement of goods and people as well.  However, the negotiators will be the negotiation team of the European Union.  Even though this is the intent of the two jurisdictions involved, we still have to get it across the line in Europe.  That might be five or six years down the line.</p> <p>  I will answer Deputy Doherty's question directly.  The Customs is looking at contingency in the event of where the negotiations may land, but the decision of Government and the policy position is not to have the kind of border that would require Customs officials to be in place.</p></speech>

I have a further question in respect of the contingency plans the Revenue is drawing up.  Some years back a campaign resulted in several Border roads being reopened.  This is relevant for my county of Donegal.  There are numerous roads, including main roads and national roads as well as secondary and local roads, that transcend the Border.  Does the contingency plan include numerous locations being identified in the relevant counties?  Is it the case that only the key arterial routes, like the Lifford to Strabane road, the Bridgend to Derry road or the Beleek to Pettigo road, are being targeted?  I appreciate that this is contingency planning, but is that the type of contingency planning the Revenue is considering in spots?</p></speech>

The information I am giving is drawn from a lengthy conversation and discussion I had with the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners two weeks ago.  I have no wish to say anything to give the committee a wrong steer.  I would invite the Deputy to put down a written parliamentary question to me and I will find out the exact up-to-date position with regard to contingency planning.  In that way we will provide the relevant information to the Deputy.</p></speech>

The Minister referred to Customs controls.  Did he indicate that it may be possible, even in the event that the UK leaves the EU Customs Union, not to have any physical Customs controls or Customs-related activities at the Border? </p></speech>

I have had various discussions, but they have been informal and without any policy status.  Let us suppose goods come in to Dublin Port, they follow the colour coding I have described and there is a physical check on 2% at Dublin Port.  Then let us suppose the lorry drives north and crosses the Border.  Effectively, the technical people have said to me - again, this is not a policy position &ndash; that all we have to do is put in place a camera to get the licence plate on the Border to verify that pre-clearance took place in Dublin Port.  In other words, there would be no necessity for a Border check.</p> <p>  I understand that with regard to the movement of people, the UK authorities are not doing checks at the point of entry.  They are doing checks internally, including by matching PRSI numbers and revenue numbers and so on.  That is how they are doing follow-up work.</p> <p>  The process has moved on.  It would be wrong to think of fixed borders as we knew them.  Anyway, it will all depend on where the negotiations land.  The UK negotiating position is for a reciprocal free trade agreement between the UK and Europe.  If there is a reciprocal free trade agreement, there will be no tariffs of any kind.  We would only have the normal checks for illicit materials.</p></speech>

That would be a criminal activity and it would be a matter for the garda&iacute;.  Where the issue arises along the Border domestically would be, for example, the man from the bakery with the bread van delivering to shops on both sides of the Border, so that he would be up and down and over and back.  I am told arrangements can be made for these things.</p> <p>  There is no doubt this is going to be a difficult negotiation.  I ask members of the committee not to take anything I am saying as a definitive policy position.  I am trying to scope out current practice in respect of third country goods to give the committee the flavour of how British goods might be handled in the worst case scenario.  I would hope it would not be the worst case scenario because, as I said, Prime Minister May's position is to negotiate a reciprocal free trade with the EU.  If she does not get that, I would assume that she would get some way down that road. </p></speech>

At this point in time there is a free flow of people crossing the Border in both directions and carrying out their shopping activities because we are in a customs union.  We are speculating here but is it a possible outcome, in the event that Britain takes itself out of the customs union and that there is not a free trade agreement between both jurisdictions, the EU and Britain, it would be a criminal activity for an individual from my county to go across the Border to shop in the ASDA in Strabane and to come back with their boot full of shopping without going home and filling in a VAT or customs return?  How do we deal with that?</p></speech>

It has been reported that it will describe it as flawed and unable to demonstrate that it was good value for the State.  There has been an agreement to set up a commission of investigation.  The question I have for the Minister is how prepared is the Department of Finance, and indeed is the Minister of Finance himself, to engage with that commission of investigation, the terms of reference of which will obviously require them to do so?  What pressure or strain, if any, will dealing with that commission put on his Department alongside the other challenges that it has?

I volunteered at the PAC's request to appear before it.  I gave five hours of evidence and my officials and I were there for three days with innumerable hours of evidence.  The matter which the newspapers are now saying will be the basis of an adverse finding against me was never raised with me in five hours of evidence.  The minutes of the particular meeting were put up on the website back in 2015 by my Department.  Subsequently there was a written request from the PAC for documents around that meeting and everything was supplied to it.  No question was raised with me about that meeting on receipt of that set of documents.</p> <p>  As I understand due process, an adverse finding cannot be listed for anybody without giving them the right to reply.  The meeting I had with Cerberus was not inappropriate in any way whatsoever.  The PAC has legal advice saying that the functions of NAMA, the Minister and the Department were entirely different and that I had no legal right or authority to interfere with the commercial decisions of NAMA, and I did not.  The minutes of the meeting are on the Internet.  If what is in the newspapers is accurate, I strongly rebut this.  If the PAC is now going to draw adverse conclusions about matters it never raised, after I gave five hours of evidence on a voluntary basis and was in correspondence with it subsequently, I would be very surprised it would do business in that way. </p></speech>

We are looking at the eurozone growth figures for the fourth quarter of this year and they are being revised downwards to something like 0.4% from 0.5%.  I understand that letters have been issued to something like seven countries, although not to Ireland thankfully.  Increasingly what we are seeing in respect of the Stability and Growth Pact is that there is a lot of focus on the stability but very little on the growth.  I would like to get a perspective from the Minister as to where Ireland stands on, for instance, recent comments by the German finance Minister that there may need to be a review of the Stability and Growth Pact and where the politics of that rest at present within the EU.</p> <p>  If we are looking at growth in our own economy and capital spending, obviously there is going to be a turf war on the capital spend.  The Minister and I both inhabit the great province of Munster.  We would be looking at regional economic development between Cork, Limerick and Galway and that Atlantic corridor.  People representing the eastern side of the country would be looking at metro north, the M50 and other such projects.  If we are to be realistic about proper investment in projects of this nature, there needs to be some degree of flexibility built in to, or a revision of, the Stability and Growth Pact because I think it is actually impeding the potential for growth.  There cannot be growth without proper regional infrastructure.</p><p>I would welcome the Minister's perspective on that and on whether that conversation is being had by ECOFIN Ministers.</p></speech>

We are maintaining that as the forecast even though there are some signs of variations on it.  In January, the Central Bank marked the forecast down to 3.3% while Davy's Stockbrokers marked it up to 5% on the basis of recent data showing that domestic demand continues to be strong.  I think there would be agreement that the adverse affects of Brexit that were anticipated, if they existed at all, have worked themselves through at this stage.  We mark down growth rates by 0.5%.  The weakness of sterling is coming into the equation but it looks now as if our position is pretty strong.  We will monitor the forecast as the year passes and we will revisit it in the context of the summer economic forecast.</p> <p>  Growth rates in Europe have risen.  The current forecast is 1.7% to 1.8% across the Community but there are regional variations on that.  All European countries across the 28 member states are showing positive growth now.</p></speech>

On investment, like Ireland, Europe experienced a crisis but its impact was uneven across the Continent.  It impacted more strongly on one set of countries than others.  As a general observation, Europe is underinvested in infrastructure.  Ireland is underinvested, in my view, in both social and economic infrastructure.  In terms of economic infrastructure we need to work on completion of the roads programme, investment in the ports, airports and broadband and investment in social infrastructure in terms of refurbishment of schools, including prefab replacement, health centres and so on.</p><p>The capital programme announced in 2015, which relates to spend up to 2022, is &euro;42 billion, but that includes the public capital programme from the Exchequer and the investment intentions and policies of the commercial State bodies.  We know from experiences over the past year that more resources will be required for the public capital programme.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has announced that he will revise upward the public capital programme and I understand he will do that in the first half of this year, although I am not sure of the date.  Although I do not think he will be nominating projects, he has notified Departments that additional resources will be made available and projects will be prioritised.  The Minister proposes to make the announcement in this regard some time in the course of this year.  As I said, I do not know the timeline.</p><p>In regard to Europe, the rules continue to be the rules but we argue for flexibility on all occasions.  As the Deputy will be aware, Mr. Andrew McDowell is now vice president of the European Investment Bank.  I am an <i>ex officio</i>governor of the European Investment Bank.  I am working with Mr. McDowell to see if we can get additional resources for a public capital programme.  Mr. McDowell is also working with EUROSTAT on whether we can finance off-balance sheet.  The Deputy will be aware from public private partnerships that the key test will be around transfer of the risk.  Transferring the risk means transfer of the financial liability to the entity that is building the road, school and so on.  We have just started this initiative but we have already discovered that we can expect the EIB to look favourably on projects that generate an income stream.  For example, if we proposed to undertake a project in the public transport arena which resulted in the fares accruing from that being sufficient to service the loan, we could get it off-balance sheet.  There are other projects of a similar nature.</p></speech>

If they do not, we will have two motorways.  People will driving on that motorway at the back end of this year.  There are other large projects in the pipeline.  I agree with the general principle behind Deputy Sherlock's question, namely, that we need more investment in infrastructure and to find the resources for that.  While the capital programme is under way and it is stronger than it was, it will be revised because extra resources are available now.  That will be done in the course of this year.  The additional bit I would like to put in place would be off-balance sheet financing through the European Investment Bank at low interest rates in respect of big infrastructural projects that would have an income flow.  We will see how that works out.  I am not promising anything.  All I am saying is that it is worth exploring.</p></speech>

I refer the Minister to the recent parallel in Limerick whereby the Strand apartments were sold by NAMA to Oaktree, leaving the tenants faced with eviction.  Is this an issue the Minister is taking into account in terms of the process of privatisation?</p></speech>

The sale of 25% of AIB and what it might do with its impaired loan books is not connected.  I am aware that AIB is examining the possibility of selling a loan book but my understanding is that loan book is in the main buy-to-rent rather than private mortgages.  The big problem with vulture funds is their names.  The Deputy will have seen articles in the newspapers to the effect that some of the vulture funds have more discretion to do deals with people than the banks have.  I cannot vouch for that.  If a bank writes off bad debt, it is crystallising bad debts on its books, bringing it forward and crystallising upfront whereas if somebody buys a loan book for 50 cent on the euro, then that person has a 50 cent head run to negotiate a settlement with the borrower.  There are mixed views about this, which I admit, but there is publicity in both directions in the newspapers.</p> <p>  The credit servicing legislation is in place.  Under law, the same obligations apply to the purchaser of loan books as applies to the original loaner of the loan books.  The Central Bank is a vigilant regulator and it keeps a close on what is happening.  In regard to the proposed privatisation of AIB, my intention is to sell around 25% of it.  I would not be in a hurry to put the remainder of it on the market.  I was talking recently to my former Swedish colleague about the Swedish banking crisis in the early 1990s.  Sweden only sold off the last tranche of shares in the banks in 2015.  By holding on to them for a time, they recovered, in nominal terms, about three times what they had invested.</p><p>It is a long game and my successors will deal with the matter.  I am not certain we are going ahead with 25% this year.  We have started a process but there is no compulsion on us from a debt management point of view or anything like that to sell.  It is not like it was four years ago when Europe said we had to sell assets to get debt down.  It is not like that.  This is totally discretionary.  We will only sell if we think we will get full value for the shares.  If we do not sell then someone else will in the future.  </p></speech>

Previously the Minister has said that he had full confidence in both NAMA and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The reports are that the Committee of Public Accounts report will strongly back the Comptroller and Auditor General against NAMA.  In respect of the two entities saying two different things, only one can be accurate.  What position does that put the Minister in?  Does he wish to revise his estimate of having full confidence in both if it is the case that the Comptroller and Auditor General has been very critical of NAMA, a view now backed by the Committee of Public Accounts?</p></speech>

I have never seen an inquiry or tribunal where an adverse finding was found against anybody on which that person was not allowed to comment.  I spent five hours in there and was not compelled.  I went in as a volunteer because the committee asked me.  I answered everything and then I find there is an adverse finding about something, supposedly, that was never raised with me.  There was a second shot at it when they looked for documentary evidence, which I provided, relevant to the meeting.  When they received that they raised no question with me about it.  I just do not understand what kind of legal advice was applied when this document was generated.  I have written to the Chairman of the committee and pointed these things out to him.  I do not think that I should get involved in a discussion on it because of that.  I must wait until there is a final report. </p></speech>

The committee has written to the Minister about the vulture funds and meetings that the Minister or his Department officials have had with them.  I am coming at this matter from a different perspective.  If representatives of these funds have met the Minister and his officials, they have refused to come here before us.  As a committee, we want to look in their eyes to ascertain their agenda although we know that in a single line it is profit.  We want to get an idea of how they operate.  I ask the Minister that in his discussions with them to encourage them to come here.  They have refused point blank.  Due to the fact that they will end up with a considerable size of the market and there are individuals caught up in those loans and debts, it would be relevant if they would come before the committee.  It is a pity that they do not.  They have refused so far.</p></speech>

It started very strongly around 2014 and has pretty well worked its way through the system.  NAMA has redeemed something like &euro;30 billion worth of the loan notes that it had.  In terms of assets the notes are down to about &euro;1.5 billion so its work is nearly complete.  I do not know how far up the road the IBRC is but I think it is fairly up the road as well.</p></speech>

A vulture fund could be funded by the State and could take in these loans from the banks at the same rate that a vulture fund might get them.  Then it would be in a position to either continue at a lower mortgage repayment or create a situation where people become tenants and remain in their own homes.  That is the level we are at.</p></speech>

The objective is to explore what is available within the current market and to determine if this alternative model will benefit a greater number of households.</p> <p>  At the minute the local authority is empowered to purchase a house that has an impaired mortgage and rent it back to the owners so that they become local authority tenants.  What if the same model could be applied to private funds?  One must do the sum obviously.  The issue would be whether the income flow generated from rental income was sufficient to service the loan.  It is a good idea that is being explored actively but not in the Department of Finance.  My officials have had a conversation with the officials of the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and the matter is being explored.  </p></speech>

An extensive operation is under way out of the Department working with the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and the Departments of the Taoiseach and Foreign Affairs to make sure financial services entities that currently reside in the UK continue to have access to the Single Market from other locations should they find at the conclusion of the Brexit negotiations that they are unable to retain such access from the UK.   The work I am involved is to ensure Dublin and Cork, in particular, are seen as destinations for these firms to continue to access the Single Market.  Having been appointed to this role, I visited London prior to the Brexit vote to talk to the London Irish Business Society and the diplomatic community.  I also met a few other Irish people who are involved in business there to get their sense of where everything was going.  I met bank representatives to talk about their contingency planning.  Once the decision was known, engagement on our side ramped up quickly because we had one our contingency planning as a Government but companies had also done their contingency planning.  They were coming back into the country to kick the tyres around again.</p> <p>  IFS 2020 is the five-year strategy for expanding our international financial services sector.  We immediately went about retooling some of the key elements of the action plan for 2016 to adapt it to Brexit.  We wanted to launch the new promotional banner brand, IFS Ireland, which represents the IDA and the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Finance, in Asia and North America in order that when people saw IFS Ireland, they knew what it meant - a young, educated workforce in a niche, developing, innovative financial services centre.  Brexit gave us the opportunity to talk about how much of a better offering we have.  We, therefore, talk about the three Ls - language, location and law.  We are a common law jurisdiction, an English speaking workforce is important to Asian countries as is our location in terms of accessibility not just to London but to other parts of Europe.</p> <p>  At the same time, I began to engage with industry domestically and elsewhere, particularly in London, to put together further contingency planning around risks and opportunities.  I am a member of the Cabinet sub-committee on Brexit and I have a feed into that work there as well.  Ongoing work was done in parallel with continued engagements in Singapore, Shanghai, Tokyo, New York and Washington last year and Hong Kong, Beijing and a number of trips to London so far this year.</p> <p>  Prime Minister May has sought to put potentially a carve-out for financial services in a free trade agreement.  That might come in the future.  I have met representatives of the corporation, City of London, a few times and they have lobbied hard for such an agreement.  However, they have since changed their position and they are seeking more of a bespoke arrangement where there might be passporting or its equivalent for certain entities.  That means we continue to live in an environment of uncertainty.  If the authorisation process for a financial services entity takes more than two years, it will be unable to wait until we have sight of what will happen.  From last September onwards, we began to learn that companies would make decisions in the first two quarters of this year.  I have made sure I am available to meet those entities where they have questions around the operating environment here.  Sometimes they will go through the IDA or directly to my office or I organise meetings in London with 60 or 70 people in the room to discuss all the benefits of coming to Ireland and continuing to access the Single Market in terms of financial services offerings.</p> <p>  The IFS 2020 action plan for this year was launched at the European Financial Forum.  This was attended by approximately 700 delegates from more than 400 companies based in 20 countries.  Meetings were held on the side and there was a great deal of positive engagement and positive press.  The action plan has two components.  The first relates to the context of the Brexit, the Central Bank, international education and communications and the second outlines the 40 key actions under four pillars.  Some have a specific Brexit dimension but others are more about maintaining a commitment to the regions and a focus on particular subsectors which all have a Brexit element underneath that.</p> <p>  To come back to the core question, what we think will happen is companies will continue to have a presence in the UK, including US companies, but they will move portions of their business abroad or start new hires abroad.  They will go to different jurisdictions but we will in the mix and we will get more than our fair share from what I am hearing.  I am worried about what other jurisdictions are saying to firms at a regulatory level when they meet them in terms of commitments they might be making that they may be unable to fulfil.  That is doing a little reputational damage to our offering and, therefore, we are robustly countering that at every opportunity.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.516" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017021500002#S00700"><p>I would describe it as "dangerous competition".  I have been stressing to people I have met at a political level the importance of a transitional arrangement to protect the security of our financial system in this entire process because the financial architecture we have across Europe underpins day-to-day business, including exporting, businesses getting loans and trade.  It is important to have a transitional arrangement in place and the Taoiseach spoke about this at another forum earlier.  In that way, we can have the negotiations in a calm and safe environment.  I am bothered when I hear that other jurisdictions are potentially making commitments on the level of regulation and supervision they might put in place when we work to a common framework under the ECB and various European laws and standards.  We are in a competitive environment.  We are not being predatory regarding London, as the Minister has said, but we want to facilitate companies where we can and, therefore, we are competing with other jurisdictions.  What we have heard from some companies makes me question whether they are being prudent.  If a significant company was to choose another jurisdiction as its location and what it had been led to believe did not transpire to be true and created difficulties for it, that would be worrying.  We have been in communication with our European partners on this.  I am visiting Brussels next week to meet members of the Commission and I will make that point to them.</p></speech>

If promises are being made on regulation and how companies will be treated when we are meant to be under a common supervisory and regulatory system------</p></speech>

My understanding is its officials are aware of it and they have raised it with the ECB but I cannot speak for them and I do not want to put words in their mouths.  I am speaking from memory but a meeting might be coming up to discuss some of the elements that have been reported but not confirmed------</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.519" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017021500002#S01000"><p>How many jobs could be attracted from the UK in the context of Brexit?  Could the Minister of State also comment on the quality of the jobs?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.520" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017021500002#S01100"><p>It is difficult to put a number on the quantity because we are in a changing environment.  Some companies have decided to create more jobs in Ireland as a result of Brexit but they will not attribute them to Brexit immediately because they have relationships in other jurisdictions to which they are sensitive.  Companies have chosen Ireland as a contingency but they have time to wait until they trigger it.  They may not have to depending on what agreement is put in place. Other companies are waiting to make decisions and because they do not know what it will mean for them, they cannot put a number on this.  Therefore, if they cannot, we cannot.  IFS 2020 is about expanding the sector by 30% or between 35,000 and 45,000 by the end of 2019 and I anticipate that we will surpass that.</p><p> The Deputy asked about the quality of jobs.  We have had inquiries from entities in every part of the financial services industry and in every part of the value chain in terms of jobs.  We will see high-end jobs coming into this country if we can manage to get a couple of big wins in particular areas where we currently do a bit of the infrastructure - a bit of the plumbing - but we do not do the front office.  If we can become a location for the front office, we will see a big gain with high-end jobs coming in, and not just to Dublin.  Certain companies that have offices in Kilkenny and Cork are increasingly moving high-end jobs outside Dublin into the regions because of the cost competitive advantage and because the workforce is there.  The Deputy knows all the reasons.  He knows the strong offering Cork has in IFS.  We will see high-quality jobs coming through.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has emphasised the regional dimension.  As he is well aware, there are many pressures in Dublin.  With Brexit, it is hoped that many jobs will come to Dublin in the financial services area.  The regions have a lot to offer.  The Chairman will make the case for Kilkenny.  I and others will make the case for Cork with the university we have, the tier 1 data connection, the airport, being very competitive in office accommodation costs and so on.  The Minister of State will be aware that Cork Chamber has done considerable work in its support for IFS 2020 and promoting Cork.  I wish to reinforce that.  I know the Minister of State has been there.  He should keep the regions centre stage in his assessment of where incoming investment and FS can go.  The regions have a huge amount to offer.  This is an opportunity that only comes once and we have to make the most of it.</p></speech>

As he will be aware, currently one third of Ireland's IFS jobs are outside Dublin, so there is already a strong offering.  IFS 2020 was developed with industry.  I am working with those in the industry on a weekly basis to ensure we are across everything we need to be across.  They have been incredibly helpful in terms of intelligence.  I have been unambiguous on this.  I think Cork should be the second city for international financial services.  When I was there recently on my second visit I said it was not for me to say that because those in Cork have done it themselves.  Organisations such as Cork Chamber, Connecting Cork and UCC are doing a fantastic amount of work to position Cork, which is a very exciting place.  As the Deputy said, this is potentially a once in a lifetime opportunity and we need to ensure we are completely across it.</p> <p>  Having said that, I have also been to Kilkenny.</p></speech>

I have been to Drogheda twice, I have been to Kilkenny, I have been to Cork twice and I have been to Kerry.  I will be in Galway in two weeks and I will be in Limerick the week after that.  It is very important to me because I believe there is a real opportunity to correct some of the things we have got wrong in the past such as our strategic development in certain industries.</p> <p>  Certain very exciting things are happening.  I hope the Chairman does not mind me mentioning State Street which has a very strong presence in Kilkenny.  It is involved in the joint action committee I have with IFS 2020.  It is also doing great work down in Cork.  Such companies are making a very strong contribution to the country and what the Government can achieve, and a very strong contribution to places like Kilkenny.  It has a great workforce there.  Its workers are getting the benefit of living in a location like Kilkenny and not suffering some of the problems we have in Dublin.</p></speech>

I asked earlier about the engagement of friendly vulture funds with the banks.  Could the Department not be proactive about that?  I know the Minister of State has got some information from his officials on the setting up of that fund and perhaps on the use of Government bonds to progress the notion of taking these bad debts from the bank and allowing them work out, similar to the business one.</p></speech>

We have been dealing with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government to ensure we can see what has worked in the past for local authority residents and whether it might work in the future for other mortgage holders.</p></speech>

The same applies to Ulster Bank on the commercial decisions it made around the global fund.  We will engage with the Central Bank again, but it is an ongoing process that is affecting people's lives.  I would like to see greater efficiency in how it is dealing with it.

The Central Bank does not place enough emphasis on that area.  I would like to see the Central Bank highlight its role in protection.</p> <p>  Vote 8 relates to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  As the Department of Finance is responsible for the policy relating to the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts, it should extend the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General to ensure he can track the money, where necessary, down to the point where it is spent.  As the Minister of State is a former member of the Committee of Public Accounts, he will know there are roadblocks on the way to achieving real transparency and accountability.  I would like to see a policy shift to provide powers to the Comptroller and Auditor General to give greater accountability.  That would apply to Irish Water if it continues to exist.</p></speech>

We experienced frustration with issues such as the Poolbeg incinerator where we could not get past how the local authority spent that money.  Unfortunately, a former Member from the Chairman's constituency and a member of my party was not of the view that that was the correct approach.  I remember debating the Bill in the D&aacute;il.  I think we had the same position even though legislation was going through at the time.  I am not sure about the current position.  I have not discussed it with the Minister, Deputy Coveney.</p></speech>
