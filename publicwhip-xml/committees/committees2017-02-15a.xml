Deputy Mattie McGrath has also indicated that he might be unable to attend. </p><p>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Dara Murphy.  Ongoing strong engagement between the committee and the Minister of State is very important and we appreciate the time he dedicates to working with us.  Many committee members had the chance to meet him when we were in Brussels last week, but it is also helpful to have a formal discussion about the work of the General Affairs Council, as well as other key developments on the European agenda.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>I invite the Minister of State to make his opening remarks, after which I will open the meeting to questions from members.  I again thank the Minister of State for taking time out to be here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1282" speakername="Dara Murphy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017021500002#A00300"><p>Thank you, Chairman, for your expression of thanks.  I acknowledge the strong diplomatic presence at the meeting.  I also thank you, Chairman, for your recent assistance in providing a pair for me which was very important and also for the excellent job you did two weeks ago when virtually every committee member was in Brussels.  I am more than happy to answer questions and make my statement, but, equally, I am interested in hearing the observations of members following their meetings.  I am aware, for example, that Senator Terry Leyden was in Valletta recently.  There is very good engagement with the committee.  I am delighted to be back before it and appreciate the agreement of members to having a slightly shorter format.  Many of us will attend the Taoiseach's keynote address this afternoon entitled, Ireland at the Heart of a Changing European Union, which will take place in little over an hour.  I will keep my intervention a little more brief than usual to allow time for interaction.</p> <p>  There have been two General Affairs Council meetings since my last appearance before the committee.  The first of the General Affairs Councils I attended and the first under the Maltese Presidency was held in Valletta on 23 and 24 January.  There were two agenda items, the first of which was on the Maltese Presidency's priorities - migration, the Single Market, security, social inclusion, Europe's neighbourhood and maritime issues.  We very much support these priorities.  We strongly believe they are realistic and achievable and address most of the key challenges facing the European Union.</p> <p>  Of the six priorities, the Maltese highlighted migration as being the No. 1 priority.  The migration crisis may have faded to a certain extent from the media headlines in recent months, but it is far from being resolved.  On the contrary, it remains one of the biggest challenges facing the European Union.  A total of 180,000 migrants entered the Union last year via the central Mediterranean route - essentially from Libya to Italy.  Behind this headline figure, sadly, hundreds drowned and many lives were shattered.  Migration will and must remain high on the EU agenda for the foreseeable future and the March European Council which will involve Heads of State and Government will address it again, as it has done continuously since the crisis developed in the spring of 2015.</p> <p>  The second item on the agenda of the January General Affairs Council was the future of Europe.  To frame discussions, the Maltese Presidency produced a short paper highlighting the need for citizens' trust to be re-established in the European project and for the delivery of a realistic agenda focused on practical issues.</p><p>Ireland strongly supports this approach.  We want to see the Bratislava process which was launched in the aftermath of the British referendum and the focus of President Tusk's informal summit of Heads of State and Government held in the Slovakian capital in September concentrate on practical issues which improve the lives of citizens through measures such as increased investment and the creation of more job opportunities.  Progress in implementing the Single Market, in particular, the digital Single Market, will be of vital importance in achieving this goal.</p><p> On 3 February the leaders of the 27 member states had another meeting to discuss what they envisaged for the Rome summit on 25 March, which will mark the 60th anniversary of the birth of the European Union when the Treaty of Rome was signed.  While no written conclusions emerged from the meeting, as I indicated, it broadly agreed that this was not the time for bold new initiatives, still less consideration of treaty change.  However, it was also agreed that we had to work on existing priorities in a much more energised fashion.  Given the ever-changing geopolitical landscape, there was also a strong view that the importance of the European Union in protecting and promoting European values internally and globally had to be prioritised. </p><p> The Commission indicated that it viewed the March European Council as being about consolidation and restoring the security of citizens from both internal and external challenges.  At the meeting I stated that, from Ireland&rsquo;s viewpoint, the March European Council would be an important step in refocusing the European Union.  As we are all aware, there are a myriad of items competing for attention.  However, we must also ensure adequate attention is given to economic issues.  Sometimes, given the capacity of people to focus on other key matters, there is a danger that these bread and butter issues will become marginalised.  They remain, however, issues of immediate concern to citizens and addressing them would improve their lives.  If we want to seriously address the gap which many EU citizens see between the European Union and the lives they lead, this is a pragmatic way of doing so and showing the link.  I hope the next meeting of the European Council will provide a tangible demonstration of the European Union's determination to focus on and deliver measures that will improve the lives of European citizens in a concrete and specific manner.</p><p> To be clear, the decision making will take place at a political and at European Council level between the 27 member states.  While there will be some additional meetings, the General Affairs Council will meet on a monthly basis and our ambassador will be involved in weekly meetings of the working group which will also have officials from Ireland in attendance.  The various groups in Ireland will meet perhaps twice each week.  There will, therefore, be a high level of engagement.  Having met Ambassador Kelleher and some of our team of officials in the Permanent Representation in Brussels, I hope the Chairman is satisfied with their level of expertise and engagement.</p><p> Given the way in which politics in Europe works, I restate the very important role the political groups in the European Parliament will play.  The group to which the Fine Gael Party belongs, the European People's Party, has a role, as do the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, ALDE, to which Fianna F&aacute;il belongs, the GUE/NGL group, the Socialist Group and Independents who also have a strong presence.</p><p> I hope the engagement by members the week before last will mark the start of a process of continued engagement.  I understand the committee will continue to be a forum European Union officials will attend.  I have visited 15 member states in recent months and one of my key objectives has been to speak to committees such as this one in other countries, not only to make Ireland's views known on key issues with respect to security, the peace process and the free movement of people but also to listen to the concerns of other countries, many of which have similar concerns to ours.  I also wish to identify possibilities for building alliances and strategic partnerships.  Many of those with whom we engage are members of other political groupings and relationships with them will be very important.  The term "green jersey" is sometimes viewed as being a little fluffy, but we should not underestimate the links and influence we have.  This will be a long game.  Changes in the governments of member states will continue to take place on a cyclical basis.</p><p> I compliment the work done by the joint committee.  I will be pleased to take questions from members and listen to observations they may have following their recent visit to Brussels.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1319" speakername="Michael Healy-Rae" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017021500002#B00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his engagement with a delegation from the committee when we visited Brussels last week.</p><p>I also thank the secretariat who organised the trip so well.  We were all well prepared.  I thank the Deputies and Senators for their commitment to the process over a couple of days.  I acknowledge the cross-party work of our MEPs and their staff in Brussels.  One often hears negativity about politicians, but they are doing their best for us in stormy waters and troubled times.  It is only right to put on the record of this committee that we acknowledge the assistance of our MEPs and their staff who are working over there on our behalf.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1390" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017021500002#C00200"><p>I congratulate the Chairman on the way he chaired the meetings in Brussels and ensured everybody from this committee had an opportunity to make their points.  Likewise, the secretariat did a fantastic job, ensuring we got 14 meetings in two days when we met quite a number of important people.</p> <p>  Until I went to Brussels I was unaware of the level of work the Minister of State had undertaken.  I compliment him on that.  His travels around the EU, his efforts to drive the Irish message home and his willingness to listen to other countries' issues are to be commended.  Unfortunately, however, that work has not been sufficiently appreciated.  I therefore wish to put on record my thanks to the Minister of State for the work he is doing.</p> <p>  I have concerns but they do not necessarily reflect on the Minister of State.  I have been saying for some time that I want Ireland to take a leadership role rather than a following one.  I could see leadership in Brussels but I cannot see it at home.  It is to be hoped that will be sorted out today.  I would like to see us lay down a number of priorities that we will want to raise during the negotiations on Brexit.  Five or six were mentioned in Brussels, but there is no point in laying down priorities unless we have solutions.  How far advanced are we in presenting not just the problems but the solutions to them?  We are all aware of the Border and trade issues, but the island of Ireland is our concern.  We have enjoyed the ability to travel throughout the 32 counties unimpeded and I do not want to see that change, Nor does the Minister of State.  There is no point in Ireland and the UK agreeing on that, however.  It is a question of how advanced we are on getting agreement from the other 26 EU member states.  That is my concern.</p> <p>  The Minister spoke about re-establishing the European project at citizen level, but there is a huge problem there.  That is because the European project has been demonised for as long as I can remember.  In the Oireachtas, we constantly blame the EU for imposing directives obliging us to do various things.  We go there to negotiate, but we must now stand up to the plate.  Water is a classic case in point.  It was sold as something the Europeans told us to do, not something we negotiated in Europe.  I will not ask the Minister of State to comment on that, but if he wishes to do so, I would be interested.</p> <p>  As we go through the Brexit process, I am concerned that we should be able to access funding for market diversification, that is, to move away from the British market where we have 41% of our agricultural output and 35% of our textile and leather industry.  I would like to see us moving that to other markets.  Is such market diversification funding available and is there such a willingness on the part of the EU?  I think it was Monsieur Barnier who suggested that they wanted to get away from derogations as they want a single policy in Europe.  However, a derogation on state aid for Monaghan Dairies was mentioned in Brussels.  That company is getting a huge proportion of its milk from across the Border.  If that stops, where does the company go?</p> <p>  Does the Minister of State know how far the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has advanced with respect to opening up new routes to Europe?  I am referring in particular to our ports and a European super-highway of heavy ferries travelling from Rosslare, Cork, Waterford, Foynes, Galway and Dublin.</p> <p>  I think I have asked enough questions of the Minister of State, as others wish to speak.  I thank him for the work he has done.  I wish him every success as he moves forward because he has a big job ahead of him.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1309" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017021500002#C00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the committee.  I still have this image in my head of the fluffy green jersey, so I wonder if the Minister of State is using the right softener.</p> <p>  This is an important issue and we are all trying to be on the same page.  We all accept there are substantial challenges facing the EU, both internally and externally.  The Minister of State has mentioned some of those challenges in this debate.</p> <p>  We all have major concerns about Brexit, so the work we carried out in Brussels was useful in that regard.  Some 15 committees were mentioned and a lot of work is going on.  We are all trying to do our best, be it privately or publicly.  Does the Minister of State have any recommendations for the committee in terms of its work, including outreach and inviting witnesses to appear before it?</p> <p>  We had quite a number of meetings in the couple of days we spent in Brussels, including talks with the European Ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly.  She spoke about the importance of transparency, which links in to the need for citizens' trust to be re-established.  Visiting various committees, one gets a sense that the issue needs to be tackled.  In this committee and others we have discussed how the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, and Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, negotiations were handled.  People had concerns about the secrecy surrounding such fundamental trade deals which impact on people's lives, not just in Europe but also around the globe.  It is important for the public to buy into such deals.</p> <p>  It is similar with the Brexit negotiations.  It is important for all of us wearing the green jersey to have an understanding of the Government's strategy.  We may disagree with, add to or subtract from that strategy but at some stage when we visit various capitals we must have a sense of where the Irish Government stands.</p> <p>  The Minister of State mentioned migration and we all accept that this is the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War.  Some 5,000 people drowned in the Mediterranean last year.  Side deals have been done with some countries, but there has already been criticism of Turkey and Libya.  Does the Minister of State see side deals as the way forward in tackling the refugee crisis?  Should we consider being more supportive of those countries on the front line of migration, particularly Greece and Italy?  Thousands of migrants are landing in those countries daily during the summer months.</p><p> I am conscious that I shall not get an opportunity anywhere else to discuss the fact that Ibahim Halawa is facing his 19th trial hearing having spent three years of his young life behind bars.  Yesterday his trial was postponed again.  We all know the circumstances behind his case and delegations have gone to Egypt.  In the first week of March the foreign Minister for Egypt will attend the EU Council meeting in Malta to discuss the ongoing situation in Egypt.  As no progress was made at the trial hearing yesterday will the Irish Government prioritise the case at the next EU Council meeting and make it clear that there can be no further normalisation of relations between Egypt and the EU while an Irish and European citizen remains in a Cairo prison?  Does the Minister of State share my view on same?</p><p> The Maltese Presidency of the EU has produced a short paper on the future of the Europe.  People have demanded that we build a progressive, prosperous and social Europe that respects sovereignty.  Has the Minister of State got a sense that this goal needs to be prioritised?  Have we learned anything from Brexit?  Even though Ireland campaigned for a remain vote it does not mean that everything is hunky-dory in the European Union.  Clearly huge problems exist that need to be addressed.</p><p> Lastly, does the Irish Government plan to publish a White Paper on Brexit?     </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1360" speakername="Se&aacute;n Haughey" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017021500002#D00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee secretariat for the work that they put into the recent visit to Brussels by the committee.  I also thank the Minister for engaging with us in Brussels and enlightening us on his work on the various issues of the day, most particularly Brexit.</p> <p>  We met important people in Brussels and people openly conveyed their views to us.  Probably one of the most important meetings, without intentionally singling anyone out, was with Michel Barnier and Guy Verhofstadt given their crucial role in Brexit negotiations.  While there was huge sympathy for and understanding of the Irish position, I took the clear message from the meetings that we had to come up with a solution, in particular a solution for the hard border question.  They threw the issues back at us by asking us to come forward with practical and workable solutions.  Is the Government working on practical solutions to this issue?  The Taoiseach informed the D&aacute;il this morning that he brought a memo to Government on the Brexit issue and there will be a big speech this afternoon in the Mansion House.  Have we moved forward with coming up with practical solutions to our particular problems to put on the negotiation table?</p> <p>  When we were in Brussels I picked up on the fact that the committees of the European Parliament, that deal with all of the sectoral issues, have to date prepared 20 reports on Brexit.  I am sure that is a very useful amount of knowledge that has been prepared by the European Parliament.  I hope that the Irish Government will tap into that information.  The committees dwell on the micro-economic issues as they manifest themselves and the reports are available and ongoing.  I am sure they will be a useful resource for Ireland in helping it to tackle this particular challenge.</p> <p>   Can the Minister of State update us on his visits to the European capitals?  The Taoiseach is visiting the Heads of Government and the Minister is visiting his equivalent throughout the member states.  The Minister of State undertook a number of visits throughout the European Union to inform the other 26 member states of our particular concerns and listen to their concerns.  Has the process been finalised?  Have we contacted everybody who needed to be contacted initially?  How is the programme going?</p> <p>  I was interested in what the Minister of State had to say about the challenges that face the European Union and the future of Europe, in particular the Bratislava process that was launched following the vote on the British referendum on 23 June.  I agree with what he said about the Irish position.  I agree that we need to concentrate on practical issues and bring forward a realistic agenda so that the citizens of Europe engage with it, fully promote it and support it.  In particular, he laid emphasis on increased investment and creating more job opportunities with which I agree.  He also mentioned the Single Market and the digital Single Market.  If we can bring forward practical solutions and Europe is seen to deliver then support for the European project will be maintained and increased.  </p> <p>  The Rome Summit will take place on 25 March, which is the 60th anniversary of the Treaties of Rome.  I presume it will be a great opportunity to return to basics and outline for all of us the values of the European Union, what it stands for and what it has prevented.  The European Union has prevented war and brought peace and stability in our time.  The summit should be used to reinforce that agenda.  I look forward to seeing that being rolled out in advance of and following the summit on 25 March.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1393" speakername="Terry Leyden" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017021500002#D00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, his officials and the representatives from the embassies here today.  I heard a great report on his visit to Brussels last week.  I had planned to go and even had my airline ticket booked but unfortunately circumstances prevented me from going.  The meetings were in very good hands and I have heard excellent reports about the meetings that took place.  At a meeting of this committee the Minister of State recommended that we travel as a group to Brussels.  His proposal was implemented by the committee and he was also able to attend as well.  As he will know, I was in Malta to represent the chair of this committee.</p> <p>  I am convinced that there should be a dedicated Brexit Minister.  I have no problem with the Minister of State taking up the role.  Like Britain, we should have a section of a Department to deal with Brexit.  The Prime Minister, Theresa May, is not the Brexit Minister and the President of the Commission does not deal with the negotiations.  I feel that the appointment of a Brexit Minister will happen in the not too distant future.  Fianna F&aacute;il has laid it on the line by appointing a spokesperson on Brexit.  We should have a one-stop-shop unit in Dublin that is dedicated to dealing with and processing everything to do with Brexit.  It would be useful for us to have a unit that an organisation like the IFA, other organisations, business people, investors or exporters could approach to discuss Brexit.  Too many people have their fingers in the pie.  It is unfair on the Taoiseach that he has to be so engaged with the minute details of Brexit.  Of course he and the Cabinet have the overall responsibility.  As I have suggested before, it would be easy to amalgamate the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is quite nonsensical in a small country like ours to have two different Departments, one dealing with raising funds while the other deals with expenditure.  The measure was introduced to satisfy the Labour Party that formed part of the last Government.  It is not a requirement for this Government but that debate is another day's work.  In terms of Brexit, it is important that anything that can be done should be done. </p> <p>  I have heard a report but I do not know whether it is accurate that the Government, or some part of the Government, is considering recreating the customs posts at the Border.  The issue was reported in some newspaper that I read in the past few days.</p><p>I am greatly concerned about that report.  That is something we should never concede at the beginning of negotiations.  We could never consider initiating it or conceding that point because we must have an open border.  I am unsure whether the people present are aware of the situation or whether the Revenue is looking at it.</p><p> Senator Craughwell made some good points.  As part of the preparation for Brexit we must increase and expand our exports to mainland Europe through France.  We have a direct route from Rosslare.  That is important.  We have roll-on, roll-off ferry facilities and the whole question of availability and speed arises.  That is in the transport area but all Departments should feed in to one major overall plan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017021500002#E00200"><p>I congratulate the Minister of State for his adroit chairmanship of the delegation and presentation to the various parties.  Likewise, I congratulate the secretariat here and all the contact people in Brussels as well as the Commissioner, Mr. Hogan, and the permanent staff there for the tremendous work they did in laying on the programme, co-ordinating it and putting it together.  I thank the Minister of State for his hospitality and for his contribution to the process as well.</p><p>Several points come to mind.  I will go through the initial part of the Minister of State's speech.  The question on migration is still live.  Sadly, it reflects on the European Union as a whole.  We all know that this is something that should have been possible to resolve in a better way, rather than the haphazard way in which it was resolved.  It is well and good for people to say we do not want immigrants or people coming ashore and so on.  The end product was that thousands of children lost their lives - they were drowned at sea - and many more starved on the way to what they thought was freedom, solace and comfort.  Whatever they were coming from, they were not running away from health, happiness and good fortune.  They were running for their lives.  Sadly, some countries in the Union saw that as a threat.  The Union, as a whole, needs to come together to recognise the need for co-ordination in such situations, rather than tempting everyone to put up the razor wire, as it were.  I know that countries in the front line are the first in line.  However, the Union has to be able to deal with the situation in a humane and amicable way.  If it does not, then it will continue to reflect badly.</p><p>The future of Europe was referenced and there is no doubt this is timely.  We hope that out of all the stress and trauma from migration, Brexit or whatever, a re-definition of the visions of Europe will re-emerge in a meaningful way that will relate to all the people of Europe.  These people live in Europe and are members of the European Union.  We are not outsiders.  We are all part of Europe and the European Union.  We need to see a recognition of that in future.</p><p>I do not agree with my colleague Senator Terry Leyden in respect of the handling of Brexit.  I believe the one-stop-shop is already in place.  Only one country has a Brexit Minister and that country is leaving the Union.  It would be dangerous to emulate that set-up and have the debate between the country leaving the Union with a specified Minister.  There is a serious danger that we could be categorised in the same way and become part and parcel of that exit strategy.  I would not advise such an approach.</p><p>We were greeted warmly by all the people we met.  We should recognise the great understanding of Ireland's unique position as an island off Europe.  Logistical issues arise and serious issues arise in so far as our future is concerned.  This is the most important time in the history of this State since we joined the European Union.  It is up to ourselves to make of it what we want.  We were encouraged to set out our stall and our list of requirements, as opposed to demands.  Mr. Barnier and Mr. Verhofstadt were vying with each other in respect of how they could be helpful.  That is a useful basis from which to operate.  There was recognition that we are not an adjunct of our next-door neighbour but an independent state.  More important, there was recognition that the European Union recognises the importance of the island of Ireland as an economic and political entity.  There was a recognition that it has worked well, that the peace agreement was sacrosanct and that it was part and parcel of our economy, North and South.  There was also recognition that we did not opt to leave the Union.  The island of Ireland did not opt to leave the Union, although others did.  It is not for us to facilitate others.  It is for us to do the best we can to facilitate the island of Ireland as an economic entity in the first instance.  That has to be borne in mind.  I believe it is borne in mind and all the indications we have received from the Minister of State and from everyone else we met was that it would be borne in mind.</p><p>It is also important to recognise that we are going to be part of the negotiations.  The country and the Taoiseach will be part of the negotiating team on behalf of the European Union.  The Minister of State will be part of the process as well.  Ireland will be part of the process as one of 27 member states.</p><p>As we stand, we have it all to play for.  Whatever emerges from the debate taking place in the coming six months or year &ndash; things will begin to gel into place at that stage &ndash; will have a fundamental and lasting effect on our country and people.  There must be recognition that the customs of the island of Ireland are important.  We are in a happy position now and we need to retain what we have become accustomed to.  We have progressed a long way in this country in the past 30 years, albeit through tough territory and in spite of many obstacles and deviations <i>en route</i>.  Everyone made a contribution to the Good Friday Agreement and the good relationship between North and South.  That is part and parcel of what must remain at the core of any discussions.  I believe that is recognised by everyone.  There is no intention of deviating from that.</p><p>We realise that we are not the only negotiators as well.  There are 26 others and we need to convince them.  I believe the Minister of State has done a good job in touring the capitals of Europe and meeting his counterparts to discuss this issue.  It is clear that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade have done likewise.  In any event, the battle is not over yet.  We need to be careful how we concentrate the argument.  We need to convince our European colleagues of the importance of the survival of the economic entity of Ireland.  Failure to do that would be a failure on the part of the European Union to recognise the integral part we now play in the Union.</p><p>Numerous things will happen quickly once Article 50 is triggered.  Currency fluctuation will take place rapidly, depending on what is said at a given time and place.  That will have a varying effect on our economy on a weekly, if not a daily, basis.  We need to do our job well and achieve what we need to achieve, as opposed to what we want to achieve.  The fundamentals are in place.  That is what we have now.  We cannot afford to lose any part of it, especially because we did not initiate this process.  We will be part and parcel of what happens as a result of the process.  Anyway, we know where we have to go and I know from our discussions with the Minister of State in the course of the meetings and ordinary business that we all recognise that much.</p></speech>

I thank the committee members for their questions and kind words.</p> <p>  I will take the comments in the order that committee members have spoken.  There is some overlap although not a great deal.  Senator Craughwell asked questions about the process and our priorities.</p><p>The process of the divorce, so to speak, has four key pillars.  We must be satisfied at this stage that issues pertaining to Ireland, such as the common travel area and the peace process, are in pillar one and will be dealt with at an early stage.  We will continue to work with the Commission to present solutions for concerns which are unique to Ireland.  It is true to say there is an appetite for us to present solutions and work is ongoing in so far as it can be, because we still have not seen the absolute nature of what the UK will present within the coming four weeks.  Work is being carried out at a very detailed level in many Departments with respect to the movement of people.  The position of everybody, including the Taoiseach, committee members and, to be fair, the British, is we do not want any impediment to the free movement of people around the island.  This is not something we consider possible to dilute in any way.  It is of extreme importance to us with regard to both sides of the Border and east and west.  There is, as committee members have heard, good understanding throughout the EU of the circumstances unique to us.</p><p> The problem we have at citizen level has been mentioned.  It is 100% correct to state we must communicate better what we do as politicians.  We must show the work we do around the table, irrespective of where we are on the political spectrum, is about the citizen.  Something I found most frustrating about the debate and referendum in the UK was continuous reference to the European Union and its institutions in the third person.  Every decision taken by the European Union had British Ministers and officials at the table, but somehow everything was everybody else's fault.  We must ensure all politicians take more account themselves.  I am a strong supporter of the European Union but it would be very silly and simplistic to suggest it is perfect.  Many people feel it can be improved, but we must try to improve it from the inside out, particularly as a small country.</p><p> We will work to support categories and sectors which may be specifically disadvantaged.  The issue of ports and new routes was mentioned.  To follow on from other questions, it is vital we build new alliances and look to diversify into new markets, irrespective of how severe the challenges will be with respect to trade, and this work is ongoing.</p><p> To respond to Deputy Crowe on what the committee can do, it should be robust when senior people are in the country.  The committee should get them to come before it, whether they are Commissioners, politicians or members of committees of other parliaments, and the committee should not just continue to go to Europe at intervals.  Something we should focus on is going before parliamentary committees.  It is of value to meet opposite numbers, Ministers and members of Government.  We did this in Bucharest and Greece several weeks ago and will do so in Hungary and Austria next week.  Through this we get a sense of where cross-party support exists on the issues we bring and our unique circumstances.  We can also pick up on the objectives of other countries. Committee members could speak to Commissioners and explain that as Independent members or as members of Sinn F&eacute;in or Fianna F&aacute;il, they agree with what the Government is doing.  Equally, there would be nothing wrong with committee members stating that in particular areas the Government could do better or that they disagree with policy.  We should embrace this.  The committee will have a very important role given the Ministers with responsibility for Europe will meet on a monthly basis to engage in the negotiations.  The committee will probably be the conduit of the information that will flow between the Ministers.</p><p> The issue of Turkey and migration is absolutely vital.  There are many concerns about the deal done with Turkey.  The &euro;3 billion is going directly to support the refugees.  We must continue to work with countries of origin and countries of transit and try to continue to remove the reasons people leave.</p><p> I could not agree more with regard to what must be the horrendous frustration of Ibrahim Halawa and his family.  We have engaged the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, and the Ceann Comhairle's office and cross-party groups have travelled out.  We have robustly stated we want him to be released and we will continue our work on this.  However, Egypt is a sovereign independent nation with a court process that is what it is.</p><p> I have met Michel Barnier on a number of occasions, the Taoiseach will meet him next week and the committee has also met him.  We will repeatedly engage with Mr. Barnier, who is well abreast through work he did previously as a Commissioner, on issues pertaining to regional policy and the Border region in Northern Ireland.  Very strong importance will be given to the deliberations on the unique elements that exist between parts of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, with respect to the common travel area.  Where we can present solutions to our partners, show they will not impact on them and get their support we should achieve success.</p><p> We are on rounds three and four with many countries with respect to visits, contacts and meetings.  The messages pertaining to our country cannot be said too often, particularly given that negotiations on common travel will take place in the first section.  We share concerns about the trade issues with many countries.  Many countries to the east of the United Kingdom have very similar concerns about exporting food into the large British market and we are working to build alliances.  We can get details on a programme of work involving me, the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, the Taoiseach and other Ministers, particularly those whose remits are most relevant.</p><p> Deputy Haughey spoke about the Rome Summit and getting back to concrete deliverable measures.  He also mentioned the digital Single Market.  Roaming charges have been removed and we have data portability, VAT simplification and copyright improvements.  They benefit all the European Union, but they really benefit small, peripheral and open economies such as ours.</p><p>That is why, at the formation of this Government, I was asked to play a co-ordinating role in the digital Single Market.  While everyone will benefit, the more remote, smaller and more open an economy is, the more such measures will help.</p><p> I like the broad range of topics covered at this committee, and Europe is a very broad church.  We almost always agree with Senator Leyden, but I do not think a Brexit Minister would work and Deputy Durkan gave a couple of reasons.  First, we have a one-stop-shop in the Department of the Taoiseach which has authority when corresponding with Departments such as Finance or Justice and Equality.  There is extra prestige and urgency when a request comes from the mother Department, as it were.  If we had that somewhere else, it might dilute the whole-of-Government approach.  Senior officials in the Department of the Taoiseach have been involved in our Presidencies and they co-ordinate whole-of-Government approaches to European Council meetings.</p><p> The second reason is more practical.  Agriculture and fisheries Ministers frequently meet in Brussels to discuss detailed aspects of fisheries policy, quotas, physical maps, jurisdiction and law.  Transport Ministers might be meeting on the same day to discuss ports or something else, but the meeting might take place in Luxembourg.  At the moment we are talking about everything together, such as the movement of goods and people, the common travel areas and institutions and other bodies, but negotiations on Brexit will be broken into chunks, such as agricultural issues, trade issues etc.  We will need this to be at the very top of the agenda of relevant Ministers.  We do not believe that abdicating responsibility from line Ministers to anybody else would be in our best interests.  I am not fully sure where the UK Brexit Minister will sit.  Boris Johnson is Foreign Secretary but its finance Minister and others will also be present.  We are not sure if the Brexit Minister will have a co-ordinating role back in the UK or whether it will be Theresa May.  It will be a full-time function of mine and my team but that will also apply to many others.</p><p> There was a question on Border posts.  We need to be clear that this was a decision of the United Kingdom.  The UK has decided to leave but we are not leaving.  We will not be the ones putting any customs posts up on this island.  We do not want them and will not initiate them.  We will be working hard to minimise the effect on our people and we will not do this work or come up with any solutions that work against our national interests.  We respect the UK's decision but we fundamentally think it was the wrong thing to do.  The UK has said it does not want to be in the Single Market but we want to be in the Single Market.  The UK has not yet told us how they propose to square the circle with respect to the customs union.</p></speech>

The UK is out of the Single Market and has a new customs arrangement.  These will present difficulties but they are not ours.  The UK will have to look very seriously at the implications.</p> <p>  Deputy Durkan said there were concerns relevant to the island of Ireland, and that is true, but we need to continue to work on the specific difficulties as the discussions evolve.  The issues show the importance of the all-Ireland civic dialogue, and we should continue with sectoral groups looking at specific concerns as they arise, sector by sector.  There will be a differentiation between the part that deals with the free movement of people and those parts dealing with the free movement of goods, services and trade, which may take a long time to establish.  This goes back to Senator Leyden's question about the customs relationship.  We do not know what that will be, but preparations are very much ongoing to consider the potential outcomes, though this should not be mistaken in any way for an acceptance that there should be restrictions.</p> <p>  If members wish to send further questions by e-mail, we will be happy to give more detail.  I apologise to Heidi Lougheed and the committee secretariat for not acknowledging the great work they did in preparing for this.</p></speech>

Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, distinguished Members of the Irish Houses of Parliament.  It is a privilege for us to be here today and to make ourselves and our knowledge and understanding available to the distinguished members of this parliamentary committee.  This is a matter of importance in Ireland.  We understand this very well.  It is also very important for the European Commission and it is also important across the European Union because water is a basic element of life and is vital for the balanced and sustainable development of our societies.</p> <p>  We are also deeply respectful of the current political process in Ireland, involving the Parliament, the Government, and large swathes of Irish society because we believe that any legal rule and obligation must be understood properly and perceived as profitable for the society in which it applies.  There is no simple obligation by constraint.  The rules must be understood, as well as their sense and the overarching objectives they serve.  There is no blind compliance and no theoretical or abstract compliance in itself.  There are objectives of societal importance and they must be understood and accepted by large majorities of our societies.</p> <p>  This is the situation in this case where several obligations and rules of the EU Water Framework Directive are at stake.  The circumstances predominating in Ireland are very important.  The EU Water Framework Directive is not intended to be applied in an abstract world.  It must be applied in the concrete circumstances of each EU member state and in this case in Ireland, with the geographical and environmental peculiarities, with the social, economic and political peculiarities and characteristics of Ireland.  We believe that the Water Framework Directive is a sufficiently flexible instrument, allowing member states to comply with its obligations while paying utmost attention to the particulars of their economies, societies and societal interests.  This is why it is called a framework and it is a directive. </p> <p>  We have been mindful of the fact that this distinguished committee has paid attention in past hearings to the challenges faced by the Irish water system, an infrastructure which is in serious need of upgrade and where the level of leakage is high.  There is clear evidence that previous water pricing policies have been ineffective in providing both the revenues to ensure the necessary levels of investment and the incentives to citizens to use water efficiently.  Ireland's non-compliance with the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive, as illustrated also by the measure taken today by the political college of the European Commission in Brussels, and with the Drinking Water Directive, are cases in point.  We have been mindful of the conclusions of the expert committee that was engaged to make some recommendations and to explore the matters for the attention of the parliamentary committee.  We have also noticed that the expert committee noted that Ireland is a long way from achieving a good status in its waters under the Water Framework Directive and that no overall improvement in water quality was recorded between 2009 and 2015.  The services of the European Commission endorse the findings of the committee which we believe are objective.</p> <p>  Against this backdrop the fundamental questions which deserve an earnest public debate and appropriate solutions are, one, how to secure equal access to good quality and healthy drinking water and good quality water services for all citizens whether vulnerable children or elderly people, rich or poor, working or unemployed.</p><p>Ensuring healthy drinking water means protecting the health of Irish citizens.  This is of paramount importance and does not apply only to the health of an abstract Irish citizen.  It applies to every individual who lives on the territory of the Republic of Ireland and benefits from water services.  The second important question is how to avoid wasteful expenses for the public purse, generated by significant leaks and malfunctions, and to address the inability to provide drinking water of sufficient quality.  I am sure Irish lawmakers and citizens have a very clear understanding of how careful spending of the public budget can lead to the utmost benefit being reaped.</p><p> A third crucial question is how to secure the smart investments required for upgrading the water sector as a public service.  The water framework directive is a flexible instrument allowing the public authorities of each EU country to ask these questions in a way that best fits the local circumstances.  Water pricing policy must comply with the cornerstone principles of cost recovery and polluter pays, but there is wide scope for adaptation to specific societal and economic circumstances.  The paramount argument in this respect is taken straight from the directive, and is that national authorities are allowed to take into account, when establishing differentiated water tariffs, the variation in economic and social conditions in their respective jurisdictions.  Therefore, there is room for social tariffs for vulnerable citizens.</p><p> The recovery of costs must ensure the water sector meets its serious needs in terms of both maintenance and investment in water and wastewater infrastructure.  In order to comply with the polluter pays principle and for the charges for excessive or wasteful use to attain their purpose, the consumption of water for normal use should be set at a reasonable level and the charges for excessive or wasteful use should be dissuasive.  This entails the ability to objectively and consistently measure the amount of water used.</p><p> The European Commission and its services remain at the disposal of Irish authorities during this hearing, after this hearing and throughout the deliberative process for any further exchanges that are necessary.</p></speech>

We are working through the recommendations of the expert commission report.  If we accept the commission's recommendation that, in the future, we should pay for normal water usage through general taxation, we would like as generous a daily allowance as possible up to the point where excessive usage kicks in.  What is the Commission's view of the expert commission's proposal?  Does it comply with Article 9 and does it fit in with the polluter pays principle?  If so, at what point would a personal allowance meet excessive usage?  We would want to give the general allowance but also stay within the confines of the water framework directive.</p> <p>  If Ireland reverts to the previous system whereby water infrastructure is funded through general taxation, what does the Commission do next?  Would we automatically face infringement proceedings?  What would the process be?  In such a scenario, can Mr. Ciobanu-Dordea give a range of possible fines the European Court of Justice could impose?  Can he outline the likely fines related to the case he referenced, in which the Commission is taking Ireland to the European Court of Justice in respect of urban wastewater?  Finally, has Ireland used or forfeited its derogation under the water framework directive in the past?</p></speech>

We are indeed here on behalf of our Commissioner, Karmenu Vella, who is in charge of environmental, fisheries and maritime affairs.  We officially represent the European Commission and are not here in a private capacity.  The Commission appreciates the findings of, and the process and analysis performed by, the expert committee.  One might wish to be more nuanced about various recommendations but it is not our purpose, at this stage of the deliberation in Ireland, to act as a review body for the recommendations of the expert committee.  We need to leave room for the experts to exchange views and for politicians to discuss the issues with the public and to deliberate.  It is not the role of the European Commission to act as a professor who reviews the debate at every stage.  We are a public authority, entrusted with specific competences, but we also have to pay attention to the principle of subsidiarity and there is room for the application of subsidiarity when applying the EU water framework directive.</p> <p>  When making a deliberation about the new system the Irish authorities should have a careful look at the broad picture.  What is Ireland's situation in terms of the provisions and quality of water services and access to services for all citizens?  Which are the positive and less positive sides of the water system in Ireland?  We have drawn the attention of the Irish authorities to a few serious shortcomings, such as the 45% leak rate.  This is significant and was also mentioned by representatives of Irish Water.</p><p>In addition, in a large number of agglomerations the secondary and tertiary treatment of urban wastewater is not appropriate to a significant extent.  Also, the need for investment in modernising the system, bringing it up to speed and making it able to expand and to provide ever finer services for a society in development are fairly significant, amounting to &euro;13 billion.  The solution that must be developed must allow for the consistent appropriate funding over a longer period of time of a system in dire need of upgrading and modernisation.</p><p> The formula that is developed is, first and foremost, in the hands of the Irish authorities but I would also draw the committee's attention to the following because it has asked about the charge for excessive usage.  We believe that one cannot discuss only such a charge and one needs to discuss also the charge for normal use.  One needs to define the objective parameters based on objective criteria on the basis of which one can establish what means normal use.  We would draw the committee's attention also to the fact that when one speaks about normal and excessive, one needs to have a reference, that is, what would be the reference, tool or instrument that would allow any careful public authority to identify who is consuming excessively and who is consuming normally on the ground.  We believe that this brings into the discussion the problem of metering.  We note that good progress was made in past years by the Irish authorities, in particular, by Irish Water, in advancing the problem of metering.</p><p> We are also aware of the public sensitivities and the concerns, and even protests, that have been expressed in Irish society against this and this is why we appreciate so much the reflection time and discussion that is being organised by the Irish authorities.  We believe that the discussion, if possible, can be run also based on objective arguments.  No public discussion is only based on objective arguments and only on facts and figures.  Emotions are also at stake and reactions and subjective aspects are hugely at stake as well, but there must be a grain of truth and some objective elements at the basis of it.  There must be an awareness that when discussing charges, as a short-cut we say, "water charges", in fact, it is not about charges for the water itself but for the water services which every citizen must enjoy to the protection of his or her health.</p><p> Of course, there is plenty of water in Ireland.  It rains a lot and the ground of Ireland is also rich in water resources, but few drink water straight from the collection of rainwater.  Nobody uses a straw to drink water from the ground.  One needs abstraction.  One needs processing, filtration and elimination of carcinogenic elements.  We are aware that ever more chemical substances are identified as having carcinogenic potential or are simply damaging to human health and the providers of water services must be able to identify, select and eliminate from the water provided such substances.  The adequate processing of urban wastewater treatment is ever more important for the economy and for the society as well.  Drinking water, as I have mentioned, and also other elements, such as compliance with the Nitrates Directives and the relationship with agricultural activities, may come into play.  I say "the relationship with agricultural activities" because there must be no opposition between the concerns for water quality and agricultural activities.  Solutions are possible in order to reconcile both interests.</p><p> The distinguished Deputy asked me also about the infringement procedures.  Certainly nobody would authorise a civil servant to say whether Ireland or whatever member state would be in infringement if it proceeds in one way or another simply because this is a prerogative of the political college of the Commission and I cannot anticipate the judgment.  Of course, there is a political judgment, but it will be based on objective elements.  I can tell the committee, because this is no matter of secrecy and no matter of discretion, there are objective elements to say that currently Ireland is not complying with the Water Framework Directive since it suspended the application of the water charges.  We believe also that as the situation evolves on different fronts of the water infrastructure, the situation becomes tighter and tighter.  There are such objective elements to making such a decision.</p><p> I am bound by the committee to be honest and draw its attention to certain matters.  In the public perception, matters get mixed up.  People say that if one sends a member state to the Court of Justice then this is for fines.  The first judgment of the Court of Justice that will declare a member state in violation of a certain rule of EU law is not a judgment that applies fines.  The member state will have 18 months from that judgment in order to present a programme of compliance and to comply with that judgment in principle, and only a second referral by the European Commission of that member state to the Court of Justice in Luxembourg will lead to fines.  Therefore, there is time before fines are applied and we believe it is in the vital interest not only of Ireland and of Irish society but of any member state, not to waste time and to litigate with the Damocles sword of the fines at the end of the road but rather to think about and act on complying.</p><p> Of course, sometimes solutions are easier at hand.  Other times a situation is more complex and more delicate, and more investments are required or certain deliberations are more difficult.  The Commission, not because it is warm-hearted but because it is its obligation to do so, understands these realities and understands the differences between the member states.  There is a single line or thread for all member states, but there are also national specificities.  We are ready to engage with the Irish authorities on any compliance path and commitment leading to lasting solutions to the water infrastructure that serve the Irish citizen.  I will stop there.</p></speech>

To lead on from the previous question, does Mr. Ciobanu-Dordea accept that we had a derogation from domestic water charges under Article 9 of the EU framework directive in 2000?  That is the first question.  Second, what is his and the Commission's definition of "established practice" as it relates to the delivery of water services and as mentioned in the Water Framework Directive?  I will move on to the river basin management plan of 2010, which Mr. Ciobanu-Dordea mentioned and which he believes constitutes the loss of the initial interpretation - if he confirms it existed - of the directive dating back to 2000.  If that is the case, is Mr. Ciobanu-Dordea implying that there is a shift in his interpretation of established practice?  What is his view on the legality of the suspension period that we are in currently?  We still feel we can meet the objectives of the Water Framework Directive with the suspension in place.  Has the Commission been in contact with the CER or the EPA about its contention, belief and opinion that we are in contravention of the EU framework directive?</p></speech>

The term "established practice" is only used in paragraph (4) of Article 9 of the Water Framework Directive and it has certain conditions attached to it.  It has a derogation from the obligations to establish a water pricing policy as in Article 9(1).  Among these conditions is the requirement that the member states report the reasons for not fully applying paragraph (1) in the river basin management plans.  We consider that Article 9(4) is applied at the moment when the river basin management plan is adopted.  That is when any recourse to this exemption should have been done, if appropriate.</p></speech>

The Commission decided to change its interpretation of it on submission of the river basin management plan, which is its right to do so if it so wishes.  We do not agree.  If there is to be an adjudication on it, it is beyond our control.  That is all I will say on it.</p> <p>  What is the Commission's interpretation of the legality of the suspension period considering that, in our opinion, it too relates back to the initial derogation and the objectives in it and our establishment of an established practice based on it being paid for out of taxation in 2000?  The Commission would question the legality of this period if it were to follow on from what Mr. Ciobanu-Dordea just said.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.92" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conleth Bradley" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FFJ2017021500002#F00700"><p>I appreciate Mr. Ciobanu-Dordea's answer, which was interesting and useful.  The objective of the Water Framework Directive, as he outlined, is about quality, not quantity.  The terms of Article 9.4 are interesting.  The reporting of the non-compliance or the derogation is in the report on the river basin management plan, but the reference to an established practice is an important point.  I am sure that Mr. Ciobanu-Dordea is not that familiar with established practice under Irish law.  There are key dates for ascertaining the established practice.  The beginning was 1962, when the Public Health (Ireland) Act 1896 was amended.  Other keystone dates are 1983, 1997, 2013 and 2016.  To ascertain established practice, one must examine the range of the established practice.  When the directive came into force, the established practice was not to charge.  As Members will know well, the history of established practice in Ireland is tied into local government and the responsibility of elected members versus the executive.  In my respectful view, it is clear that the established practice applies in the way that I have described, that being, the established practice on the key date was not to charge.</p> <p>  Mr. Ciobanu-Dordea referred to the river basin management plans.  That relates to the reportage aspect of Article 9.4.  The key phrase is "established practice".</p> <p>  I wish to mention another matter relating to Article 9.  Mr. Ciobanu-Dordea will be aware of a recent decision of the European Court of Justice, ECJ, involving a hydroelectric plan.  The Commission took Germany to the ECJ in an infringement action and lost.  Important principles arose from that case.  I accept that it was about a hydroelectric plan, but it was the first challenge under the Water Framework Directive.  That decision has been recently upheld in a case taken by the Commission against Austria, where the ECJ again confirmed what Mr. Ciobanu-Dordea has correctly set out, namely, the margin of appreciation or discretion that is given to a member state.</p> <p>  This is about quality, not quantity, and the margin of appreciation given to a member state.  It is important that the Commission be aware of this, which I am sure it is.  That margin of appreciation was emphasised in the ECJ decision.</p></speech>

This conversation is important to us, so I am fine with letting it flow because it is core to our deliberation, but if possible, can the witnesses keep comments as tight as possible?

We have never publicised that.  When this committee sought its content, we made that available to it.  We are here today to enforce that in as best a way as we can because it is our belief that the D&aacute;il may accept a recommendation from this committee to revert to a non-charging regime and allow water charges and services to be paid for by the customer, namely, the State.  We have every right to make this committee aware of the sound legal advice that backs up the contention that we have held for some time.  I did not abuse that advice by making it public.

There have been newspaper articles arguing that if we abolish domestic water charges, we will face immediate and very substantial fines from the European Court of Justice and the European Commission.  Therefore, we understand all of this is important for ourselves and the public.  I have three sets of questions for the Commission and Mr. Bradley and Mr. Kelly because I am interested in their respective views.</p> <p>  What is really crucial is that Article 9.4, as outlined, sets out two criteria.  The first is the idea of established practice, while the second is the achievement of the objectives of the directive as outlined in Article 1.  I am a little confused as to the Commission's position because between 2010 and 2014, in both public and on the record comments, it seemed to have changed its position.  I will outline what I mean by that and then seek a response.  </p> <p>  In 2010 when he was a Labour Party Member of the European Parliament Deputy Alan Kelly asked a parliamentary question of the then Commissioner and was told very clearly "where this is an established practice at the time of the adoption of the directive".  The interpretation of the part of the answer by many people is that established practice, as per the water framework directive, means whatever the established practice of the member state was at the time the directive was passed in 2000.  There is nothing in that answer that relates to whether a member state chose to invoke the derogation in its 2009 river basin management plan.  That is reinforced by a subsequent communication to Ms Lynn Boylan, MEP, from the Directorate-General for the Environment in 2014.  She asked whether it was possible to reinvoke Article 9.4, despite the fact that it had not been used in 2009.  The answer was as follows: "On the basis of-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.133" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FFJ2017021500002#G00400"><p>Yes, absolutely.  It read: "On the basis of the information reported to the Commission, Ireland has not made use of Article 9(4)" in its first river basin management plan, as we know.  It went on to state that should Ireland wish to rely on the provisions of Article 9.4 in its second river basin management plan, a justification would need to be provided in that plan, including drafts, in order that the public could effectively comment thereon.  Like all member states, if Ireland invokes Article 9.4, the Commission "shall carefully consider whether the conditions of this flexibility provision are met at that stage".  Let us fast-forward to 2016, bearing in mind that this had been the position of the Commission in all correspondence with MEPs who had asked the question between 2014 and 2016.  In 2016 the Commission started to insert a new argument.  In a reply to Ms Marian Harkin, MEP, it stated, as the representatives present have outlined, that if Ireland did not invoke Article 9.4 in its first river basin management plan, it could not do so in the second.  These were three Commission responses, in the first two of which it was very clear that established practice was whatever it was when the water framework directive was enacted and that member states could apply to invoke the provisions of Article 9.4, although there was no guarantee that its request would be granted because it would have to be assessed in the context of the second river basin management plan.  Why did the Commission change its position in 2016 from that adopted between 2010 to 2014, as outlined in the documents referenced?  </p> <p>  I will pose my other two questions now to save time.  The second issue concerns the new position of the Commission.  It does not involve invoking established practice but talks about a "clear commitment" to introduce water charges in the river basin management plan of 2009.  I am interested in knowing, from a legal point of view, whether established practice is the same as a "clear commitment" to introduce water charges.  Clearly, if this matter ends up in the European Court of Justice, that will be a relevant question and the answer to it will be one this committee will need to assess.  </p> <p>  My third question relates to the other part of Article 9.4 which refers to the objectives of Article 1 of the directive.  The directive is really about these core objectives.  That is part of the point Mr. Bradley was making.  If a member state, in its river basin management plan and its accompanying investment plan for water infrastructure, is demonstrating that it is meeting the objectives set out in Article 1 of the directive, how could it be in breach of the directive and how could enforcement proceedings be taken against it?  That is why the German case is so important.  If I understood the ruling of the European Court of Justice correctly, it stated that, notwithstanding the fact that there was not full-cost recovery or adherence to the polluter pays principle in that particular water use case, because there was no evidence that the non-charging for water use was having any negative impact in achieving the objectives of  Article 1, there was no case to be heard.  As Mr. Bradley said, that decision has been upheld in subsequent judgments.  I would like to hear the views of the delegates in that regard.</p> <p>  There are two jurisdictions that do not have in place the type of domestic funding regime the Commission clearly prefers, one of which is Scotland.  Representatives from that country outlined their rationale to the committee.  As we know, the other jurisdiction is Northern Ireland.  Are there infringement proceedings pending against either of these jurisdictions for not having the cost-recovery and polluter pays model that the delegates have outlined?  Does the Commission have any intention of bringing proceedings against them?  If not, how can it state they can do it but Ireland cannot?</p></speech>

In response to the contributions of Mr. Bradley and Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin - I also said this at the beginning of my contribution - we should go beyond the legal discussion.  This is not just a legalistic issue between attorneys and lawyers; it is about much more than that.  I am not trying to relativise the objectivity of law and the rules, but it is more than just a discussion about what is meant by established practice.  I hope my remarks will not be deemed inappropriate, but we must think about the international custom, a concept lawyers understand well.  Let us say we have a rule that has been applied for a long number of years and we have behaviour that has been repeated for a long number of years until it becomes a rule and it is considered to be a consequence of application.  If an actor or player intervenes and changes the rules, this changes the established practice.  One has it until one changes the practice.  One can then no longer claim the international customary law and-----</p></speech>

If the Commission had been applying the principles it has been applying since 2016, the reply in 2014 would have stated Ireland could not invoke Article 9.4 because it had not included it in the 2009 river basin management plan and that, therefore, it no longer had that entitlement.  However, what the Commission stated at that stage was that if Ireland was going to invoke the article, it would have to outline the reasons for so doing and that the matter would be considered in the context of the second river basin management plan.</p></speech>

It is important for members to hear the details of the case because it is ECJ case law.</p></speech>

It begins, &quot;Water is not a commercial product like any other&quot;, and goes on to refer to &quot;diverse conditions&quot;.  It continues:</p><blockquote>This Directive aims at maintaining and improving the aquatic environment in the Community.  This purpose is primarily concerned with the quality of the waters concerned ... The ultimate aim of this Directive is to achieve the elimination of priority hazardous substances and contribute to achieving concentrations in the marine environment near background values for naturally occurring substances.</blockquote> <p>The directive recognises that member states can and should look at diverse national considerations.  When the derogation in Article 9.4 of the directive was introduced, it was known colloquially as the &quot;Irish derogation&quot;.  It was introduced specifically to meet conditions in Ireland where water had not historically been charged for in this way.  When the Commission first proposed the derogation, it also proposed full cost recovery, but that was dropped during the conciliation process.  That was recognised in the German case as significant.  It is.  It is not about cost recovery.  The purpose of the directive is to improve the quality of water and deliver high quality water services.  It is not about cost recovery.  It is up to Ireland or any other country to demonstrate that it has an established practice to which large numbers of people are continuing to adhere.  That should be relatively easy in the case of Ireland because it has had this established practice.  In my view as a lawyer, a country does not cease to have an established practice.  Despite some of the comments made, I am not a member of any political party here or anywhere else.  I gave independent legal advice.  The established practice in a country will remain in place until it can successfully put something else in place.  Under the Irish system, it is subsidised from general taxation.  That is how it is seen from the point of view of the public.  People are not reaching into their pockets to pay for water.  If that is to be changed, something else has to be put in place, but nothing else has successfully been put in place.  That is why it is quite clear that the use of the derogation continues to be available to Ireland.<br/><br/>As I set out in the note I was asked to prepare for the committee, an unsuccessful attempt to change an established practice means the practice in question has not been changed.  By definition and as a matter of logic, it continues.  While it is true that the Commission may do A, B, C and D, we live in a system of democracy governed by the rule of law.  The Commission does not have its way.  If, for example, the Commission says &quot;no&quot; and means &quot;no&quot;, we have a legal system to test this under which certain procedures must be gone through.  I know from my experience of litigating before the court that it does not always agree - far from it - with the Commission.  The Commission regularly loses cases before the court.  The mere fact that the Commission is taking a particular view should not influence this committee to believe this view will prevail - far from it - because it is a long process.  The Commission has to come back, set out its position fully, notify Ireland of it, hear what Ireland has to say, take account of it and be satisfied that it impedes or compromises the purpose of the directive.  The Commission will have an uphill task on the latter consideration alone.  It is going to be rather difficult.  It would then have to satisfy the court that Ireland was in breach of the directive.  As I said, this needs to be considered in the context of basic principles and established practice.  As a lawyer, I would find it very difficult to understand how it could be said the established practice was not still in operation, given what had happened.  It is still in operation in Ireland.</p></speech>

I accept Mr. Ciobanu-Dordea's emphasis on the margin of appreciation given, but it has to be the margin of appreciation given to the member state.  It cannot be the Commission's, as it cannot have it every way.  There is either a margin of appreciation or there is not.  I said the German case involved hydroelectric issues.  The points of principle established by the European Court of Justice in that case are important.  If anybody wants to read them, they are set out in paragraphs 47 and 51 of the judgment.  These important points of principle apply to the discussion we are having.  I will summarise them.  Article 9 does not state there is an absolute requirement to bring in charges.  Article 9 which is about river basin management has to be read in the context of Articles 4, 5 and 11.  The committee can look at this later because I do not propose to go into the details of it now.  When the European Court of Justice considers these matters, it looks at them from an holistic perspective.  Mr. Ciobanu-Dordea is absolutely correct when he says this is about quality rather than quantity.  When we consider Article 9.4 of the directive which refers to "established practices", we must look at how Ireland dealt with water services from 1962 to 2016.  I will not go back to the Public Health (Ireland) Act 1878.  Everybody is looking at key dates.  When the directive was in force, charging was done by way of general taxation as an established practice.  Everyone who has worked in a local authority will know what went on between the elected members and the executive in the case of service charges.</p></speech>

There needs to be a fair reading of Article 9.4 in order that readers will not lure themselves into wrongful interpretations.  I draw the attention of the distinguished members of the committee and those who are observing the meeting to the fact that Article 9.4 makes it clear that the concept of established practice can come into play "where this does not compromise the purposes and the achievement of the objectives of this Directive".  I also draw their attention to two additional simple and clear elements of the directive.  The obligation to introduce water charges was to be met by 2010.  More importantly, the objectives of the directive were to be attained by 2015.  I want to see future river basin management plans that will show how these objectives which have not been attained were attained two years ago.  I want to see those plans.  I rest my case.</p></speech>

It is nothing personal when I say I do not believe the European Commission is respecting the political process here.  It is doing the very opposite.  I refer to the letters sent to the expert commission and the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney.  I suggest Mr. Ciobanu-Dordea's presentation was designed to state we did not have political choices.  The message is that the political choice not to have water charge made by the people through boycott and protest and in last year's general election is not legitimate and cannot be upheld without fines.</p><p>I fundamentally disagree with that.</p><p> I will go through questions one by one to try to make it more concise and in order that we do not lose them.  First, I return to the question of inconsistency.  I think two different questions were mixed up a bit in the witness's response.  Let us forget about what the Irish Government is doing in saying whether it has water charges or not.  That does not matter.  Let us forget about what we define as established practice, etc.  The difference between the answers in 2010 and 2016 is very substantial.  It does not relate to anything that the Irish Government is doing.  It relates to a different interpretation of the European Commission on article 9(4) of the water framework directive.  I seek clarity on why this changed and an admission that it did change.</p><p> The answer to Deputy Alan Kelly in 2010 was as follows: "Article 9(4) provides the possibility for Member States not to apply the provisions of Article 9(1) to a given water-use activity, where this is an established practice at the time of adoption of the directive".  That answer defines that article 9(4) kicks in "where this is an established practice at the time of adoption of the directive".  In other words, that was in 2003.  The answer given in 2016 to Marian Harkin, MEP, effectively said that the current practice is to have water charges.  We can get into a debate separately about that.  In 2010, it clearly said "at the time of adoption of the directive".  In 2016, it effectively said at the current time.  Why has that changed?</p></speech>

If I would like to be polemical with the Deputy, I would say that the Deputy thinks that every opinion that is provided upon request of the Irish authorities is an interference with the political process.  However, I do not want to be polemical and I cannot afford to be polemical with the Deputy.  Nevertheless, I still draw his attention to the fact that the Commission responded to the invitation of the Irish authorities to state our opinion, to be here as witnesses and to be interrogated.  The second answer is that we did not change any interpretation of the established practice element or of article 9(4).  The situation has evolved in time and the essential element is the fact that that concretely on the ground the practice has changed.</p></speech>

That is fine.  At least we have an acknowledgement that the answer has changed.</p> <p>  The second point relates to established practice.  Why does the Deputy think the word "established" exists in article 9(4)?  What the witness explained as established is just a matter of practice or of something changing.  If something changes over time, there is a different practice.  However, it did not just say "practice".  It said "established practice".  For example, I have never paid water charges in this country.  There are many people in this country who have never paid water charges.</p></speech>

Is it in favour of water privatisation?  Is it the case that the troika agreement with Greece included an agreement for the privatisation of two Greek public water companies in Athens and Thessaloniki?  Is it the case that the troika agreement with Portugal included the privatisation of water services?</p></speech>

They are very important ones.  The Commission is a political body but nobody is above the rule of law.  Also, in its political decisions, the Commission does not and cannot go beyond the law.  I am not aware of the details of the IMF agreement with Greece but I point the Deputy to the treaty provision that says that the property regime of the member states is not interfered with by the provision of the treaties.  We cannot impose one philosophy or another.  We do not have a doctrine in favour or against the privatisation of the water services.<br/><br/>My general point is that we bring to the committee's attention for its deliberation elements of relevance to the political judgment.  We do not impose any solution.  We are not in favour of or against water charges.  However, we point to the fact that the overwhelming majority of the continental member states of the European Union have water charges and metering in different forms and with different degrees of flexibility.  This proves that the system works.  The system is not overwhelming in terms of the financial burden for the consumer and the citizen who receives the water services.  We are bound by the reality that any <i>retour en arri&egrave;re</i>or return to the <i>status quo ante</i>will mean the return to a system that did not function properly.  I will use a comparison.  In terms of secondary urban waste water treatment, Scotland is okay up to 98% of the population.  In Ireland, that level is only 53.1% of the population.  This is only one indicator of the challenges of the system.  The committee has to make a judgment and a decision against a backdrop of these concrete elements.</p></speech>

Mr. Ciobanu-Dordea seems to be saying that if a practice has continued in a country for many years and then there is a proposal to change it, it suddenly ceases to be established practice and the proposal becomes established practice.  Why is the word "established" used?  It is not "changed practice", but "established practice".  Does the witness not take Deputy Kelly's point that if there is an established practice, it remains so until something workable is put in its place?  Clearly that has not happened in Ireland.  Without getting too far into the complexities of this, is the witness saying that to meet the objectives of article 9(4) there has to be a system of individual payment?</p><p>Reference has been made to the polluter pays principle.  If taxpayers generally are paying, then the polluter pays principle surely is satisfied.  Where does it say, imply or direct that there must be individual charging?  If that is indeed what the directive implies and if there is something in the directive that says as much, has the Commission taken any legal action against Northern Ireland?  Northern Ireland does not have an individual charging system.  Has the Commission taken any legal action against Scotland?  Are we the only people against whom legal action is being taken?  The Commission officials have said, rightly, that no one is above the law, but no one is below it either.</p><p> What is the relevance of the directive to metering?  Does the directive encompass the provision of metering or would district metering be sufficient?  Do we need any kind of metering at all?</p></speech>

Article 9.4 is an exemption to an obligation.  Exemptions have to be interpreted narrowly.  Article 9.4 provides for an exemption to an obligation to establish a water pricing policy in accordance with the cost recovery principle and the polluter pays principle, the latter principle being part of the treaty, by the way.  The exemption, therefore, needs to be interpreted narrowly.</p> <p>  The context relates to before the first river basin management plan was adopted.  We wrote that to apply Article 9.4, we believe that it must have been established practice by the time of adoption of the directive and the practice must have been consistently maintained until the adoption of the river basin management plan.  Then, in respect of that river basin management plan, the member states would have to give the reasons for not applying a water pricing policy according to the cost recovery and polluter pays principles as long as they met the objectives of the Water Framework Directive.</p> <p>  It is a pity that Mr. Murphy has left the room.  This is the sense of the addition that we made in 2010 to the established practice at the time of the adoption of the directive.  The idea was to avoid member states abolishing water charges in 2006, for example, and then claiming that the situation was established practice.  It is not a symmetrical issue.

We made our intervention on metering at the beginning in the context of the recommendations from the expert commission.  The expert commission recommends that a charge for wasteful use of water is implemented in Ireland.  It is for the country to consider how to do it.  What we are saying is that the only way to do that is to implement metering.  Metering for domestic use is general practice in the whole of the EU, with few exceptions.  The committee has invited representatives from exempted areas to give evidence to the committee recently.  This applies in Scotland, for example, as well as some parts of England and Wales and Northern Ireland as well.  The rest of the EU is using metering generally for domestic households.  It is generalised.</p> <p>  It is a well-established practice, if I may use the term, to promote conservation and to have a fair water charging system in place.  Deputy O'Dea referred to Scotland and Northern Ireland.  My colleague, Mr. Ciobanu-Dordea, referred to the need to avoid looking at the obligations of the Water Framework Directive in isolation.  Article 9 is in place to support the achievement of the objectives of the directive.  That is why, as Mr. Bradley mentioned, it is part of the programme of measures relating to water pricing policy.  I say as much because of comments relating to whether the Commission could reproach Scotland and Northern Ireland as regards the water services if they have compliance that is close to 100%.  Urban wastewater treatment directive compliance is close to 100% in those countries.  This is not the case in Ireland.</p></speech>

My question is whether, to comply with the EU directive, there is any requirement for individual metering.  The fact that it is generalised does not necessarily mean there is any requirement to have individual meters.</p> <p>  The Commission representatives are suggesting, by admitting that the Commission is not taking action against Scotland, that individual charging is not really essential under the directive to comply with the objectives of the directive.  Is that the case?</p></speech>

I thank the delegation for attending the meeting.</p> <p>  Mr. Aurel Ciobanu-Dordea said he is available to the committee for further consultation should we have any further questions later.  If he is willing, I suggest that, when we get to the point where we may have a draft proposal, we can ask Mr. Aurel Ciobanu-Dordea some questions at that stage.  If there are fines, they are decided on by the European court but are based on objective elements.  Can we run by Mr. Aurel Ciobanu-Dordea the committee's recommendations to see, from the objective facts, whether they would be in compliance with EU directives?</p> <p>  In his letter to the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, as well as in his letter to the expert group, Mr. Aurel Ciobanu-Dordea referred to the principle of the polluter pays as being fundamental to the directive.  We have heard other interpretations around this, such as we can have a derogation because of established practice.  However, I am sure we also have to comply with the fundamental intentions of the directive, part of which is the polluter pays principle.  Will Mr. Aurel Ciobanu-Dordea clarify if the polluter pays principle has to be part of any solution we come up with?  He has been clear that there is a certain amount of discretion to the member state to comply.  Ultimately, we all have to comply.</p> <p>  The expert commission report stated excessive or wasteful use of water will be discouraged by applying a tariff for such use and, therefore, is consistent with the polluter pays principle.  There is a general view in this committee, as well as in the expert report, that there should not be a charge for normal use but that there should be a charge for excessive use.  In Scotland, there is a charge for water services.  It is taken in through the household tax which varies in accordance with the size of the house.  Does that protect a country like Scotland?  Scottish Water was at the committee recently and informed us it has district metering.   It can use the information from that to pinpoint where there may be excessive use in a particular district and approach those who may be causing excessive use.  Scottish Water has a system in place to deal with excessive use and it also has a system of paying in place.</p> <p>  In my view, the Scottish situation is totally different from the Irish situation where we are proposing to have no charge whatsoever.  Is there any other way of charging for excessive use if one does not have meters?  If the outcome of this committee is that there should be a normal household free allowance, paid by the State through central taxation, but that excessive use should be paid for by the individual, then we are obviously not adopting the Scottish model because we will not have a general payment through local taxes.  Maybe that will be an option.  How can we actually comply with the polluter pays principle if we do not have meters?  Is there any other way?</p> <p>  In his presentation, Mr. Aurel Ciobanu-Dordea spoke about room for social tariffs.  Will he elaborate on this?  Does that mean allowances could be made for households with illnesses which require extra water?</p></speech>

It is normal in general in environmental practice.  It is among the environmental rules and should be part of the solution.  We would also like to point out the fact that in practice it is hard to imagine how one would identify excessive use in the absence of metering.  It would also be difficult to identify for each individual whether his or her consumption is normal, is excessive or is below the norm.  One needs metering.</p> <p>  We understood from the depositions of other regional authorities that the committee heard, as well as from our experience with other member states, that in practice there can be strategic or structured approaches.  One starts with applying district metering to identify which areas suffer most of the leaks.  Afterwards, one can tighten the net gradually until one goes into individual metering.  We acknowledge the fact that introducing district metering is a significant contribution to controlling the leaks.</p> <p>  We would also draw the committee's attention to the fact that controlling or curbing leaks is not the only purpose of this.  The level of consumption must be determined as well.  It is hard to imagine how compliance in the case of each citizen and how a level of consumption could be calculated with fair precision in the absence of metering.  We also have to be aware of the fact that consumption patterns can have common trends but also can have significant variables.  For example, one family has a swimming pool while most other families do not.  Some families might have large gardens and want to water their gardens but others cannot afford to have large gardens.  How does one distinguish between these families?  Is it fair that somebody living in a dwelling on the fifth floor of the building pays the same amount of charges as someone who has a large garden or a swimming pool?  Is that realistic?  We believe metering allows public authorities to distinguish between these different situations.  This means fairness and equality which are generally accepted principles of law.  In practice, the introduction of metering should not be politically seen as outrageous.</p><p>It recognises the individuality of each consumer.</p><p> I will come to the matter of the social tariff by confirming that there is an explicit mandate in the directive allowing for social tariffs.  If I may be allowed to add, I would say that the directive does not impose a certain level of the charges.  The level of the charges is left in the hands of the member states.  Ireland can start low and progressively advance towards higher charges.</p><p> I would like to highlight one important difference between Scotland and Ireland.  In Scotland, with its tax that is dependent on the value of the property but which is highlighted specifically on each consumer's bill, they secure full cost recovery.  They pay &pound;430 to &pound;450 a year, which is far more than was paid in Ireland when the previous system was in force.  Securing cost recovery, therefore, is an important element.  If Ireland secures cost recovery and a practical application of the polluter pays principle, many issues can be discussed but the objectives of the directive are of paramount importance.  That is why, and not wishing to soak everything in a fuzzy political discussion, we would still like to draw members' attention to the fact that a broader policy and political discussion must take place and the full picture be considered.</p></speech>

I repeat the disclaimer made at the outset that any infringement decision is a prerogative of the College of the European Commission.  However, for the current discussion I would say it is difficult to identify the arguments that would convince somebody that such an indistinct system sits well with the water framework directive.  If there are elements that can be explained properly by the Irish authorities, and I am not the oracular mouse who tells the ultimate truth, perhaps we do not see them here but it is very difficult to perceive them, and it is not <i>prima facie </i>the casethat we are seeing this.<br/><br/>We have reflected a good deal on the matter.  It is important to see how this system would secure, in a credible way and for a relatively long period of time, an investment of &euro;13 billion.  Would the Irish authorities make a commitment to make such an investment from the public purse in a short or longer amount of time?  How would the &euro;13 million be procured by the public purse?  What will happen when in three or four years time such investments will compete with other investments that are equally important to this society?  How will this be preserved in terms of the integrity of continuous investment in a safe water system that is fundamental for the health of Irish consumers.  I know the word &quot;consumers&quot; is not liked but beyond citizens, they are consumers as well, and this does not diminish their status.  They are entitled to the best, not to have halomethanes in drinking water.</p></speech>

We will have to make a judgment individually and also as a committee regarding those opinions.  I value any opinions this committee gets from either side.</p> <p>  It is clear from listening to the contributions of the Commission representatives that any reasonable and common sense reading of what they have outlined is that the Commission's position has been inconsistent, that it changed between 2010 and 2016 and, in my view, is now an openly and nakedly political position.  </p> <p>  I have two questions, and Mr. Ciobanu-Dordea might answer the first one.  Regarding the German case, the European Court of Justice held that the failure to put in place a pricing policy on a specific matter without any complaint that has resulted in a failure to meet the objectives of section 9.1 or the directive as a whole was not sufficient to establish a breach of Germany's obligations.  Am I right in taking from that that the lack of a pricing policy did not make Germany in breach of the obligations?</p> <p>  My second question is to the same three gentlemen.  Am I correct in saying that the question of full recovery of costs was in the original draft directive but it is not in the actual directive?</p></speech>

In other words, in the German case the absence of full price recovery did not render Germany in breach of the obligations.<br/><br/>With regard to whether full cost recovery was in the original proposed directive, it was, and it was withdrawn following conciliation at the Parliament.  That is recognised in the document I was looking at from the European Parliament which I will read into the record.  It is A5-2000-0214 and the relevant part states:</p><blockquote>Water pricing is a sensitive issue for number of Member States that have particular regimes for exempting certain categories of users.  However, in the conciliation the attention focused on Ireland.  It is the only member state that does not charge households according to water and sewage volume but finances these services via taxation.  At the end of the conciliation it was agreed to provide for the Member States to be able to opt out from the obligation of cost recovery if this is based on &quot;established national practices&quot;.</blockquote><p>That is why, when I spoke earlier, I spoke about it being the Irish exemption.  There was a clear recognition by all involved at the time that Ireland had an established practice.  There was acceptance that Ireland could continue to have that established practice, which is why full cost recovery was dropped from the directive as we now have it. </p></speech>

I will add that the German case, for me, emphasises the margin of appreciation in terms of cost recovery and its implementation.  Margin of appreciation is effectively the discretion given to the member state.  The decision in the German case has been criticised by leading academics, but it reinforces the outcome of the decision in the sense that it emphasises the margin of appreciation that is left to the member state.  The Commission representatives have supported this today.</p> <p>  I would finally add that it must be looked at holistically in respect of Articles 4, 9, 11 and 5.  It has to be looked at in the round and that is what the court did.</p></speech>

This is the reasoning.  This does not apply to domestic water pricing in the Germany's case because Germany has a generalised system of domestic water pricing based on metering and usually a tariff which has a fixed part and a variable part.  It has a full cost recovery obligation in its law.  I am talking about full cost recovery.</p> <p>  Legal archaeology, which we can carry out, sometimes helps us to understand and interpret what the intentions of the legislator were, but there is no hard obligation to recover 100% of costs  in the Water Framework Directive.  There is a principle of cost recovery and there is an obligation to establish cost recovery but there is some flexibility in the last paragraph of Article 9(1) which states that member state may take account of social and economic considerations and climatic conditions.  It is for Ireland to find a solid way to have a consistent system that justifies, and can achieve, the goals of the Water Framework Directive and can consistently deliver funding for the required water infrastructure. </p></speech>

At this point members are exploring three options.  In synopsis, the existing regime which includes a suspension, charges funded entirely from taxation and a scenario based on the expert commission report.  From the evolving conversation there are obviously very different perspectives on that and there are risks associated with what would be a compliant funding model.  I did not want to get into that precisely,  but simply for information I will say that the focus has been on what we said in the first river basin management plan.  We are now in the process of doing the second river basin management plan and we are close to going out to public consultation on that.  It will reflect that the Oireachtas is seized with looking at this issue at this stage, and then we will be finalising those plans.  In those final plans we, as I state, will have to set out how whatever model has been chosen following the process is in compliance.  That will have to take account the risks associated with different models, which members are informing themselves of.  That timeline is due during the course of this year and by the end of 2017 we will be finalising the second cycle river basin management plans.</p></speech>

Compliance with the Water Framework Directive is critical to this committee's ultimate recommendations and whatever policy the Government of the day will adopt.  One of my questions to Ms Graham and the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government was if a legal risk assessment been carried out with the advice of the Attorney General in respect of compliance under both the Water Services Act 2014, which I would presume had the approval of the Attorney General as it has been enacted, and under the current suspension regime?  Is she looking forward, in the river basin management plan, at further risk assessments?  That is a critical point to make.</p> <p>  Taking account of the obligation that we as policy-makers have and that we as a country have, I will ask some questions of the Commission.  With regard to consistency of how EU members are treated, are the witnesses satisfied that the Irish State is being treated consistently in terms of our obligations?  We have heard about cases being taken to the European Court of Justice, ECJ.  Are we being treated consistently?  The impression may have been given that we are being targeted in some way by the Commission.  I would like the witnesses to reassure the committee that is not the case.  Will they give their view on that?</p> <p>  What are the witnesses' views on the fairest way to treat excessive use or waste of water resources?  They have mentioned metering, but what is the view across the Commission and the EU member states?  What is generally considered the fairest way to capture and to charge, or to treat in whatever way, people that waste or use water excessively?</p> <p>  There was a lot of debate around the derogation and whether it can still be applied in Ireland's case.  Listening to the difference in views, I believe that the ECJ may well ultimately determine the outcome of that.  The Commission has made clear to the committee its view under EU law, and the delegates need not reiterate it for me.  As a member state we have bought in to the Commission as an authority and we, as committee members, should take careful cognisance of what it has said in regard to derogation.  If the current water policy regime, that is the suspension of charges, continues, is it increasingly likely that further cases will be taken to the ECJ against Ireland?  </p> <p>  A delegation from the Environmental Protection Agency is here today.  In our whole debate about water services provision it is important that the EPA, as our environmental regulator, expresses a view.  Taking account of another case taken against Ireland, where 38 urban centres around the country, large towns and cities, are now before the ECJ, is the EPA satisfied that the current Irish Water capital plan is adequate to address the issues in that case?  Would it have any concerns regarding the sustainability of those capital plans should there be changes to how they are resourced in the future?</p> <p>  We have listened to some legal opinions here today.  I welcome legal opinion, even though I might not always agree with it.  It helps to inform the debate.  Under the Water Services Act 2014, it was clear that Ireland was compliant with our obligations.  I would like to hear if the legal experts share the view that Ireland would be less likely to be compliant if water services continue to be funded from general taxation and no charge levied?  I would like to put their view on that on the record.  If they think we would continue to be compliant without charges, why do they think that would be the case? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.234" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aurel Ciobanu-Dordea" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FFJ2017021500002#O00200"><p>On the important matter of equal treatment, it might sound like a general reassurance to the committee but we have constantly paid attention, probably historically from the beginning of the institution, to this crucial matter of equal treatment.  It is important not only that member states are treated equally and fairly but that they see this fairness and equality in action.  That is why the Commission is deploying, at least in the area of the environment, particular attention to equal treatment.  Of course one has individual situations in one member state or another and then one has to deal with that particular situation but one has also general obligations defined by EU law and deadlines applicable to all member states.  In order to secure full equal treatment we are dealing with all the member states at the same time and are moving forward or on the contrary, holding back when that is necessary, cases concerning all member states for which this situation is relevant.  This represents a particular challenge.  When one has to deal with 12 or 15 cases at the same time it is not simple.  It is not a case of me writing three paragraphs on a sheet of paper and tomorrow we go to court or something like that.  As members can well imagine from the work of this Parliament and the work of any public authority, one needs to prepare things properly.  I can reassure the committee and if it is necessary we can provide examples to it - I do not know them by heart but we can provide them in writing - illustrating that we strive for equal treatment.  I think we achieve equal treatment and that we do not treat Ireland in any particular way compared with other member states.  Because certain examples have been brought here which some read as illustrative of discrimination, I have tried in my explanations to the committee to point out why the situation in Ireland is not comparable with that in Scotland or in very few other jurisdictions, principally Northern Ireland, because their performance in terms of the general efficiency of the system is different compared with the situation in Ireland and the directive points towards taking care of the broader picture.  When one makes the assessment one must pay attention to how the general system functions.  The parameters of the different engines show that the functioning is sometimes significantly different.  That is why of course the situation is significantly more challenging for Ireland but it is possible to find solutions in the framework of the directive.</p> <p>  A question was asked about what fairer way than metering exists to measure excessive use .  To the best of our knowledge, there is no other solution.  Nobody has pointed that out, although I am open to being shown by anyone what practical tool, instrument, formula or system can be put in place that is fairer than metering and that identifies the behaviour of individual citizens better than individual metering.  Let me repeat that it is perfectly understandable and acceptable to roll out a programme that like the satellite imagery narrows down - it starts with a more general image and makes it finer so that it increases the granularity.  In order to fight with most of the leaks, one can start with district measurement and thereafter increase the granularity until it rolls out a general system of individual metering.  I will stop there.  I am not sure if I have noted well all the questions that have been asked.</p> <p>  I indicated earlier that we believe the implication of the current situation, with the suspension of the water charges and the wider context of the situation, makes things of such a nature that we believe undoubtedly Ireland is not in compliance with the Water Framework Directive.  We are very much supportive of an adequate process of reflection and deliberation in Ireland that is persuasive for the majority of Irish citizens.  We hope that such a deliberation, no matter how heated it can become, and it is legitimate and understandable - it is an important societal matter - will lead to the right outcomes.  Because if people do not care about their own health, what do they care about?  If they do not agree that they deserve and require protection of their own health, what do they want more than that?  This is of paramount societal importance.</p></speech>

We have an ongoing engagement in terms of the legal issues arising from funding and compliance with the Water Framework Directive.  As models evolve, different legal and policy considerations come into play.  Without prejudice to what might become the final view when one takes into account all of those complex dimensions, the Department has formed the view at this stage that a regime in line with the Water Services Act 2014 would clearly be compliant with the Water Framework Directive.  A scenario where the domestic segment of water costs was entirely funded by taxation would, more likely than not, be found to be non-compliant with Article 9.  The approach recommended by the expert commission would potentially be compliant with the Water Framework Directive, depending on matters such as what constitutes normal usage.</p> <p>  We have obviously noted the contents of the letter from Commissioner Vella.  Ultimately, following the Oireachtas deliberations, the approach to funding compliance with Article 9 will need to be set out in the second cycle river basin management plan.  Any bundle of measures adopted or that would be considered for adoption in that regard would have to achieve the purposes and objectives of the directive, and that obviously includes things such as the promotion of sustainable water use and enhanced protection and improvement of the aquatic environment.  That involves, in substance, policy analysis as well as legal issues.  In finalising the plans we will engage on any of the legal issues arising with the Office of the Attorney General.</p></speech>

I understand the difficulty with sharing the advice of the Attorney General but what is the Department's position - I do not ask about the Minister - on derogation?  We have heard different views expressed today.  The Commission holds a very strong view, namely, that derogation no longer applies and we have heard legal opinion that it possibly does still apply.  Does the Department have a view on derogation and where we currently are in that regard?</p></speech>

It is a separate question whether we could have used it or not, but we did not use it.  Subsequently, the Water Services Act 2014 was brought in and established a charging regime.  We then moved to the second cycle plans.  I do not think that the Department has previously said that we thought we could rely on a derogation under article 9(4).</p></speech>

We have no role with regard to setting water policy, water charging, metering or related matters, so I will leave that debate to others.  On Senator Coffey's questions with regard to Irish Water and capital investment, we are focused on the delivery of safe and secure water and ultimately the protection of the environment from wastewater impacts.  That is what we focus on.  Our assessment of Irish Water is based on the achievement and delivery of those objectives.  It is very straightforward.  During the period 2014 to 2017 the EPA's remedial action list dropped below 100 supplies for the first time, and the number of people on boil water notices is now less than 5,000.  We also have national strategies in place to deal with key issues such as lead, trihalomethanes and pesticides.  Our assessment of Irish Water's plan suggests that all schemes on the current remedial action list will be removed by the end of 2020, with many scheduled for completion within the next two years.  That covers the drinking water side of things.</p> <p>  With regard to wastewater, the news is less encouraging.  We have not seen the same level of improvements and performance, and we are seeing increasing delays to the reported completion dates of projects such as the elimination of discharges of raw sewage from 43 identified sites.  Many of those schemes are now two years behind the original planned dates.  This is not new - it was in our annual report on wastewater.  We have also said that Irish Water needs a greater focus on improving operational effectiveness of its existing infrastructure, but there also must be an acceleration of investment in new infrastructure for both drinking water and wastewater treatment.  I should highlight to the committee that the EPA has been raising this since 2006, so it is not a new message.  The state of the infrastructure has been identified by us in many reports over the years.  My colleague, Gerard O'Leary, might talk about the specific points of the ambitions of the plan out to 2021.</p></speech>

I am going to read aspects of slide 17, which maps out where we were in 2014, where we were in 2016 and where we are today.</p> <p>  The existence of the boil water notice shows that the reality today is that the water quality is not good.  That has been dropping, as Ms Burke pointed out, and there is a projection to get to zero by the end of 2020.  </p> <p>  We have gone further and analysed all of the public water supplies.  We are trying to identify where the issues are likely to be tomorrow and where the water supplies are not resilient enough.  The 99 schemes currently in place represent 770,000 people who are at risk of being on some form of water restriction.  We are playing catch up on 16 years of backlog, and that is also the picture with the urban wastewater treatment directive.  Many of the deadlines were 2000 and 2005.  The year 2000 was for the larger supplies.  From the presentation it can be seen that the largest plant that we have in the country, at Ringsend, does not comply, which brings down our average.  We are running at about 50%, whereas the rest of Europe, on the basic and urban wastewater, are in the 90%+ bracket.  I am reluctant to speak too much about the stats because if Ringsend was compliant we would be in the 90% bracket as well.  However, as Ms Burke pointed out, there were 43 years when if one flushed the toilet everything went into the aquatic environment.  </p> <p>  From an EPA point of view we do not want those smaller areas left behind, because although they are small areas they have a lot of tourists.  If I was to pick one, for example where I live in Wexford, there are playgrounds in Kilmore Quay adjacent to sites where there is raw sewage.  We are keen that the job gets finished for the urban wastewater treatment directive.  There is a greater list of 124, encompassing the small and the big.  The whole preamble to the urban wastewater treatment directive was the protection of public health.  In the case of urban wastewater there are 124 areas on the list.</p></speech>

Much of the debate that we have had today is around compliance, and there is no doubt that the EPA is working in the interests of protecting human health and environment, especially with regard to water provision and water services.  It is a message for our committee, and I do not mind putting it on the record, that irrespective of where we stand on the derogation debate we have a much larger obligation to human health.  Leaving aside member state obligations aside, we have obligations to our citizens.  Much of the debate today, if we are honest about it, has been about getting off the hook in terms of charges and in terms of derogation.  What the EPA have outlined today is what the committee members should be focused on, and that is how we improve our environment, our water provision, and how they are sustained into the future with regards capital investment.</p></speech>

Article 9(4) is the derogation from article 9.  One must have an understanding of what the obligations are under article 9.  The European Court of Justice has said, and it is common case today, that charging <i>per se</i>is not the issue, because it has to be seen in a wider context.  The European Court of Justice has said that if a member state has wide discretion they also have broader obligations.  The management of the river basin comes into it.  That is the context within which to look at this.  We should sort out our understanding of article 9 and then assess whether article 9(4) kicks in.  My understanding of article 9 is that it is not dispostive of the issue of water charging.  I think that is the best way to look at it.  Perhaps that is in ease of the Senator's previous statement as well.</p></speech>

There is a wide margin of appreciation.  The question is whether Ireland can be compliant without water charges, and the answer is yes, provided that Ireland meets the objectives.  One of the core objectives is to ensure a clean water supply.  It is not prescriptive about how that is achieved or how the public finances are arranged to do that.  It could be done through general taxation, as is the established practice and as is done, for example, to some extent in Scotland.</p></speech>

We were given responsibility for drinking water and urban wastewater in 2008.  In regard to drinking water, during that period, through an intervention funded by the Department of the Environment e.coli, has been reduced in public water supply by 90%.  That intervention involved the putting in place of a chlorine monitoring alarm - which is approximately 7,000 for every public water supply - which was very difficult to do.  Some of the issues that we are dealing with now, such as trihalomethanes, require serious investment.  In regard to urban wastewater, every year we have published reports setting out where the issues are in relation to urban wastewater, to the point of frustration.  The EPA is not the economic regulator.  In our last report, for the first time after almost 20 years of publishing reports on urban wastewater, we mapped investment in our wastewater infrastructure.  That report is publicly available.  There has been a huge drop in investment in that area.  With respect, enforcement is not the issue.  We have prosecuted on four or five occasions where there have been breaches.  Systematic failure leads to infringement cases by the European Commission, such as the one announced today.  The information about which I am speaking dates back to 2013.  It is information that we have made available to the general public.  Again, with respect, the information has been available, and not only since yesterday or today.  We can deal with situations of kit malfunction but in situations where a kit has not even been installed it is a funding issue.</p></speech>

However, I would like clarification on some points.  Returning to the Scottish Water situation and a comment made earlier, which seemed to me to be enlightening in light of the Scottish Water's contribution to the committee, Scottish Water has the second most expensive water supply in Europe.  It was indicated that there was an element of compliance in what Scottish Water was doing because cost recovery is built into its charge.  It would appear to me, therefore, that in regard to a non-metered system to be in compliance with the directive a cost recovery component is essential.  This is achieved by Scottish Water and, therefore, Scotland, by way of high charges for the supply of water to everybody.  In other words, it is required to actively discriminate against people who could have lower water bills to ensure that cost recovery is built in to its charge.  Perhaps the witnesses would confirm if my understanding of that is correct.</p> <p>  On established practice, which I appreciate has been dealt with in some detail already, my understanding is that if something is established practice it is possible to have a derogation on that basis, unless the State ends that practice.  I am speaking about a sovereign state introducing legislation through its Parliament to change a practice.  It was previously an established practice in this country not to pay equal wages to men and women but we ended that practice by way of legislation.  Once a state has introduced legislation to change something it ceases to be established practice.  We move on and effectively the derogation lapses.  The references to proposals and so on were grossly misleading.  We legislated to introduce charges and we levied them.  The majority of people paid them.  I presume, regardless of what percentage of people paid and so on, when a sovereign state, through its Parliament, ends an established practice then effectively the derogation lapses.  That is my understanding of why established practice would not be possible in this context.  The witnesses may put forward a technical legal argument in that regard but as I understand it that is why established practice has lapsed in this instance.  I would also like the witnesses to respond on whether my view in this regard is correct.</p> <p>  I appreciate that any decision which initiates legal action or fines or charges against the Irish State will be, at the end of the day, a collective decision for the Commission.  However, the witnesses, as people who have held senior positions within the Commission structure for many years, must have some indication or idea of the level of fines Ireland could expect to have levied on it if found to be in breach of the directive.  In my estimation the level of fine we could expect to have levied on us would be in the millions and there would be a daily recurring fine that would be very substantial as well.  I appreciate that this will be adjudicated eventually by the European Court of Justice, with the Commission and the Irish State being the protagonists.  In other instances, I have been no friend of how the Commission does its business.  However, I believe that the opinion of witnesses, as Commission representatives, is valuable in this instance because it is not just another opinion but a real guide for us of the implications of what the Irish State could be facing.  I would welcome if the witnesses could give us some type of indication as to the real costs might be in terms if Ireland were to fall foul of the directive.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.261" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jorge Rodr&iacute;guez Romero" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FFJ2017021500002#Q00900"><p>I will address the question on Scotland and established practice and try to clarify the position.  The Scottish system is very different from any other system in the EU of which I am aware.  Under this system citizens receive a bill setting out the amount they are being charged for water, which money is paid directly to Scottish Water to enable it to operate water services to the level established by Scottish ministers and overseen by the regulator.  This system is based on full cost recovery and as a result Scotland meets the requirements of the urban wastewater treatment directive and the drinking water directive 100%.  This system is working for Scotland.  Whatever the legalities in terms of the flexibility provided for under Article 9.1 or the de facto 9.4, this system works for Scotland.  Ireland, given its situation, has to find a way to fund its water service to a level that is considered acceptable to society and the authorities, that is sustainable in the long term.  The water framework directive provides the flexibility to adapt this system to the reality of the country.</p><p>We have insisted on this quite a number of times.</p><p> On the issue of established practice, if I understood the Deputy correctly, I agree with him.  I will try to explain it again, because Deputy Healy-Rae also referred to the issue of whether we have changed our approach.  I have tried to explain why we have not changed our approach and I will try to do it again, if the Chairman allows me.  One of the conditions to apply Article 9(4) is that it is an established practice.  An established practice at the time of adoption of the directive is taken over until the adoption of the river basin management plan in 2009.  It is in that river basin management plan that the Commission receives the explanation of why the application of Article 9(4) would not prevent the member state from achieving the objectives of the directive.  This has not been applied in Ireland because Ireland, in the river basin management plan, decided to go another route.  However, this does not prevent Ireland from finding a way of providing a sustainable solution for its domestic water funding.  It should not prevent the finding of a solution that is adequate to the situation in Ireland.</p><p> I will hand over to Mr. Ciobanu-Dordea for the last question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.263" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aurel Ciobanu-Dordea" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FFJ2017021500002#R00200"><p>We cannot venture into speculating about the amounts but it is clear that it will be a significant amount if the violation is sustained in time.  It will be a significant amount and in the order of millions or perhaps more than millions.  It could be tens of millions.  One should pay attention again to the fact that this violation will be compounded by other violations that are more advanced such as those relating to the urban waste water treatment directive.  The figures would be aggregated with other cases that are also related to malfunctions of the Irish system.  In other words, if a clear and effective solution that is not expensive is identified - it does not have to be an expensive solution like the one in Scotland - and applied, this will bring enormous direct and indirect benefits to the public purse and the citizen.  It will solve the problems, bring benefits to the consumers and it will also - these are the indirect benefits - avoid or spare Ireland huge fines.</p></speech>

It is important to remember that it is acknowledged that there has been an historic lack of investment in the water infrastructure and the intent behind the charging regime was to address it.  As the economic regulator, we have to hold Irish Water to account to ensure that it delivers service improvements and reduces its costs at the same time.  I reiterate my earlier point which was that the funding must be available and secure to do that.  We cannot hold Irish Water to account for a five-year business plan if the basis for that business plan, which would be secure funding, is not available.  I wanted to reiterate that point and to follow up on the points made by the EPA.</p></speech>

Colleagues from the Commission today have emphasised that it is about quality and not quantity and they have also emphasised the margin of appreciation that is given to member states.  I respectfully suggest that paragraph 4 of Article 9 is not how the Commission categorise it but is as set out in the terms of the paragraph.  The final sentence in the paragraph provides that &quot;Member States shall report the reasons for not fully applying paragraph 1, second sentence, in the river basin management plans&quot;.  That is where the reporting requirement comes in.  The requirement is to report when the member state is going to derogate.  The key phrase, in my respectful submission, is &quot;the achievement of the objectives of [the] Directive&quot;.</p></speech>

He can, of course, respectfully suggest it, but the point I would make is that it is his legal opinion.  He obviously is entitled to give it, but the committee has to make a decision that will go to the D&aacute;il and the Oireachtas for implementation.  I believe we have to be much more conscious of the fact that, as a result of a decision that is politically expedient or anything else, we cannot put this State's finances at risk of tens of millions of euro in fines based on what might be an opinion or a decision.  As a committee, we have a very serious body of work to do.  We take it very seriously and are working on it every single week.  However, it is vitally important that the view of the Commission, which would be the initial instigator of a possible levy, be given significant weight.  The other opinions, legal or otherwise, which we receive from those who attend the committee are important.  Fundamentally, however, we must take on board in our recommendations both what we want to see politically and what are the implications and risks to our nation.</p></speech>

The OPW is responsible for a wide variety of functions with an overall budget of &euro;394 million in 2017.  The principal areas of responsibility reflect two priority areas of the Government programme - flood risk management and estate management, including the heritage estate.</p> <p> As members know, the key objectives of flood risk management is to reduce the risk of river and coastal flooding to homes and businesses and to provide flood risk information to be considered for effective planning in Ireland.  In the assessment of flood risk the OPW must consider the potential impact of climate change to ensure appropriate plans to mitigate the risk are considered.  Recognising the difficulties flooding has caused for individuals and businesses in Ireland in recent years, I am working actively to address the issues with a range of measures.</p> <p>  In relation to capital works, these complex engineering projects continue to present many challenges through the planning stage, the procurement process and the construction phase.</p><p>While it is widely acknowledged that there are long lead-in times for the delivery of flood relief projects, I am pleased to report that construction works commenced on seven major flood schemes in 2016, which means there are currently 11 schemes at construction stage.  A further seven flood schemes are programmed to commence construction in 2017.<br/><br/>The projects programmed to commence this year include Athlone, Bellurgan, Blackpool, Clonakilty, Ennis south and Templemore and the first phase of the largest flood relief scheme ever to be undertaken in the State should commence in Cork city before the end of the year.  I am aware that the people of Cork city have a particular interest in the scheme on the River Lee and to fully capture their observations, the public consultation has been extended to 16 March.<i></i>It is expected that five of the projects currently under construction will be substantially completed in 2017 thereby bringing flood protection to an additional 2,000 properties.  A further 20 projects are at various stages of planning and design stage and when completed will provide protection to several hundred properties currently at risk of flooding.  Running in tandem with these major schemes, 83 localised flood relief projects were approved under the minor works scheme in 2016, which will be undertaken directly by the local authorities in the coming year.<br/><br/>In terms of output measures, it is worth noting that the cumulative number of properties to benefit from major flood relief works completed to date is over 7,700, with an additional 6,150 properties benefitting from local authority projects.  The cumulative value of this benefit to properties, or loss avoided in economic terms, is estimated to be in the region of &euro;1.5 billion.<br/><br/>The OPW&rsquo;s strategic, evidence-based approach to flood risk management has been reinforced with the completion of the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme.  The CFRAM programme is the largest flood risk management planning programme ever undertaken in the State and has completed detailed surveys and numerical models for 300 areas at risk of flooding involving 6,700 km of watercourse and 9,400 sq. km of flood plain.  The output from the ongoing CFRAM programme is a comprehensive suite of maps for the areas at risk around the country and the consultation process with local communities regarding these maps is nearing completion.  I hope to submit the final plans for approval to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in the near future.<br/><br/>In acknowledging that structural measures may not provide the appropriate solutions in many areas, the interdepartmental flood policy co-ordination group is developing a range of policy initiatives to underpin the overall investment in managing national flood risk.  The group, of which the OPW is a member, is considering a number of prevention and mitigation measures for providing flood relief which may include schemes for individual property protection and voluntary home and farmyard relocation.<br/><br/>Following the severe flooding events in the winter of 2015 and 2016, I am pleased to report that a memorandum will go to Government for a voluntary home relocation scheme in the coming weeks.  This scheme will apply where the properties remain exposed to a high risk of flooding and the benefit of major or minor flood relief schemes will not be felt.  Initial funding has been ring-fenced this year for the scheme to be administered by my office.<br/><br/>I am aware that some members of this committee have a particular interest in ensuring that home and business owners can insure their properties against flood damage.  The most recent meeting with Insurance Ireland was held on 8 December 2016 and a further meeting has taken place since to explore the legal, technical and administrative arrangements that may allow for the further sharing of data on flood insurance cover for those 300 areas where the OPW has mapped the flood risk through the CFRAM programme.  The OPW is providing Insurance Ireland with detailed background and technical information on all completed flood relief schemes, including maps showing the extent of the area protected in the anticipation that this will allow Insurance Ireland members to offer flood insurance cover.  A further meeting with Insurance Ireland is scheduled for 8 March, which I will attend.<br/><br/>With regard to the matter of flood forecasting, I am pleased to inform members that Met &Eacute;ireann is in the process of setting up a flood forecasting centre, which will be supported by additional resources within my office, to enhance the early flood warning to those at risk of flooding.<br/><br/>On the Shannon catchment, the Shannon flood risk State agency co-ordination working group is looking at ways to enhance ongoing co-operation of all State agencies involved with the River Shannon.  A comprehensive programme of works is being developed as part of the co-ordinated approach by all State agencies involved in addressing flood risk in that catchment area, and the group is due to meet again on 21 March.<br/><br/>In terms of drainage maintenance, the OPW continues to maintain all arterial drainage schemes completed under the Arterial Drainage Act 1945.  This investment provides ongoing protection to 650,000 acres of agricultural land, infrastructure and properties through the maintenance of 11,500 km of river channel including 730 km of embankments at an annual cost of &euro;15 million.  Separately, local authorities maintain 4,600 km of river channel providing further localised flood protection.<br/><br/>The other main programme of investment for my office is estate management, which encompasses the management, maintenance and development of the State&rsquo;s property portfolio.  In recent years, with a move towards better space management, the Office of Public Works has rationalised office accommodation, surrendering over 300 leases in recent years.  However, the growing demand for space to deliver Government services will require that additional leases are taken on in 2017 and the annual Estimate will increase this year.<br/><br/>The OPW provides a shared service for the maintenance of accommodation occupied by Departments and manages construction projects on their behalf.  Some examples of these construction projects or programmes to be initiated or delivered in 2017 include<font color="#FF0000"></font>the Garda building programme, the fit out of office accommodation at Bloom House, the refurbishment of the Seanad Chamber at Leinster House, the children&rsquo;s science centre, roof works at the National Gallery and a programme of essential health and safety works under the mechanical and electrical programme.<br/><br/>It is worth noting that the OPW also has a key role to play in the delivery of services that are not directly funded by the OPW Vote.  For example, the OPW manages a comprehensive Garda major building programme and in 2015, the Government launched a capital investment plan for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the period from 2016 to 2021, which involves the major refurbishment of stations and facilities from both the OPW and the Garda Votes.  Three new divisional-regional Garda headquarters at Kevin Street, Dublin, Wexford and Galway are currently on site and will be delivered during 2017.<br/><br/>In the heritage area, I am pleased to report that the total number of recorded visitors to OPW sites at the end of December 2016 was in the region of 5.5 million.  This is an increase of some 12.8% over the 2015 attendance and reflects the increasing popularity of our heritage product nationally and internationally.  This is a key driver in terms of the economic benefit being generated for the tourism sector and receipts in this area have increased year on year to over &euro;11 million in 2016.<br/><br/>The heritage sites managed by the OPW are particularly prized by foreign visitors, a demographic targeted by F&aacute;ilte Ireland in its tourism marketing.  Understanding the needs of these visitors and planning for a targeted investment campaign to improve the sites will be a key part of the ongoing tourism investment programme which will be developed in parallel with F&aacute;ilte Ireland branding propositions such as the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East, Dublin - A Breath of Fresh Air, and a future proposition yet to emerge around the lakelands area.<br/><br/>Guided visitor services will continue to be provided by my office at 70 heritage sites nationwide in 2017 on either a seasonal or full-time basis.  One such visitor attraction that is central to the OPW tourist offering and which has featured prominently in the 2016 commemorations is Kilmainham Gaol.  Work was completed in early 2016 on the new visitor centre, which was one of the Government&rsquo;s signature 1916 commemoration projects.  The building was opened by An tUachtar&aacute;n Michael D. Higgins at Easter and now serves as the main entry point for visitors to the gaol.  The OPW heritage service will continue to develop this site as one of the country's premier tourist attractions and in the period ahead, there will be a focus on meeting a strong demand for visitors and developing further visitor offerings at the site.<br/><br/>A strategic partnership has been developed between F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Department of Arts, Heritage, Rural, Regional and Gaeltacht Affairs and the OPW regarding the tourism investment programme.  This promises to be a significant and beneficial relationship, which will bring a greater tourism focus on and investment in relevant projects within the heritage estate managed by the OPW.  The objective of the partnership is to identify projects at heritage sites that will be suitable for investment and to develop them as tourism destinations.  This year, 2017, will focus on improving existing visitor offerings at places like the Rock of Cashel, D&uacute;n Aonghasa, the C&eacute;ide Fields and Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne and creating new visitor offerings at sites like Carlingford Castle, Knowth and Altamont.<br/><br/>Additionally in this period, the OPW will also seek to engage positively with the Creative Ireland initiative, which is currently being developed and seeks to build on the success of the Ireland 2016 project in the area of the creative arts in particular.</p><p>I realise that I have referenced only a small part of the work of the OPW, which has a vast array of responsibilities.  If the committee has any questions on the office's Estimates requirements for 2017, I will be happy to take them.</p></speech>

I will start with estate management.  I also join with the Chairman in welcoming the new Chairman of the OPW.  I too worked in a previous guise with him through the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  I am delighted to see him appointed to this role.</p> <p>  It may not be possible for the Minister of State to answer my questions directly at this session.  If he cannot, I would be grateful if somebody would revert to me.  I want to raise sites like Barryscourt Castle, County Cork, Annes Grove Gardens in Castletownroche, County Cork, and Doneraile Court.  They are three key reference sites that come under the ambit of the OPW's sphere of responsibility.  I know that works are ongoing in Barryscourt Castle, for instance.  The people who use these facilities are anxious to ensure there is continuing maintenance and development.  I note the Minister of State's remarks with regard to Ireland's Ancient East and the reference to developing the heritage element of the OPW offerings.  I ask the Minister to revert to me with regard to what the plans are for those three particular sites.  The Annes Grove Gardens site, in particular, is a recent acquisition and a very valuable one in terms of its history and place in north Cork.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure that the resources are deployed in such a way as to ensure its future development.</p> <p>  I note that there has been a 12.8% increase in revenue streams.  I ask the Minister of State to delve further into how that 12.8% is arrived at in terms of attendance figures across the sites throughout the country.  It is a cumulative increase.  People like me, who represent the people of north and east Cork, would like to see how that translates to sites like Doneraile Court, Annes Grove Gardens and Barryscourt Castle, which is obviously closed at the moment.  I would be very grateful if we could get some solid information from the Minister of State on the figures as they relate to those three reference sites.  My next question is about the children's science centre.  What is the actual state of progress on that?  That is the first half of my intervention.</p> <p>  The second half of my intervention relates to Cork in particular and the proposed flood works.  I note the Minister of State said that the deadline for submissions has moved out to a date in March.  There have been some concerns raised, of which the Minister will be aware, regarding the aesthetics that this project will bring and how that will impact on the visual amenity that people enjoy on the River Lee.  Historically, on schemes like the Munster Blackwater in Fermoy as well as in Mallow, similar concerns were raised by people living within those regions.  I can understand the concerns of the people of Cork city.  I ask the Minister of State to be mindful of those concerns.  I understand a process is under way.  I ask the Minister of State to keep in mind the aesthetic value of the River Lee and to be mindful of the need to ensure the visual amenity that is there.  There are other concerns that will come into the public forum as time goes on.</p> <p>  The Minister of State mentioned small schemes.  There is still a situation arising from Storm Frank in 2015 where works are ongoing on the N25 east of Castlemartyr.  I travelled on that road the other day and work has been carried out opposite a particular property.  I do not want to name the person in question but he and his family have been very much affected by Storm Frank.  There are turloughs present in the area.  There has been no communication between the OPW and this person.  To be fair to the person in question, aesthetically, opposite his house looks a bit like a bomb site at the moment.  I do not want to inflame the situation in any way.  However, if the OPW or its agents could communicate more with the people affected in that particular region, I believe it would be a good day's work.</p> <p>  I also want to ask about the voluntary home relocation scheme.  I would like to know what criteria apply.  Do they include a person moving to an elevated site on their own property and building from scratch?  Is that one of the areas that the Minister of State is examining?  I would like to hear more about the modalities of the scheme, maybe not today, but perhaps at some future session.  In fairness to the Minister of State with regard to his engagement on the insurance issue, he has been quite proactive to my mind.  I had a meeting with the Minister of State prior to the Christmas recess.  We are perhaps still sceptical about whether Insurance Ireland will actually take on board the CFRAM process and, having done that, whether it will reflect in lower costs in the premiums of people living in areas affected by CFRAM.  That remains to be seen and I would like to hear the view of the Minister of State.</p> <p>  Many people have carried out works in smaller areas, such as Castlemartyr in County Cork, which was badly affected, and places like Midleton.  Some of those people had insurance, but others did not and had to pay out quite an amount of money to repair damaged property.  They are looking for an answer to the question of whether Insurance Ireland will realistically engage and whether a real protocol will be put in place to ensure that, once the OPW has future-proofed a particular area that is within a certain flood plain, the cost of insurance will be reduced for people in the future.  I acknowledge it is an ongoing process and I appreciate the Minister of State's engagement on it.  Those are my opening remarks.</p></speech>

It will probably remain closed until at least 2018 but it is being developed.  With regard to the Annes Grove site, it was donated to the State in 2015.  The OPW has commenced a programme of works to make the garden safe and to facilitate initial public access to sections of the garden in spring of this year.  At present, it is envisaged that pre-booked guided tours will be available for the month of May only.  As development works will be ongoing throughout the year, it is necessary from a health and safety point of view that the May tours be limited to small sizes and accompanied by a member of staff.  The site will be shown in this initial trial period as a work in progress site, but at least it is being opened up to the public and progress is being made on it.  The Deputy mentioned one other site and we will come back to him on that one.</p></speech>

It is a hardy perennial in my book.  I want to know what are the numbers as it is a site that I want to see developing.</p></speech>

The Deputy mentioned the tender for the children's science centre.  It will go out to tender by the end of this year.</p> <p>  Before I leave that point, I concur with the Deputy's idea that we need to be spreading out the numbers right throughout the area.  I have had the privilege of travelling to wonderful places around Ireland, only last week on a beautiful morning I visited venues during snowdrop week in Carlow.  This is an event that one will find no place else and it is an absolutely priceless gem.  We need to market it.  We are working with Bord F&aacute;ilte on marketing it.  This will be a help.</p> <p>  In regard to flooding and Cork city, I had the nice task of going to Cork twice.  I have announced schemes for Cork four times, so Cork is doing.  There have been some concerns about the treatment of the quays in the city scheme.  On the basis that there was a great deal of interest in it, we have extended the consultation period.  The Deputy can take that as a signal that the process is being considered.  It is important to remember that this is the single biggest project, worth &euro;140 million, that will be done in Ireland.  We hope to have work on site by the end of the year.  At the end of the day, the important thing is that we will work with the local people to find solutions to their concerns.  That is why we have engaged in consultation but I am putting the pressure on the officials and the design team to drive on with the project because we need to build the defences because of the devastation in the past.  </p> <p>  Deputy Sherlock mentioned the impact of Storm Frank on the N25.  Work is in progress.  The first port of call for somebody with an issue on that is the local authority.  If it an issue for the OPW, it will come back to the OPW, but I think the contracting authority is the local authority.</p> <p>  On the issue of the voluntary home relocation scheme, I hope to bring that proposal with the relevant criteria to Cabinet for approval.  I do not have the full detail but the Deputy mentioned the idea of somebody rebuilding a house on an elevated site.  That can be considered provided that planning permission can be obtained for it and that it meets all the planning criteria and that it is not in a flood risk area.  It will have to be through the planning process.</p></speech>

Since I have come into office we have instigated quarterly meetings with Insurance Ireland.  I acknowledge that Deputy Sherlock came to me with information and we are trying to feed it to Insurance Ireland.  There are major problems in two areas, the first of which arises in areas where we installed demountable flood defences that are to the highest international standards but the insurance companies are not prepared to insure them.  That is a difficulty.  We have answered all the insurance companies' questions in terms of the protocol for the erection, maintenance and dismantling of the flood barriers and at our next meeting we will have further discussions on them.</p> <p>  The second area of concern is that people are not able to get insurance because the maps produced by CFRAM are creating difficulties where they are indicative and they should not be used for commercial purposes.  We continue to liaise with Insurance Ireland to try to build on that.  We are working on that issue.</p></speech>

The demountable walls meet best international practice.</p></speech>

I cannot tally why that would not be accepted by Insurance Ireland or any insurance provider, if it is best international practice and these insurance houses are international insurance houses.  It seems to me that the companies are refusing point blank to insure.  That seems to be closer to the truth.  The ultimate question for people who live in areas where work has been carried out and demountable walls are in place is whether there is a power to compel the companies to provide insurance.</p></speech>

I accept the Deputy's point in respect of the scheme to which he refers and we have discussed it in detail.  I am not happy with it and will work to try to get a resolution to the situation.</p></speech>

Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it agus a chomhghleacaithe.  T&aacute; c&uacute;pla ceist agam anseo.</p> <p>  We have figures for the schemes that will progress and the schemes that are targeted.  As anybody who has been following this for a couple of years, the same schemes appear to be on the same lists year after year.  I was looking at the list from 2015, which in fairness was before the Minister of State took office, there was a target to commence seven major flood relief schemes, but none was commenced in 2015.  The target for 2016 was to commence five schemes and seven were commenced.  Is it fair to say that the seven schemes that were commenced in 2016 were the seven schemes that were to be commenced in 2015 and were not delivered?  I refer to the south Ennis scheme.  When Deputy Simon Harris was the Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW, he told the D&aacute;il the scheme would commence in 2015.  He later informed the House that he anticipated that construction would commence in 2016 and would take 18 months to complete.  Now Deputy Canney is informing us today that it will commence in 2017.  Is my description of the south Ennis scheme correct?</p></speech>

We know the scheme has not commenced and has not yet commenced at this point in time.  The same schemes have been on the list of years.  The people of Clare are sick to the teeth of it.  Am I to believe this scheme will commence quite soon, that is, will it be within a number of weeks?  Is there a chance that Deputy Canney will be before this committee again and the south Ennis scheme will be one of the schemes to commence in 2018?</p></speech>

There are competing problems in respect of funding for flood relief schemes.</p> <p>  From my background in construction, I can understand some of them because the issues relate to engineering and water and it is very hard to define the timescale.</p> <p>  I have a note that the contractor for the Ennis works is to be appointed in the first quarter of 2017.  Construction will probably start in the second or third quarter of 2017.  What I have been doing since I took up the position in the OPW is looking at how long it takes to plan a project, as the Deputy has, and the average time it has taken to bring a project from inception through to the construction stage, that is, to the day that the machinery goes on the ground, has been seven years.  That is the way it has worked.  What we are doing is looking at ways of trying to shorten that timeframe.  With the work that has been done on CFRAM to date, it will knock two years off the length of the process for the projects that have been picked.  We have changed some of the planning procedures to try to expedite the whole process and to shorten it.</p><p>We have also had some cases in which we ran into engineering problems, environmental or other issues which delayed some projects.  My commitment is to reduce the timeframe from conception to construction.  Construction is the easiest part.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that some of my questions are on projects initiated prior to the Minister of State's time in the Department.  There are officials who have been there a lot longer than he has.  This is not something new.  A private company would be able to pinpoint the problems.  It would not have stated seven schemes would start in 2015 but none of them actually started.  It would have been out of business and liquidated by the end of the year.  Can one imagine a large construction company stating it will start seven major projects and none of them starting?

There are difficulties in areas such as Fermoy, to which the Deputy referred, where there are demountable flood barriers.  Insurance Ireland looked for the protocols for the operation of these demountable barriers.  It had queries about who was responsible for putting them up, taking them down, maintenance, where they were stored, how often they were inspected and how often they were used in a dry run to make sure they were still operational.  There were more than 100 questions to be answered and all of them have been.  Insurance Ireland is now working through the answers.  We will be meeting it in March to find out where we stand on the issue.</p></speech>

The demountable flood barriers are in place and have been certified.  However, for the people affected, there has been no real progress made in dealing with the issue of insurance.  The Minister of State has been in position for nearly a year but he cannot inform the committee that he is closer to resolving the issue.  We are at a stage where Insurance Ireland has asked a series of questions and answers have been provided.  However, there has been no indication that the answers will suffice.  If Insurance Ireland is satisfied with the answers, does it mean that insurance companies will start to insure properties in these areas?  Is there any assurance the Minister of State can give to the public on his ongoing engagement with Insurance Ireland?</p></speech>

The Department of Finance regulates the insurance companies.  We cannot force them to do anything.  We just provide the information as we complete every project.  We provide certification that they have been completed.  We have also done that with the demountable flood barriers.  Insurance Ireland has received further information on protocols and we are hoping it has gone through all of it.  If there are queries, it can come back to us.  I believe it has not yet come back with any.  There is interaction between meetings.</p></speech>

Obviously, there were no premises in Dublin which could accommodate them.  I understand the legal action taken by Hibernia REIT, the owner of the building, to look for vacant possession, has since been withdrawn.  The Office of Public Works has entered into a six-year contract with Hibernia REIT, or what is now known as a vulture fund.  It will pay &euro;6 million per year for the building, on which there is a one-off arrears payment of &euro;500,000.  My 11-year old son could figure this one out.  The total cost of a &euro;6 million a year contract for six years comes to &euro;36 million, plus arrears of &euro;500,000.  Hibernia REIT bought this office from the State for &euro;70 million.  It is a shocking waste of public moneys.  The problem is that the Garda will be out on its ear in six years time.  Will the Minister of State confirm that the Office of Public Works has entered into a new a six year lease at a cost which is 22% higher?  Will he explain why a one-off arrears payment had to be made?</p><p>Will the Minister of State inform the committee what the OPW is doing to source alternative accommodation?  As the Minister of State and I know, there is no alternative accommodation in Dublin which will suit the type of nerve centre required by the garda&iacute;.  Are we looking at a fresh build?  What is happening with that?  I understand it is before the Minister of State's time but we raised the issue with the former Minister of State and asked him to intervene with NAMA to buy the building.  What has happened here is a complete waste of public money. </p></speech>

I think the number of garda&iacute; is higher than what the Deputy said but it is a moot point.  The Deputy is right that it is the most critical building in terms of the teams of people that are in it.  We have a lease on the place for the next six years so we have a window of opportunity to provide a permanent base for all the garda&iacute; that are required.  We have identified a site on which we will build a new facility.  The budget for the building of that facility is something like &euro;80 million.  Discussions are going on between the Office of Public Works, the garda&iacute; and the Department of Justice and Equality to finalise the brief for the accommodation that will be required.  That work is ongoing.  There is a five-year window with a contingency of one year to allow for a new building to be built.  When I looked at it, I said it was something we needed to do so we would not find ourselves in the same situation in five or six years time.  This is the plan that will be put in place.  We are working closely with the Department of Justice and Equality whose Vote the money will be coming from to build it.</p> <p>  The Harcourt Street building was bought by the vulture fund.  I do not know how much it paid for it.  I think it was bought in a bundle that cost &euro;200 million.  The Deputy mentioned a figure which I am not aware of.  </p></speech>

The garda&iacute; are not using all of Harcourt Street site so there is an argument to be made that if the OPW was only purchasing that part of it, it could have gotten it for less than the reported &euro;70 million.  The &euro;70 million figure is out there in the public domain and it has not been disputed.  It would cost &euro;80 million for a new build and if that figure does not increase, it is absolutely mind-boggling that &euro;36.5 million will be paid in rent over the next six years in addition to the rent we already paid to the Hibernia REIT.  This is a State building.  How could the State allow the sale of the nerve centre of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to a vulture fund?  It is unbelievable.  It is like selling Leinster House.  It is madness.</p></speech>

I will not call myself a super-sub but I hope I can engage in a positive manner.  I welcome the Minister of State and his officials, particularly Mr. Buckley who is a constituent of mine.  In the past he has been a champion of creating jobs and a great advocate for creating employment in some of the forgotten counties such as Roscommon.  I wish him well in his role.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions I want to put to the Minister.  I acknowledge that we have engaged a lot with the Minister of State and he is good at engaging.  He has visited many localities that have been devastated by flooding.  There has certainly been some movement on schemes, which I acknowledge.  I will put a number of questions to the Minister of State and his officials.  If one looks at the flood risk management programme, over a two-year period there has been a reduction of &euro;12 million.  The allocation in 2015 was over &euro;87 million but, if I am correct, the allocation for 2017 is &euro;75 million.  What is the reason for the scale of that reduction over that two-year period?  Was the full allocation drawn down over the years?</p><p>Could I have an answer to that question initially?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.356" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1260" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017021500002#G00200"><p>Initially, I can tell the Deputy, that there was a carryover of &euro;7 million from the previous year which was spent in 2016-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.357" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1342" speakername="Eugene Murphy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017021500002#G00300"><p>It was a carryover.</p></speech>

Therefore, effectively, in 2016, we spent in excess of &euro;52 million on flood relief alone, which was a record spend for flood relief specifically in any one year.  We spent the &euro;45 million plus the &euro;7.52 million.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.359" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1342" speakername="Eugene Murphy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017021500002#G00500"><p>That is fine.  There also appears to be a substantial reduction in the level of funding provided to local authorities for minor works.  Again, I will refer to a three year framework, namely, 2014, 2015 and 2016.  If we look at 2014, the allocation was &euro;9 million.  In 2015, it was &euro;16 million.  However, according to the figures I have, in 2016 it was down to &euro;3 million.  The level of funding shows a sharp decline.  If we take that same period, the number of proposed projects increased from 27 in 2014 to 55 in 2015 and to 83 in 2016.  How can those figures be reconciled?  Is it that the OPW is carrying out the works itself as opposed to funding the local authority for minor works?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.360" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1260" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017021500002#G00600"><p>To date, the amount of funding which was approved to local authorities since the scheme was introduced is &euro;37.621 million and the local authorities have drawn down &euro;30.421 million.  The value of works directly undertaken by the OPW is &euro;1.5 million.  The number of approved projects is 597 and the number of them that have been completed is 435.  The estimated number of properties that were protected is 6,153.  On average, each year there is approximately &euro;3 million being spent on minor works.  There is no reduction in the funding as such because we will fund what the local authorities seek.  In terms of what they have sought, there may have been a spike that refers back to 2014 when there was an allocation of &euro;9.34 million and the following year it was &euro;16.83 million.  However, those figures are related to storm damage.  There was a specific fund for storm damage at the time, whereas the normal minor works flood relief schemes are averaging approximately &euro;3 million per annum.  There is no reduction.  We pay out based on the funds that are applied for by the local authorities, which averages at approximately &euro;3 million per year.</p></speech>

I think it is accepted that local authorities could solve many of those problems in the short term rather than having to go through the OPW with every project.  Would it not be a good thing to consider the possibility of broadening the minor works scheme?</p></speech>

However, there are a number of things to consider, including the capacity of the local authorities themselves to carry out these works or to even get the paperwork done and into us.  More money can definitely be spent.  There is no cap on what can be spent.  My officials and I are are also reviewing the scheme itself in terms of its cost benefit and other areas to see how we can make it, one might say, more attractive.  However, there definitely is huge interest in it from the local authorities.  If they want to apply for additional moneys, that can be examined.  We are not capping the money or refusing to give money if the scheme meets the criteria.  As the Deputy stated, it is a very good scheme to get works done.  One can see from the figures that nearly 6,200 properties have been protected for very small money.</p></speech>

Coming from Galway and having visited the Roscommon area, the Minister of State knows how badly we were hit and that we are still suffering the consequences of the last storm.  Has the Minister of State specific road budgets within his Department or is it all with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport?</p></speech>

Where roads have to be raised, there is a funding mechanism in place that has been applied by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The local authorities apply for funding for it.  We do not have funding in that regard.  Our primary objective is flood relief and emergency flood relief.  That is where we work.  We do not have funding for roads.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport provide that funding to local authorities.  It also provided for special budgets last year in counties where flooding had caused damage to the roads.</p></speech>

Local businesses and schools were closed.  If we consider parts of south Roscommon around Loch Fuinseann, which is still flooded long after the heavy rainfall is gone, would it not make sense to have a budget for roads in such areas?</p></speech>

I know, for instance, that the money was provided by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport from its budgets for anywhere along Loch Fuinseann where the roads were raised.  There is money available to the local authorities for that.  People contact me, including the Deputy, about getting works done here and there in terms of flood relief, which is my Department's responsibility.  It would be like asking the Department of Health to build a road because we cannot get into the ambulance to the house.  It does not do that and I cannot do that.  I do not have a budget for it.  We do not get a budget for it and we do not have the expertise that the local authorities have to construct roads or reconstruct them.  Our expertise is in the area of flood and flood relief.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that the Minister of State has taken a keen interest in examining with the OPW ways to possibly relieve some of the flooding issues, particularly along the River Shannon basin.  However, the Minister of State states:</p><blockquote>In terms of drainage maintenance, the OPW continues to maintain all arterial drainage schemes completed under the 1945 Arterial Drainage Act.  This investment provides ongoing protection to 650,000 acres of agricultural land, infrastructure and properties through the maintenance of 11,500 km of river channel including 730 km of embankments at an annual cost of &euro;15 million.  Separately, local authorities maintain 4,600 km of river channel providing further localised flood protection.</blockquote> <p>I put it to the Minister of State and his officials that there is in many respects a reluctance to deal with the issue of drainage.</p></speech>

We have spent money on the River Boyne, the River Glyde in Monaghan, the River Inny, the River Brosna, the Broadmeadow River, the River Corrib, the River Moy, in Donegal - the Deputy is gone but we did spend money there - on the Boyle River, the River Bonnet, the River Feale, the River Maine, the River Deel, Shannon embankments - the River Maigue, Shannon embankments - north and south, the Mulkear River, the Groody River, and in Killimer, Nenagh River, and Dunmanway.  Ongoing maintenance has been done year on year in all of these areas, where we have a legal responsibility.  In other areas, the local authorities have responsibility.  In some areas, the responsibility is with the repairing owners.  We have prepared some information for the repairing owners on how they can deal with their areas.</p> <p>  I know what the Deputy is thinking, which is that there are those who say that this is all about channel maintenance.  However, what we are doing on the River Shannon at the moment is unprecedented.  Waterways Ireland and the OPW, in consultation with the National Parks and Wildlife Service have machines clearing areas down in Madden Island and up again on the Shannon above, in Carrick on Shannon and in Mountcampbell.  Both sides, between Leitrim County Council and Roscommon County Council, are working together.</p><p>What we are doing within the Shannon Group is to prepare a template that we will be able to replicate in other areas where we have difficulties with channel clearing.  We are preparing that at the moment.  When carrying out channel clearing, we are working in SACs most of the time so we have to be very sensitive to what we do.  We are working on that.  </p></speech>

Bord na M&oacute;na has major works in the localities right along the River Shannon in Roscommon, Longford, and Offaly.  Has the Minister of State had any discussions with Bord na M&oacute;na about a possible dredging scheme to remove some of that silt from the Shannon?  I am sure the Minister of State will agree that capacity has been taken up by the build-up of silt and other things on the Shannon.  We need to get a dredging and drainage programme going as quickly as possible.  Have we brought Bord na M&oacute;na on board?  Is there any possibility of it coming on board, even on a pilot basis, to remove some of that silt?</p></speech>

It is part of the Shannon Group.  It is part of the agreement to put the maintenance programme in place which, as I said earlier, is unprecedented.  A working group has been put together to identify works we can do fairly easily and works which would take longer as a result of having to get consent and because of the environment and the Habitats Directive.  Bord na M&oacute;na is part of that.  I met representatives of Bord na M&oacute;na last year and they are very co-operative.  They very much want to make sure we bring a maintenance programme forward.  They also suggested that over the winter the low boglands could be used as attenuation ponds, so water could be flooded into them if required.  Bord na M&oacute;na is definitely on board.  All of the stakeholders involved in the Shannon are signed up to working together to bring in a maintenance programme.</p> <p>  We talk about Bord na M&oacute;na and silt in the Shannon.  I have looked at it and there are other areas where silt is coming in from private bogs.  That has to be looked at.  Over the years, things were done but now Bord na M&oacute;na works under a regime and what they can and cannot put into the Shannon is being controlled by the EPA.   I raised that in my first meeting with the Shannon Group.   </p> <p>  The other issue is the pilot schemes on water levels on Lough Allen, Lough Ree and Lough Derg.  It shows the Shannon Group has mettle.  It has demonstrated its mettle and that it is working with intent to get things done.  It has been a success this winter and is being monitored on an ongoing basis.  All of the local groups have recognised that things are being done in a co-operative way.  The local groups in Carrick-on-Shannon, the groups we met at the conference in Athlone and the groups in Ballinasloe are also very co-operative.</p></speech>

Previously, as the Minister of State, I and others know, the OPW has referred to the legal and contractual difficulties it may run into in delivering flood relief schemes.  I am sure the Minister of State will agree this is a very relevant issue.  Are we still dealing with legal and contractual problems with any of the works we are trying to carry out?</p></speech>

We have to work within all of that and we have to work within the law.  In the Office of Public Works all of the agencies that are involved, such as the National Parks and Wildlife Service, are co-operating very well with us.  The intent there is to get works done.  We are not being legally challenged but we have to work within the law so we will not be legally challenged and projects will not be held up.  It may take longer to get the project to where we need to get it but we will avoid a situation like the one we had in Galway city, where the outer bypass has been delayed ten years because it ended up in the European courts.  In the Office of Public Works, we make sure we work with the agencies to get around the issues so we can get a successful conclusion to projects without having a legal challenge.</p></speech>

Is there a possibility of a drainage scheme for land owners?  As the Minister of State knows, many landowners cannot afford to carry out necessary drainage works.  I have no doubt this is an issue in flooding.  Is there any intention of bringing into being a scheme that could alleviate some flooding difficulties that occur because farmers cannot drain the drains that are close to major roads?  Europe tells me this is not a problem.  There is no problem with small drainage schemes that will alleviate flooding.  Is it something that is on the Minister of State's radar?</p></speech>

It will advise farmers on what they can and cannot do in terms of their own banks of land beside the rivers.  The biggest difficulty of the farmers I speak to is not the cost but the fact they do not know how to go about getting the permissions to do it.  We are working on trying to get that in place.  The concern of the farmers I have met is to make sure they keep the water going so it does not flood their land.  They have a vested interest in it and have never said they want money to do it.  What they have asked about it how to go about doing it and where to go.  There is a plethora of agencies they may have to satisfy and we are trying to give them the guidance and help them so they can do the work.</p></speech>

One of the difficulties we have with the home relocation scheme is trying to identify exactly the quantity we are dealing with.  At this stage, having talked to the local authorities and gotten back as much information as we can on the potential relocation units we might have, we could be talking about a &euro;90 million budget in total.  We have a &euro;2 million budget to get the scheme up and running and we will look for further funding in 2018 and 2019 to continue with the relocation scheme.</p></speech>

It has been carried out, funded by the OPW through the county council, but the appropriate permissions were not given by the National Parks and Wildlife Service and others for a particular section of the work in time for all of the work to be completed.  The part that could be completed is completed but the silting up of the river is having an impact and is now rising over the non-return valves.  Is there a possibility that either the Office of Public Works or the council will inspect it?  Could funding be provided for the part that was not completed?  It is causing serious problems with the eye of the bridges and the channel itself.  There is a huge overgrowth now which is of concern to those who live in Callan.  It is also a problem for the scheme.</p><p>The silt is now having a negative impact on the infrastructure that has been put in by the scheme.  What happens in such a case?  How quickly would it take the OPW to sanction the work that is required or is that the way the Minister of State would have to go with it?</p></speech>

It is the River Nore flood relief scheme, which had its issues with cost but which was a fantastic scheme to watch being delivered.  The trucks were going up and down the bed of the river, etc.  It was a great engineering achievement.</p> <p>  Downriver the OPW facilitated some properties by granting them funds to prepare their own flood relief in terms of the impact of the major works that were carried out at the city.  In recent flooding, those works were washed away.  Businesses were destroyed to the point where they had to be started again from scratch.  I refer to Brett sawmills in Kilkenny which has been there for 100 years.  It was so badly affected it is now hugely difficult to rebuild it because there is no insurance.  I am merely asking what, if anything, the OPW can do to assist in that business because of the flooding.</p></speech>

I have two questions on visitor centres and the spreading of numbers.  As visitors come to Ireland and are attracted by Kilkenny Castle or the other heritage sites that we spoke about earlier, what plan has the Minister of State in place for the impact of Brexit on visitor numbers?  Is there an engagement with the tourism promotion of these sites?  Has the Minister of State conducted any analysis as to how these sites might be affected by it and deal with the issue, perhaps, of a drop in numbers?</p></speech>

While a good deal of our visitors come from England, if the Brexit brings borders with different exchanges or whatever, there could be difficulties.  Under Brexit, each Department and agency, including Bord F&aacute;ilte, is looking at the implications for visitor numbers coming to Ireland.  Bord F&aacute;ilte is involved in the promotion.  What we are doing is ensuring we work with Bord F&aacute;ilte in promotion and also ensuring the facilities are fit for purpose when people come to visit.</p></speech>

We spoke earlier about the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East and Dublin.  Bord F&aacute;ilte is conducting a review of the idea of the midlands and the lakelands being developed as another tourist brand.  We have a lot of gems which I have seen which I did not know about before I became Minister of State and which are not on the coast or down the Ireland's Ancient East route.  They are in Offaly, Carlow, Kilkenny and east Galway.  We need to promote all of them to showcase that we have something different.  It is about marketing.</p></speech>

This brings me to the point on a visit by the OPW to a location in Jerpoint in Kilkenny, which is privately owned.  It is the burial ground of St. Nicholas.  It is the best example in Europe of the layout of a town.  It is completely under grass but it has been presented in a way that one can identify the streets, the types of buildings and the river crossings.  I wonder what grants are in place to assist the owner of that type of property at least to maintain it in order that those who are visiting on coach tours are able to access the property with appropriate walkways, etc., because now there are restrictions on those who come by bus and yet it is a promotion of a county location rather than the central location.  What kind of grants or funding are available to assist people?  While significant money is not made out of these sites, it is so important for the State to ensure they are presented properly.</p></speech>

I mentioned to the Minister of State and his officials prior to the meeting about the possibility that the OPW would take a lead role in a project which I will outline.  It is the desire of Kilkenny people that we would acknowledge the hand-over of the castle, which has made such a significant difference to Kilkenny city, county, the region and the country as a whole, from the Butler family to the castle restoration committee, most of whom are now dead but there is one surviving member.  That is part of the history of the castle.  Perhaps as part of the presentation of that more recent history some arrangement could be made to explain the delivery of the castle, as it were, to the State.  It was given for a nominal sum of money, possibly &pound;5, but it has made such a difference to the city and county that the OPW should take the initiative and honour those who were involved and the fact that the transaction took place in such a reasonable way for such a major piece of land.  S&eacute;amus Pattison, a former Ceann Comhairle, often reminded me that in the course of the 1960s the Heinz company was going to apply to the local authority for a factory on the castle site.  Thank God that did not happen because it is worth substantially more to the city than a factory would have been.  I thank the Minister of State for his involvement in Kilkenny Castle.</p></speech>

As members know, the Department was restructured in 2016 around two directorates &ndash; the economic and fiscal directorate and the finance and banking directorate.  This structure remains largely unchanged in 2017.  There are a number of divisions in each directorate and I will briefly set out the key outputs from each of those divisions.</p> <p>  The EU and international division deals with the cross-departmental co-ordination of EU policy and with the development and implementation of strategies at European Union, euro area and international levels in regard to economic, fiscal and financial policy formulation.  It manages the EU budgetary process and EU economic governance.  It also builds relationships through Ireland's diplomatic network and ensures that the Minister and Department are fully apprised of EU and international developments.</p> <p>  The UK decision to leave the EU will result in major challenges for Ireland, as a small open economy with very strong economic ties to the UK.  It is one of our most important domestic and EU-level issues.  In addition to the priority of addressing the economic impacts, Ireland's key priorities are our economy, Northern Ireland, the common travel area and the future of the EU itself.  Government work has been ongoing since well before the referendum vote in the UK.  Since then, preparations have been intensified across all areas of Government to best safeguard Ireland's interests and to minimise any adverse impacts on our economy and on the free movement of people, goods and services on these islands.</p> <p>  A Brexit unit has been established within my Department and it is responsible for the co-ordination of the Department's contribution to the overall Government response on Brexit, preparation for the upcoming negotiations on the UK's withdrawal from the EU, and the future relationship; ongoing cross-departmental and interdepartmental consultation contributing to a whole-of-government response; and liaison with the Central Bank of Ireland, the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, and other agencies, as appropriate.</p><p> We know that, as result of our close economic ties, there are challenges to be met, as was highlighted by further macroeconomic analysis undertaken in November 2016 as part of the joint Department of Finance-Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, research agreement.  The best and most immediate policy within the Government's control to counter the likely negative economic impacts of Brexit is to prudently manage the public finances to ensure that Ireland's economy continues to remain competitive in the face of future economic headwinds.  In that regard, budget 2017 contained a number of prudential budgetary policy measures that will help our economy prepare for Brexit.  Additionally, the last budget, budget 2017, laid out an extensive range of policies targeted at the most exposed sectors, including measures to support small and medium enterprises, SMEs, entrepreneurship, agrifood and Irish exporters.  These measures are an important step in mitigating the impacts on the Irish economy from the economic implications of Brexit.  Furthermore, where Brexit presents potential opportunities, we will seek to maximise these.  For example, I refer to the area of financial services, where the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has responsibility for the IFS 2020 strategy that will build on and compete for mobile international investment in the international financial services, IFS, sector.  There are undoubtedly opportunities for financial services firms to locate here as Ireland remains a committed member of the European Union and the Single Market. </p><p> The EU financial services division of the Department continues to represent national interests in a European and international context.  During 2016 the division made an extensive contribution towards Council agreement on a range of financial services dossiers, including the anti-money laundering directive and the European venture capital funds regulation. </p><p> The Department's review of policy in the insurance sector was also initiated in 2016 in consultation with the Central Bank of Ireland, other Departments and agencies and external stakeholders.  In July 2016, a joint report on the review of the framework for motor insurance compensation in Ireland was published and work on the implementation of that report is already under way. </p><p> The international financial institutions division provides the primary interface with, and management of, Ireland&rsquo;s shareholder interests and obligations in a number of international financial institutions, including the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank Group, and the European Investment Bank.  The opening of the European Investment Bank&rsquo;s new office in Dublin in December 2016 was an important milestone for that bank and will serve to underpin and build upon the strong relationship that already exists between the bank and its counterparts in Ireland. </p><p> Small and medium enterprises, SMEs, make up the vast majority of businesses in Ireland and account for approximately seven in every ten jobs.  The latest Department of Finance credit demand survey for the period April to September 2016 indicates that while demand for credit remains subdued, trading conditions for SMEs remain broadly favourable despite the significant economic uncertainties.  Profitability also remains high with 87% of the SMEs reporting they had made a profit or had broken even in the last six months. </p><p> The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, continues to make low-cost, flexible finance available to SMEs across all sectors of the economy and all regions of the country.  To the end of September 2016, over 10,600 SMEs, operating across all business and economic sectors of the Irish economy, have benefitted from &euro;458 million of SBCI loans. </p><p> The financial stability group, FSG, established in January 2017, replaced the principals group as a forum for senior officials in the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and the NTMA to monitor and discuss financial stability risks facing the Irish economy.  The FSG will have a more forward-looking mandate, which is appropriate as the financial system moves from crisis management and the resolution phase into a growth phase. </p><p> My Department also constantly monitors and reviews the consumer protection frameworks that are in place in the area of financial services including, in 2016, the implementation of the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015.  Under this Act, relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes issued by the Central Bank of Ireland. </p><p> Another very important issue is the Central Bank tracker mortgage examination.  The Government is fully aware of the seriousness of this matter.  It is essential that affected customers receive acknowledgement for the harm they have suffered from lenders, and appropriate redress and compensation packages are put in place.  Therefore, the Government is committed to supporting the Central Bank in its independent examination of this matter in order to ensure a prompt and transparent conclusion.</p><p> Central Bank figures contained in its residential mortgage arrears and repossessions statistics to the end of the third quarter of 2016 show that progress continues to be made on mortgage arrears.  The number of mortgage accounts in arrears for principal dwelling houses, PDH, has declined for the last 13 quarters. A total of 121,140 PDH accounts were also classified as restructured, of which 88% were reported to be meeting the terms of their arrangement. </p><p> Throughout 2016, officials in my Department continued work on our strategy to monetise the State&rsquo;s remaining investments in the banks.  Given its size, our immediate strategy prioritises the return on our AIB investment as the next milestone with disposal strategies for Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB kept under review.  We have received strong advice that a stock market initial public offering, IPO, is best way to optimise the return from AIB, with the earliest possible IPO window being the second quarter of 2017.  We intend to be ready to avail of this window and recently appointed three firms from our panel of advisers to form the core of our selling syndicate.  The appointment of these firms as advisers does not signal any intention or obligation for us to proceed with a transaction, which will be subject to a number of factors, including favourable market conditions.</p><p> In the budget 2017 income tax package I provided, for the third year in succession, for reductions in marginal tax rates for low and middle income earners.  The Government&rsquo;s policy of phasing out the universal social charge, USC, over time, as resources allow, will increase take-home pay for taxpayers, increasing their spending power and allowing for consumer confidence to generate positive knock-on effects for businesses and jobs in the domestic economy.</p><p> The well-established economic recovery is maintaining momentum.  Gross domestic product, GDP, grew by 6.9% in the third quarter on an annual basis.  As a result, the annual average GDP growth rate was 4.7% in the first three quarters of 2016.  Encouragingly, the exporting sector appears to be holding up reasonably well despite the weakness in sterling.  Recovery is perhaps most clearly evident in the labour market with annual employment having increased in each of the last 16 quarters, representing an increase of over 194,000 jobs since the low point in 2012.  The number of people in employment has exceeded the 2 million mark since the second quarter of 2016 and is now at its highest level since the fourth quarter of 2008 - though with a more sustainable composition.   While the indicators for domestic activity are encouraging, the international outlook underlines the need for caution supported by prudent economic and fiscal policies.  Notwithstanding this, my Department is forecasting real GDP growth of 3.5% this year and 3.4% in 2018. </p><p> Public finances also continue to move in the right direction, with significant progress being made on the general government deficit.  As members are aware, Ireland exited the excessive deficit procedure during 2016.  Underpinned by a growing economy, the hard-won improvements in our public finances provide a sustainable budgetary platform upon which funding for the provision of public services can be provided in the years ahead.  The most recent bond sale, in which &euro;1.25 billion was raised through auction at yields of 0.088% and 1.026%, demonstrates that international investors have confidence in the Irish economy and its continued growth.</p><p>The market reaction to our management of the public finances has been positive but it is vital we sustain our progress.  We must guard against complacency, maintain our prudent management of the public finances and continue with competitiveness oriented policies.</p><p> The funding allocation sought for the finance group of Votes for 2017 totals &euro;389 million which compares to a 2016 Vote group total of &euro;379 million.  This represents an increase of &euro;10.3 million or 3%.  The primary driver of this increase is the provision of a &euro;10 million increase for the Office of the Revenue Commissioners relating to increasing staff numbers and other staff costs, which I will address later.</p><p> The allocation sought for the Department of Finance Vote in 2017 is &euro;39.47 million, of which some &euro;10 million is provided for a fuel grant scheme for disabled drivers.  Leaving this scheme aside, my Department's allocation provides for the administrative and non-administrative costs of the Department.  The majority of this, some 61%, is provided to cover salaries and allowances, with a further &euro;6 million, 20%, to cover facilities and non-pay administrative costs.  The remaining &euro;5 million is provided to cover the legal, advisory and committee costs necessary to support my Department in the proactive delivery of its remit.</p><p> The allocation for Vote 8 is for the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  This is an independent, constitutional office which has several responsibilities including controlling the release of funds for public services as approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, auditing public accounts, undertaking independent examinations on the management and use of public resources, and reporting the results of the work to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's public audit role covers 290 sets of financial statements and accounts produced by public bodies.  Together, those bodies have financial transactions which total over &euro;200 billion of public money each year.  The allocation for this office in 2017 is &euro;6.915 million, which is broadly unchanged from 2016.</p><p> Vote 9 is for the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  They have requested a budget allocation of &euro;331 million, an increase of &euro;10 million or 3% on the 2016 net Estimate.  Nearly three quarters of the budget is related to payroll for an employment ceiling of just over 6,000 officers.  The Office of the Revenue Commissioners plays a vital role in our economy by collecting taxes and duties due to the State.  In 2016, Revenue collected a record &euro;47.9 billion for the Exchequer.  In its recently published Statement of Strategy 2017-2019, Revenue is committed to two key strategic pillars, which are to provide a service to support compliance and to confront non-compliance.</p><p> In 2016, Revenue continued to support taxpayers in meeting their tax and duty obligations.  Almost 2.1 million payments were made through the Revenue online service, ROS, an increase of 8% on 2015.  The use of electronic business and PAYE self-service channels continued to increase in 2016.  Almost 1.4 million customs declarations were processed by the automated entry processing system, an increase of 7% on 2015.  During 2016, Revenue extended their electronic service channels through the introduction of RevPay which facilitates online payments for non-ROS customers, as well as jobs and pensions with a new online facility which allows first-time employees to register for tax online.  In the annual report published by the World Bank last November, Ireland was once again ranked first among EU countries, and fifth worldwide, for ease of paying taxes.  Looking forward, a key priority for Revenue will be the fundamental redesign and modernisation of the PAYE system, which I announced on budget day.  Non-compliance with tax and duty obligations is an ever present challenge and those who engage in evasion can expect a robust response from Revenue.  Through targeted and risk focused compliance interventions, Revenue continued to pursue those who do not meet their tax and duty obligations, as well as detecting those involved in tax evasion, shadow economy and smuggling activities.</p><p> In 2016, the yield from Revenue's audit and compliance interventions was &euro;555 million and there were 17 criminal convictions for serious tax and duty offences.  There were also 1,672 summary convictions with a total of &euro;5.1 million imposed in fines, as well as the publication of 372 settlements on the list of tax defaulters.  Revenue has also introduced a new data analysis system to its debt management operation which facilitates sophisticated case base segmentation and compliance tracking.  This allows for quicker intervention in non-compliant cases.</p><p> Tackling tax evasion is an important element of Revenue's non-compliance focus.  In my Budget Statement, I announced significant changes to the disclosure regime for Revenue audit.  From 1 May 2017, tax defaulters who use offshore facilities to hide income, accounts or other assets will no longer have the facility to make a voluntary disclosure.  This means that those who do not come forward before the end of April will face penalties of up to 100% of the tax evaded, publication in the list of tax defaulters and potentially criminal prosecution.</p><p> In strengthening our commitment in tackling non-compliance, the 2017 Estimates provides for an additional &euro;5 million to the Revenue Commissioners for increasing staff resources by 50 full-time equivalents on audit and investigation activities, as well as enhancing ICT systems capacity for data matching and data analytics.  This will lead to a direct increase in tax and duties yield from compliance interventions.</p><p> In other areas, Revenue continues to assist and support the Department of Finance in the formulation and implementation of tax policy.  Revenue also has a key role and is actively involved in cross-departmental discussions on the implications of Brexit.  Additional funding has also been allocated to the Revenue Commissioners to deal with challenges associated with Brexit.  The Government's position is clear in that we want the closest possible trading relationship with the UK.  In that regard, a key priority is to ensure the continued free flow of trade on the island and the need to avoid a hard Border.  The Revenue Commissioners are actively engaged examining a range of scenarios to support Ireland's stated objectives.  In this regard, the Estimate makes provision to increase Revenue staff by 40 full-time equivalents.</p><p> On Vote 10, the new Tax Appeals Commission, formerly the Office of the Appeal Commissioners, the Commission requested a budget allocation of &euro;1.605 million, a net increase of &euro;165,000, or 11% on the 2016 net Estimate.  The increase in the 2017 Estimate is to provide for the Commission to continue to advance its programme of modernisation and reform, as well as to address its caseload in an efficient and effective manner.  Specifically, the increase is largely accounted for by the need to provide for a significant number of additional personnel, including temporary commissioners and support staff, to deal with a large number of open appeal cases transferred from Revenue to the Tax Appeals Commission in 2016, as well as completing an ICT development programme for the commission necessitated by it becoming an independent statutory body.  With regard to the latter, an amount of spending originally anticipated for 2016 in respect of the provision of an electronic case management system is now expected to fall into 2017.</p><p> I thank members for their attention and I commend the Estimates for the finance group of Votes to the committee.  An unexpected meeting has come up for me some time after 4 p.m.  Accordingly, at some stage, and with the permission of the committee, I may be replaced by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.</p></speech>

A report appeared in the media today &ndash; I imagine the Minister is aware of it &ndash; suggesting the Revenue Commissioners have identified several locations along the Border, including in my county of Donegal, that would be areas of examination and identification for checkpoints for what are called red and green channels.  It is also stated that the M1 motorway between Dublin and Belfast is to be an area of considerable focus for customs officials should a hard border be needed.  Can the Minister confirm whether the Revenue officials are engaged in such activity and scoping work?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.446" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017021500002#O00700"><p>The Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, among his other responsibilities, has responsibility for the Customs services.  If Deputy Doherty is talking about the free movement of goods, it is an issue for Customs; whereas the free movement of people is more of an issue for the immigration authorities, with the chain of responsibility going back to the Department of Justice and Equality.</p> <p>  I had a discussion with the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners about how the Customs Service operates.  With your permission, Acting Chairman, I will take a few minutes to give the committee an insight.  The best insight arises from the procedure for goods from Third World countries coming in to Ireland rather than from European Union countries.  This is the worst case scenario if there is no deal with the UK.  Arrangements will have the status of Third World countries under the World Trade Organization.  At present, Revenue operates a colour coded channel system if goods are coming in from a Third World country.  The colours are green, orange and red.  Let us suppose something is coming from the Americas.  Everything has to be transferred electronically to the Customs in advance.  The procedure is that 92% of the goods are cleared in advance electronically.  They simply go through when the containers come in, without a check.  Goods in the orange zone may be subject to an electronic request for a manifest of what might be in individual containers, but there would not be a physical check of them.  The actual physical checking is less than 2%.</p> <p>  Let us suppose the UK ended up with a status operating under World Trade Organization rules.  That would be the template under which the Customs would operate.  However, given the large amount of trade we undertake with the UK and the large amount of imports received from the UK, volumes would change.</p> <p>  The Revenue is undertaking contingency planning, but it has not been directed from a policy point of view in any respect.  It would be prudent for the Revenue to consider the options, but that is all Revenue is doing at the moment.</p> <p>  The Taoiseach is speaking in the D&aacute;il this afternoon on Europe and Brexit.  The Taoiseach has enunciated the Government position on several occasions, saying that we want no hard border and no inhibition to the flow of goods and services across the Border.  From a Government policy point of view, we do not envisage Customs activity on the Border.  However, it will depend on where the negotiations go.  The British have a similar view.  They want free movement of goods and people as well.  However, the negotiators will be the negotiation team of the European Union.  Even though this is the intent of the two jurisdictions involved, we still have to get it across the line in Europe.  That might be five or six years down the line.</p> <p>  I will answer Deputy Doherty's question directly.  The Customs is looking at contingency in the event of where the negotiations may land, but the decision of Government and the policy position is not to have the kind of border that would require Customs officials to be in place.</p></speech>

I have a further question in respect of the contingency plans the Revenue is drawing up.  Some years back a campaign resulted in several Border roads being reopened.  This is relevant for my county of Donegal.  There are numerous roads, including main roads and national roads as well as secondary and local roads, that transcend the Border.  Does the contingency plan include numerous locations being identified in the relevant counties?  Is it the case that only the key arterial routes, like the Lifford to Strabane road, the Bridgend to Derry road or the Beleek to Pettigo road, are being targeted?  I appreciate that this is contingency planning, but is that the type of contingency planning the Revenue is considering in spots?</p></speech>

The information I am giving is drawn from a lengthy conversation and discussion I had with the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners two weeks ago.  I have no wish to say anything to give the committee a wrong steer.  I would invite the Deputy to put down a written parliamentary question to me and I will find out the exact up-to-date position with regard to contingency planning.  In that way we will provide the relevant information to the Deputy.</p></speech>

The Minister referred to Customs controls.  Did he indicate that it may be possible, even in the event that the UK leaves the EU Customs Union, not to have any physical Customs controls or Customs-related activities at the Border? </p></speech>

I have had various discussions, but they have been informal and without any policy status.  Let us suppose goods come in to Dublin Port, they follow the colour coding I have described and there is a physical check on 2% at Dublin Port.  Then let us suppose the lorry drives north and crosses the Border.  Effectively, the technical people have said to me - again, this is not a policy position &ndash; that all we have to do is put in place a camera to get the licence plate on the Border to verify that pre-clearance took place in Dublin Port.  In other words, there would be no necessity for a Border check.</p> <p>  I understand that with regard to the movement of people, the UK authorities are not doing checks at the point of entry.  They are doing checks internally, including by matching PRSI numbers and revenue numbers and so on.  That is how they are doing follow-up work.</p> <p>  The process has moved on.  It would be wrong to think of fixed borders as we knew them.  Anyway, it will all depend on where the negotiations land.  The UK negotiating position is for a reciprocal free trade agreement between the UK and Europe.  If there is a reciprocal free trade agreement, there will be no tariffs of any kind.  We would only have the normal checks for illicit materials.</p></speech>

That would be a criminal activity and it would be a matter for the garda&iacute;.  Where the issue arises along the Border domestically would be, for example, the man from the bakery with the bread van delivering to shops on both sides of the Border, so that he would be up and down and over and back.  I am told arrangements can be made for these things.</p> <p>  There is no doubt this is going to be a difficult negotiation.  I ask members of the committee not to take anything I am saying as a definitive policy position.  I am trying to scope out current practice in respect of third country goods to give the committee the flavour of how British goods might be handled in the worst case scenario.  I would hope it would not be the worst case scenario because, as I said, Prime Minister May's position is to negotiate a reciprocal free trade with the EU.  If she does not get that, I would assume that she would get some way down that road. </p></speech>

At this point in time there is a free flow of people crossing the Border in both directions and carrying out their shopping activities because we are in a customs union.  We are speculating here but is it a possible outcome, in the event that Britain takes itself out of the customs union and that there is not a free trade agreement between both jurisdictions, the EU and Britain, it would be a criminal activity for an individual from my county to go across the Border to shop in the ASDA in Strabane and to come back with their boot full of shopping without going home and filling in a VAT or customs return?  How do we deal with that?</p></speech>

It has been reported that it will describe it as flawed and unable to demonstrate that it was good value for the State.  There has been an agreement to set up a commission of investigation.  The question I have for the Minister is how prepared is the Department of Finance, and indeed is the Minister of Finance himself, to engage with that commission of investigation, the terms of reference of which will obviously require them to do so?  What pressure or strain, if any, will dealing with that commission put on his Department alongside the other challenges that it has?

I volunteered at the PAC's request to appear before it.  I gave five hours of evidence and my officials and I were there for three days with innumerable hours of evidence.  The matter which the newspapers are now saying will be the basis of an adverse finding against me was never raised with me in five hours of evidence.  The minutes of the particular meeting were put up on the website back in 2015 by my Department.  Subsequently there was a written request from the PAC for documents around that meeting and everything was supplied to it.  No question was raised with me about that meeting on receipt of that set of documents.</p> <p>  As I understand due process, an adverse finding cannot be listed for anybody without giving them the right to reply.  The meeting I had with Cerberus was not inappropriate in any way whatsoever.  The PAC has legal advice saying that the functions of NAMA, the Minister and the Department were entirely different and that I had no legal right or authority to interfere with the commercial decisions of NAMA, and I did not.  The minutes of the meeting are on the Internet.  If what is in the newspapers is accurate, I strongly rebut this.  If the PAC is now going to draw adverse conclusions about matters it never raised, after I gave five hours of evidence on a voluntary basis and was in correspondence with it subsequently, I would be very surprised it would do business in that way. </p></speech>

We are looking at the eurozone growth figures for the fourth quarter of this year and they are being revised downwards to something like 0.4% from 0.5%.  I understand that letters have been issued to something like seven countries, although not to Ireland thankfully.  Increasingly what we are seeing in respect of the Stability and Growth Pact is that there is a lot of focus on the stability but very little on the growth.  I would like to get a perspective from the Minister as to where Ireland stands on, for instance, recent comments by the German finance Minister that there may need to be a review of the Stability and Growth Pact and where the politics of that rest at present within the EU.</p> <p>  If we are looking at growth in our own economy and capital spending, obviously there is going to be a turf war on the capital spend.  The Minister and I both inhabit the great province of Munster.  We would be looking at regional economic development between Cork, Limerick and Galway and that Atlantic corridor.  People representing the eastern side of the country would be looking at metro north, the M50 and other such projects.  If we are to be realistic about proper investment in projects of this nature, there needs to be some degree of flexibility built in to, or a revision of, the Stability and Growth Pact because I think it is actually impeding the potential for growth.  There cannot be growth without proper regional infrastructure.</p><p>I would welcome the Minister's perspective on that and on whether that conversation is being had by ECOFIN Ministers.</p></speech>

We are maintaining that as the forecast even though there are some signs of variations on it.  In January, the Central Bank marked the forecast down to 3.3% while Davy's Stockbrokers marked it up to 5% on the basis of recent data showing that domestic demand continues to be strong.  I think there would be agreement that the adverse affects of Brexit that were anticipated, if they existed at all, have worked themselves through at this stage.  We mark down growth rates by 0.5%.  The weakness of sterling is coming into the equation but it looks now as if our position is pretty strong.  We will monitor the forecast as the year passes and we will revisit it in the context of the summer economic forecast.</p> <p>  Growth rates in Europe have risen.  The current forecast is 1.7% to 1.8% across the Community but there are regional variations on that.  All European countries across the 28 member states are showing positive growth now.</p></speech>

On investment, like Ireland, Europe experienced a crisis but its impact was uneven across the Continent.  It impacted more strongly on one set of countries than others.  As a general observation, Europe is underinvested in infrastructure.  Ireland is underinvested, in my view, in both social and economic infrastructure.  In terms of economic infrastructure we need to work on completion of the roads programme, investment in the ports, airports and broadband and investment in social infrastructure in terms of refurbishment of schools, including prefab replacement, health centres and so on.</p><p>The capital programme announced in 2015, which relates to spend up to 2022, is &euro;42 billion, but that includes the public capital programme from the Exchequer and the investment intentions and policies of the commercial State bodies.  We know from experiences over the past year that more resources will be required for the public capital programme.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has announced that he will revise upward the public capital programme and I understand he will do that in the first half of this year, although I am not sure of the date.  Although I do not think he will be nominating projects, he has notified Departments that additional resources will be made available and projects will be prioritised.  The Minister proposes to make the announcement in this regard some time in the course of this year.  As I said, I do not know the timeline.</p><p>In regard to Europe, the rules continue to be the rules but we argue for flexibility on all occasions.  As the Deputy will be aware, Mr. Andrew McDowell is now vice president of the European Investment Bank.  I am an <i>ex officio</i>governor of the European Investment Bank.  I am working with Mr. McDowell to see if we can get additional resources for a public capital programme.  Mr. McDowell is also working with EUROSTAT on whether we can finance off-balance sheet.  The Deputy will be aware from public private partnerships that the key test will be around transfer of the risk.  Transferring the risk means transfer of the financial liability to the entity that is building the road, school and so on.  We have just started this initiative but we have already discovered that we can expect the EIB to look favourably on projects that generate an income stream.  For example, if we proposed to undertake a project in the public transport arena which resulted in the fares accruing from that being sufficient to service the loan, we could get it off-balance sheet.  There are other projects of a similar nature.</p></speech>

If they do not, we will have two motorways.  People will driving on that motorway at the back end of this year.  There are other large projects in the pipeline.  I agree with the general principle behind Deputy Sherlock's question, namely, that we need more investment in infrastructure and to find the resources for that.  While the capital programme is under way and it is stronger than it was, it will be revised because extra resources are available now.  That will be done in the course of this year.  The additional bit I would like to put in place would be off-balance sheet financing through the European Investment Bank at low interest rates in respect of big infrastructural projects that would have an income flow.  We will see how that works out.  I am not promising anything.  All I am saying is that it is worth exploring.</p></speech>

I refer the Minister to the recent parallel in Limerick whereby the Strand apartments were sold by NAMA to Oaktree, leaving the tenants faced with eviction.  Is this an issue the Minister is taking into account in terms of the process of privatisation?</p></speech>

The sale of 25% of AIB and what it might do with its impaired loan books is not connected.  I am aware that AIB is examining the possibility of selling a loan book but my understanding is that loan book is in the main buy-to-rent rather than private mortgages.  The big problem with vulture funds is their names.  The Deputy will have seen articles in the newspapers to the effect that some of the vulture funds have more discretion to do deals with people than the banks have.  I cannot vouch for that.  If a bank writes off bad debt, it is crystallising bad debts on its books, bringing it forward and crystallising upfront whereas if somebody buys a loan book for 50 cent on the euro, then that person has a 50 cent head run to negotiate a settlement with the borrower.  There are mixed views about this, which I admit, but there is publicity in both directions in the newspapers.</p> <p>  The credit servicing legislation is in place.  Under law, the same obligations apply to the purchaser of loan books as applies to the original loaner of the loan books.  The Central Bank is a vigilant regulator and it keeps a close on what is happening.  In regard to the proposed privatisation of AIB, my intention is to sell around 25% of it.  I would not be in a hurry to put the remainder of it on the market.  I was talking recently to my former Swedish colleague about the Swedish banking crisis in the early 1990s.  Sweden only sold off the last tranche of shares in the banks in 2015.  By holding on to them for a time, they recovered, in nominal terms, about three times what they had invested.</p><p>It is a long game and my successors will deal with the matter.  I am not certain we are going ahead with 25% this year.  We have started a process but there is no compulsion on us from a debt management point of view or anything like that to sell.  It is not like it was four years ago when Europe said we had to sell assets to get debt down.  It is not like that.  This is totally discretionary.  We will only sell if we think we will get full value for the shares.  If we do not sell then someone else will in the future.  </p></speech>

Previously the Minister has said that he had full confidence in both NAMA and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The reports are that the Committee of Public Accounts report will strongly back the Comptroller and Auditor General against NAMA.  In respect of the two entities saying two different things, only one can be accurate.  What position does that put the Minister in?  Does he wish to revise his estimate of having full confidence in both if it is the case that the Comptroller and Auditor General has been very critical of NAMA, a view now backed by the Committee of Public Accounts?</p></speech>

I have never seen an inquiry or tribunal where an adverse finding was found against anybody on which that person was not allowed to comment.  I spent five hours in there and was not compelled.  I went in as a volunteer because the committee asked me.  I answered everything and then I find there is an adverse finding about something, supposedly, that was never raised with me.  There was a second shot at it when they looked for documentary evidence, which I provided, relevant to the meeting.  When they received that they raised no question with me about it.  I just do not understand what kind of legal advice was applied when this document was generated.  I have written to the Chairman of the committee and pointed these things out to him.  I do not think that I should get involved in a discussion on it because of that.  I must wait until there is a final report. </p></speech>

The committee has written to the Minister about the vulture funds and meetings that the Minister or his Department officials have had with them.  I am coming at this matter from a different perspective.  If representatives of these funds have met the Minister and his officials, they have refused to come here before us.  As a committee, we want to look in their eyes to ascertain their agenda although we know that in a single line it is profit.  We want to get an idea of how they operate.  I ask the Minister that in his discussions with them to encourage them to come here.  They have refused point blank.  Due to the fact that they will end up with a considerable size of the market and there are individuals caught up in those loans and debts, it would be relevant if they would come before the committee.  It is a pity that they do not.  They have refused so far.</p></speech>

It started very strongly around 2014 and has pretty well worked its way through the system.  NAMA has redeemed something like &euro;30 billion worth of the loan notes that it had.  In terms of assets the notes are down to about &euro;1.5 billion so its work is nearly complete.  I do not know how far up the road the IBRC is but I think it is fairly up the road as well.</p></speech>

A vulture fund could be funded by the State and could take in these loans from the banks at the same rate that a vulture fund might get them.  Then it would be in a position to either continue at a lower mortgage repayment or create a situation where people become tenants and remain in their own homes.  That is the level we are at.</p></speech>

The objective is to explore what is available within the current market and to determine if this alternative model will benefit a greater number of households.</p> <p>  At the minute the local authority is empowered to purchase a house that has an impaired mortgage and rent it back to the owners so that they become local authority tenants.  What if the same model could be applied to private funds?  One must do the sum obviously.  The issue would be whether the income flow generated from rental income was sufficient to service the loan.  It is a good idea that is being explored actively but not in the Department of Finance.  My officials have had a conversation with the officials of the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and the matter is being explored.  </p></speech>

An extensive operation is under way out of the Department working with the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and the Departments of the Taoiseach and Foreign Affairs to make sure financial services entities that currently reside in the UK continue to have access to the Single Market from other locations should they find at the conclusion of the Brexit negotiations that they are unable to retain such access from the UK.   The work I am involved is to ensure Dublin and Cork, in particular, are seen as destinations for these firms to continue to access the Single Market.  Having been appointed to this role, I visited London prior to the Brexit vote to talk to the London Irish Business Society and the diplomatic community.  I also met a few other Irish people who are involved in business there to get their sense of where everything was going.  I met bank representatives to talk about their contingency planning.  Once the decision was known, engagement on our side ramped up quickly because we had one our contingency planning as a Government but companies had also done their contingency planning.  They were coming back into the country to kick the tyres around again.</p> <p>  IFS 2020 is the five-year strategy for expanding our international financial services sector.  We immediately went about retooling some of the key elements of the action plan for 2016 to adapt it to Brexit.  We wanted to launch the new promotional banner brand, IFS Ireland, which represents the IDA and the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Finance, in Asia and North America in order that when people saw IFS Ireland, they knew what it meant - a young, educated workforce in a niche, developing, innovative financial services centre.  Brexit gave us the opportunity to talk about how much of a better offering we have.  We, therefore, talk about the three Ls - language, location and law.  We are a common law jurisdiction, an English speaking workforce is important to Asian countries as is our location in terms of accessibility not just to London but to other parts of Europe.</p> <p>  At the same time, I began to engage with industry domestically and elsewhere, particularly in London, to put together further contingency planning around risks and opportunities.  I am a member of the Cabinet sub-committee on Brexit and I have a feed into that work there as well.  Ongoing work was done in parallel with continued engagements in Singapore, Shanghai, Tokyo, New York and Washington last year and Hong Kong, Beijing and a number of trips to London so far this year.</p> <p>  Prime Minister May has sought to put potentially a carve-out for financial services in a free trade agreement.  That might come in the future.  I have met representatives of the corporation, City of London, a few times and they have lobbied hard for such an agreement.  However, they have since changed their position and they are seeking more of a bespoke arrangement where there might be passporting or its equivalent for certain entities.  That means we continue to live in an environment of uncertainty.  If the authorisation process for a financial services entity takes more than two years, it will be unable to wait until we have sight of what will happen.  From last September onwards, we began to learn that companies would make decisions in the first two quarters of this year.  I have made sure I am available to meet those entities where they have questions around the operating environment here.  Sometimes they will go through the IDA or directly to my office or I organise meetings in London with 60 or 70 people in the room to discuss all the benefits of coming to Ireland and continuing to access the Single Market in terms of financial services offerings.</p> <p>  The IFS 2020 action plan for this year was launched at the European Financial Forum.  This was attended by approximately 700 delegates from more than 400 companies based in 20 countries.  Meetings were held on the side and there was a great deal of positive engagement and positive press.  The action plan has two components.  The first relates to the context of the Brexit, the Central Bank, international education and communications and the second outlines the 40 key actions under four pillars.  Some have a specific Brexit dimension but others are more about maintaining a commitment to the regions and a focus on particular subsectors which all have a Brexit element underneath that.</p> <p>  To come back to the core question, what we think will happen is companies will continue to have a presence in the UK, including US companies, but they will move portions of their business abroad or start new hires abroad.  They will go to different jurisdictions but we will in the mix and we will get more than our fair share from what I am hearing.  I am worried about what other jurisdictions are saying to firms at a regulatory level when they meet them in terms of commitments they might be making that they may be unable to fulfil.  That is doing a little reputational damage to our offering and, therefore, we are robustly countering that at every opportunity.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.516" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017021500002#S00700"><p>I would describe it as "dangerous competition".  I have been stressing to people I have met at a political level the importance of a transitional arrangement to protect the security of our financial system in this entire process because the financial architecture we have across Europe underpins day-to-day business, including exporting, businesses getting loans and trade.  It is important to have a transitional arrangement in place and the Taoiseach spoke about this at another forum earlier.  In that way, we can have the negotiations in a calm and safe environment.  I am bothered when I hear that other jurisdictions are potentially making commitments on the level of regulation and supervision they might put in place when we work to a common framework under the ECB and various European laws and standards.  We are in a competitive environment.  We are not being predatory regarding London, as the Minister has said, but we want to facilitate companies where we can and, therefore, we are competing with other jurisdictions.  What we have heard from some companies makes me question whether they are being prudent.  If a significant company was to choose another jurisdiction as its location and what it had been led to believe did not transpire to be true and created difficulties for it, that would be worrying.  We have been in communication with our European partners on this.  I am visiting Brussels next week to meet members of the Commission and I will make that point to them.</p></speech>

My understanding is its officials are aware of it and they have raised it with the ECB but I cannot speak for them and I do not want to put words in their mouths.  I am speaking from memory but a meeting might be coming up to discuss some of the elements that have been reported but not confirmed------</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.519" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017021500002#S01000"><p>How many jobs could be attracted from the UK in the context of Brexit?  Could the Minister of State also comment on the quality of the jobs?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.520" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017021500002#S01100"><p>It is difficult to put a number on the quantity because we are in a changing environment.  Some companies have decided to create more jobs in Ireland as a result of Brexit but they will not attribute them to Brexit immediately because they have relationships in other jurisdictions to which they are sensitive.  Companies have chosen Ireland as a contingency but they have time to wait until they trigger it.  They may not have to depending on what agreement is put in place. Other companies are waiting to make decisions and because they do not know what it will mean for them, they cannot put a number on this.  Therefore, if they cannot, we cannot.  IFS 2020 is about expanding the sector by 30% or between 35,000 and 45,000 by the end of 2019 and I anticipate that we will surpass that.</p><p> The Deputy asked about the quality of jobs.  We have had inquiries from entities in every part of the financial services industry and in every part of the value chain in terms of jobs.  We will see high-end jobs coming into this country if we can manage to get a couple of big wins in particular areas where we currently do a bit of the infrastructure - a bit of the plumbing - but we do not do the front office.  If we can become a location for the front office, we will see a big gain with high-end jobs coming in, and not just to Dublin.  Certain companies that have offices in Kilkenny and Cork are increasingly moving high-end jobs outside Dublin into the regions because of the cost competitive advantage and because the workforce is there.  The Deputy knows all the reasons.  He knows the strong offering Cork has in IFS.  We will see high-quality jobs coming through.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has emphasised the regional dimension.  As he is well aware, there are many pressures in Dublin.  With Brexit, it is hoped that many jobs will come to Dublin in the financial services area.  The regions have a lot to offer.  The Chairman will make the case for Kilkenny.  I and others will make the case for Cork with the university we have, the tier 1 data connection, the airport, being very competitive in office accommodation costs and so on.  The Minister of State will be aware that Cork Chamber has done considerable work in its support for IFS 2020 and promoting Cork.  I wish to reinforce that.  I know the Minister of State has been there.  He should keep the regions centre stage in his assessment of where incoming investment and FS can go.  The regions have a huge amount to offer.  This is an opportunity that only comes once and we have to make the most of it.</p></speech>

As he will be aware, currently one third of Ireland's IFS jobs are outside Dublin, so there is already a strong offering.  IFS 2020 was developed with industry.  I am working with those in the industry on a weekly basis to ensure we are across everything we need to be across.  They have been incredibly helpful in terms of intelligence.  I have been unambiguous on this.  I think Cork should be the second city for international financial services.  When I was there recently on my second visit I said it was not for me to say that because those in Cork have done it themselves.  Organisations such as Cork Chamber, Connecting Cork and UCC are doing a fantastic amount of work to position Cork, which is a very exciting place.  As the Deputy said, this is potentially a once in a lifetime opportunity and we need to ensure we are completely across it.</p> <p>  Having said that, I have also been to Kilkenny.</p></speech>

I have been to Drogheda twice, I have been to Kilkenny, I have been to Cork twice and I have been to Kerry.  I will be in Galway in two weeks and I will be in Limerick the week after that.  It is very important to me because I believe there is a real opportunity to correct some of the things we have got wrong in the past such as our strategic development in certain industries.</p> <p>  Certain very exciting things are happening.  I hope the Chairman does not mind me mentioning State Street which has a very strong presence in Kilkenny.  It is involved in the joint action committee I have with IFS 2020.  It is also doing great work down in Cork.  Such companies are making a very strong contribution to the country and what the Government can achieve, and a very strong contribution to places like Kilkenny.  It has a great workforce there.  Its workers are getting the benefit of living in a location like Kilkenny and not suffering some of the problems we have in Dublin.</p></speech>

I asked earlier about the engagement of friendly vulture funds with the banks.  Could the Department not be proactive about that?  I know the Minister of State has got some information from his officials on the setting up of that fund and perhaps on the use of Government bonds to progress the notion of taking these bad debts from the bank and allowing them work out, similar to the business one.</p></speech>

The same applies to Ulster Bank on the commercial decisions it made around the global fund.

The Central Bank does not place enough emphasis on that area.  I would like to see the Central Bank highlight its role in protection.</p> <p>  Vote 8 relates to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  As the Department of Finance is responsible for the policy relating to the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts, it should extend the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General to ensure he can track the money, where necessary, down to the point where it is spent.  As the Minister of State is a former member of the Committee of Public Accounts, he will know there are roadblocks on the way to achieving real transparency and accountability.  I would like to see a policy shift to provide powers to the Comptroller and Auditor General to give greater accountability.  That would apply to Irish Water if it continues to exist.</p></speech>

We experienced frustration with issues such as the Poolbeg incinerator where we could not get past how the local authority spent that money.  Unfortunately, a former Member from the Chairman's constituency and a member of my party was not of the view that that was the correct approach.  I remember debating the Bill in the D&aacute;il.  I think we had the same position even though legislation was going through at the time.  I am not sure about the current position.  I have not discussed it with the Minister, Deputy Coveney.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.560" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jerry Grant" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017021500002#D00100"><p>Thank you.  I will try to give a fairly brief overview of what is a very substantial, strategic and long-term project for Irish Water and the country.  This project has a long provenance, it was first identified as a long-term requirement in 1996 when the strategic requirements for the eastern region, and particularly the greater Dublin area, were looked at.  It is useful to reflect on the history of water supplies in the region.  The Vartry scheme was first built in 1870 following an act of the British Parliament.  In its time is absolutely transformed public health in this city.  I think that the average life expectancy at the time was about 46 years and death from cholera and dysentery, especially child mortality, was huge.  That scheme was extraordinarily transformative in its time.  In the 1940s the ESB built the Poolaphouca impoundment; at the time it was built not only for hydroelectric but with provision for further water supplies for Dublin.  It provided the basis for development of the region for the period since then.  Today the big water treatment plants at Ballymore Eustace and and Leixlip abstract 40% of the total flow in the River Liffey for the greater Dublin area, which is quite an extraordinary level of abstraction, and frankly at the limit of what is sustainable.  Currently, Vartry needs &euro;150 million to bring it up to modern standards, both in terms of treatment and integrity.  A huge amount of money is being invested in the Dublin system and in the eastern region system, but the reality is that within ten years there will be a shortage and that shortage has to be met with a big decision to provide a new major water supply for the region.  </p> <p>  On the approach that is being taken, in the short term for the next ten years, there is about 8% headroom in the Liffey schemes which is very tight in the context of a growing region with a strong economic growth again.  We will need to save substantial water from leakage which will take a massive effort given the types of pipework that we have and the age of much of it - there is about 2,000 km of old cast iron and a lot of very poor more modern pipe, especially cement and PVC.  There will be a huge effort by Irish Water in recovering leakage year on year over the next ten years to ensure that we do not have a problem until we can develop a new major source.  For the long term, after years of investigation and four rounds of non-statutory public consultation, we have arrived at the view that a scheme based on the River Shannon, abstracting from Parteen basin, is the most sustainable long-term solution and will provide for the needs of the eastern and midland regions of the country long into the future. </p> <p>  A new supply clearly gives us the capacity to have sustainable water capacity in the entire region which caters for 40% of the national population.  That overall supply will then be resilient for things such as climate effects, changes in summer rainfall and so on, all of which are significant risks at the moment if we did nothing.  Obviously there is significant social and economic growth potential in the region, that includes both FDI and indigenous industry, all of which need a certainty of sustainable supplies.  Critically, it would give the region the kind of headroom or security against things going wrong such as the failure of a plant, the failure of a pipeline, pollution of a source or that the supply does not come down and cause a major difficulty.  On the consequences of failure, the economic assessments which we had carried out as part of the project indicated that a day of a shut-down in water supply to the Dublin region would cost a minimum of &euro;78 million in economic loss, but obviously reputational damage would impact on our ability to attract industry, for example, and indeed the confidence of the country would be severely shaken, so it is critically important that we ensure long-term supplies.</p> <p>  We have provided members with figures for population projections using median CSO predictions but extending them out to 2050.  Obviously, in a project like this, one looks well beyond the normal demographic projections because this is a project that will be multi-generational and therefore one has to look as far as one can into the future.  In that context we have projected an increase in the greater Dublin area of about 640,000 people and a further 160,000 people in the benefiting corridor across the midlands, which gives an idea of the kind of population requirement.  Obviously, that is matched by the potential commercial non-domestic demand and we have also factored in, in discussions with the IDA and others, a reasonable provision for strategic capacity and we recognise how critical that can be when it comes to multinational industries trying to decide between countries where water can be a determining factor. </p> <p>  There is a multiplicity of small schemes dotted around the region and over the next 20 years we will be looking to eliminate a great deal of those because many of them are unsustainable and many of them are poor quantity sources or indeed sources that are vulnerable to pollution where it is very difficult for us to ensure the quality.  In time, we see the larger schemes gradually eliminating many of the smaller schemes as we aggregate them to bigger schemes and we can provide the kind of level of treatment that is considered appropriate nowadays. </p> <p>  On the solution, after looking at many options, I think there were ten significant options looked at in the beginning.  These were gradually narrowed down and eventually it came down to a choice between the River Shannon and desalination.  Ultimately, that decision came down, to a large extent, to both the benefits of the Shannon scheme, as an option, and the running cost.  The long-term economic cost of desalination is enormous by comparison.  The decision to transfer water from the Shannon basin to the eastern region had to be on the basis that the benefit to one community could not be at the expense of another, it could not be at the expense of the Shannon communities.  To prove that, we examined various options on the Shannon from Loughrea down to northern Lough Derg and ultimately ended up in Parteen basin on the basis of the storage and control which the ESB can exercise at that point.  It is possible to take water without any impact on either levels, in Lough Derg, because they are controlled within the normal operating regime that the ESB use, or indeed any loss of amenity benefit or ecological benefit because the water has already passed through the entire Shannon system.  That means that in developing a pipeline corridor from there to Peamount and the western side of Dublin where they would integrate to the Dublin network.  That pipeline evolved over a long period, again looking at options, marking out all of the things that needed to be considered, barriers such as the communities where people were living, woodland, conservation areas, mountains and so on.  This ultimately came down to a number of corridors and was gradually tightened down to a 1 km corridor and then to 200 m.</p> <p>  Members have been given an aerial view of the Ardnacrusha dam.  It shows the old river and dam which controls 10 m3/s which continually goes down the old river.  The balance of the flow which averages 170 m3/s goes down through Ardnacrusha and is used for generation.  The proposition is that to achieve full development of the scheme in 2050 would take up to 4 m3/s which reduces the amount of water going down through Ardnacrusha to 166 cubic meters and the 4 cubic meters would be diverted to water supply, so it is a very small proportion of the water that is currently used for power generation.  </p> <p>  On the pipeline, Mr. O'Sullivan can speak in more detail later about the discussions with individual landowners and the process by which we are engaging with the landowning community.  We had a broad corridor within which we are now settling on a 50 m wayleave; that is the construction width.  There is still tweaking going on with that in consultation with individual landowners.  That process will continue for another six weeks or so, and then, during the following months, we will have very detailed engagements around activities on farms and the impacts on the work with a view to coming up with proposals that we can address and compensation in each individual case.  We have had people on the ground for about 12 months, looking at the issues, agricultural and so on.  The starting position is to find the least impactive route and then to work on the impacts of that on people and communities.</p><p>The slide shows an English pipeline, which is the only long distance pipeline of this scale.  It demonstrates, broadly speaking, the kind of impact during construction which is significant.  It is a 50 m width.  The construction period at any particular section could be for 12 months but there is a significant recovery period as well while the land returns to full production.  The slide on our PowerPoint presentation shows land with a Bord G&aacute;is pipeline after it has been restored and has gone back to full productivity.  We are following the practice that Bord G&aacute;is developed well.  It came up with comprehensive codes of practice for the way the work should be done, particularly how it impacts on farms of different kinds of farming activity, drainage, groundwater management, final reinstatement and the quality of same.</p><p> Ms Claire Coleman can give the committee more detail on the pre-consultation processes.  This is the third round of intensive public non-statutory consultation as part of the process of eliciting the issues which need to be considered.  We have come to the end of that process.  Each time all of the submissions have been considered, we have responded to all of them.  They certainly played a significant part in the evolution of this project.  We hope to go for planning application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la at the back end of this year.  In that subsequent process, there will be a statutory public consultation process to which everybody will have access, and ultimately, to what will be a substantial oral hearing.  Assuming all that goes well and we have an approved scheme sometime in 2019, we hope to continue to develop the scheme with a view to construction between 2021 and 2024.</p><p> There is without question a significant deficit facing the region in the medium term unless we make provision for significant additional water resources.  It is a challenge previous generations had to face in the 1860s and the 1940s.  Due to the far-seeing projects put in place at those times, we have had the benefit of significant development, as well as social and economic progress.  We are now at a stage where we need another scheme on that scale to secure the future of the eastern and midlands region.  We are in the process of preparing a national water resources plan for the entire country.  This will be published in draft for public consultation at the back end of this year.  This particular area had much work done already and the scheme is being brought ahead.  We will be looking at long-term secure water supply provision and how it will fit in with the water framework directive and river basin management across the country.</p></speech>

This is significantly less than what Irish water had originally calculated.  What would be the impact of this usage deficit on this proposed Shannon scheme?</p> <p>  Mr. Grant also said this week that 765 million litres of water is lost a day through leakage, 45% of overall water production, and that Irish Water is making quite a headway in reducing this.  I assume that will happen in the future.  Has this been factored into the calculations for water needs in the greater Dublin area?</p> <p>  In addition, we have spoken about water-saving devices, and technology in this regard has moved on through good developments.  Could something be done in this area to reduce the need to create this massive development?  I have many concerns about this proposed scheme and we are hearing from communities around the country with regard to it.</p> <p>  Has any scoping exercise been done on the environmental impacts of such a large construction project?  Has the impact of climate change with regard to greenhouse gases and our obligations over the course of the development of this project been taken into account?</p> <p>  The Kennedy report refutes much of the information that Mr. Grant gave the committee today.  What are his views on this report and the concerns it has raised?</p> <p>  Has Irish Water considered the canals as a way of bringing water from the Shannon to Dublin?  It would not impact as much on the landowners along the way?  Has this been considered?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.564" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017021500002#E00400"><p>I thank Mr. Grant for his presentation.</p> <p>  This is probably one of the largest infrastructure projects in the history of the State.  It is probably in the top three in terms of its size and its cost.  It is important this committee scrutinises it in as much detail as possible.  I hope this is the first of a number of engagements in this regard.</p> <p>  There has been much debate around the accuracy of the projections of the future water needs of the Dublin water supply region, not only the city but the larger region.  I note that two of the early assessment reports in 2006 and 2010 had projections for 2015.  When we got to 2015, however, they were in fact greatly inflated because water usage in the city had plateaued by then.</p> <p>  I have read with great interest the back-and-forth between Irish Water and the Kennedy report authors contesting their figures.  I am not convinced the issues the authors of the Kennedy report raised have been fully answered.  I am particularly interested in Mr. Grant's responses to the concerns they have raised around the overestimation of the projected need of Dublin's water needs in the future.</p> <p>  Related to that, the population projections from Irish Water are based on the population and economic development of Dublin and the surrounding region on an as-is basis, namely, all other things remaining as they currently are.  We are in the middle, however, of the development of the national planning framework.  One of the issues the framework is trying to address is to come up with a Government policy which can start to reverse that trend away from the overconcentration in Dublin and its region to a more balanced regional development.  It seems to be premature for this project to fix on its population projections and move to an An Bord Plean&aacute;la application before the national planning framework is completed.  What is in that document when it is finalised could have significant consequences for Irish Water's planning application and population projection figures.  Would it not be more prudent, given that the framework will be ready in September, to wait for the outcome of that before Irish Water proceeds?</p> <p>  There is the same point with the river basin management plan.  This is meant to be ready by the end of the year.  Much good new work and research has been done by the Environmental Protection Agency's catchment management unit, which is directly relevant to the environmental impact of this project, as well as the contentious issue of groundwater and whether it could provide some additional capacity for Dublin.  The last report on groundwater in Dublin in 2008 was quite controversial.  It did not do much primary research itself into the availability of groundwater resources.  That information will be available when we have the river basin management plan and the EPA catchment management unit's survey.  Again, would it not be more prudent, given that this will be ready at the end of the year, to wait to factor it into this plan?</p> <p>  It is same again with the abstraction regulations required under the water framework directive.  I understand there is a working group in the Department looking at the extraction regulations.  This is a crucial part of the compliance with the relevant directive.  What level of engagement has Irish Water had with this working group?  Obviously, that is relevant to any extraction from Parteen weir.</p><p>I refer to the national water resources plan.  Part of the pitch in the presentation is the inclusion of this benefiting corridor, yet there is no plan in terms of the future water infrastructure in that area.  Would it not have been better to have that plan in place before a case is made regarding the benefiting corridor?</p><p> On leakage and water conservation, if the plan is agreed by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, is constructed and water starts pumping into Dublin, on the basis of Irish Water's figures 40% will be lost straight away.  I understand reducing the current 40% water loss to 20% takes a lot of time and money, but would it not make more sense to accelerate that process to the greatest possible extent so that if a pipeline project like this goes ahead, less than 40% of the water that is being pumped across the country is lost?</p><p> I know water conservation is not primarily the responsibility of Irish Water, rather of other Government agencies.  To what extent has there been a cross-departmental or inter-agency approach to try to have greater use of the water in Dublin in parallel to this project?</p><p> The only strategic environment assessment for this project was done in 2008, when the project was on a smaller scale.  I would like to know why a strategic environmental assessment is not being carried out for the larger project.  I also have a concern about the environmental impact assessment, or the lack thereof, for the benefiting corridor.  Can the delegation talk us through that?</p><p> I refer to Dublin Bay.  We know that the European Commission currently has enforcement proceedings against the State for failure to comply with the urban wastewater directive.  One of the areas of concern is Dublin Bay, where a significant amount of wastewater is being pumped into the bay.  In the discussions with the Commission and Irish Water or the Department on compliance with the urban wastewater directive, is the Commission fully aware of the increased volumes of wastewater that could be dispersed into Dublin Bay as a result of the increased level of water coming into the city and the region through this project?</p><p> In terms of tackling that issue, a chemical, orthophosphate, would be used in the Ringsend water treatment plant.  That has significant environmental impacts in terms of algae and large plants in the Dublin Bay region.  What environmental impact assessments of the consequences of that for a greater level of water going into Dublin Bay have been undertaken?</p><p> This is clearly an Irish Water project, but it is really a State project that affects not just Irish Water but the relevant local authorities, the Departments of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and the Environmental Protection Agency.  There have been high-level contacts in terms of directives.  I am interested in knowing the level of technical day-to-day or week-to-week engagement between the different agencies up until this point.  If this project goes ahead, what kind of management and inter-agency co-ordination would take place as the project is being implemented and once it is up and running into the future?</p></speech>

I will refer to the current Vartry project.  It is to be hoped lessons have been learned from that project in regard to public consultation.  In that case, we did not bring the public with us.  The public were not informed of the project and the impact it would have on the Vartry River.  The initial application did not contain an environmental impact statement which raised concerns.  A rearguard action was being fought from then on in terms of additional information and trying to acknowledge the views of the public.  The decision has now been appealed to the board.  It is regrettable that an agent of the State has appealed the decision to the board.  Irish Water did not bring along some of the State bodies in the consultation process.</p> <p>  Before we embark on an even bigger project than Vartry, has the delegation made ample provision for public consultation with landowners and those who will be affected by the project?  Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned the environmental impact statement.</p> <p>  Is Irish Water interacting with State bodies?  It is very disappointing to see a State body appealing the decision of Wicklow County Council regarding the Vartry reservoir.  Proper consultation was not carried out with Inland Fisheries on the project.  Its views were not taken into consideration and solutions were not proposed to deal with them, and it appealed the decision.</p></speech>

Many of our questions have been alluded to by previous speakers.</p> <p>  In recent weeks and months, many people have come to this debate who had not engaged with the issue previously, many of whom live in the vicinity of the area which the pipeline transverses.  Needs must on their part.  Irish Water briefly outlined the process, which involved four different stages of consultation during the discussions around the various routes that had been proposed until it arrived at the preferred route option.</p> <p>  As Deputy &Oacute; Broin acknowledged and referred to, much of the guiding factors, background and relevant scientific information that led Irish Water to arrive at the preferred route was based on information and reports that date back to 2006 and so forth.  From some of the engagement I have had with landowners and communities who believe they will be impacted, perhaps in a negative way, it is a case of the consultation needing to be such that people are properly engaged, informed and allowed to make a more informed decision than is currently the case.</p> <p>  It would be no harm if, for example, Irish Water could produce a document that gave a brief synopsis of the process to date, including where it was initiated, its current status, how it arrived at its current status and where it can go.  </p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin also referred to the infamous Kennedy report.  I am led to believe that Irish Water is meeting the authors or their representatives in the coming weeks.  It would be no harm to produce a document highlighting Irish Water's response to what is contained in the report in order for people to easily ascertain the issues that are being communicated to them, how Irish Water has responded to them, how it will respond and how their fears can be allayed.</p> <p>  I wish to elaborate on some of the points made by Irish Water.  We acknowledge the significance of the project and the benefits that will accrue to Dublin and the greater midlands area.  Irish Water has gone through a process and will go through another to devise a national water framework to ensure the resource is available to all regions and to allow all regions to realise that potential and not be hamstrung by deficiencies regarding the provision of water services.  We need to be sure at this juncture that sufficient resources are available to other regions so that they can, where necessary, be able to attract investment from an industrial and residential perspective in terms of their potential.</p> <p>  Costs have been disputed at various meetings I have attended.  I have heard a figure of &euro;1.2 billion mentioned.  In previous discussions I had with Irish Water figure of &euro;850 million and &euro;950 million were mentioned.  Have the costs remained consistent with the original projections?</p> <p>  I hope that in the other documentation Irish Water produces it will identify routes that were explored and the reasons they did not meet with approval following the processes and procedures involved.  People have mentioned canals and railway lines to me.  </p> <p>  In my constituency, Bord na M&oacute;na had a fine proposal to have a storage facility at Cloneyhurke which had the potential to attract investment to the area in terms of watersports, activities and so forth, which I would have welcomed, enjoyed and been in a position to expand and explore.  That community needs to be re-appraised in terms of the conclusions that were arrived at and why the State's capital investment is for the betterment of the entire region rather than any individual area.</p><p>If the documentation about the entire process is easily accessed and understood, it will help.  What stage is Irish Water at in respect of consultation with landowners?  Has expertise been engaged?  Is independent expertise available to landowners to enable them to make an informed decision before they eventually sign agreements?  There is much fear and trepidation on the part of some at public meetings I have attended regarding backfill and reinstatement of the land.  Any dichotomy on the land of dairy farmers would have a greater effect than on other types of farming activity.  Have Irish Water officials examined the different farm holdings and activities on the land and scaled them into priorities thereafter?</p><p> There will be greater emphasis when it comes to the planning application on environmental impact issues.  Studies will have to be carried out and will have to be available during the planning process for people to scrutinise, comment on and object to or support.  Each local authority along the route will have an opportunity, as is the norm, to make a submission to An Bord Plean&aacute;la based on consultation with the elected representatives, management and the expertise available to them.  Each of them has a development plan, which may be impacted, and that will need to be highlighted.  Councillors also need to be fully informed and briefed in order that they can play the role expected of them by their constituents in so far as they can protect their development plans or amend them accordingly if there is a benefit to doing so.</p></speech>

If it is not included, it would be a huge disaster for the project.  I was involved in a previous life as a Minister of State is setting up this wonderful body called Irish Water, for which I have suffered greatly.  Apart from losing my job for telling the truth, which is something that should not happen to a good politician like me, the biggest issue in setting up the organisation, which was completely ignored and which I repeated <i>ad nauseam</i>, at high and low level meetings, was public engagement.  This is being raised again in this context.  The key to this project is to sell it to the people on economic grounds, the benefit to the local community in terms of jobs, and the augmentation of the water supply for the towns between the source and Dublin.</p><p>Nationally, we do not have enough water and Dublin will not be able to deal with a significant disruption of supply or increase in demand after 2022.  This is one of the most important projects in the history of the State.  I acknowledge the comments of local Deputies.  Every farmer, GAA club, community and individual must be aware of, and buy into, the project.  There are economic issues in the context of farmers being disadvantaged with disruption to their everyday activity and land not being reinstated in a proper and acceptable condition.  However, the key to this project is the social and economic benefit to communities on the route beginning with the location of the source of the water.  It must be ensured there is an immediate, significant community benefit by increasing community services, and resources for schools and local health centres.  Irish Water needs a plan to sell this to the people because it is so important to get it right and to get them to buy into it.  That is what I wanted when Irish Water was being established in order that people understood what the benefits would be at the end of the day, but this was absent.</p><p>The key element of this project was put forward by Dublin City Council, which was the Bord na Mona proposal regarding Garryhinch.  This would be a strategic reservoir which could supply the city of Dublin for a minimum period of six months uninterrupted.  If all other supplies shut down, Garryhinch could supply water for a significant period.  If there is a significant interruption to the Dublin water supply, how will Irish Water deal with it if Garryhinch is not included?  I visited the site, which covers a huge area.  The issue was properly lining the site to ensure no issue with THMs in order that the water was safe.  It would be a magnificent reservoir should anything happen in the future.  We do not know what will happen to the country in the future but Garryhinch would guarantee supply to Dublin, Wicklow, Kildare, Louth and so on.  All these counties would benefit from the security of supply and inward investment.  The high-tech jobs in Leixlip would be guaranteed forever and it would create the capacity to create more jobs.</p><p>I visited Anglian Water in England, which has reservoirs similar to the proposed reservoir at Garryhinch, although I acknowledge there is different geology and so on.  A total of 1 million people have visited the reservoirs in England.  The Chairman should visit them because they are strategic to the water supply for the area.  The tourism spin off is magnificent, including hotels and so on.  I spoke to other Deputies, including Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy, about how important such a project would be because it would transform the local economy in terms of tourism and employment.  A bog could become the largest lake in Europe for recreational fishing.  It would have huge advantages.</p><p>I hope everyone will forgive my enthusiasm for the project and my cynicism about the way I was treated, which is a matter for other fora.  I am committed to this project but if Garryhinch is not included, I would like a clear explanation.  If not, can it be reconsidered?  It would provide long-term security.  I do not know where the abstraction for the water supply is now because it may have changed and I am not involved anymore.  The key is local people must buy into this.  They must want it and they must shout for it because the benefit to them will so big in terms of employment and community.  If the project is sold properly, they will want it because it will be hugely beneficial to them.</p></speech>

I represent the constituency where the abstraction is due to take place.  There is considerable unease among the public regarding the pipeline.  I will not repeat the points raised by colleagues but consultation to bring the public onside and to outline what the end product will be and what impact it will have on communities is essential.  Smaller projects in other parts of the country have caused significant disturbance.  People along this route have the experience of the recently built motorway.</p><p>Many farmers suffered greatly because of the motorway and now, when they see another major infrastructural project happening, they are asking why they are being affected again.  The motorway impacted on the profession of dairy farmers along the route for three to five years and it caused serious disruption, and now they are facing the same scenario again.  These individual landowners are hugely resentful.  Another major issue is where landowners are unfortunate enough to suffer sterilisation of sites which would have been suitable for family members to build on.  Some landowners have limited road frontage and they may lose it because of the route of the pipeline.  They would like to see family members building houses near the family home.  Points are made about the impact the project may have on underground water sources.  Will the project impact on activities?</p><p> Many local issues arise and, as has been said by previous speakers, they all need to be addressed and serious consultation is required.  At present, there is significant resistance to the project at local level.  Education and consultation could sort out many of the issues.  Why were other options overruled?  Why was this option picked?  There must be education to show this is the best and cheapest option which will benefit the infrastructure.  Reference has been made to the Kennedy report.  Objectors point to the committee report, which states that better and cheaper options are available.  We are a long way from having the public on side in my constituency and getting the public on side is paramount to the success of the project.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.574" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jerry Grant" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017021500002#H00200"><p>Many very good questions have been asked and they cover what is at the heart of a project being successful in the planning process.  This is a massive project.  As Deputy &Oacute; Broin stated, it is the third biggest project in the history of the State.  By virtue of this, we cannot rush it and we must be very sensitive to the fact we are looking for a broad societal benefit which could be at the expense of communities.  We must evaluate this very carefully, and this is the point of the environmental impact process, the planning process and the consultation process.  I am hugely aware of this.  I am also acutely aware of the impact on individual farms and farm families, because a large trench is dug for a year or two and there is a recovery period.  All this must be factored in.<br/><br/>With regard to consultation and when reports were published, this has been under discussion for 20 years, and seriously so for the past 12 or 14 years.  At one stage, economic growth was such that it looked like we would need it sooner in Dublin and we were asked to have it for 2021.  I am very glad we do not need to have it for 2021 because we would not be able to get it for then.  We cannot rush a project like this.  Other plans, and the development of national plans, must be considered because a project such as this transcends a number of plans.  Between starting and finishing, along the way it will have to be able to adapt to spatial planning, river basin planning and many other issues.  We certainly have tried to do this.<br/><br/>Senator Grace O'Sullivan asked about <i>per capita </i>demand and it is exactly as she said.  With metering information and knowledge on <i>per capita</i>usage and household usage we were able to revisit the <i>per capita</i>figures.  Quite frankly, this has bought us at least three years in terms of having to bring forward the project because between leakage savings and the reality of the demand figures, we will have until the mid-2020s before we reach a point when, in my view, the risk becomes critical for the country.  Previously, it looked like it would be earlier than this.<br/><br/>When we look at the leakage question, the reality is that nationally approximately 765 million litres are lost in leakage.  In the greater Dublin area the figure is probably approximately 300 million litres.  Addressing this is a massive project.  People speak about leakage being recoverable but we never beat leakage.  All we can do is address and attack it.  We must replace 2,000 km of old cast iron pipes in the city.  If we were to do this over ten years we would paralyse the city.  It would be like having the Luas works continuously for ten years, and this would only replace cast iron pipes and would not deal with the leaks in the service connections or the PVC pipes.  We have a lot of very poor pipes and over the past 40 years connections have been rusting.  We will address leakage.  We have committed to taking out approximately 70 million litres of leakage between now and 2021 and we will need to do so to meet the needs of the region.<br/><br/>It comes down to the question of risk.  I will return to a question from Deputy &Oacute; Broin on planning and where it happens.  Our job is to ensure there is enough water in every region to support the planning objectives of each region.  It is not to dictate planning.  If we do not have enough water in Dublin it would have an impact for sure, but this is not the way in which anyone, politician or engineer, would want to plan the country.  Therefore, our job is to ensure that in the furtherance of supporting proper spatial planning water is available as required.  There must be an element of speculative provision.  Foreign direct investment and the development of our indigenous agrifood industry are crucially dependent on drinking water.  There are many parts of the world where water on this scale would not be able to be mobilised in the public good and the common good.  There are factors with regard to risk.<br/><br/>The report from Emma Kennedy and other reports have been referenced.  We have published responses and will publish fully comprehensive responses to all the points raised because they are very important.  They seek to examine getting the maximum out of the Liffey to combine with maximum demand on any given day.  If we do this we will fail.  It is absolutely guaranteed to fail.  Even as late as last December, because we had a very dry autumn period, we were close to having to look at having to conserve water because of where the Poulaphouca reservoir was at.  The Vartry was also very low last autumn.  It is absolutely critical that we are realistic about the water in the Liffey.  As we bring forward projects such as the river basin plans under the water framework directive, the likelihood is there is a real risk we will be asked to reduce the abstraction from the Liffey, particularly if climate change has the effect predicted.  If this were to happen we would be in real trouble.<br/><br/>One of the considerations any first world country has in a city region is multiple supplies.  It is very risky to have all our eggs in one basket, and the fact we take 40% of all the water in the Liffey for the greater Dublin area is a huge risk.  Taking all these issues into account, it would be very imprudent in my opinion not to plan and deliver this project within a reasonable timeframe, but this must take regard of all the considerations discussed.<br/><br/>With regard to greenhouse gases and energy, transferring water from the Shannon to Dublin involves a significant energy component, but it is much less than desalination.  This particular pipeline has been optimised in a way I did not think was possible.  The water is being pumped to Cloughjordan on the Tipperary and Offaly border and it can flow by gravity from there to Dublin, with offtakes for the various communities along the way.  It is very efficient from an energy perspective, compared with the other pipeline options we examined.<br/><br/>I was very attracted to the Garryhinch option, and I thought it was real runner on the basis water could be taken from north Lough Derg and we could stop taking it out during low summer flow periods, but difficulties arose when we did a detailed investigation.  We would need much more storage in Garryhinch than we thought because the ecological modelling of Lough Derg, which has a very sensitive ecosystem, suggested to us we could not be sure there would not be an impact if we did not have four, five or even six months storage.  The detailed geotechnical investigations showed the cost of the Garryhinch reservoir would be much higher.  In the end, Parteen basin, which is at the Ardnacrusha dam, was a much more secure option from an environmental point of view.  Effectively, water would be taken at the back of the dam, so it would have come right through the lake and the lake and its ecosystem would have benefited from the water and there would be minimal risk of environmental impact.  A huge number of environmental studies are still being done.<br/><br/>To answer Deputy &Oacute; Broin's question, a strategic environmental assessment was conducted on this project specifically.  We also conducted a strategic environmental assessment on the 25 year water services strategic plan, which specifically references this project.</p><p>All of our plans and programmes have strategic environmental assessments, SEAs and all of them, in so far as we can, are integrated.  I would love if we could have an overall national water resources plan within the timeframe to cover everything but, frankly, that is in itself a massive piece of work.  I am very cognisant of where there is adequate water.  Places like Limerick, Galway and Cork are well supplied but in other parts of the country such as the north east, Deputy O'Dowd's territory, we need to upgrade the treatment plants.  They are okay for the moment but the Boyne is a very limited river because it has been drained.  Therefore, there is a need on this side of the country to have a strategic capacity in order that one can respond to changes over time in terms of development.</p><p> A question was asked about the loads on Dublin Bay.  Our job is to provide the drinking water and to provide the wastewater treatment to the required standard.  The urban wastewater treatment directive requires us to remove phosphorus and nitrogen from Ringsend and we have a project to do that.  We are increasing the capacity of Ringsend from 1.65 million to 2.4 million population equivalent.  The use of orthophosphate is a different thing, which is to deal with lead in drinking water.  That has to be factored into how much phosphorus we take out so that we do not have an adverse impact on Dublin Bay.</p><p> In terms of the river basin planning process, we are very much in touch with that and we are very much part of the process of consultation and engagement in how those plans are being developed.  What we do on the wastewater side and what we do on the abstraction side is very much part of that.  We have been in discussions with the Department around the evolving implementation of abstraction regulation.  At the moment, we have to work within the context of existing legislation, which is the 1964 Act, with the ESB and if there are any changes to that we will take them on board as we proceed to planning.</p><p> I will ask Ms Coleman to respond to the question about the environmental impact statement and how it is being scoped.  In terms of the overall governance of the project, this project has been through four rounds of non-statutory public consultation, which has had very intensive engagement with communities, individuals, and all manner of interested groups but also directly with local authorities.  We have been in the chambers in Tipperary and Offaly.  We have been talking with the chief executives of those counties and directors of services.  We have been very open.  Deputy Cowen made a good point, namely, that when one is talking about broad options people who are impacted locally do not engage, so no matter how many rounds of consultation one has, until one comes down to a specific route and a specific pipe one does not know the people who are going to be directly affected.  I can fully understand that we now need to go back to those people and show them what has been done in terms of the broader options.  I will not go into the issues here as there is a massive amount of work involved.  Deputy Cowen asked that we might look at the process we have been through and document it.  It would be very valuable to remind people of all the steps and to be able to reference back to the various studies, among other things.</p><p> I accept Deputy Casey's point about the Vartry river.  We probably underestimated what we were doing there.  We were going in to put a treatment plant in an existing plant and we did not see ourselves impacting on the Vartry flow and we still do not intend to impact on it.  The leakage from the old filters was travailing it and I think it is possible to compensate for that and still have a workable water supply.  Perhaps we did drop the ball.  If we did, we are talking to Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, and to various others.  There is of course a competition for how much water we can trade with the Vartry river because anything we give to the Vartry river we lose for Dublin, and more particularly for Wicklow now, because very little of that water reaches Dublin anymore.  I accept the point that we have an obligation to engage and consult with State bodies and local authorities and to try to cover as much as we possibly can.</p><p> In response to Deputy Cowen, I will ask Mr. O'Sullivan to speak about the approach to individual landowners and how that process is being conducted.  The environmental impact statement, EIS, process is really only happening this year.  Ms Coleman can talk about the scoping of it, but that is a very big piece of work which has to look at every issue.  Someone mentioned groundwater effects, such as how it affects local wells, and how it might affect aquifers.  Groundwater is frequently referenced as a potential source of water but the experience in this part of the country in particular and, generally in Ireland, is very poor apart from small volume capacities.  Any attempt to abstract from the Kildare aquifers would be met by immediate local opposition on environmental grounds.  People might remember the Pollardstown Fen in respect of the motorway project where a massive amount had to be spent to try to protect against any drop in water level.  Scientifically, one is just not going to get any appreciable amount.  Certainly groundwater is very useful and probably needed for local needs anyway.  I refer to agricultural needs in this part of the country and horticulture for example.  There was thought to be a lot of water on the Fingal-Meath border and a lot of investigation went into it but very few sustainable yields were proven.  One will get locally useful supplies but one will not solve the problem of the Dublin area in that regard.</p><p> The onus on us now is to engage openly and as much as we possibly can with communities and individuals who are directly affected by the proposal, which is now the preferred option on the table.  We are only in the early stages of that and I give an assurance that we will make ourselves available and talk not just to individual farmers and communities but also representative bodies until we are satisfied that we have convinced people to the maximum extent possible.  The prize is enormous as well and the risk of not developing the scheme is that we will run into shortages of water, whether that happens in 2024, 2025 or 2026, and we will get to the point where it will not be possible to cater for development in this region.  In terms of the midland region, the Mullingar scheme is dependent on Lough Owel, which we share with Waterways Ireland.  At the moment we are not able to meet the requirements of Waterways Ireland and Irish Water and we need to get additional supplies for the Mullingar scheme.  I invite Mr. O'Sullivan to refer to the issue concerning farmers.</p></speech>

It is also hugely important to us.  The model we are adopting is one that has been very successfully employed on the other side of our organisation, namely, gas networks, where over the past 30 to 40 years we have put in place nearly 2,500 km of gas infrastructural transmission pipeline crisscrossing this country.  Through that process we have engaged with approximately 6,000 landowners.  We have a very good model <i>in situ</i>in this organisation in terms of how we do consultation and engagement.  As Mr. Grant outlined, we are in a consultation process at the moment.  This is the fourth leg of the consultation process.  This particular exercise has involved very extensive consultation in terms of open information evenings, of which we had eight in total, spread across the pipeline route.  We had six landowner information evenings.  Of the 500 landowners impacted across the 170 km we had a turnout of approximately 350 landowners at the information evenings.  We are now actively engaging on an individual basis with the landowners who did not turn up to get their feedback and input into the process.  We are in the middle of that process.<br/><br/>We have land liaison officers on the ground working individually with each particular landowner looking at the local issues associated with the 200 m preferred pipeline route.  What we will do in the coming months is take on board the issues and concerns they have raised and, to the maximum extent possible, take them into consideration in the context of coming up with the final design for this pipeline option.  Consultation is very important to us.  It is how we operate as an organisation.  We have successfully done it previously in respect of the gas networks infrastructure and we are taking that model and implementing it in the context of the consultation processes here.  All of the Deputies are correct that it is really important that we get the consultation right.  We are certainly not rushing in terms of the consultation process.  It is really important to us that we get all of the views and opinions of landowners and other stakeholders and take them on board so that ultimately when we go into the planning process all of the stakeholders are on board in terms of what we are trying to achieve.</p></speech>

I am open to being convinced about the worthiness of this project.  I am not against it in principle.  I know from talking to senior water managers in South Dublin County Council, the local authority in which I live, that there is a need for additional capacity and diversification.  I do not dispute any of those things.  The issues are as follows.  What is the level of that need?  What is the most appropriate source or sources of that diversification?  I accept the arguments that the move from Louth Derg to Parteen deals with many of the environmental concerns about an impact on ecosystems and the River Shannon.  </p> <p>  The Kennedy report, whatever about the motivations of the people who wrote it, raises important questions.  I have read the Irish Water documentation, the Kennedy report and the various exchanges since.  Many questions asked by the authors of the report have not been answered and they have not been answered here today.  Members of this committee would like to hear the answers.  I shall repeat some of the questions again because they are important. </p> <p>  I do not dispute that there is an additional water need.  In the 2006 report it was projected that Dublin would need 665 million litres per day in 2015.  In the 2010 report the projection was downsized to 573 million litres per day.  In 2015, the real water requirement was 540 million litres per day.  Obviously we must project forward.  If these figures are correct then how can we be sure that projections into the future will not have the same differential?  That is an important point, regardless of source.  Likewise, the methods for calculating the projected need have gone through various changes.  One has the Tobin report, the Indecon report and Irish Water's methodology for calculating.  Why are different methodologies chosen?  How do different methodologies affect the projected level of need?</p> <p>  Mr. Grant cited the national planning framework and his answer is insufficient.  The framework will be the master strategic planning framework for the State for the next number of years.  Therefore, it will be the high level document within which any major and minor infrastructural project must take account.  The Minister has told us that he wants to reverse a particular demographic, social, economic and infrastructural trend with this plan.  Some of us are worried that the current proposal by Irish Water will go ahead before the plan is agreed and put on a statutory footing.  One might have pipe-led development.  It means, irrespective of the Government's plan and many of us hope that we will be able to sign up to it if it is a good one, the proposal may run counter to it and, therefore, may be a drag against what many of us want to see, namely, more balanced regional development.  We should take cognisance of the plan.  I would like to know, specifically, how Irish Water thinks it is appropriate to move to planning permission before we know what is contained in the national planning framework.  </p> <p>  I shall not repeat all of the points in terms of the other plans.  I shall comment on the river basin management plan, and my view is also relevant to groundwater.  My understanding is, and please correct me if I am wrong, we do not know what the level of groundwater in the area surrounding the Dublin water supply region is because there is no data available.  That data is being collected by the EPA in the most comprehensive form to date.  Having that information would definitively let us know whether there are groundwater supplies that could be used, irrespective of the issues of opposition or otherwise.  Surely knowing that information would be better because the only report that we have dates from 2008 and there are significant problems with same.</p> <p>  Not all of my questions were answered.  On Dublin Bay and the environmental impact of the increased wastewater issues, has the increased volumes of wastewater that this project would bring into Dublin Bay been discussed with the European Commission in the context of the current infringement proceedings under the urban wastewater directive?  If not, why not?  Should such a matter not be discussed?  This matter is of direct relevance to whether the European Commission will be satisfied that what is being done in Ringsend, which is good, will tackle the problem.</p> <p>  Mr. Grant mentioned that the strategic environment assessment is referenced in a broader SEA.  There is no SEA for this project.  Why?  What will it cost?  How long will it take?  </p> <p>  In terms of the engagements on the river basin management plan and abstraction regulations, who is meeting whom?  How often do they meet?  Are they meetings of a technical nature? Are they just high level update meetings?  Such information would enable us to understand the extent to which those two very important pieces of work feed into the detail of the plan by Irish Water.</p></speech>

There is no way any of the other rivers or sources of water, groundwater or otherwise, can meet the demand for water in Dublin.</p> <p>  I can be corrected on the exact location of the following.  Due to a major supply going into Dublin and a geological fault in the rock, and theoretically it could happen tomorrow or in 1,000 years, there could be a major significant interruption in supply to the greater Dublin area.  All of this is due to an accident of geology.  Is that a fact?  It is a fact that the water supply at this moment is very precarious. </p> <p>  A company called Intel spent &euro;13 million augmenting the water supply in Kildare a couple of years ago.  There is no solution that does not involve increasing and augmenting the water supply in Dublin.  There is no solution that meets the risks, potential or otherwise.  There is no solution that meets the demand for the greater Dublin area for economic development.  There is no solution to saying we have a huge supply of water in Ireland but in the wrong place.  That is the question that Deputy &Oacute; Broin raised in terms of regional development.  Mr. Grant is quite right that it is a huge prize for Ireland if we augment our water supply and locate it where it will be needed.  That is my honest opinion too.  We just have to concentrate on this aspect.  </p> <p>  I am disappointed in one sense with what Mr. Grant has said but understand that he represents Irish Water.  One must go beyond the legalities, planning permissions and reach out to communities in a bigger and greater way.  There is no advantage that does not include communities buying into this project 100%.  That is the only way because otherwise this project will not succeed.  It will be delayed and fought over.  There will be protracted legal cases.  That is the gap. </p> <p>  I have always been impressed with Mr. Grant.  He is one of the few officials from Irish Water that has impressed me.  He has an amazing encyclopaedic knowledge of these matters.</p> <p>  In terms of the non-Garryhinch proposals of Irish Water, how many days of water supply to serve Dublin is stated in the proposals right now?  What is the name of the current reservoir?  </p></speech>

When Garryhinch existed there was a six-month reserve of water for the whole of Dublin.  In other words, there was a reservoir that could hold a six-month supply.  That is what I was told.  Mr. Grant is shaking his head but I have the documents that were given to me in my office.  If supply was interrupted one had a six-month supply in the reservoir to feed Dublin.</p></speech>

I know it is now not going to happen, but the economic model or cost-benefit analysis did not include the social benefits, the employment benefits, the huge potential of the whole plan.  I am concerned about it.  I know the costs have gone down significantly compared to costs I looked at, but what is happening now is very regrettable.</p><p> Mr. Grant spoke about the timeline being extended out.  I do not think we can afford that time.  If there is such a small headway in terms of supply and demand, and if the project is pushed back to the mid-2020s or 2025, there is going to be a crisis before that time.</p></speech>

Peat extraction is nearing an end, and the Garryhinch option would have offered an alternative, beneficial use for the site.  I acknowledge what has been said about the benefit to the ecosystem and wider environmental surroundings of Lough Derg from the Parteen basin alternative.  I am sure there is merit in that, but these are questions that will ultimately be decided on by the board in arriving at their final decision.  In the event of not granting I am sure they would make recommendations and conditions associated with other options that had been considered.</p> <p>  I think Deputy &Oacute; Broin is receiving representations from many of my own constituents who have questions relating to the Kennedy report.  I am aware that the witnesses are meeting with those associated with that report in the coming weeks.  I would ask them to provide the members of this committee, and members of the local authorities, with a synopsis of that meeting, details of the points raised by the Kennedy report, the response and the conclusions.</p> <p>  In the event of a citizen not being happy even at that stage, what is their recourse to challenge the decision on a preferred route?  Is it solely open to them to submit their objections to the planning application when it is made to An Bord Plean&aacute;la?  Is it only a judicial review that can halt the process at present?  That needs to be clarified for people who may still have a difficulty with the route and its selection, and wish to challenge that in the future.</p></speech>

That was to go until 2025.  Three years of that contract have now elapsed.  The talk is that Irish Water are now contracting out work, and that the SLAs with local authorities will be shortened.  It seems that Irish Water hope that the SLAs will not go until 2025, as they are saying that in the next four or five years all their work with local authorities will be finished.  Clarification on this issue is so important.  I am a firm believer that if one gives work, one gives work locally.  If one contracts work, one contracts work locally.  I have massive concerns on that issue, particularly concerning the local authorities.  In my own area there are maybe 50 people who are now working with Irish Water through the local authority.  What will happen if Irish Water decides that it is going to come out of the SLA quicker?  What will happen to those jobs, and what is the long-term picture?</p> <p>  There is a lot of confusion about water meters.  It now seems that if one has a leak inside one's own premises, one is responsible for that.  This it is something that I want Irish Water to come back on.  There is a lot of confusion on this issue.  Local authorities are fixing leaks in local authority housing estates, but will not do so for private estates.  Maybe that could be clarified.</p></speech>

This is the first time in its history it has not filled over the winter.  We are now in mid-February and it is still almost empty.  The impact of that will not be felt until later on this year; the springs around it are only filling up with the water that is there.  There is no doubt there is a need for a new supply for Dublin.  This is one of the infrastructural projects that we will look back on in time.  It will be talked about like equally critical pieces of infrastructure such as the Vartry reservoir, built in the 1860s, and Poulaphouca reservoir, which flooded a whole village in the 1940s.  Public consultation is key to the success of this project.  As was said, it is only when a project has a direct impact on somebody that awareness of it is raised.  If anything is to be learned from the Vartry project, it is that it was not until there was a direct impact on them that the community raised awareness that two-thirds of the water flow could have been reduced into the Vartry.  This is an exciting project.  It is a project that the country needs to secure a water supply now and into the future.  I am supportive of it, but we must directly consult communities about it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.605" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jerry Grant" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017021500002#L01300"><p>There is a very fundamental point around need.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin referred to requiring 545 million litres a day in 2015 .  That is the average demand on a given day.  There is no peak in that; there is no headroom in that.  Any city or country region would have a peak factor of 15% on demand for a dry period.  Headroom means the risk around either demand or supply.</p><p>If an industry requires additional water supply because of demand or because of a supply-side issue such as a pollution incident at Vartry or Poulaphouca involving chemicals and so on we have no margin.  In terms of forward planning, these are the factors that are missed in many of the reports that have been submitted to us.  They are factors which a water utility is acutely aware of.  It is possible for a customer to determine water demand and need every day but if a water utility tries to operate on that basis, it will fail.  The day it fails it lets everybody down.  </p><p> In regard to the methods of calculation of demographic projections, once we start to talk about a timeframe of 40 years we move beyond the realm of CSO data and normal planning but that is the reality of a project like this.  In this regard we are looking to 2050.  While projections might be out by a factor of a few percentage points in the long run, it does not make any difference because the scheme is necessary.  To pair down a scheme on the basis of a tighter projection makes no economic sense because the marginal cost of an extra couple of inches on a pipeline diameter makes so much sense.  In the context of the national planning framework, there is nothing that has been said so far in the scoping document that suggests that the broad growth projections about which we are speaking will not repeat and continue.  If the numbers that we have rolled out, which are median projections, are to hold it will require balanced regional development because the possibility is that they could be higher if some of the previous patterns repeated.  </p><p> I agree that there should not be pipeline-led planning.  However, if the desire is to avoid that and to still allow the water supply to be a determinant, then one is inviting failure.  In other words, if provision is based purely on what one would like to happen and something else happens, then the water supply fails.  As a country, we cannot afford that.</p><p> As well as being involved in the business of running Irish Water, I meet industrialists and other clients.  There is an amazing amount of focus on water supply and sustainable water supply by international industries because it is such a problem in so many parts of Europe, Asia and the United States.  We take it for granted.  I do not want to be emotional about this but simple sums will not address this issue.  We must address the risks around 10 years' time, 20 years' time and 30 years' time.  This is about future generations.  The requirement in 2025 might only be 10 million litres on a typical day but it is 10 million litres we do not have right now.  Given our leakage figures, we will be very hard pressed to achieve the targets set out, although they are more aggressive than what has been achieved in Scotland.  Very few of the English and Welsh water companies reach the pace of recovery of leakage.  Irish Water has been very aggressive in that regard.  </p><p> On the river basin planning process and groundwater issue, a huge amount of study has been done on groundwater in the eastern region, all of which states that while it is locally useful there is no major strategic source available of the scale required.  Much of the work that is currently being done by the EPA on this issue is around vulnerability to pollution and management of the water environment.  For example, the Kildare aquifers are part and parcel of the groundwater recharge of the River Liffey.  That is where the groundwater summer flow comes from.  Interference with the groundwater causes interference with the River Liffey base-flow.  We are finely balanced in terms of water resources in this region.  There is no magic bullet.</p><p> In regard to Dublin Bay, Ringsend and the EU, the EU demand of us is that we reduce the nitrogen limit to ten and the phosphorous limit to one.  That is what we are trying to do.  The EU has not set any targets and is not questioning the growth factors.  It has set those two mandatory parameters under the sensitive waters directive and we are endeavouring to comply with them over the next few years through massive investment in Ringsend.</p><p> Deputy O'Dowd spoke about Garryhinch.  It is useful to have raw water storage in the midlands in a situation where a pipeline bursts but the reality is there is already tremendous water storage at the bottom of Lough Derg.  It is a fantastic resource.  There is 18-inch control on the lake out of which we require a tiny amount for drinking water compared with that going into hydro.  There is no valid argument for putting further raw water storage half way along the route.  It does not make sense.  The decision-making process is the remit of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  A judicial review would be the next step and it is often availed of in the context of major controversial projects.  </p><p> Senator Murnane O'Connor asked about the service level agreement, SLA.

The point that people miss about the SLA is that it was never meant to be a fixed measure in terms of what a local authority or Irish Water must do.  Irish Water is an evolving organisation.  It is building operational capacity.  For example, design-build-operate, DBO, projects in local government are currently contracted out on long-term contracts.  Irish Water is no longer doing that.  We are breaking contracts into two, five, seven and ten years such that we can start to retake control of them when we build operational capacity.  This requires us to do more regional working and to look at the skill sets we create to do certain things.  The SLA allows for this.</p> <p>  In terms of the process in which we are currently involved, we are examining how in the context of the remaining years of the SLA we can get economic efficiencies and improvements in service and what this means for the SLA.  As I said, there is a process of discussion going on with the local government sector, through the CCMA, and the Department in this regard.  The degree to which we need to make changes or not will be determined in that process.  It will certainly not be determined by Irish Water.  There will be changes over time because we are looking at re-engineering the water industry in Ireland, raising skills levels and having less manual work on the ground and more visibility through telemetry, planning and so on.  This is not about contracting out.  There is no intention on the part of Irish Water to contract out work that is currently done within the public sector but we might do it differently and on a regional basis into the future.  If we are to achieve the very challenging targets we have been set in terms of economic efficiency, we will need to do that.</p> <p>  Senator Murnane O'Connor also asked about responsibility for plumbing.  Householders have always been responsible for problems in their properties.  If a property is a local authority house then the local authority is responsible for maintenance of the plumbing but the householder has always been responsible for leaks on their own property.  We have been offering a free first fix for leaks in, say, a driveway.  It is a limited scheme but a very effective one.  To date, we have fixed 28,000 leaks under our first fix scheme.</p></speech>

Funding is an issue.  There have always been leakages but we appear to have more now than ever before.  Due to a lack of funding, leakages in estates and so on are not being addressed and this is holding up completion of road projects in those estates.  As Mr. Grant will be aware, if a problem arises with a pipeline Monday to Friday the contact is the local authority but when it comes to problems arising at the weekend the contact is Irish Water.  While we are making progress there is still a lot of confusion around what are the responsibilities of local authorities versus Irish Water.  I accept it will take time to clarify this situation.  The concerns of the SLA need to be addressed.  Mr. Grant stated that it may not remain in place for the full 12 years.  It is important people are kept informed about the long-term picture in that regard.</p></speech>

One hears about parole, temporary release and remission, but the three terms are different.</p> <p>  Remission is an entitlement that virtually all prisoners have to have one quarter of their sentence deducted.  It does not apply to life sentences.  If I were given a sentence of four years, I am entitled to have remission of approximately one quarter.  The prison makes an application for remission to the Minister and it is generally granted.  It is dependent on good behaviour but in general we can say that under the prison rules, virtually all prisoners get remission of one quarter of their sentence.</p> <p>  Temporary release is slightly different from remission.  Temporary release applies if a prisoner is unwell and needs some treatment or there are compassionate grounds to let the prisoner out.  Sometimes a prisoner can be let out if a relative is unwell or if the prisoner has day-to-day temporary release, the prisoner may have managed to get a job.  That is infrequent but it can apply.  The law in respect of temporary release is dealt with in the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003, which involves an amendment of the Criminal Justice Act 1960.</p> <p>  Temporary release and remission already exist, but the purpose of the Parole Bill 2016 is to put on a statutory basis the operation of parole in Ireland.  Parole applies at present on a non-statutory basis to people who have been convicted and sentenced to a sentence of eight years or more.  It is only for serious criminals, people who have been sentenced to a long time in jail.  At present our parole system does not operate on a statutory basis.  It operates on an informal basis run ultimately by the Minister for Justice and Equality but on the basis of advice and recommendations that she receives from the Parole Board.  The Parole Board is a non-statutory board.</p> <p>  The objective of the Bill is fourfold: to establish an independent Parole Board on a statutory basis; to give that independent statutory board responsibility for the decision to grant parole, thereby taking it from the Minister for Justice and Equality; to establish on a statutory basis the clear criteria for the granting of parole, so people can look at it and understand how parole operates; and to give victims of crime a say in the process, because much of the time, we hear that victims of crime do not have a say when it comes to parole.  The Bill does not give them a veto but it does give them an involvement in the process.  </p> <p>  The reason I think the current system is unsatisfactory is because it is not based on statute; one cannot see how it operates and ultimately it is controlled by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Sometimes there will be political pressures on a Minister not to give parole to a particular individual because it could be met with a great deal of opposition in the press and it could be politically difficult for the Minister.  Sometimes there may be pressures on Ministers to give parole to people because of political affiliations they have with them.  It is better to take the issue out of politics and put it on an independent, transparent and statutory basis that sets out how and when a person is granted parole.</p> <p>  Let me take the members briefly through the Bill as I know members will have read it thoroughly.  I will be waiting for questions, particularly from Deputy Wallace, who I know was working on the Bill last night.</p> <p>  At present much of the legislation is relatively similar.  It is setting up a quango, which is one criticism that members can make, however at present we have a Parole Board.  We need a Parole Board so the Bill, when enacted, will put the Parole Board on a statutory basis.  Sections 1 to 4, inclusive, are the standard provisions one finds in any legislation dealing with regulations, expenses, establishment and interpretation.</p> <p>  In section 5, I set out the nature of parole and the purpose of it.  Under the terms of the Bill, parole gives individuals an entitlement to apply for a reduction in their sentences if they meet certain criteria.  The important thing to note is that, at present, and I retain this in section 5(2), parole is only available for people who have a sentence of eight years or more.  Members may want to table amendments subsequently in respect of that but part of the reason is that if people who got a four-year sentence were up for parole, the system would become very over-burdened with work.  When one considers that remission is available, we really need to concentrate on the most serious offences.  On the basis of workload it only really applies to people who have a sentence of eight years or more.</p> <p>  In Part 2, I deal with the Parole Board.  Section 6 establishes the board and section 7 sets out its functions.  Its main functions are: to convene panels to consider persons for parole; direct the release of persons; set out the conditions so that if they were to be released, they would be released subject to some monitoring; and to consider what conditions should apply in respect of parole.</p> <p>  Section 8 sets out the membership of the board.  Such sections seem to arouse most interest.  I know I can be legitimately criticised.  People will say, "Here is a lawyer trying to make this very complicated."  One of the criticism made of the Bill by the T&aacute;naiste on Second Stage was that it could make the process very legalistic.  However, in Britain and elsewhere in the world, cases are now being taken by individuals who claim they have an entitlement to parole.  We have a process at present whereby people can apply for parole.  They go to a Parole Board.  They are entitled to challenge that.  We need to have a mechanism in place whereby prisoners and the public can look at the procedures and say, "This is how one would apply."  There are bodies who look at these issues which are independent of politicians.  They make a decision and if one does not like it, one can go elsewhere.</p> <p>  The membership of the board will comprise: a chairman; at least four people who are appointed through the Public Appointments Service, PAS; a registered medical practitioner who is a psychiatrist; a psychologist; a representative of the Irish Prison Service; a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; a probation or welfare officer; a representative of the Irish Penal Reform Trust; and other persons who have developed a knowledge and experience of the supervision of prisoners.</p> <p>  Four members of the board will be nominated through an applications process under the Public Appointments Service but I think there is a benefit in asking organisations such as the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland to nominate a psychiatrist to go on the board, the Psychological Society of Ireland to be the body to nominate the psychologist and also the Irish Prison Service to nominate the appropriate prison officer.  Generally if one asks bodies such as those I have listed, they will put forward reasonable people who have a good understanding as opposed, and I may be criticised for saying this, to the people who apply who may not necessarily be the best.</p> <p>  Section 9 sets out the terms of office.  A member can only serve a four-year term and then another four-year term, a total of two four-year terms.  Section 10 deals with the chairperson.  Section 11 sets out what I call the panel convenors.</p><p>Section 11 sets out the role of the panel convenors who will convene panels of between three and five members to decide on parole applications submitted by prisoners.  There is a great deal of work involved here.  Many prisoners are going to be applying for parole.  It will not be an easy job in which one hears the odd application now and again.</p><p> Section 12 deals with staff.  The Parole Board has to be staffed properly.  If one talks to those involved with the board at present, they will say they are concerned about the need to have sufficient staff numbers.  They would prefer to be able to select their own staff.</p><p> Section 13 relates to parole panels.  Section 13(2) states that such a panel "shall consist of 3 or 5 members" with a chairperson among that number.  Each panel will decide whether to recommend a prisoner for parole.</p><p> Section 14 sets out the powers of parole panels.  I envisage that parole panels will have two functions.  I will explain it simply.  Under the system I am proposing, there will be a review or a hearing in each case.  Most parole applications will be dealt with by review, which will involve looking through documents like reports from doctors and probation officers to see whether the person is doing well and making a decision on whether he or she is entitled to parole.  A prisoner will be entitled to a hearing in some circumstances and on certain grounds after he or she has been refused parole.</p><p> One of the powers of the parole panel, as set out in section 14, is worth noting.  Section 14(8), on page 13, provides that a parole panel, "may conduct a hearing as it thinks appropriate".  There does not have to be a hearing all the time.  Most of these cases will be dealt with by means of review.  This will involve looking at the file.  Sometimes there will be a hearing.  The panel will determine who can attend and give evidence at such hearings.  It will also be able to, "impose limits on what a person may talk about".  We do not want hearings to turn into long-running sagas.  We have to be careful to ensure people do not use hearings as opportunities to have a go at other people.  The parole panel will be in control of that.</p><p> It is important to note that section 14(11), on the bottom of page 13, provides that, "the Board may receive written submissions from any victim of the person whose parole is being considered", if necessary, "allow any such victim to appear and make oral submissions at a hearing for the purpose of assisting the Board to reach a decision", and, "allow for the representation of any such victim".  There are circumstances in which the Parole Board may allow the victim of the prisoner to attend.  This will not be mandatory or obligatory.  There are conflicting rights here.  There are the rights of the prisoner and the interests of the victim of the crime.  The latter cannot be a veto on the former.  I think it is in the public interest to have this mechanism available.</p><p> Section 15 deals specifically with reviews.  Section 15(1) states that, "a review may involve consideration of such information, documents, memoranda [....] but shall not involve oral testimony or oral representation".  It is a straightforward paper review.  Section 15(4) provides that, "where the decision by a panel is to decline to make a parole order in respect of a person, the decision shall specify a date".  Section 15(3) sets out that a person who has been refused parole, "shall be entitled to a hearing", as opposed to a review.</p><p> Section 16 clarifies that hearings, "shall be conducted in such manner as the parole panel thinks fit".  Section 16(2) requires each decision of a hearing panel to be given to the candidate for parole, the Garda Commissioner, the Prison Service and the Minister.  Section 16(3) states that, "for the purposes of a hearing, a person whose parole is being considered is entitled to appear [and to] attend while any other person is making submissions, provided that the person whose parole is being considered may not be present at the hearing when any victim is present".  That will keep the victim and the person whose parole is being considered out of the same room at the same time.  I am not assuming that victims do not want those responsible for offences against them to get out because that is not always the case.</p><p> Section 17 requires the Parole Board to report on its activities.</p><p> Part 3 deals with the parole process.  Section 18 sets out the guiding principles the board should take into account, including the, "recommendations of the sentencing judge", "the nature and gravity of the offence", and, "the degree of responsibility of the person whose parole is being considered".</p><p> Section 19 sets out the criteria for parole.  Rehabilitation is an important part of this.  Consideration must be given to the impact of the offence.  Section 19(2) provides that various factors, including, "the conduct of the person while in custody", "any recommendations of the court", "the nature and gravity of the offence", and, "the potential threat" posed by the offender, must be considered by the Parole Board when consideration is being given to parole.</p><p> I think section 20 is interesting because it relates to eligibility for parole.  It provides that, "every person serving a sentence of eight years or greater period shall be eligible for parole having served a period of one-half of such sentence or after seven years, whichever is the lesser".  That is the way it is at present.  Section 20(2), which states that, "a person serving a life sentence shall not be eligible for parole until that person has served a minimum period of eight years", also reflects the current position.  That is the law as it is applied by the Parole Board at present.</p><p> My own view is that an eight-year period is too short.  The Parole Board will say it is pointless considering somebody who has been convicted of murder for parole after eight years because he or she will not get it.  A tariff of approximately 15 years currently applies to a conviction for murder, which involves the intentional killing of a person.  I know Deputy Wallace thinks prison does not work.  We need to think about the punishment that should be imposed on a person who kills another person.  Is there a suggestion that we should not put the killer in prison?  I think there has to be a punishment.  That is probably a bigger question than the one we are discussing today.  I suggest this section of the Bill should be amended on Committee Stage to reflect the reality that somebody convicted of murder is not considered for parole for between ten and 12 years.</p><p> Section 21 deals with consideration for parole.  I intend to change this in a Committee Stage amendment.</p><p> Section 22 relates to parole orders.  Legal proof is required to get a person out.  A parole order is a document that will state that a person is being granted parole and will permit a prison warden or governor to release that person.</p><p> Monitoring and compliance provisions are set out in section 23.  If there is concern about the impact of the release of a person on parole, perhaps because he or she will be a threat to somebody else, it will be possible under this section to impose conditions on the person being released.</p><p> Section 24 sets out how parole orders may be varied.  Parole involves release on licence.  It can be revoked.  If a person who has been given parole starts committing other offences or breaching his or her parole conditions, his or her parole order may be varied under this section.</p><p> Section 25 provides for the revocation of parole orders.</p><p> Section 26 is a technical section relating to warrants.  Obviously, there is a need to be able to issue a warrant in order to return to jail a person who has breached a parole order.</p><p> Section 27 sets out the general administrative rules for preparing for reviews and hearings and how those reviews are to be considered.</p><p> Section 28 provides for privilege under the Defamation Act 2009 in respect of documents generated for the parole process.</p><p> I drafted amendments after this Bill was passed on Second Stage.  I do not know if I have submitted them.  I appreciate the opportunity to scrutinise the Bill in advance of Committee Stage, which cannot take place until the Government decides to pass a money message in respect of it.  This issue, which arises because the legislation involves a charge on the Government, has arisen previously.  If that happens again on this occasion, we will see how it goes.  I am happy to answer any questions my colleagues might have.</p></speech>

I invite other members of the committee to ask salient questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.621" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017021500002#C00300"><p>I do not know how salient my questions will be.  I welcome the introduction of the Parole Bill 2016.  I have yet to get my head around the mechanics of how this process works.  We need to do everything we can to encourage the Government to provide a money message to expedite this process so that this urgent and timely legislation can advance to Committee and Report Stages.  The number of people serving life sentences has increased.  The amount of time they are serving has also increased.  We need to examine this issue in detail because little has changed in the past 50 years, as Deputy O'Callaghan said.  I welcome the proposal to establish an independent panel.</p> <p>  At present, the parole board overwhelmingly comprises people from the criminal justice system, including formal criminal justice agents.  I see the need for a change in that regard.  While I admit that I have not studied this Bill in sufficient detail, it strikes me that some sections of it are worthy of further comment.  We would have a few issues with section 8, which relates to the membership of the board.  Section 11(1) proposes that every panel convenor must be, "a barrister or solicitor who has had not less than 9 years experience", or "a person who has held office as a judge of the District Court, or the Circuit Court".  At present, there is provision for community representatives to sit on the parole board.</p><p>I do not think that should entirely change.  I believe there is a substantial role for that without them being replaced by people from a legal or judicial background.  We need a discussion on the balance between lay and community representatives, or whatever it is called.  Section 8(2)(b) allows for four people to be appointed and, given the qualifications required of them, it is very likely that they are going to come from that legal background.  Given that the other 11 are high-ranking professionals as well, we might be missing out on that.  I believe that is something that we need to look at.  We might need to look at other jurisdictions to see how it is done.</p><p> Section 8(2)(j) provides that not less than four members are women and not less than four members are men.  I think we should look at changing that to six and six.  We are trying to drive forward change.  I know it is difficult.  If we are saying that the panel of conveners will not necessarily be drawn from the ranks of the Judiciary and the legal profession, we might have more of a basis for making it six and six.  I understand that sometimes the numbers are not always there.</p><p> A lot of emphasis in the parole process is now on the interview.  That is only one side to it.  If a prisoner gives a poor interview, it weighs heavily against him or her.  There should be some mechanism for how the prisoner's progress has been monitored and how the reports around it give weight to that.  It is very welcome that parole applicants will be permitted to have legal counsel during the interview.  That is really important.  A rational evaluation of their progress is also important.  Perhaps there should be some training around that.</p><p> I have a couple of other brief points.  Section 13(2) provides that panels that make decisions on parole will have three to five members as the chairperson may determine.  Perhaps three people is a little bit small, particularly if there is one dominant person.  I would favour five, although that could be cumbersome.  Maybe it is not hung up and maybe it is disrespectful to the chairperson.  However, three is a little bit small.  We are talking about people making a pretty significant decision.</p><p> My other point is on the power of the parole panels in section 14(5)(b).  It lists a number of criteria that a report covering somebody's parole application might cover.  I have no problem with the items that are listed.  We should look at adding in consideration of the effect that the granting of parole would have on the prisoner's family and the possibility that the prisoner will successfully reintegrate back into his family.  I am probably not explaining that very well.  Family and social supports have been shown to be the key determinant in whether somebody re-offends or not.  There was a good programme launched in Limerick last week in terms of family supports and that.  All the studies say that it is key.  Something such as the birth of a child often changes how somebody views things and changes his or her reintegration into the family.  These things should be factored in in some way.  I believe all of the other criteria are good but something like that could be beneficial.</p><p> In section 19 on the criteria for parole, I have what is probably an ideological difference rather than a technical one.  In section 19(2)(a), it states that the board may have regard "to the nature and gravity of the offence to which the sentence of imprisonment being served by the person relates".  I understand the point made about the severity of the crime and that type of thing.  The safety of the community and so on is hugely important.  However, that wording puts too much emphasis on the offence committed by the person, which takes place a number of years before he or she meets the Parole Board.  The whole purpose of parole is to evaluate the progress and take words from professionals about how that person has been rehabilitated.  In that case, I believe there should be an assessment of the risk to victims or the community where the Parole Board is making a decision on whether a person should be released.  Obviously, emotionally, one's tendency is to focus on the original crime, but the rational head has to prevail.  Prison is not intended as punishment.  It is supposed to be for rehabilitation.  The focus of the decision-making in terms of release has to be on that end.</p><p> The only other point is about the the revocation of the parole order.  I know that the IPRT has focused on the word "gravity" and how the breach of conditions has to be grave for the parole order to be revoked and an individual returned to prison.  The IPRT says that "gravity" is too loose a term and too low a bar and that somebody should only be returned if they have committed a criminal offence.  I would agree with a rewording there.</p><p> With the week that is in it, we have not done as much as we would have liked on this Bill.  Those are just some observations on it at this stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.623" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1416" speakername="Martin Conway" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017021500002#D00200"><p>I have to confess that no more than Deputy Daly, I have not given it due consideration either.  I very much welcome Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill.  I would agree with the vast majority of Deputy Daly's commentary.  I certainly think that the gender balance issue is something that can easily be got right.  With regard to what Deputy O'Callaghan said in terms of Deputy Wallace's point that prison does not work, I would agree with Deputy Wallace in the vast majority of cases.  However, there are obviously certain circumstances in which prison is probably and unfortunately the only option.</p> <p>  In its last term, I was the rapporteur for this committee on work we did on restorative justice practices, which have been proven to work exceptionally well in areas where the effort has gone in to setting up restorative justice.  The examples that are regularly quoted are south Dublin and north Tipperary where there has been up to a 70% improvement in terms of second offences and people realising what they have done.  We also did extensive work in this committee on community courts and the necessity to set up a community court on a pilot basis in inner city Dublin.  As we are all aware, the principle of community courts is to bring all of the various stakeholders together in an environment of support, assistance and rehabilitation, as opposed to the adversarial environment of the big stick.  In places like Times Square in New York, it has worked remarkably well.  I am very much of the view that prison is an absolute last resort.  There are an awful lot of people in prison today who really should not be in prison and whom the system has let down.</p> <p>  In the overall context, I believe this is a very welcome Bill.  I commend Deputy O'Callaghan on the work he has done on it because we are here to bring forward legislation to improve the lives of citizens.  I will make a point of bringing this up in the Seanad to encourage the Government, as I am sure my colleagues will do as well.  The Deputy's own party has a significant influence on Government and I certainly think that the Deputy and his party will pursue this.  I will certainly commit to it in the Seanad, as I know my colleagues will.  In the last term in the Seanad, I tabled a motion on restorative justice, which we succeeded in getting unanimous support for.  I also tabled a motion on community courts.  Again, we received unanimous support for that.  It is actually quite frustrating to see the delay in getting a pilot project up and running.  We are where we are.  I wish the Deputy well with the Bill and I will engage with it as best I can.</p></speech>

I am guilty of that.  Not only do I find it difficult to criticise anything that Deputy Jim O'Callaghan has put forward, I cannot even contradict anything that Deputy Daly has said.  I have every intention of researching it and learning a bit about it.</p> <p>  I will pick up on one point that Deputy O'Callaghan made about eight years being too early to let a fella out.</p><p>If a person has not been rehabilitated and no improvement has been made to his approach to life and the people with whom he has to share the world, yes it is.  However, if the work is being put in, one would hope otherwise.  If I had someone in my care and I had eight years to rehabilitate them, I would be fairly disappointed with myself if they had not changed after that time.  </p><p> I agree with the point about prison not working.  First, some 80% or 90% of the people in prison should not be there.  Second, of course if there are people who are a risk to society and are just too dangerous to be let loose then we have to do something with them.  If we are going to lock them up, however, let us do something with them.  We should be in a position to consider letting them out after eight years if they have made the required improvements.  That is not possible under present conditions because prison is not geared that way.</p><p> We have read a lot of what the Jesuits have had to say about prisons and we have a lot to learn from them.  If we took some of it on board, the notion of letting people out after eight years might not be so draconian or mad.  The idea that a person does something terrible and under no circumstances should we reconsider or let them see the light of day for 15 years, does not strike me as being rational.  </p><p> It costs a crazy amount of money to keep people in prison - &euro;70,000 a year per prisoner is nuts.  If we stopped putting in all the people who should not be in prison, we would have more money to help those who should be imprisoned.  </p><p> The next time I come back, I promise that I will know something about the Parole Bill.  I hope I can tear strips out of it, but that is unlikely.</p></speech>

There are not very many in terms of the contributions.  Deputy Clare Daly has highlighted a series of different areas that he will likely address in his response to us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.627" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1413" speakername="Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017021500002#E00300"><p>I join with other speakers in welcoming this Bill.  As with everything that Deputy O'Callaghan does, it is clear that a mammoth amount of work has been put into it.  I am also in concert with other speakers because I am not as familiar as I probably should be with some aspects of the Bill.  We will get to that stage, but at this early point we need to discuss the broader themes.  While Deputy Clare Daly had some specific questions on that, one can already see some of the broader themes emerging, which show why such legislation is necessary.  The themes include the prison system itself, how we treat prisoners, and how people deal with the system, be it through restorative justice or other mechanisms.  It is an important piece of work and from our perspective it will be good to hear further from Deputy O'Callaghan.  We should also discuss how we can start to get some movement on this Bill  and put more meat on the bone.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.628" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1269" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017021500002#E00400"><p>I have a number of questions to put to Deputy O'Callaghan.  My understanding of the current situation is that those who wish to apply to be considered for parole must correspond directly with the Minister for Justice and Equality of the day.  He or she then refers cases, although perhaps not all, for the current non-statutory board consider.  If that is not the case, then I stand to be corrected.</p> <p>  Can Deputy O'Callaghan tell me how this would function under the new statutory Parole Board?  Is it the case that prisoners seeking to be considered for parole would correspond directly with the new board, rather than with the Minister who has the power of referral for consideration?  There is so much covered within the Bill but its functionality is not as explicit as I would expect.</p> <p>  Is the board's make-up based on any particular template?  Will it comprise 15 members like the current non-statutory board?  Is it based on any international comparator?  It is to be chaired by a current or former judge.  There would be a certain body of opinion which might believe that this final determination is like coming before a court again.  A person is sentenced in the first instance by a judge of the land, yet in the final determination to grant parole, or otherwise, a prisoner will be back again before a chair who is a current or former judge, as well as others from the judicial system, including judges of the respective court designations, barristers and solicitors who are of themselves the only people in a position to secure appointment to the bench.  </p> <p>  The panel of convenors is quite directing, comprising as it does a judge, barrister and solicitor.  It strikes me that the raft of important experiences that could be brought to bear in any open consideration of the entitlement of an applicant for parole are being excluded from critical roles.  I would be concerned in that regard.  I do not know that it is appropriate to be so prescriptive to the exclusion of a whole range of other life experiences, qualifications and professional competencies.  Why would one exclude a bankrupt from participation in the new board?  On what basis would one decide that somebody who is declared bankrupt did not have the capacity, competencies and requirements to make a determination as to the suitability or otherwise of an applicant for parole?  I am not aware of any.  Perhaps Deputy O'Callaghan would refer to some of these matters.</p> <p>  I will have other questions on the Bill but I welcome the broad thrust of it.  We must remember, however, that while the premise of moving political responsibility from political control to a statutory body is sound in principle, nevertheless the ultimate decision - as is currently the case - lies with the Minister of the day who does not have to be the bearer of any of these qualifications in civil life.  </p> <p>  I will conclude with that opening series of questions and will now invite our final speaker, Deputy Jack Chambers, to contribute.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.629" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1255" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017021500002#E00500"><p>I welcome the discussion around this Bill and thank my colleague, Deputy O'Callaghan, for introducing it.  It is important that the legislation tries to move control away from the Minister.  An executive function concerning parole should not be in the hands of a Minister.</p><p>The cloudiness of decision-making in recent years and decades needs to be addressed statutorily.  We must codify the rules and make the process of obtaining parole transparent for those in the prison system.</p><p> I wish to pick up on some of the points made by other members.  We need to deal with the membership of the board legislatively.  I would be concerned about a nominee coming from a particular body in a professional capacity because that would be an insider from a board of insiders.  On a professional basis, we need to open the process up to the Public Appointments Service so that a professional can employ through that service to be a member of the board rather than our having a particular professional body nominating someone to the board.  The latter restricts the professional application process for a particular nominee.</p><p> In general, I welcome the fact that this justice committee is moving towards a debate on penal reform.  When studying law, I studied penology and the history of political debate on penal reform.  Historically, the discussion has been on punishment and the length of time spent in the prison system and not about the rehabilitation of the prisoner and the overarching concerns in this regard.  This Bill will move the debate towards the right framework, which should result in giving people a chance.</p><p> Like others, I have not studied every piece of legislation.  We need, however, to impose an obligation on the wraparound services so they will have an active role regarding those who are given parole.  They should be obliged to work with the individual rather than having the individual approach them.  The services should have an obligation to play a positive role in respect of the individual.  This is an issue with addiction and rehabilitation generally.  I am not saying every prisoner has an addiction issue but it is important, in respect of medical, counselling and community-level services, that the input of the service provider not be optional.  It should not just be the obligation of the person given parole.  Funding should be linked to working properly with people who have engaged with the parole service.  They get off scot free much of the time where they have an option to opt out in respect of people who are vulnerable and need intervention.  There needs to be a statutory obligation to take an active and positive role.  This would fit in with regard to providing the wraparound services.  We can actually provide a legislative component such that the services are not just consulted but actually involved, with a statutory responsibility to play an active role in cases of parole.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.631" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017021500002#F00200"><p>I thank all the members for their contributions and efforts.  I will deal first with what Deputy Clare Daly said.  She made the point that she would like to see community representatives on the board.  That is a good idea.  We need to assess how we could identify community representatives.  A criticism, which may be legitimate, is that the membership of the board may look too legalistic.  This may be due in part to what I work at.  My stance takes into account that it involves a quasi-judicial process for a body to assess whether a person should be released from jail.  The authorities must take into account the conflicting factors and the entitlement the prisoner will have under the legislation to apply.  On the other hand, they must take into account the potential threat the prisoner may pose to the public.  Two sides must be weighed up.</p> <p>  In England at present, this is becoming a quite litigious area.  That is the reason, in part, why I believed somebody is needed at the head of the membership who can weigh up these considerations.  Perhaps community representatives could do so just as well as people who are used to assessing and to playing a quasi-judicial role.  I am happy to consider community representatives.  It would be interesting to see how we could get them and whether we should attract them through nomination.  I sometimes believe that if one just seeks applications, community representatives are hard to get.  When Dublin City Council was trying to get community representatives to sit on the policing committee, people would not apply.  One could end up with busybodies who are not necessarily the best.  This is a matter I am happy to consider.</p> <p>  I note what the Deputy says about trying to make the gender balance better.  The Deputy seeks minimums of six women and six men, rather than four and four, where there are 15 members.  That is a good idea.</p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about the interview and its importance.  There is an interview but the question of whether parole will be granted is also a legal issue from the prisoner's point of view.  They have rights in that regard.  Under my system, the constant refusal in an interview to give a prisoner parole would entitle that prisoner to a hearing, which would also involve a quasi-judicial process whereby the body making the decision would have to set out more reasons for refusing or granting parole.</p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about the panels.  It is proposed that the panels have three to five members but the Deputy would prefer five.  The reason there are 15 members on the board is because there is a lot of work for them to do.  They have many applications to consider.  It might be worthwhile hearing from the Parole Board in due course if we get to that.  One could have five panels of three people assessing.  Obviously, it would be preferable to have panels of five but it does come down to resources and workload.</p> <p>  Deputy Daly also suggested that we should consider the impact of parole on the prisoner's family.  That is an interesting point.  As legislators, we have to be careful when introducing this legislation that we do not present the parole process as simply about being on the side of prisoners and the prisoner's family.  Necessarily, victims and victims' families will be coming forward saying that while prison is about rehabilitation, it is not just about rehabilitation as it is also about punishment.  People will be saying their son was murdered and is gone forever.  It may be asked whether, if a prisoner cannot be rehabilitated, there should be no punishment.  That is an interesting debate.  Prison is not simply about rehabilitation but also about punishment.</p> <p>  Deputy Daly mentioned how section 19 deals with the fact that one of the factors to be taken into account is the severity of the crime.  That is a fair point because one can argue that when the individual is being sentenced in the first instance, the court takes into account the severity of the crime.  Therefore, the sentence itself takes into account the severity of the crime.  That is an argument and a strong argument.  One could ask why severity is being considered again on the grounds that something else is being dealt with.  I am happy to examine that.</p> <p>  The Deputy also mentioned the revocation of the parole order, the view that "gravity" is too loose a term and that there should be a revocation only where another crime is committed.  I believe there should be a revocation if the terms of the parole order are not complied with or are breached.  Parole is just letting one out on licence.  One can be brought back if one breaches the terms.</p> <p>  Senator Martin Conway also mentioned gender balance.  I agree and in this regard I draw attention to what I said about Senator Clare Daly's point.</p> <p>  Senator Conway also spoke about restorative justice and said it does not work in the community courts.  There is a much bigger discussion here because the majority of people in prison do not come near the parole process because they are in for fewer than eight years.  I would have believed the majority of people are in for approximately two years.  These are small sentences.  Those with such sentences are the people who do not pose a huge threat to the community.  They comprise the majority.  These are the people in respect of whom we should be trying to use our community courts and restorative justice.  The Senator's point in this regard is valid.  I welcome the fact that he is going to mention it in the Seanad.</p> <p>  Just because Deputy Wallace has not read the legislation does not mean he cannot comment on it.  He is perfectly entitled to do so.  He will have a chance to read the legislation on Committee Stage.</p> <p>  As I said before, I disagree that prison is all about rehabilitation.  Maybe I am a hardened person in that I believe it is also about punishment.  It has to be considerably about rehabilitation, however.  I agree with the Deputy's point that if people are imprisoned with the intention of rehabilitating them as well as punishing them, leaving them in a cell is not achieving that.  If the balance between rehabilitation and punishment is to be 50:50, there needs to be some function to ensure the rehabilitation process is working.  At present, it does not exist at all.  People do make mistakes and do terrible things.  Considerable numbers of people are in prison because of things they do when they are drunk.  We need to recognise that moments of madness can destroy many lives.  The Deputy is right that we should not be throwing away the key.  In this regard, we need to look to the rehabilitation process.</p><p>I am glad to hear Deputy Wallace quoting the Jesuits.  No soul is ever lost.  We could learn much from how community groups like the Jesuits deal with issues like this one.</p><p> I welcome Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile's comments.  It is a large amount of work.  We need legislation.  The situation will get more complicated and it needs to be on a statutory basis.  I do not know whether this is the right way to do that.  It may appear too complicated, but it does not involve a process like a judicial appointments commission where people just sit around and have an easy job of assessing applications from a limited number.  This board will handle a great deal of work because of the numbers coming through.  It will undoubtedly get that wrong sometimes, so we must ensure that prisoners have their rights and the rights of communities are taken into account so that there is no threat.</p><p> The Chairman was correct about how, currently, people apply to the Minister and the Minister defers the matter to the Parole Board before it comes back to him or her to be signed.  This new system would cut out the Minister.  The statutory function of the Parole Board would be to consider applications for parole.  It would then make decisions as to whether to grant parole and send out the parole order at the end of that process.  That the Minister's role would be removed is constitutional.  Under the Constitution, the State is entitled by law to delegate responsibility for the commutation and remission of sentences to another body.</p><p> A good point was made about membership of the board, which was criticised for having many lawyers on it.  I was asked why there would be judges.  After being sentenced by a beak, a person will be back in front of another beak.  The reason is that it is a quasi-judicial function.  As a prisoner, I would prefer to take my chances with the Parole Board and someone who is used to weighing up matters than with individuals who have strong views on an issue.  This is sometimes evident in other statutory schemes, where individuals with strong views reject all applications.  However, I get the point about it possibly being too formally legalistic and that we need more community representation, but we cannot get away from the fact that it is a quasi-judicial process.</p><p> A good question was asked about why a bankrupt would be excluded under section 9(6).  I did not mean to be offensive to any bankrupt, but that is a standard section that I took from other legislation.  Under it, persons are disqualified if they are "sentenced ... to a term of imprisonment or penal servitude" or they are adjudicated bankrupts.  It would not be appropriate to have someone who is currently sentenced to a term of imprisonment on the Parole Board, but I take the point about a bankrupt.  It probably appears unfair that a bankrupt would be precluded.  Such people are not in a position of conflict when it comes to considering applications from parole applicants.  Former prisoners who have been rehabilitated should also be able to be considered for membership on this panel.  They have managed to come out of the process.</p><p> Deputy Chambers stated that he was opposed to nominees by groups.  There are different ways of handling matters for these boards.  Either applications are made through the Public Appointments Service, PAS, or Top Level Appointments Commission, TLAC, or bodies recommend people.  On paper, it is great to get people to apply via the PAS.  My view, which may be based on prejudice instead of fact, is that that will often not supply the best people.  I have included the Irish Penal Reform Trust in this Bill.  If we asked it to nominate a body to the Parole Board, we would get a good nominee.  If we put an ad in the newspaper, we may get good people, but it would be hit or miss.</p><p> I thank members for their contributions.</p></speech>

Take football, for example.  People who play football are generally involved in running teams and are greater lovers of football than those who organise the sport.  That is true of most sports.  How to prevent people from joining the board who are not the type of people we want is a challenge that we should discuss and examine.  I do not have the answers, but we should consider the matter.</p> <p>  I did not actually know that the bankruptcy provision was included.  I have the proud record of being the first serving Member of Parliament in Ireland who is bankrupt.  It is a wonderful achievement.  The story has not been accurately told by the mainstream media, but I will not bore members with it either.  There is an interesting statistic.  In America, the average millionaire goes broke more than three times.  That is how the capitalist system works.  Someone is rehabilitated more quickly over there.  There is a different approach to it, a different philosophy behind people.  More often than not, people who become bankrupt are risk takers.  I am still a risk taker, but the notion that being bankrupt would in any sense make one close to being a criminal or a less satisfactory person to deal with this issue is a strange one.</p> <p>  I do not want to get into defending myself and being where I am because my business collapsed over a banking crisis, but I agree with the Chairman, in that this provision is harsh on bankrupts.</p></speech>

On that note,  I propose not to make the formal proposition in regard to the Parole Bill 2016 on its own.  I will deal with both pieces of legislation before us this morning at the conclusion of our address of the Prisons (Solitary Confinement) (Amendment) Bill 2016, a Private Member's Bill moved by Deputy Clare Daly.  We will now move to that Bill which was referred for Committee Stage on 1 December 2016.  I call on Deputy Daly to brief the committee on the provisions of her Bill.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.665" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017021500002#H00400"><p>I will be brief because the legislation itself is short and I have to leave the meeting at 10.45 a.m.  The Bill codifies in primary legislation the rules around the holding of individuals in solitary confinement.  The first point was raised by the Minister and was, why primary legislation?  Should we not just leave it for the Minister to provide through regulation?  Are we trying to micro-manage in primary legislation?  That is not on.  The current process where prison rules are created by regulation obviously allows for a greater degree for flexibility, which I believe, by and large, is appropriate.  That is not what this Bill is about however.  It is about protecting human rights and protecting people from harm.  In that sense, there can be no inflexibility.  Putting the protection of fundamental human rights into primary legislation is good.</p> <p>  There is only one piece that might open me to a charge of micro-management, which is the amended section 35(2)(2A)(i).  This provides that prisoners held in solitary confinement "shall have access to work, training, education, rehabilitation, and other services, and insofar as is possible this shall be in association with other prisoners".  That might be the only charge of micro-management.  Other than that, this is about protecting people from a violation of their human rights and it is entirely appropriate to have in primary legislation. </p> <p>  There may be some practical difficulties from the Irish Prison Service, IPS, although they are moving in the direction of dealing with this issue anyway.  I would consider it complementary rather than causing a difficulty.  I do believe the input of the IPS could help it happen.  I think we can eliminate the practice. </p> <p>  Basically the Bill amends section 35 of the 2007 Act, which is the Act that allows the Minister to make rules to govern and regulate prisons.  At present, prisoners held in solitary confinement in Ireland are held under either rule 62 or 63, which are made under section 35.  This Bill inserts a provision which will oblige the Minister to make prison rules restricting the use of solitary confinement.  </p> <p>  The Bill gives a definition of solitary confinement for the first time in Irish law, which is "the restriction of a prisoner&rsquo;s opportunities for meaningful human interaction and communal association for 22 to 24 hours a day, whether by means of restricting the prisoner to a cell or by any other means".  The reason we said 22 hours is partly because we felt is would be easier.  I would have preferred 19.  The international standard is 22 hours, because after that time we are looking at irreversible psychiatric problems if people are held indefinitely.  I would obviously be much happier to see 19 and if the big parties supported 19, let them bring it on, but the reason we chose 22 is because it is the international human rights standard.  It is the time period for which there is medical evidence.  That is the definition.</p> <p>  We see the amended section 35(2)(2A)(a) as being very important.  It is the most important section because it says that "no prisoner shall be held in solitary confinement for any reason for more than 15 consecutive days", because after the 15 days is when the damage sets in.  I thought Deputy O'Callaghan's point on Second Stage was graphic for people.  If we were talking about a prisoner being beaten or getting their legs broken people would readily understand it.  This is similar damage to their mental health and has to be recognised as such.  There are hugely damaging psychological effects, which can be long-term, and we need to have it outlawed.</p> <p>  I absolutely appreciate that the Prison Service and the current director general are trying to deal with this issue but we cannot just leave it up to chance.  Who is going to come in after him?  Perhaps it will be an austerity bunch and maybe there will be a different Minister.  We need it protected in law.</p> <p>  The other provisions in the Bill are, very briefly, divided into two groups.  One is to complement the principle that solitary confinement is so serious and damaging that certain persons can never be subjected to it.  It should not be used as a punitive measure.  Prisoners with mental illness should never be placed in solitary confinement and similarly neither should prisoners on remand.  Flowing from that is the provision that solitary confinement should be the last resort.  There is a group of measures to make sure that it is in fact a last resort by putting obligations on the Prison Service. These include daily visits from a mental health professional or the doctor, a system whereby there would be a review every three days, a requirement for the governor to keep a written log, access to treatment and so on, and then the provisions around work training, family visits and access to complaints.  This is again important.  It relates not just to general complaints but category A complaints, which are ones around which there is an urgency.  Given the potential damage of this type of incarceration, this does need to be addressed promptly, as indeed medical contact needs to pick up any signs early.  </p> <p>  To address some issues that arose around it, it has been noted that the IPS are working on this anyway.  That is great, but it does not mean that we should not enshrine it in law.  There is no reason why we should refuse to ban torture and that is what this essentially is.  I think the IPS, like anybody, can bring about change in that when we bring in legislation.  There are other issues about people who seek to be kept away from others. These issues are around protection.  Where many people are on their own because of that, the reasons why they are in danger need to be addressed and the security risk to them needs to be tackled.  If somebody is asking to be on their own and deprived of human contact, that sets off alarm bells.  There are some serious other underlying problems there which need to be addressed.</p> <p>  There are good things being done, particularly with people with mental health problems, including attempts to set up facilities where they would be cared for in a different custodial environment.  This legislation does not negate any of that.  It actually complements it and simply puts it in primary legislation.  It is pretty straightforward.</p></speech>

It is unacceptable to use solitary confinement as a punishment.  It is a form of deprivation of association with people.  It is a form of sensory deprivation and the reason it is happening is because the prisoner has engaged in indiscipline or has broken prison discipline rules.  There must be other methods, I would have thought, of ensuring that prisoners can be disciplined.  Obviously prisoners do break rules in prison but surely there are other mechanisms that can be used to punish them, such as taking away some of the few liberties they have or reducing visits or whatever.  It would be interesting to hear what the Prison Service has to say in respect of it.  I am sure it has ideas as to how a disruptive prisoner can be dealt with as opposed to just locking them up and denying them association.</p></speech>

We are now in a position to confirm the schedule of engagements.  Deputy O'Callaghan mentioned the Prison Service.  I am happy to advise, if members wish to note, I do not know if this has been circulated yet, but on 22 February the meeting will be of the select committee.  I will come back to that.</p><p> In regard to our sequence of engagements on penal reform, the joint committee will have a discussion with the Victims' Rights Alliance on Wednesday, 1 March 2017.  That follows last week's engagement with the Irish Penal Reform Trust.  On the following Wednesday, 8 March the joint committee will have discussions, and this has been confirmed, with the Prison Service and the Probation Service.  We will conclude our engagement on Wednesday, 22 March when the Jesuit Centre for Faith and Justice and the Prison Officers Association will come before us in separate tranches on that day.</p><p> As Deputy O'Callaghan has said we will have the opportunity to address some of the matters to the Irish Prison Service on 8 March.</p></speech>

I fully agree with Deputy O'Callaghan that solitary confinement should not be used anymore.  It is horrendous.  I sincerely hope - and I bow to Deputy Daly's knowledge on this - that it is not being used that much in this country.  I would be interested to hear what the director general, Mr. Michael Donnellan has to say when he appears before the committee.  I am going to make a point of being present on 8 March.  It is good that there is a working group but obviously solitary confinement is being used as a sanction if there has to be a working group.   Even though great work is being done in the prison service, I agree with the principal that we should legislate and ensure that if we get some director general in the future who is not as forward thinking as Michael Donnellan is, that we have the protections in place.  Our responsibility as legislators is to close down that type of risk.</p> <p>  I salute what Deputy Daly is trying to achieve.  I hope the Prison Service would see it as complementary to what they are doing.</p></speech>

I know the Deputy has more expertise in this area that I do, but is there any scope to legislate for an international number of hours that is better for the prisoner than we have laid out as this would be a more positive measure.  What is the international perception?  It would be interesting to hear from the IPS on that.</p> <p>  We need to put more positive measures in primary legislation in regard to rehabilitation, education, work and training because there is a significant deficit in our system in that respect.  The more we can do to incorporate positive measures in this area and put them on a legislative footing the better.  </p> <p>  I do not know what countries have moved beyond the international norm for the number of hours in confinement for the benefit of the person in confinement.</p></speech>

I too like Deputy Daly have an ideological view but also a very practical technical view as to why solitary confinement is a significantly negative process, not just for the individual concerned but also for the penal system we want to achieve.  Solitary confinement does not benefit anybody at any level.  It is a real stain on society that we would think it acceptable or an appropriate way to deal with a prisoner.</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Chambers' point on looking at the technical matters.  When we hear from the groups that the Chairman mentioned we can discuss how the proposal would compare with best practice.  What Deputy Daly has done is a very important piece of work.  More power to your elbow, Deputy.</p></speech>

First, I fully concur with the Deputy that it is more unfortunate that the template would be the 22 hours of solitary confinement.  I would absolutely believe that we should be looking at a lot less than that.</p> <p>  A question that I put to Deputy O'Callaghan on his Bill, is there a particular template in respect of the 15 consecutive days and 30 days in any year?  Are there international comparators in terms - I hesitate to say it - of  best practice, heaven forbid in terms of solitary confinement?  I am asking the question to tease out the construction of the Deputy's proposition.  In relation to section 2 and the amendments of the sections, I absolutely support where the Deputy wants to bring this, but can she elaborate on section 2 (2A) "(d) no prisoner with a diagnosed mental illness or disability shall be subject to solitary confinement;".  Is there any weakness in that wording by using the word "disability", and the wide understanding and application that can have because it is such a broad term in terms of many absences of ability or impaired abilities.  Is there a weakness that the provision could fail to be applied in the sense that the subsection refers to a diagnosed mental illness?  Might the reference to disability merit some strengthening in order to ensure certainty?</p> <p>  While in her response Deputy Daly laid the responsibility for protections in the prison system on the system itself: that protective solitary confinement was not an excuse or could not be, other measures have to be found in terms of protecting those who are detained in a prison environment, I am being a devil's advocate here.  Are there instances where solitary confinement would be requested and would the measures contained work adversely in regard to such a situation?  I have no personal knowledge of such a case, but I am trying to tease it out.  At the end of the day I would like the Bill to be all the Deputy intends.</p> <p>  There is no other member indicating, and I know that Deputy Daly has another appointment.  Would she like to respond to our collective contributions?</p></speech>

Unlike Deputy O'Callaghan, I do not have the legal expertise to answer the more technical points but the discussion has been good.  The committee secretariat gave us a good pack, which gives a breakdown of the information for which Senator Conway was looking.</p></speech>

They give a total breakdown of the people on restrictive regimes, which is the new term for solitary confinement.  The hours are given, as are the reasons such as punishment, the protection of vulnerable prisoners - voluntary, and the protection of vulnerable prisoners - involuntary.  Special observation is also a reason, but the Minister had a problem with this because it meant people with severe mental illnesses were being placed in closed supervision areas on a solitary basis.  There are huge issues around people with mental health problems and some severely psychotic cases are not being cared for adequately in the Prison Service, although I am sure Michael Donnellan will deal with it.  There is a plan to develop a unit in the midlands prison but it will only take small numbers and many of prisoners are in isolation because they have requested it themselves.  They are afraid and feel at risk or they have other mental health issues.</p> <p>  The figures are very useful for answering some of the questions.  Medical research states that the maximum period should be 15 days and that any more than that causes irreversible psychological damage to set in.  We are trying to manage these cases while also managing the prison.  We want to keep it to under 15 days but we also propose to exclude certain groups of vulnerable people from ever being placed on such a regime.</p> <p>  I take the point about disability and such an amendment would need to be adopted in a hurry.  Deputy Chambers made a point about prisoners spending 19 hours in cells and I wanted to have a provision on this in the Bill but we thought it might not pass Second Stage.  The IPRT figures give a breakdown of the figures and 19 hours is the figure in some areas.  The Minister would probably make the argument that a maximum period would be more difficult to manage from an administrative point of view.  If somebody spends 19 hours in a cell but gets five hours outside to have a great time and to socially interact, that would actually help but that is often not the case.  That is why we propose a provision that there be meaningful human contact because people in solitary confinement are often let out for exercise but not allowed to talk to, or interact with, anybody.  That is where the damage is being done.  It is not a lack of exercise but a lack of meaningful human contact, sometimes for periods of years.  All the best penal policy would have it that the more a person spends outside the cell the better it is, but this creates issues for prison management and, sadly, a lot of times this comes down to resources.  People have to stay in cells because there are not enough staff.  I would certainly be prepared to accept an amendment to 19 hours.  I also take the point about disability and I believe we can work on the other issues.</p></speech>

These are the highest category.  Rule 63 allows people to voluntarily go to the prison governor and the latest figure gives 389 as the number of people who have done so.  The vast majority would be in a gang and there would be a security risk, that is a risk to their well-being as a result of the criminal activity for which they were serving time.  Some, however, have deep mental health problems and do not want to be around others.  If somebody asks to be removed from human contact the medical view would be that it would be a serious indication of underlying problems.  It is sometimes a prison management issue but it should not be.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.697" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciaran Staunton" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22017021500002#C00300"><p>I am the chairman of the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform.  I have worked in the United States for over 30 years and dealt with Irish people who have gone there illegally, from the era of the Donnelly visas in the 1980s to the Morrison visas in the 1990s to Ted Kennedy, John McCain and many others.  I am sure I have met many Members who have travelled to the United States.  I have circulated some of my remarks, following which I understand I will take questions.</p> <p>  I am accompanied by Ms Karen McHugh who has been dealing with people for many years.  She lived in London but is now dealing with people who are returning home, especially to rural Ireland.  I am also accompanied by Ms Maureen O'Sullivan who lived in the United States for many years and is now helping people who are returning to Ireland.  Mr. Michael McMahon is a leader of the group Families of the Undocumented Irish.</p> <p>  Addressing the issues that face returning citizens feeds into a larger national plan for rural revitalisation and is, I believe, the desire of most members of the committee.  The benefits of economic recovery have not been evenly distributed across rural and other areas.  Since the demise of the Celtic tiger, over 300,000 people have left the jurisdiction.  Probably 100,000 have left the North.  Emigration continues to affect rural parts of Ireland to a greater extent than urban areas.  We have found that in rural areas at least one in four households has been directly affected by emigration since 2006.  </p> <p>  Naturally, some people may want to come back to Ireland.  We know about the uncertainty that has been created by the Trump Administration.  People who have lived in the United States for ten or 15 years are trying to figure out whether they need to come back to Ireland because the last President did not do anything for them.  When they come back, they will face a number of issues, on which I will touch briefly, but I will not go into them in depth because there are so many to be addressed. </p> <p>  Some obstacles for those returning to rural Ireland include securing entitlements from the national reserve because they must have a green certificate and show their tax returns for 2013 or 2014.  Everyone knows that when a person is working illegally, he or she cannot pay taxes; therefore, he or she is deemed ineligible.  I could go into that issue further.</p> <p>  Taking out car insurance is another issue in rural Ireland.  After being after away for two to five years, a person loses his or her no claims bonus and goes back to the start of the insurance process.  A friend of ours expected to pay &euro;430 for car insurance, but because she had been away for ten years her the cost of insurance policy came in at &euro;1,900.  </p> <p>  The position on driving licences is crazy and getting worse.  People from counties Kerry, Galway and Mayo and so on who have been out of the country for over ten years have to start from scratch.  If they return from California, their Californian driving licence is no good, but if they come back from Canada, their licence is deemed to be fine and can be changed for an Irish one.  If a person returns to west Kerry, having lived in the Bronx for many years, and shows his or her driving licence to the authorities, he or she will have to start from scratch.  He or she will have to obtain another licence, have L-plates on a car and sit the driving test which will involve paying thousands of euro for driving lessons.  In the meantime, he or she cannot drive on major roads.</p><p>One has to pay thousands of euro to get driving and in the meantime one cannot drive on the major roads that one could have driven on previously.</p><p> To open a bank account now, one must, according to some, have utility bills.  Again, we have found there are waivers.  As one of our people said recently when she met the Irish ambassador to the US, it is easier for an illegal to open a bank account in America than it is for someone to open a bank account when he or she returns home.  It is absolutely disgraceful.  Loans are a big issue when someone moves here and wants to check in with the bank.  If people want to buy into farming, they must show they have basic payments but they would not have anything along those lines.  The US system of credit rating is not recognised in Ireland, although it is recognised throughout the states so a person has no credit rating and is starting from zero.  People cannot get first-time buyers' allowance if they have owned a house, so again they are being penalised.</p><p> We continuously say we are not talking about returning Irish emigrants but returning Irish citizens.  Nowhere in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann does it say that once a person leaves the country for any number of years that one is no longer a full Irish citizen.  Look at the 1916 executed leaders.  James Connolly, Thomas Clarke and Major John McBride were returned Irish emigrants, or leaders.  Michael Collins lived for many years in London.  Michael Davitt, the founder of the Land League, would not even be regarded as being eligible to farm in Ireland at the moment.  Those are some of the areas.</p><p> What is the Government to do?  All the issues we have discussed have not been created by bureaucracy but by Governments and Departments.  We have tried to deal with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for quite some time on a number of those issues but it has fallen on deaf ears.  We have also tried to deal with the Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora on a number of those issues because they are issues about which we have talked in the past.  When the wheels lift up on the airplane, the Irish citizen is dealt with by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade but when that airplane lands, the Irish citizen is thrown to the wind.  In regard to education, for example, if someone wants to go back to school after being away, which is what happened to Ms Sullivan, he or she has to pay a non-EU rate or wait three years in the country before going back into education.  It is the same for people who come back from America or Australia and they have Irish children.  If their Irish children go back into national school or into first or second year of post-primary, they are fine for third level but if they go back in any later than that, their children are not treated equally as Irish citizens.</p><p> Who is looking after the 300,000 people from every constituency who were on the census in 2006 but who have disappeared?  When they come back and run into problems, what agency or who looks after them?  We know there was a big announcement in 2015 of an agency which was supposed to meet quarterly and was supposed to issue reports.  I have yet to get any reports.  I have asked the person in charge about issues and we are still getting the standard response, which is very hurtful to anybody who has been an emigrant.  How many people are we talking about?  How many people are coming back?  How many farmers are there?  The Constitution does not count heads, as far as I know.</p><p> The same issues come up over and over when people come back.  There are always new situations but most of the situations we face have came about over the last number of years.  Most of the people who went away in the 1980s and came back in the 1990s and have been credited by many taoisigh and parties of creating a landing pad for the Celtic tiger did not face these issues.</p><p> We say we want people to come back to rural Ireland and that great work has been done in rural Ireland on the big problems.  However, we all agree the Internet is a disaster.  We do not need to reach up to the very high things; we can deal with the low-hanging fruit.  It is all within the gift of Departments.  Every issue I have raised can be dealt with but people do not care.  I say with a heavy heart that there is a complete lack of empathy among Government agencies as to the plight of returning citizens.  As the chairman of Irish Lobby for Immigration for Reform, I have written on behalf of the organisation and the letters I got from Government agencies regarding returning Irish emigrants are absolutely appalling.  I would not even put them in the public domain because I do not think anyone should be embarrassed to that degree.  However, I do not believe that the people who wrote our great Constitution thought that their people would be dealt with like that.  </p><p> I would like to see this committee play a bigger role.  We are all familiar with the famous book, "No one Shouted Stop!", from the 1960s which was written by the great John Healy.  We are in a position again where these people are coming back and are being treated so appallingly.  It is disgraceful.  We do not have anyone in the D&aacute;il or at this committee.  I will not name names but would this committee cry "stop"?  What this committee is trying to do is maintain and to hold on to rural Ireland and yet those who want to come back to where they were born, to family and to family farms, are faced with obstacles, including in terms of banking.</p><p> I will certainly answer any questions on where we might go from here.  We know that it is all do-able.  I will wrap up with that.</p></speech>

Before I go to members, I will ask Ms Karen McHugh to say a few words.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.700" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Karen McHugh" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22017021500002#D00300"><p>I am the CEO of Safe Home Ireland which was set up in 2000 to support older Irish emigrants who wanted to return to their native counties.  Over the last couple of years, we have broadened our remit to provide advice and information to all returning Irish emigrants.  Our base is in Mulranny, County Mayo, but we have outreach offices in Limerick and in Galway and I am based in Portlaoise.  We cover the Twenty-six Counties and also some of the other counties when people want to come back to Northern Ireland.  We try to have an all-Ireland approach, although our remit in terms of our funding is the Twenty-six Counties.</p> <p>  We have a lot of issues and concerns.  I presented to the interdepartmental committee on diaspora affairs in November and outlined all the challenges and barriers we felt were pertinent and that came to our attention.  We did not address the issue of farming as I would not be as confident to speak on that, although I came from a farm in Sligo.</p> <p>  Over the last couple of years, we have seen a drop in the numbers returning and we believe one crucial reason is the barriers and challenges.  It is quite concerning because we have a service and a facility and we provide outreach.  We visit anybody who returns, whether an elder person, a family or a younger person.  We can work with that person when he or she comes back.  I lived in London for many years and returned to Ireland.  I went back again to London because I could not settle here as I found I had come back to a different country but I was drawn back again.  It is quite challenging to get any kind of support or assistance.  When I went to get my car taxed, I went to the post office and queued for about half an hour only to be told that people do not tax their car in the post office.  In England, everything is done through the post office.  I refer to basic, little things like that.</p> <p>  Many of the challenges and barriers are around issues such as driving, housing, social protection, employment, the standard of one's health care, family, Brexit and the undocumented in America.  I have a paper, which I am happy to circulate to members.  I will not go through it now but we presented it to the interdepartmental working group in November.</p><p>I have a paper which I do not propose to read, but I am happy to circulate it to the committee.  It is a paper we presented to the Department in November.  </p><p> We believe the barriers can be lifted.  We have been able to negotiate some of the challenges for older Irish emigrants.  For example, Safe Home Ireland has an arrangement in place with the local authorities and the housing associations which allows it to access housing for any person over 60 years in need of social housing.  The agency also has arrangements in place with the Department of Social Protection and the banks.  The arrangement with the Department of Social Protection is in connnection with PPNs because unless a person has been living in the country, he or she does not have one.  We have been able to put in place provisions for people who are over 60 years.  The arrangement has been in place since the year 2000; therefore, as stated by Mr. Staunton, it is possible to address all of the barriers and challenges and we have been able to do so for a particular cohort.  When families and young people want to return, access to housing, PPNs, banking and so on present a huge challenge.  For those who have a car, the process to bring it with them is not straightforward.  The rules in this regard are discretionary such that what is applicable in one area versus another will differ significantly.  As stated by Mr. Staunton, there must be good will towards and empathy with returning emigrants.  </p><p> While everybody is agreed on the need to bring the 70,000 people concerned home, there is not much of a focus on what needs to be done to make this possible and happen.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade does tremendous work abroad, but the practice of making it happen is not straightforward.  Safe Home Ireland received more than 700 new inquiries last year from people who wanted to return to Ireland but were unable to do so because they were not in a position to buy a property and because accessing social or private rented accommodation was a challenge.  Those who would like to come back are people who would be working and paying taxes, contributing to the economy, etc., or who would have worked here before they left.  They now want to return to the land of their birth, to have children, to be near their families and, unfortunately, in relation to the cohort we represent - people over the age of 60 years - to die, which is sad because many only come back to be buried here when they die.  We have to make this happen.  If there is a will, there is a way.  Safe Home Ireland, working with others, is happy to support and progress and also lobby for it.  It is possible to do it.</p></speech>

I have been dealing with Safe Home Ireland in County Mayo for many years.  I thank all those involved for their support and assistance in bringing many people home to County Kerry to end their days in the place they left 40 or 50 years ago.  I thank them for the part they have played in assisting the people concerned to return home to end their days in their home country.</p> <p>  I have personal experience of some of the issues highlighted, including the one highlighted by Mr. Staunton of licence renewal.  I know of a young man who passed his driving test in Ireland and received a full licence and who then went to work in the United States for a few years.  His driving licence has now expired, but he is unable to renew it without coming home to do so, which is ridiculous and shameful.  As I understand it, he will be required to re-sit the driving test when he comes back.  As stated by the delegates, emigrants are unable to open bank accounts and so on.  </p> <p>  One gets the impression that the Government does not want the people concerned to come home because as long as they stay away, the unemployment figures remain low.  The reason the data for unemployment rates are so low is many young people have emigrated.  While previously there were two football teams in Sneem and Caherdaniel, now there is only one between the two areas because so many young people have emigrated.  That gives us an idea of just how many young people are emigrating from rural areas.  </p> <p>  It was mentioned that returning farmers had no entitlements.  Young farmers living here who received their green certificates in 2014 and 2015 had no entitlements to receive anything from the national reserve in 2016.  </p> <p>  A week or so ago I raised in the D&aacute;il the question of what we, as Members of this House, were supposed to say to a young person who on returning home could not get insurance cover?  People living in areas such as Kilmarnock in Kilgarvan or Tureencahill in Gneeveguilla cannot get to Killarney unless they have a car.  We are all aware of the exorbitant cost of insurance, be it car or house insurance.  Every Member has been raising this issue in the D&aacute;il since the general election last year, in respect of which we were told the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, had commissioned an investigation.  We are now being told that the Government can do nothing about the issue.  This is not fair to young people, or even elderly people.  I know of a woman who was paying &euro;330 per annum for car insurance up to last year and whose premium this year is &euro;750.  We do not know the half of what is going on.</p> <p>  Farmers who move abroad for a year or two or even shorter periods cannot retain their farm payments.  What are we to say to people who want to come home but who cannot afford to buy a property?  They are in a catch 22 in that they cannot get onto a housing list because they are living abroad.  If they do come home, they will have nowhere to live and if they are not on the housing list, they will not be able to access rent allowance.  There are many questions that need to be answered and as elected Members, we feel adequate in not being able to tell the people concerned what they should do.  There are too many blockages in the system.  I know of a number of young people who have come to live in Ireland in their father's home but because they were not born here they cannot access PPS numbers.  According to the Department of Social Protection, it is not a matter that is within its bailiwick.  The same response has been received from other agencies.  What are the people concerned to do because if they cannot access PPS numbers, they cannot access social welfare benefits and so on?  Are they expected to live on the wind? </p> <p>  I thank the delegates for being here.  Ideas they give us will be taken on board.  We appreciate that they have taken the time to come here to highlight the problems they are experiencing.  We will do our best to help in any way we can.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.704" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1237" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22017021500002#E00400"><p>I thank the delegates for their presentations.  As somebody whose sister lived abroad for over ten years and came home in the past couple of years with a husband and a young family, I am aware of some of the challenges in adjusting to life back in Ireland.  My sister chose not to live close to the home place but in a rural village about half an hour away.  The local school in the village is happy to have my niece and two nephews in it.</p><p>She has set up her own business now.  They are well settled in.  I am aware that it is a difficult adjustment.  It would still be a difficult adjustment if every State agency was helping, because when people have lived abroad for a long time, there are changes when they return.  I am conscious as well that she had a lot of family support.  I imagine that Ms McHugh is talking about people who are closer to retirement age who might be living alone, may not be married, may not have a support network, and their family network at home might also be gone.  When we talk about returning emigrants as a cohort, there is a very different image in my mind of a man in his 70s who worked on the buildings in London all his life returning to live and die at home, whose family network and support network might be gone, as opposed to my sister in her 40s with a young family.  They are very different.  It is key to be mindful that there are different challenges for different returning emigrants.</p><p> Deputy Danny Healy-Rae has just left but I wanted to point out that while the unemployment rate is dropping, it is not because people have all emigrated.  Our employment rate is rising as well.  The glass is a bit half empty in everything he said.</p><p> Some of the challenges outlined are a challenge for people living in rural Ireland who never left.  Access to housing, private or otherwise, broadband, car insurance and health insurance are all challenges that we have to try to face here as a country.  I would like Ms McHugh to outline more about the challenges around the area of the PPS number.  That is very specific.  What are the challenges in getting a PPS number when one returns?  How can we streamline that process?  There is the issue of buying a house.  If one came home and had the means to buy a house, that is fine.  Is the issue here around the ability to get a mortgage?  I am not really sure.  Mr. Staunton mentioned buying a house in his presentation.  He might expand on what the big impediment there is.  It might be the access to finance more than anything else.  He said that getting electricity has been an issue as well.</p><p> These are practical things that we, as a committee, can get our teeth into.  I am not dismissing the others, but am saying that they are a challenge for all of us in rural Ireland.  The entitlement to the national reserve was mentioned there as well.  The national reserve has &euro;52.5 million.  It was the biggest pot ever in 2015, and there has been an application to the Commission to get increased flexibility for that.  It is financed by a direct cut to existing farmers.  Again, the issue might be around the Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC, level 6 requirement.  I was a farmer before I was a Deputy.  I did my green certificate and I did not get access to the national reserve, but I did inherit entitlements at home by going through that process.  It is probably a difficulty if somebody is coming home to land in their 40s or 50s and has never done a green certificate or similar.  That is going to be difficult to get around, because ultimately we have to be able to display it to Europe, because a lot is European money.  We also have to be able to display that people are serious about the farming enterprise that they are going into, and that they have displayed a desire.  Is it an issue for returning emigrants to access the necessary training requirements?  It is fair enough to expect somebody who wants that entitlement to do a level of training to show their seriousness about farming.</p></speech>

I returned from London.  I am familiar with the great work that both Ms McHugh, in Mulranny, and Mr. Staunton do with the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform.  I agree with much of what they are saying.  The minute one gets on a boat, as I did quite a long time ago, one loses citizenship.  One goes from being an Irish citizen to being an immigrant.  It is a case of out of sight, out of mind.  That is how it has been for decades, and the way that it still is.  Look at the most recent publication, Realising our Rural Potential.  The investment, work, creativity, education and experience that returning emigrants have brought to places like Mayo and elsewhere in rural Ireland is absolutely invaluable.  While it might be amusing to some people here, it is an extremely serious issue.  Why are we putting barriers in place?  Why, out of all of the 230 actions in here, which is a crazy number for a plan anywhere, do I not see anything - maybe there is somewhere - that is progressive or positive about barriers for returning emigrants here?  Emigrants formed, and because of the last cohort of people who have had to emigrate will in the future form, a huge part of the redevelopment and rebalancing of Ireland as a whole, yet they do not even deserve a mention in here.</p> <p>  We need to look at what can be practically done here.  I want to display my absolute dismay at both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael for not supporting voting rights for the diaspora.  I cannot for the life of me understand why they are afraid to give voting rights to the diaspora.  That is part of the crux of it.  If all of the diaspora, or at least a part worked out from how many years they had been abroad, had their voting entitlement, they would have to stand up and listen.  It would not be a case of them saying they need a few quid for something and that they will go out and shake down the diaspora, who are always good for a few quid, and that then they will forget about them again until the next time they need a few quid.  If they had voting rights here, including my relations, and if I had had voting rights while I was gone, then they would have to listen because they must listen to the electorate.  Until the diaspora or indeed Irish citizens in the North have a vote, they do not need to be listened to.  It is a bit like the matter in rural Ireland where there are Civil War politics, where they could go into a village and say: "There are 69 for me and 72 for you so off we go, why would we bother investing there?"  Why would they bother listening to the diaspora?</p> <p>  There are very practical things that can be done in each of the Departments, for example in the Department of Social Protection.  In particular, the habitual residency clause that was brought in has really caused awful problems, because citizens are then treated the same as anybody coming into this country who has never spent any time here.  There could be a desk in each of the Departments dedicated to the diaspora.  I take fully what was said by Mr. Staunton about it because my findings are that some of these Departments ask people why they do not go back to where they were.  There is that underlying sentiment of: "Do you really need to be here bothering me about this?  I have enough to do to look after the people who are there."  That attitude must change.  It is almost like rural-proofing of documents.  There needs to be diaspora-proofing of actions within each of the Departments, whether the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, or the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  The habitual residency clause needs to be changed to take into account Irish citizens.</p> <p>  We have gone through car insurance.  My colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty and I, and others cross-party, made a submission to the insurance industry about the huge problems that exist for returning emigrants.  I understand what Mr. Staunton is saying about farming.  The green certificate has to be done.  There have to be ways of doing that.  There is technology.  If somebody is planning to come from abroad, there is no reason why six months or 12 months beforehand, they cannot start doing a green certificate course online to make them ready.  Of course they need to be ready and have everything in place.  Let them have access to the national reserve based on that so that they can have their entitlements as well.  It is not about doing them any favours.  It is just about creating a level playing field and recognising what those young farmers will bring to that community in terms of ideas and attitudes.</p> <p>  The other big problem I come across relates to pensions.  If somebody worked here for three weeks in the summer in 1969, and they then come to get their pension here, the levelling out and the way it is averaged across the years means that person returning is at a very distinct disadvantage, and on a very reduced pension entitlement, if any at all.  If there was somebody in the pensions area who was looking specifically at that and dealing with that problem, it could be dealt with.  The other situation we have encountered of late is where spouses are split up, where the only way they can pay the mortgage is if the husband works abroad while the wife has to stay with the children.</p><p>In such cases, the husband will find himself becoming further alienated every six months in terms of his ability to access the systems here.</p><p> I ask the witnesses to comment on voting rights for the diaspora.  Do they share Sinn F&eacute;in's sentiments on the issue?  We are making efforts to have the voice of the diaspora placed front and centre in the political process and heard by the administration responsible for erecting all of these barriers.</p><p> I am not a permanent member of the joint committee but I have a special interest in hearing the comments of the emigrant groups represented.  I thoroughly commend them and Mr. McMahon and Ms Sullivan on the work they are doing.  I encourage them to continue their work.  I speak for my party colleagues in offering Sinn F&eacute;in's full support to emigrants.  We will lead the way in every we can for the diaspora. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.709" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciaran Staunton" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22017021500002#G00200"><p>I am disappointed Deputy Danny Healy-Rae had to leave the meeting before I addressed the some of the issues he raised.  I will start, however, by responding to Deputy Martin Heydon as I wish to clarify a matter.  While one should never blame the messenger, someone is giving misinformation.  For the past two years, a number of people who have returned from the United States and elsewhere have been told they are not eligible to apply for payment from the national reserve because they do not have a green certificate or tax returns for 2013 or 2014.  I have received letters on this issue.  When it was raised on the floor of the House the Minister of the day stated he was restrained by European Union regulations and his hands were tied.  We wrote to a number of Members of the European Parliament on the matter and Mr. Matt Carthy, MEP, wrote back stating there is no European regulation in place that requires a person to have a green certificate before he or she is deemed eligible for payment from the national reserve.  Without such a European requirement, a returned emigrant or a person who never left Kildare, Ballycroy or Connemara should have a right to access the national reserve.  It is a matter of record that there is no educational or training requirement in the relevant EU regulation.</p> <p>  In addition, the EU regulation does not set out any tax or income requirement.  Whether one is a new entrant, young farmer or someone like me who is a little on the wrong side of 40 or 50 years and may be returning from abroad, the EU has dictated that young farmers and new entrants to farming are the priority for the &euro;1.3 billion in funding it provides every year.  When the question is asked as to whether a new entrant is a suitable person for farming, a litmus test applies, regardless of whether the person grew up in a rural area and is returning to the country after 15 years abroad.</p> <p>  I examined the list showing the names of the 200 people who receive the largest amounts from the national reserve.  They include a sheikh from the Middle East who is worth $18 billion and receives &euro;150,000 from the national reserve.  Did he obtain a green certificate and show his tax certificate for 2014?  It also features the top six meat processors in Ireland, all of whom receive more than &euro;150,000 per annum.  Did they produce green certificates?  Are they suitable farmers?  I met a man in Louisburgh, County Mayo, the other day who does not have a green certificate but was fit to turn a calf around in a cow's womb the previous night.  Is he a suitable farmer?</p> <p>  Many of those who are being denied access to the national reserve are progressive farmers.  The other day, a senior official in the Department explained to me that there is an EU regulation in place on the type of farmer who is eligible.  I asked him to define this regulation.  This is a senior person who works for the Government and decides who is and is not a farmer.  I also asked him how many teats a Lanark had.  His answer was "four".  A Lanark is a type of a sheep which has two teats.  This is the person who decides who is suitable to be a farmer.  I wonder if the sheikh who receives &euro;150,000 could tell us how many teats a Lanark has.  People in Ballycroy and Connemara would certainly be able to answer the question. </p> <p>  According to the programme for Government, the Department will enable more money to reach the people for whom it is intended.  The average farmer receives approximately &euro;6,000 or &euro;8,000 if he is lucky.  The Government indicated it would reduce the cap on payments from &euro;150,000 to &euro;100,000.  As a result, the 300 people who received between &euro;100,000 and &euro;150,000 would have their payments reduced and the saving would be allocated to others.  This commitment has not yet been implemented.  We have written to the Minister and explained that there is no EU regulation and that the European Union has made clear it wants more young people to enter farming.  It has not stated it wants more sheikhs, meat processors, multimillionaire couch farmers and corporate farmers. </p> <p>  On the other points raised, personal public service, PPS, numbers are not a major issue for us because most returning emigrants had PPS numbers prior to leaving the country.  An issue was raised in respect of buying a house.  A returning emigrant from the United States, the country with which I am most familiar, is caught in the middle.  The national credit system in the United States is one of the best in the world and is recognised by many companies.  The three main banks in Ireland operate their own credit rating system, under which they can check a person's rating and whether he or she has foreclosed or has been unable to pay bills in the past.  They have not yet recognised the international credit systems recognised by most other countries.  These allow someone returning to Ireland to provide his or her social security number and credit rating.  The banks do not recognise these systems, however.</p> <p>  A person who has just landed in Ireland will not have a guaranteed income.  If someone from a rural area wishes to buy something, one of the first questions a banker will ask is how much he or she receives in basic payments because these payments are a guaranteed cheque from the Government that goes straight to the bank.  Returning emigrants who have sold a house abroad, for example, in London, before returning to Ireland are penalised by the banks because they will not be considered a first-time buyer, even though they will be buying a property in Ireland for the first time.  This means many returning emigrants must put down a deposit of 20% rather than 10% and are penalised again.  This is another banking related issue. </p> <p>  Deputy Danny Healy-Rae made two good points about driving licences.  For many years, the only form of identification many Irish people carried in the United States was an Irish driver's licence and most police departments accepted this form of identification because it features a photograph.  Many emigrants would post their licence home to have it renewed by their parents.  This is no longer possible because the licence holder must present in person to have a licence renewed.  Many legislators have become concerned about the Trump Presidency.  However, this is an issue that could be addressed in Ireland to make life a little easier for Irish emigrants in the United States.  Why can someone not present appropriate documentation and have a licence renewed on behalf of a son or daughter?  This is not brain surgery because it has been done for generations.  I am aware of someone who obtained a licence from the PSNI because he previously held a licence from both jurisdictions and could not get one here. </p> <p>  Senator Rose Conway-Walsh referred to the habitual residency clause.  The language used in this area is maddening.  The Senator referred to the old days.  When I moved to Cricklewood in London I took the ferry to Holyhead.  After spending every summer and Christmas with family in Ireland, people must now prove they intend to live on the land they worked and in the place they went to school and may have paid taxes.  It is an absolute disgrace that people have to ask any Government agency "An bhfuil cead agam dul abhaile?"</p><p> I read the report which was mentioned.  It is the second report; the honourable footballer from Kerry had a great report some years ago.  We in Mayo forget Kerry footballers' names very fast, if we can.  It is a brilliant report, but there is nothing in it about returning immigrants.  That is why I say we have been forgotten.  I ask the committee to recognise that the plight of returning emigrants should be considered first and foremost.  I often write to party members, who then send it across the aisle to the member who deals with diaspora affairs.  Diaspora affairs starts when a person leaves the country.  It is not a social service agency.  There is no agency to assist when one comes back.  Diaspora affairs is the agency that needs to address it.  </p><p> There are no EU regulations to stop anyone in Kerry, returning or otherwise, from not getting their entitlements because of a green certificate or anything else.  The idea that there is no money has been clearly stated.  The money was supposed to come from a clawback on either the sale or lease of entitlements.  Last year the Government position was that any clawbacks had a 50% penalty towards the national reserve.  That was for selling entitlements without land.  They also said that if a person leased without land, there was to be no clawback.  This information is in a parliamentary question that I can send to the committee.  Last year, instead of selling them on to people who may be willing to buy them, &euro;19 million worth of entitlements without land transferred hands.  Some were good cases, perhaps people with hospital issues.  Others were corporate farmers.  Of the &euro;19 million, not a penny went back into the national reserve.  From the people who sold them and paid a 50% penalty, &euro;13,000 went into the national reserve.  I am not certain of this, but the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine may have waived the payment.  In the agreement with the EU, the Government, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and most other member state governments said that if one leased without land one would have to pay a fine towards the national reserve, with the percentage to be decided.  In Scotland that fine is 50%.  Ireland did not impose a fine.  Every time Deputy Danny Healy-Rae asked the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to change something, the Department said that they had to get permission from the EU to do it.  Did they get permission from the EU to waive the penalty on leasing entitlements without land?  Did they just give a waiver, or did they decide that they did not want to charge a rate of 50%?  If they had, they would have recouped &euro;9 million.  Was &euro;19 million of entitlements traded between many very rich farmers and some people who had to lease them?  There was only roughly 20,000 sold.  The take from that last year was &euro;13,000.  That is why the well is dry.  That is why the sheikh can still get his money but the rural farmer cannot.</p><p> Senator Conway-Walsh mentioned that there should be a desk in each of the Departments, dedicated to the diaspora.  For many years we have called for a one-stop-shop so that a returning emigrant does not have to go from village to town to get their affairs in order.  People in Castlebar are being sent to Portlaoise or someplace else.  When we lobbied this Government to have a Minister for the diaspora, it did that.  Many years ago we had the same problems while working with illegals.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was more interested in international relations and did not want to touch the illegals issue.  Former Taoiseach, Mr. Brian Cowen, did a fantastic job putting a diaspora desk in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  He had to push against the people in power at the time.  We asked for a similar desk for returning emigrants.  In 2015 it was announced here at the global diaspora forum that this would come into being.  It was to be called an interdepartmental committee of the Irish abroad.  It was to meet quarterly, consult with other Government Departments, and issue reports.  I have never seen any reports.  I have seen very few meetings.  It is chaired by the Minister of State for the Diaspora and Overseas Development Aid, Deputy Joe McHugh.  I am calling for its work not just to be announced on paper, but to actually take place.  Cutting silage cannot be announced on paper; you go and you cut it, or you lose it and you will have no fodder.  We have a document called Annex X, but that is as good as we have seen from that committee.  I am still receiving letters from Ministers asking for more information about it.  This was supposed to be in place but still is not.</p><p> Everyone has opinions on voting rights.  I am gone from Ireland since before a lot of the members were born.  However, many Irish people overseas have voting rights for the Oireachtas.  If a person went to the right school they can vote in the Seanad elections, no matter what part of the world they are in.  Jim Crow could not have created this.   A person who has gone to the right third level school can vote on the university panel, even if they are 500 years in Australia.  If they are in New York or Santiago they can still vote.  No matter the place, there is nothing stopping them.  Why is it that going to one university means a person can vote in the Seanad elections, but a qualified carpenter cannot?  Does the Constitution recognise two types of citizen?  I am not a constitutional scholar, but in no place do I see that special circumstances apply to tradespeople or those who attend certain schools.  Under segregation in the south of the United States people had to take a literacy test before being allowed to vote.  It is not as if this is not being currently done, so why is it not being expanded?  Many European bloc countries have only become democracies in my time.  I have seen the lines outside their New York consulates.  I saw the lines outside the Moldovan consulate in New York recently.  We know there are big parties at the US Embassy here every year.  Some of the parties turned into a bit of a wake this year, for obvious reasons.  Why is that not expanded?  I cannot see why people are frightened of democracy, whether we like it or not - and some of us do not like it at the moment.  Why does the person who went to Trinity College Dublin become a better Irish citizen than the person who finished carpentry school?</p><p> I think I have finished.  My apologies for getting carried away.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.711" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1237" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22017021500002#H00200"><p>I was previously a member of the agricultural committee.  The witness has addressed access and the green certificate, and moved on to the issue of redistribution, which took place under the last Common Agricultural Policy.  This was intended to bring about a more balanced approach.  It was a very contentious issue which saw a divide between the so-called productive farmer and more marginal farmers.  We had to make sure we got it right.</p><p>That debate is probably more suited to an agriculture committee than here, but there is a balance involved.  We have a burgeoning food and drink industry in this country, including the growth of distilleries and artisan food producers, so it is important to maintain the farmers who produce the required ingredients.  Those are value-added jobs that can be accessed by returning emigrants.  </p><p> The Minister, Deputy Coveney, held the agriculture portfolio when we had the EU Presidency which included a re-negotiation of the CAP.  He led the way with a young farmers' measure that had never been in a previous CAP agreement.  In fairness, that should be recognised.  </p><p> Leasing was mentioned and the difficulty of clawing back costs.  We have made a number of changes to long-term leasing in recent years.  Up to now this has been a big issue for somebody coming home who wanted a farm but did not have access to land.  We work on a conacre system which is a disaster for young or mature farmers who want to get into farming but do not have access to land.</p><p> One cannot plan for the future based on a year-on-year system.  We have actively gone out of way to try to encourage long-term leasing, which is the right thing to do.  That is particularly so for someone who comes back but may only have a small piece of land and needs to expand to reach the necessary economies of scale.  The long-term leasing measure is really worthwhile because it allows supports for a farmer leasing land, as well as allowing such a person to plan over a five or six-year period.</p><p> Ultimately, each EU member state must have its own set of rules which have to be approved in terms of how they plan to redistribute.  The green certificate is a fair way of doing it.  Anyone who takes the time to do such training is showing a real commitment.  If we did not have that system here - leaving aside returning emigrants for a minute - somebody who inherits a farm but may be working in a financial services job in Dublin could get access to all the supports.  They would be an armchair farmer rather than an active one, which would not be fair.  We must be careful that in trying to look after one cohort we do not make the system unfit for purpose.  My view is that the green certificate is the right way to go.  We need to work on improving access to it for returning emigrants.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.713" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciaran Staunton" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22017021500002#J00200"><p>Let me just go back on that because there is a great miscommunication.  No one is saying that a farmer should lose entitlements.  I am saying that a young farmer who comes back to Ireland is told: "Don't bother applying unless you have this in place, because this is what we are looking for."  On the other hand when we open the newspapers we see there is a sheik in the Middle East in receipt of a payment.  How can anyone sit here and justify giving a sheik worth $18 billion some &euro;150,000 a year?  He has no green certificate.  If we look at the top ten we are not talking about food and drink industries or middle-aged farmers who bought land beside them, worked to reclaim it and became progressive farmers.  We are not saying that, but a number of people are getting money who are armchair farmers or armchair millionaires.  Last year, many of them got the bones of &euro;150,000.  Most of them would not know the difference between an Angus cow and a buck goat.</p> <p>  I do not want to say that our party did this, or the other party did that.  Over the past 35 years I have said that, regardless of party, when a person lands in Cricklewood-Broadway or the Bronx, no one gives a hoot what party you campaign for.  There is no such thing as political party affiliation when someone looks for a job, a social security number or a couch to stay on.  No one gives a hoot, so I do not want people to say "Our party did this" or "Someone else did that".  All I am telling the committee is about the facts as they are today on the ground.  It is absolutely impossible.  What is even worse is that for two years we were blamed and told: "My hands are tied by the EU."  After two years of searching we found out that there was no EU regulation.  The lack of empathy adds insult to injury.  We were misled for two years and were then told that hands were tied.  We are getting the moral equivalent of saying: "There's a hole in the wall.  We're looking into it."</p></speech>

The sheik that Mr. Staunton mentioned would have been entitled to more money in the past.  The reason somebody who owned extensive amounts of stud land is getting that money is that historically, and still to this day, they have a large holding and a lot of cattle.  They are farming productively.</p></speech>

The level of passion is exemplary and it is good to see it at an Oireachtas committee.  It is also good to hear these points being made.  I am my party's spokesperson on the diaspora so I am dealing with every single issue that has been discussed, and more, on a daily basis.  I know that there is a lot more that Mr. Staunton has not been able to go into.  </p><p>I will ask him to elaborate on a couple of things so that we can get them on the record.  I have met Mr. McMahon before and I know that there are major issues due to the change in the US Presidency.  There were issues previous to that in the US also concerning the undocumented there.  I would like to hear from the witnesses about what is happening on the ground at the moment.  I am getting e-mails from family members here who are terrified about what will happen to their brethren who are undocumented and living in the United States.  What can we do immediately to try to support them, either by staying where they are or by coming back?  </p><p>It was mentioned that Ms Maureen Sullivan has personal experience of the barriers to coming home, so it would be important to hear about them.  It is worth noting the work that has been done by the &quot;Generation Emigration&quot; column in <i>The Irish Times</i>and by the <i>Irish News</i>and other publications on highlighting these type of issues.  People's stories can really strike a chord, so perhaps Ms Sullivan could tell us about her experiences.</p><p>The most poignant line I heard came from Ms McHugh who said that people do not get back to die but they get back to be buried.  That comment will stay with me because it is so true.  There are many people who want to return because they are estranged from family and friends, or may have mental health difficulties or social problems.  They find it almost impossible to return, so the witnesses might tell us what can be done in that respect.  What measures could the Department of Health and the Department of Social Protection take to deal with those matters fairly quickly?</p><p>I have a sense that there is a certain amount of cherry-picking.  One often heard of a Government announcement about a scheme with &euro;1 million available.</p><p>Some years ago, in response to a large number of fishermen losing lobster pots in storms, a famous and fantastic scheme with substantial funding was introduced.  The red tape involved made applying for funding almost impossible, however, and very little money was drawn down.  I get a similar sense sometimes with regard to the diaspora.  We may say the doors are open and emigrants will always be made welcome but we pursue a policy of placing practical obstacles in the way of emigrants returning.  The message to emigrants who are farmers, carpenters, block layers and so on is that they should come back but not just yet, whereas emigrants with plenty of money in their pockets and those who work in information technology, global financial services or similar sectors will be welcomed back.  There is a sense that we are engaging in cherry-picking.  We want certain emigrants to return, for example, junior doctors and nurses, and we will make it easier for these emigrants to do so.  Do the witnesses believe there is a form of political blocking occurring and that things are not moving as quickly as we would hope?</p><p> The figures provided appear to be an underestimate because figures available to me show that between 450,000 and 500,000 people have emigrated since 2006.  I will not argue with Mr. Staunton on the issue, however, having just observed his ability to engage in political debate.</p><p> Mr. Staunton's comments on the national reserve were extremely important and members must take them on board.  Ms McHugh and Mr. Staunton alluded to the interdepartmental agency announced in 2015.  What engagement have the witnesses had with the agency?  Is it moving on the issues on which agreement has been reached?  What actions must be speeded up?</p><p> What type of engagement is taking place with the Minister of State with responsibility for diaspora affairs?  Are he and his officials in regular contact with the emigrant organisations?  What progress is being made?  In fairness to the former Minister of State with responsibility for diaspora affairs, Mr. Jimmy Deenihan, following his appointment, there was significant activity and public engagement on diaspora issues and he travelled extensively.  Matters appear to have quietened down a little.  I have probably called for a debate on diaspora affairs ten times since the new Seanad first sat and it is disappointing that we have not yet had such a debate.  I am not sure if the D&aacute;il has had a debate on the issue since the Government was appointed but I have a sense that the momentum on diaspora affairs is slowing, which is worrying.  </p><p> Voting rights for emigrants have been alluded to by previous speakers and I concur with the point that a citizen is a citizen regardless.  I would prefer to hear from the witnesses rather than have members rabbiting on about issues.  It is very important to get their contributions on the record in order that the joint committee can then consider practical actions that could be taken to follow up on the issues they have raised.  I thank the organisations represented today for the work they have been doing both quietly and publicly for years.  It is very important that the committee supports them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.730" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1415" speakername="Maura Hopkins" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22017021500002#K00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation.  I had reason to meet Ms McHugh in another capacity, one which is, in many ways, similar as it involves supporting refugees who will come to my home town of Ballaghaderreen in the coming months, an issue on which she has been very supportive.</p> <p>  The presentation and the discussion that followed laid out many difficulties and practical challenges faced by emigrants.  I am aware of some of these difficulties.  Recently, for example, I dealt with a nurse who returned from the United Kingdom and had secured work as a care attendant while waiting for her registration to be processed by An Bord Altranais.  The administrative delays in processing her registration were excessive and unnecessary.  Thankfully, her registration is now complete and she is working as a nurse in a rural area.  Registration with An Bord Altranais must be processed in a timely and efficient manner.  In the case I highlighted, the excessive administrative delays resulted in the nurse working as a care attendant for a considerable period during which she could have been working as a nurse.  I am, therefore, familiar with some of the challenges faced by returning emigrants. </p> <p>  As someone from a rural area in County Roscommon, I am also familiar with challenges facing the farming sector in rural areas of the west.  We need to encourage productive young farmers.  I ask Mr. Staunton to respond to some questions on the young farmer scheme and national reserve.  He will be aware of the terms and conditions that attach to the scheme.  The three main eligibility criteria are that applicants must be aged under 40 years, have an educational qualification and may not have held a holding for more than five years.  It appears emigrants wishing to access the scheme face further stumbling blocks.  Mr. Staunton referred to a requirement to produce tax returns for two years, for example.  What difficulties do emigrants face in accessing the scheme other than the three criteria I cited?  I encounter cases involving people who are not emigrants but experience problems accessing the scheme.  A forgotten cohort of farmers cannot access the national reserve, even though they are aged under 40 years, because their holding was established prior to 2008.  My specific question, therefore, is to ask Mr. Staunton to indicate what criteria outside the terms and conditions are causing a problem. </p> <p>  Mr. Staunton referred to engagement with Ministers and departmental officials and Ms McHugh referred to engagement with the interdepartmental agency.  What, if any, progress has been made with the interdepartmental agency?  I note Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh asked a similar question.  I will raise issues with the relevant Ministers, including the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Michael Creed, whom I will contact with regard to the young farmer scheme.  I have raised with the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, the administrative challenges faced by nurses wishing to register here.  The witnesses laid out many more practical difficulties. </p> <p>  Unfortunately, as I have quorum duty on the Order of Business in the Seanad, I may not be present when the witnesses reply.  If that is the case, I will read the Official Report later. </p></speech>

He was honest and told the Department he owned a house in England.  The house is idle while he is here minding his mother who is almost 100 years old but he has been refused the carer's allowance on that basis.  He does not have any other income while he is here.  That is one problem I have encountered.</p> <p>  In another case, a person who wanted to become an Irish citizen had to demonstrate that a certain amount was held in a bank account before an application would be considered.  The person in question is Irish to all intents and purposes but must show a deposit of, I believe, &euro;50,000 in a bank account.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.732" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1410" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22017021500002#K00400"><p>I am sorry I missed the presentations.  I found the witnesses' interaction with other members very interesting.  I know Karen McHugh from the fantastic work she does with Doras Luimn&iacute;.  I am at a disadvantage because I am not from a rural area, although I have connections in rural Ireland.  For this reason, I cannot tap into large parts of the conversation on agricultural issues.</p> <p>  Like everyone else present, members of my family are living abroad and I know what it means to say goodbye to someone in an airport and to have an empty chair at the table at Christmas.  I recall having long distance telephone calls with relatives in the United States in the 1980s when I could have sworn I was communicating with someone on the moon.  We all know what that was like.</p><p>I am not a member of the Government.  I do not accept that Government does not care or that politicians in power do not care.  The current Government appointed a Minister with responsibility for the diaspora and one of the Taoiseach's nominees to the Seanad, of which I am a Member, is Senator Billy Lawless, who has been dealing with this issue for some time.</p><p> On the voting rights issue, in my opinion voting is a real and tangible connection with the country one comes from.  A number of years ago when I was on my way to the RTE studios by car I passed the Romanian Embassy.  It was a very wet night yet the queue to vote in the Romanian presidential election was unbelievable.  This was a wonderful opportunity for Romanian people living in Ireland to have a say in the country of their birth.  I am sure if we had the same capacity abroad for Irish citizens in respect of domestic elections it would have the same powerful effect.  That sense of connection is very real.  </p><p> As the witnesses will be aware, one of the topics for discussion by the Constitutional Convention was whether Irish citizens living outside the State should have voting rights in presidential elections and whether that would require constitutional amendment.  As far as I am aware, that was recommended by the convention.  In the witnesses' estimation, would a constitutional referendum be required in respect of the extension of voting rights in local elections and European elections to Irish citizens living abroad?  My instinct is that it would not.  What steps could be taken in a relatively short timeframe, outside of a referendum, to allow this opportunity to be afforded to Irish citizens abroad?  I have a sister living in London and a brother living in Canada.  I know that they would both greatly appreciate the opportunity to have their say in the country they left.  Some people leave with a heavy heart and others leave because they cannot wait to get out of here.  While all people may not avail of this right the fact that they can do so could mean an awful lot to them.   </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.734" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciaran Staunton" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22017021500002#L00200"><p>I thank Senators and Deputies for their questions.  As Senator Hopkins has to leave soon, I will start with her questions.  Senator Hopkins, as of now, is non-rural but she is welcome in rural Ireland.  We are welcoming people at all times.  The reason so many young people are emigrating is broken down into particular areas.  When the EU introduced its changes in relation to young farmers it said that the changes were applicable to new entrants because it knew that to set down a particular age in that regard would be discriminatory.  A new entrant is not a person who is bored and has billions of euro but a farmer who wants to buy back or return to the land.  The forgotten farmer and young farmer is also covered by this measure.  As someone old enough to remember the cow and calf schemes of the 1970s and all the various other schemes of that time I recall that regardless of what the problem was it always easy enough to sort out.  I am speaking about a time when most people did not have a home telephone such that a local representative would have to visit a house late at night to deal with issues.  As such, I come at this from an old fashioned point of view.  None of these issues is huge.  I have read the European regulations.  I have recently come to the view that there are many European bureaucrats who want to hide behind a massive cloak or, to borrow President Trump's word, wall of Europeanism.  In other words, one cannot feed the cat milk during the day because the EU says so.  None of the regulations around those groups is looked at.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, the Minister has stated that we do not have any additional funding in the budget.  We have overspent.  One of the reasons there is no money left is because no provision was made for a reasonable claw-back on sales or leasing of entitlements.  By kicking this down the road, more people are coming on side.  The advisory committee on CAP, which is made up of farmers' groups, is considering these issues.  However, these issues are relevant not only to farmers but to lobbyists on behalf of the meat processors who are getting big money, the sheep farmers and various other groups.  One group is being paid, on average, &euro;120,000 t &euro;150,000 per annum.  At the other end people are getting &euro;8,000 to &euro;10,000 per annum.  One group comes from east-south-east.  Many of them are getting money based on what business they were doing in 2000 and 2002.  I was in the restaurant business for many years.  I wish I could get income today based on what I was getting then.  However, that is beside the point.  All of the areas mentioned are areas uniquely created by farming groups and the EU.  The average age of a farmer in Ireland or Europe today is 55 plus years, which begs the question, if we do not get new entrants where will that leave us in 20 years?  The people who today are getting &euro;150,000 per annum are not 20 plus year olds, 30 plus year olds or 40 plus year olds.  What will they be doing in 25 years?  <br/><br/>Everybody in rural Ireland knows that every euro from Europe that is invested in rural Ireland is multiplied three or four in terms of spending power.  It does not go to the Cayman Islands or into high interest investments.  The first cheque goes to the co-operative; the second cheque goes to somebody else who then hires people to carry out work on land, to contractors or to the people who make silage or haul cattle.  A sum of &euro;10,000 paid to a farmer in rural Ireland results in greater spending power than does &euro;100,000 paid to a meat processor.  <br/><br/>On engagement with Ministers, given my age I have been dealing with Ministers dating back to the late great Brian Lenihan senior who famously said that this island is not big enough for all of us, which has been said many times since other parties.  I would never say that anybody I have ever met does not care about the situation.  I have known, the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, since he was a school teacher.  I first met him when he came to London to meet the agencies dealing with emigrant housing issues.  While some of the people I have met may not have empathy with others it would not be fair to say that I have ever met an elected official who does not care about the situation.  I have often had to contact personnel from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in the middle of the night and vice versa.  I want to ensure that nobody here today gets the impression that anybody on this side of the table believes that any elected official now or at any time since I began dealing with this issue in 1984 does not care.  I do not accept that.  I do, however, agree that there is very little empathy shown by officials in most Departments.<br/><br/>Leaving aside what was done by a particular member, it is important that people saw it.  I am non-political either side of the water.  I agree with what was said about the airports.  Every year in the weeks before Christmas there are cameras everywhere in the airport filming the great scenes of people returning home for Christmas.  What bothers me about this is that there are no cameras at the airports in the first week in January when broken hearted mothers and grandparents are saying goodbye to their children, not knowing when they will see them again.  I recall that in a letter some years ago to <i>The Irish Times</i>from former Deputy Proinsias de Rossa on the same issue he mentioned the lighted candle in the window of the home of the President, which is magnificent in terms of symbolism but we need to do more.  For more than 30 years, I have been witnessing what happens at the airport.  Most people do not know what that is like.</p><p>If one does not know what it is like, one cannot learn from the outside.  One will never learn from watching it, but if one lives it, one will never forget it.  There is also the issue of long-distance calls.  Boy, this was brilliant in the 1980s.  One called the international operator from New York, who called Dublin, who called Westport, who called Liscarney on a local phone to get through to home and sometimes one would hear, "Tell him to call back, Tessie is not home at the moment."  That is how far we have come.  Later when we got direct calls, people half in the tank and falling asleep called home and wound up with a $300 bill.</p><p> The empty chair has also been mentioned.  In my own life, I have an empty chair for different reasons.  The empty chair is there over the years.  I am talking about people who have never been to a nephew's or niece's communion, who have missed every family occasion, but the only thing they do not miss - and I have seen people borrow the money for this - is coming home to bury the father or mother, or a brother killed in an accident.  People borrowed that money or loaned it, as we in the bar business often did.  Where one lifts a fellow down from the stool when he gets hammered and makes sure he gets on the plane, saying to someone in Aer Lingus "it is a bad situation, let him on, he has not seen his mother in years", a mother who is dead or dying, those are real human issues.  Even today, people have to make a decision either to stay with their American-born children or go home to see their dying parent for the last time; those are the real human issues and I am glad someone has touched on them.  I want to pay tribute to that. </p><p> The election was mentioned.  I tend not to get too involved in it, because it is extremely divisive.  I do not do party politics on either side because once one mentions it, one is attacked from all sides.  Maybe we deserve that.  I do not see any reason for it.  People say that the courts have ruled that the Oireachtas makes the rules for elections.  Regardless of whether the Oireachtas decides that everyone wants to vote in local, European and presidential elections, I go back to my earlier statement that if an Irish citizen living in Australia can vote for a Senator on a panel, then that citizen has been allowed to exercise his or her franchise.  Why should the person sitting beside them who has graduated from the school of carpentry or design or hairdressing or wherever not be able to?  Are they lesser citizens?  I should not mention hairdressing, because Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh and I have had a tough day with the hairdressers.  I do not think a plebiscite or referendum is needed.  I do not know if a referendum is needed, since I am not a constitutional scholar.  I know people who have got their letter in the post saying that someone is a candidate on a university panel, and here is a list - I know some of the candidates and I have helped them all.  They are all equal when they come to the United States.</p><p> I do not have the answers to these questions.  That is within this body's remit.  There is a campaign at the moment asking emigrants to come home to Ireland.  The programme for Government says that we are going to bring 70,000 back.  That is like putting the cart before the horse.  Maybe that is appropriate in the east part of the country, but in the west an awful lot of people still do not have jobs.  Surely we should remove barriers for those who come back, or maybe we should call them speed bumps or hurdles.  They are unnecessary for someone coming back.  We are talking about the young farmers again.  I know of a young gentleman in Galway who had to show his taxes for 2014.  He had earned &pound;40,200, so for those extra &pound;200 he was denied access to a green certificate, and to the national reserve.</p><p> We have dealt with various Ministers.  We lobbied this Administration for a Minister with responsibility for diaspora.  We got a famous Kerry footballer, former Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, an absolute gentleman whom I have known for years, who did a great job.  He travelled, met people and listened to them.  I have yet to meet the current Minister of State.  It is very disappointing that he was in Kenya yet could not come to New York.  While I know that it will get a lot of lip service now coming up to St. Patrick's Day, I do not believe it has got sufficient attention.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh mentioned that the Minister of State had not been in the Seanad.  I have not heard from him and I have written to his office on many issues.  I am very disappointed with the lack of activity.  I am trying to be diplomatic, but I am disappointed with the current administration of that office.</p><p> Going back to the US, people get very frightened and worked up.  We do not like the language coming from the current US Administration.  It has certainly raised the issue of many more people returning to Ireland.  Do not forget that for the past eight years, President Obama promised us immigration reform.  Many people held out and held out.  He deported more than 2.5 million, the most of any US President ever.  Again, I am not overly concerned.  I am concerned about the hype that is going on about it, but I am not really concerned about what is going on on the ground.  I think the other issues were for Mr. McMahon, Ms McHugh and Ms Sullivan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.736" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael McMahon" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22017021500002#M00200"><p>I thank the committee for having us today.  Mr. Staunton has covered much of the ground.</p> <p>  Living in Donegal, we are certainly very worried about our families in the US.  The problem arising is that, for a number of years, the families were fit to go to see their children over there.  Now they are becoming too old or do not have the money.  People's health and well-being is a cause for concern, which would be very important on both sides of the Atlantic.  The families over there are certainly worried about the talk from President Trump.  We would be disappointed with the inactivity of successive Governments.  That is what the families say to me, and I am in constant direct contact with the families.  I would not say, as Mr. Staunton has said, that Governments do not care.  I believe that they do, but they have not really shown that care and that is where the problem arises.  I have, as Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh would be well aware, been here on several occasions talking to Deputies and Senators.  I ask them to do different things and to get back to us, but that has never happened.</p> <p>  There was a waiver scheme, and we were very disappointed that other countries got thousands of waivers while we, for some unknown reason, got none.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade can play a bigger role in the waiver.  Even if they people got home once to see their parents, their families, their towns and villages and their home areas, they would be satisfied.  One has to recognise that a majority have their own business in America whether in the contracting business, the bar business, the hotel business or whatever the case may be.  They all work very hard.  They are very good to their communities and to try to uproot them and bring them back to this country that does not seem to have anything for them is unfair.  Children are going to national school and to second level school, and one would be interfering with the whole education situation.  We are disappointed that with the waiver scheme that was there, nobody came to Ireland.  We are in a very difficult and serious situation, and I ask again that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade look into the waiver scheme.  I know that the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, is an honourable family man and I think he understands the plight of the undocumented.  We also set up several all-party committees and nothing ever really came out of that.</p> <p>  We say that the Taoiseach should and must go to Washington DC on St. Patrick's Day, but we want to know exactly what he is going to say and how strong he will be against the administration over there.  I do not have a problem with other Deputies and Senators who go over there.  People, my family and other families are saying that they do not want them coming over, getting photographs and all that, and then going back and forgetting about us for another 12 months.  That should not happen.  We are in a very serious situation given that some families have not been home in over 20 years.  Senator Conway-Walsh said "out of sight, out of mind".  I believe that is what has happened with politicians.  We are not here to ridicule politicians of any political persuasion, because they all have a part to play.</p><p>It is now time that they stood up and were counted.  The present Administration in Dublin should stand up to the US Administration and tell it exactly how they feel and what we need.  There are only 50,000 undocumented Irish in America but that is a lot of people for the island of Ireland.  The situation is serious because the families in America and their parents here are getting older.  We want action taken and progress made.  Politicians should not play politics with this issue but do something over there, tell us what they have done and declare who they have and have not met.  For a number of years there has been a lack of information.  We would have been worse off if we did not have Mr. Staunton in America.  I take this opportunity to thank him for his work and for his presentation here today.  I thank the committee for inviting our deputation here today.  </p></speech>

I come from a rural town in County Kerry.  I lived in Dublin for over a decade and went to college.  I have also lived in Boston and New York.  This is my second move home to a rural town in County Kerry.  I made the transition from a big city to a very small rural town.  A few of the issues that were outlined here today took me by surprise.  For example, the cost of car insurance if one has lived outside of the country for several years.  Also, the fact that a credit rating that I had built up in New York over several years was basically non-existent in the eyes of the Irish Credit Bureau.  I was also surprised to learn that I had to reside here a full three years before I would qualify for reduced college fees that are available to Irish residents.  The provision is shortsighted because upskilling is now a fact of life.  One needs to keep up to date with many things especially IT and the Internet because they constantly change.  I found it difficult to be asked to fork out more money as if one was not a citizen of this country.  Let us remember that one incurs financial costs when returning home, especially in a rural area.</p> <p>  We have an opportunity to improve things because the policy document mentions the revitalisation of rural Ireland.  I was surprised returning emigrants were not mentioned in the policy document because there has been a large campaign to encourage emigrants to come home to work.  I believe returning emigrants should be included in the policy document, that would be great.  There are more people like me who want to return home to their rural areas.  We have gained experience from living abroad but now have a desire to live in rural areas.  The Government had the idea of compiling a policy document to make the best of rural Ireland.   Rural Ireland has an awful lot to offer.  I am originally from Kenmare.  One would be unaware that the town has quite a number of self-employed people because the business of the town is focused on the hospitality and tourism industry.  Many professionals who live in Kenmare work in IT, film production and media and these resources can be tapped into.  I suggest that the Government take a closer look at the people who have returned to rural areas and provide a level playing field for returning emigrants.  I do not seek special treatment.  I mean returning citizens or people who have lived in cities but want to return to their rural roots.  An opportunity does exist.  I urge the Government to keep us in mind and work with us to create a vibrant rural economy in Ireland. </p></speech>

One cannot get a PPS number unless one lives in the country although there are ways around the situation.  Not everyone who left the country has a PPS number.  One can get a PPS number if one had one before leaving.  It is possible for members of Safe Home Ireland, with our age cohort, to apply for and receive a PPS number.</p> <p>  Another issue is the habitual residence condition, HRC.  We argue for resuming residency using the HRC.  Many people are affected by the HRC.  If one worked on the clause to resume residency and one can prove previous residency one can work around the matter.  The situation is a lot better than it was.  I guarantee members that it was practically impossible to work with the HRC but the situation has improved.   </p> <p>  We receive many queries from family members who want to return home for a number of months to care for a relative.  They are entitled to zero assistance regardless of their situation and whether they own a property abroad.  They are not entitled to carer's allowance or any support when they return.  Therefore, people find it impossible to return home to provide care.  The barrier could easily be addressed.</p> <p>  I support the provision of voting rights.  I worked in Doras Luimn&iacute; for many years.  When I was there we hosted the Latvian Embassy who supported the Latvian community here to vote in their home country.  Providing the option is not rocket science. </p> <p>  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh mentioned people with more complex needs.  The fair deal scheme has posed a challenge.  We worked with a person who lived in a south London borough but care was provided by a north London borough.  We worked with that person so that the local authority could fund the person's return here until the fair deal scheme kicked in.  The fair deal scheme is administered by the HSE.  Admission to the scheme takes a long time to negotiate although times have improved.  It is impossible for somebody with nursing or health care needs to return to Ireland if he or she so wishes.  The person to whom I referred was someone we worked with in order to bring them home.  The person had hoped to live for some years.  Unfortunately, the person died in England and never had the chance to spend their last months in Mayo.  We supported the family to bring the person's body home.  Unfortunately, people continue to return home dead rather than alive.  </p> <p>  The interdepartmental committee on the Irish abroad is now called the diaspora affairs committee.  Last November I gave a presentation to the committee and I have not heard anything from it since.  I shall chase up the matter because we raised many issues, including barriers, challenges and the many opportunities.  We have not received any feedback whatsoever.  </p> <p>  In terms of the challenge of dealing with various Departments, we have experienced many challenges when trying to discuss issues with various Departments.  For example, applying for social housing when somebody has a tiny bit of savings.  The decision is discretionary because one local authority will take account of savings while another will not.  There is no standard procedure.  We are afraid to ask too many questions in case a precedent is set.  Let us say someone has savings worth &euro;10,000 or &euro;20,000.  We might get a straight answer to one of our questions but then the answer may affect many other issues.  There is a huge discrepancy.  Savings can sometimes work in one's favour but in most cases they have the opposite effect.</p> <p>  Administrative delays is a huge problem.  We have written to many Ministers and Departments seeking information and clarity on issues.  We generally get the standard acknowledgement letter thanking us for our correspondence and stating they will be in contact.  We write again, email or whatever.  With a few Departments we have had to lodge five or six challenges.  We have not been given answers to our queries so we will table a few parliamentary questions.  People cannot return home because there is no clarity.  </p> <p>  I have answered all of the questions that I possibly could and I shall not go into any more detail unless there is something else that members wish to raise.      </p></speech>

This is the first time that a discussion like this has taken place.  On our way in we looked at documents.  We also read the Proclamation that has the  words "her exiled children" that everyone knows.  The words are particularly poignant as last year was the 100th anniversary.  Our exiled children are still our children.  What if Connolly, MacBride and Collins, to name but a few, landed here today?</p><p>What would happen if James Connolly arrived with his family, if Thomas Clarke arrived after living in Long Island for many years, if the bold Mick Collins arrived back after working in London for many years or if a famous guy came back from England and ended up in farming?  What about the great old Brian Cowen who laboured in New York for a couple of years and came back?  As he put it, he was still washing dust off himself after he arrived without party or anything.  I hate to use the term "out of sight, out of mind" and I hate to use analogies.  What Safe Home Ireland has proved is that there is a way around it.  My Dad had a great saying - "where there's a will, there's a way".  If you have the will, you will find the way and if you do not have the will, you will never find the way.  What we have come across is that there is no will and I am not sure where one can take that.  It is very disturbing.  I lived in London and saw what those people did.  I saw them working day in and day out.  I see what Jerry Cowley has done in Mulranny.  I have seen all the work.  I represent many young people but it is very hard when one meets someone who represents many old people who may have sent money and parcels home to Ireland and one tells them one has written to the Minister five times but all that was received was the standard reply.  I have written to the Minister who is charge of all these Ministers and I am getting it.  The membership of the interdepartmental Government committee may be there on paper but it does not make it.  I congratulate this committee on making history.  Members should not forget that when history is read down the line, if something was successful, everyone was there but if it was not successful, nobody was.  We will get a photograph.  I do want it to continue because to date, nobody has ever addressed the rural community.  I would like this committee to say: "Let's invite in those communities, let this not be the last but let it be the first, let's keep it out there and let's keep it non-partisan." I thank everybody here.  As I always conclude as a Mayo man, we will see you in Croke Park.  </p></speech>

The current situation at Bus &Eacute;ireann is one which reaches into every home in every community across Ireland.  Without Bus &Eacute;ireann there is no transport network, there is no connectivity in terms of citizens being able to access schools, colleges, the workplace, hospital appointments etc.  The National Transport Authority will say, and have said, differently.  We will cover that later in our statement.</p> <p>  First things first.  Is there going to be mass travel disruption next Monday across the transport network?  The answer at this remove must be a qualified, and unfortunate, "Yes".  As has already been pointed out, some Bus &Eacute;ireann depots are shared with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.</p><p>Even thought we in the trade union group are not in dispute with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, and we have advised our members accordingly, there is absolutely no guarantee that Irish Rail staff will attend at work in locations such as Limerick, Tralee, Waterford, Galway, Sligo, etc.</p><p> There are many aspects to this crisis.  Its creation did not come through the actions of Bus &Eacute;ireann staff.  It is wrong and disingenuous to describe the issue as an industrial relations dispute.  The consequences will go far beyond the impact of an old-fashioned trade dispute between employer and employee.  While there is an immediate threat to 2,600 jobs, the future of public transport for rural Ireland is equally under threat.</p><p> Many statements have been made in the D&aacute;il and through the media to the effect that the problems at Expressway are confined to the advent of a competitive commercial market.  While there are issues around competition, they do not tell the full story, nor do they provide a solution to the crisis at Bus &Eacute;ireann.</p><p> Bus &Eacute;ireann is a company that has three distinct elements, namely, Expressway, the public service obligation, PSO, service and schools.  The PSO services are allowed to make what we would say is a reasonable but modest profit by the National Transport Authority, NTA, of approximately &euro;400,000.  The schools contract, which is an administrative arrangement with the Department of Education and Skills, covers its costs, and Expressway is the only leg of the company that can, ostensibly at least, chase profit and increase revenue.</p><p> What has caused this crisis?  The answer is straightforward enough for those of us who work within the industry.  It is Government policy.  The National Transport Authority, the regulator, has issued licences to commercial operators that have resulted in a saturation of seat capacity across the motorway network.  Those licences have been issued without due regard to the existing Expressway services.  Consequently, people have migrated from the slower State carrier to the quicker private operator.  Bus &Eacute;ireann services are not slower because of any inefficiencies but because the social aspect of the Expressway service has it calling to towns and villages the length and breadth of Ireland.  The private operators cherry-picked the most lucrative segments of the Expressway network and now operate point-to-point for profit without any wider social service obligation.</p><p> How can the NTA state that it was cognisant of existing services when issuing licences?  Its own guidelines dictate that it will be cognisant of existing services but the reality is manifestly untrue.  In recent weeks, the same NTA has been attempting to rebut our contention that it saturated the motorway network by contending that "...we have rejected almost as many applications for licences...as we have granted".  In the same press release, a copy of which I have given to the members, it went on to state: "Our primary responsibility in law is to the travelling public, and when we assess an application for a commercial licence, we do so with this in mind, while looking at a whole range of considerations including likely passenger demand, impact on existing services and impact on subsidised services."</p><p>That refers to PSO services.</p><p> A quick analysis of that portion of the statement gives an alarming insight into the thought process of the NTA.  It states that it considered the "likely" passenger demand.  The reality, however, is different.  The five licences, and it is five, it has issued and the three amendments it has made on the Dublin to Cork, Dublin to Limerick and Dublin to Waterford routes have not met that lopsided likely demand criteria it says it does.  In fact, it has increased the seat capacity by double the NTA's own stated passenger numbers for the period 2012 to 2015.</p><p> The NTA contention that it looks at the "impact on existing services and impact on subsidised services" is frankly laughable.  Why?  The following examples of the impact on existing services conflict with the NTA line.  On the Dublin to Waterford route, Bus &Eacute;ireann has ten intermediate stops while the private operator stops only in Carlow.  That is because of the location of the college.  On the Dublin to Galway route, Bus &Eacute;ireann has 16 intermediate stops while the private operators have none.  On the Dublin to Cork route it has four stops while the private operators have none, and on the Dublin to Limerick route it has four stops while the private operators have none.</p><p> Simply put, Bus &Eacute;ireann cannot compete because the NTA has over saturated the segments of its network that were returning a profit and issued licences to private operators with no social service, unless one happens to live beside a motorway.</p><p> Bus &Eacute;ireann once made a profit.  As the table I have circulated to the members demonstrates, Bus &Eacute;ireann subsidised its public service obligation routes to the tune of over &euro;40 million over a ten year period.  That was an integrated transport provider reinvesting profits back into the State.  Today, any profits go to shareholders in Hong Kong or London.  I say "any profits" because the most recent accounts of one of the main private operators, Dublin Coach, show a loss of &euro;1.6 million, which supports our view that the so-called market is over-saturated.</p><p> In media interviews in early January, the NTA stated that if Bus &Eacute;ireann were to pull a service from rural Ireland then it, the NTA, had a toolkit by which it would quickly move to plug the gap, so to speak.  If we examine this wondrous toolkit we see that we have a working, although I question that word, practical example of its magical powers.  A number of years ago, Bus &Eacute;ireann was forced to exit five towns along the Cork route in a futile attempt to compete with the ever-increasing number of private operators.  The NTA was forced to issue a tender for replacement services.  It is a matter of public record that M&amp;A Coaches won that contract at a cost to the taxpayer of &euro;440,000 per year for a mini-bus service with less frequency to five towns.  These services were being provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann free of charge as part of the integrated network I mentioned earlier.</p><p> If those costs were applied to the Dublin to Cork, Dublin to Limerick, Dublin to Waterford, Dublin to Galway and Dublin to Clonmel routes, taking into consideration average kilometres and the number of towns, the approximate cost of providing minimum or basic bus services compared to what currently exists is &euro;88,000 per town.  The 38 towns on those routes served by Expressway would cost the taxpayer approximately &euro;3.34 million per year.</p><p> In its own recent reports, Bus &Eacute;ireann estimates that it would cost approximately &euro;5 million per annum to PSO fund towns currently served by routes 4 and the other routes set out in my written submission.  That clearly illustrates that there is a role for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the NTA in resolving this crisis.</p><p> The Department of Social Protection should be added to the list of those that can contribute to a resolution.  The funding received by Bus &Eacute;ireann from the Department of Social Protection to carry citizens of this State who have free travel has been frozen since 2009.  Bus &Eacute;ireann's Expressway service provides 7 million journeys annually, 2.4 million, or 33%, of which are Department of Social Protection passes, which are essential for those people who rely on this vital Government intervention.</p><p> Anecdotal evidence tells us that several private operators do not facilitate the Department of Social Protection passes.  Currently, Bus &Eacute;ireann gets slightly more that 40% of an average fare, that is, &euro;4.81, for the average fare of &euro;11.78 from the Department of Social Protection.</p><p> Interestingly, the recent rail review conducted by the National Transport Authority and Irish Rail recommended an increase of 40% in the moneys Irish Rail currently receives from the Department of Social Protection.  I would expect Irish Rail to look for more money, but this is the NTA of which I am very critical in my submission.  An Irish Rail passenger profile reflects that 11% of the journeys are Department of Social Protection passes.  Such an increase to Bus &Eacute;ireann would constitute an increase of &euro;4.5 million.  That is what it would do to Bus &Eacute;ireann.</p><p> The notion that the State has no role in addressing the problems at Bus &Eacute;ireann is fundamentally wrong.  It is simply not good enough for the Minister to state that he has no responsibility in this regard.  Such a stance does not move on this debate one jot.  It also tells those living in rural Ireland that their current bus service will at best be replaced by a reduced mini-bus service and is therefore not as important, or as relevant, as those in large urban centres.  That is simply not good enough.</p></speech>

However, we are very mindful of and want to reiterate that Bus &Eacute;ireann staff did not create this issue and, therefore, the resolution does not lie in attacking their terms and conditions.</p> <p>  We cannot overlook the real impact these proposals from management will have on the working families in Bus &Eacute;ireann, and in particular on their take-home pay.  The proposed cuts fail to recognise the significant contributions of staff that work unsociable hours, including loss of quality family time.  We know that, statistically, shift workers are at risk of significant health issues.</p> <p>  As a trade union that covers the clerical grades, we are concerned that this grade, having the largest concentration of women workers, is being specifically targeted for pay cuts that put the majority of them well below the average wage in Ireland.  According to the CSO yearbook, the average wage in 2016 was &euro;45,000 per annum for full-time work.  The proposed cuts from management would put the majority of women workers in the clerical grade in a band of &euro;24,500 to &euro;33,000.  Currently, most women workers in the clerical grade earn between &euro;38,000 and &euro;50,000.  The continuing undervaluing of women in the workplace, particularly with regard to pay, is a worrying trend.  It would be quite shocking that a Minister or a Department would stand over that in 2017.</p> <p>  This is also compounded by the attitude on flexitime for women workers in the clerical grade, which is utilised by staff to help facilitate child care and other caring responsibilities.  The image of a well-paid male telling our women members in clerical grades that they are overpaid and must take significant pay cuts is not lost on our members.</p><p>There is a major issue with the policy, but we cannot lose sight of the damage that will be done to our members and working people in Bus &Eacute;ireann.</p></speech>

Our union has consistently requested a mechanism to ensure avoidance of industrial conflict relating to the matter.  Regrettably, Bus &Eacute;ireann has continued in recent weeks to maintain its position of unilateral cuts to our members' pay and terms and conditions of employment.  Questionable measures have been implemented since 16 January, which have had a negative effect on our members' earnings and hours of work.  From a public transport perspective, a number of PSO routes have not been operable.  In recent days, we have seen a further attack on our members' terms and conditions, with management preventing workers on sick leave from returning to work on agreed payment terms.<br/><br/>As Ireland's largest trade union with upwards of 170,000 members, SIPTU has the largest number of front-line members in the CIE group.  In Bus &Eacute;ireann, SIPTU represents more than 1,000 workers across all categories.  SIPTU's membership in Bus &Eacute;ireann's sister CIE companies stands at 1,850 in Dublin Bus and 2,050 in Irish Rail.  We also represent the majority of Bus &Eacute;ireann's 400 school bus drivers, who are not directly affected by this current dispute.  Our members in Dublin Bus and Irish Rail and among the Bus &Eacute;ireann school bus drivers stand resolutely behind our Bus &Eacute;ireann members and are understandably concerned about these unprecedented attacks within the Bus &Eacute;ireann road passenger business.<br/><br/>This unprecedented approach by the new and recently appointed Bus &Eacute;ireann senior management team is further evidence of the complete breakdown of the industrial relations architecture within the company and the wider CIE group.  A Labour Court recommendation issued in May 2016 has been ignored by Bus &Eacute;ireann, another recommendation issued August 2013 has been ignored by Irish Rail and the WRC settlement terms at Dublin Bus have also been ignored.  Bus &Eacute;ireann attended the Labour Court on our members' pay claim on 6 December 2016 and advised the court that it would not engage in the hearing, which was a clear breach of normal industrial relations protocol.  Given that the CIE companies are now pursuing an <i>&agrave;</i><b><i></i></b><i>la carte</i>approach to Labour Court recommendations and collective agreements, it is becoming clear to our members in those companies that the institutions of the State tasked with resolving disputes are being undermined, if not being made obsolete.<br/><br/>The impending dispute is not the typical industrial relations confrontation between an employer and its employees.  It has been in the making for some time and its root cause is a direct consequence of the Government's transport policy, particularly as it relates to rural and intercity services, and the importance of all participants' direct involvement or input into resolving same is imperative.  I am referring to the Departments of Transport Tourism and Sport and Social Protection, the National Transport Authority, NTA, Bus &Eacute;ireann and its trade unions.<br/><br/>The following factors have been instrumental in bringing us to a place where our rural and intercity transport bus service could come to a grinding halt and the risk of contagion across other CIE companies is growing by the day: proposed unilateral cuts to our members' pay, terms and conditions from 20 February 2017, notwithstanding the will of the D&aacute;il pertaining to a recent motion on same and our existing collectively agreed employment terms; Bus &Eacute;ireann workers have not had a pay increase in almost nine years and are now facing &quot;phase 2 austerity&quot; by way of pay cuts and so on; and a driver who earns &euro;624 for a 39-hour week cannot be expected to subsidise the company by reducing overall earnings by between 20% and 30%.  Workers cannot be expected to accept cuts in pay, terms and conditions and agree that they will do whatever the company wants for four years while also accepting that a large number of them may have to be made redundant by compulsory means.<br/><br/>Bus &Eacute;ireann has seen a reduction of 35% in State subvention from &euro;50 million in 2009 to &euro;33.7 million in 2015.  Subvention increased to &euro;40 million in 2016.  For the record, the CIE subvention was reduced by <i>circa</i>41%.  We either want a public transport system or we do not.  If we do, we need to fund it appropriately.<br/><br/>Free Travel accounts for one third of all journeys on Bus &Eacute;ireann, but a return to the company of &euro;4.86 against an average cost of &euro;11.78 is not sustainable under any business model, particularly when there are currently 1.3 million free travel pass holders and that number is increasing.  Our trade union supports those who depend on free travel, but the company needs to be adequately reimbursed for same.  Many private operators licensed by the NTA do not carry free travel pass holders.<br/><br/>The 300 plus PSO routes are technically not losing money, as they receive subvention, but Bus &Eacute;ireann must be afforded the opportunity and resources to compete on a level playing field with other operators.  The 23 Expressway routes are losing <i>circa</i>&euro;6 million per annum due to unfair market competition and subvention is not applied appropriately to take account of the PSO sections of these particular routes.  Many of these routes should receive subvention, as they continue to service rural towns and citizens who reside off the motorway network.  The private operator, licensed by the NTA, in the main drives direct city to city or has minimal stops during the journey.  For example, Bus &Eacute;ireann's Waterford-Dublin service has eight more stops than the private operators.<br/><br/>Many of the workers employed in the private transport sector receive poor terms and conditions and rely on the family income supplement, FIS.  This is unfair competition and only serves to hasten a race to the bottom in employment terms and conditions.  Surely that is not the sort of culture or transport system that we desire for Ireland.  SIPTU believes that a sectoral employment order is necessary for categories such as drivers within the wider transport sector.  This approach would ensure somewhat fairer competition.<br/><br/>Numerous times in recent weeks, Bus &Eacute;ireann has referenced the potential for insolvency within the next 12 to 18 months.  SIPTU has, without response, repeatedly called for an examination to explore the potential for Bus &Eacute;ireann to be subsumed into a CIE holding company so as to create the space for a complete review of the Irish public transport system, which is in a critical state, from a funding and infrastructural position.<br/><br/>The State does not need to run a for-profit public bus service, but it must maintain a properly resourced and adequately funded one.  Should future profits arise, they should be reinvested in the particular CIE company from which they were generated.  In recent weeks, the Government announced its rural Ireland framework and its Ireland 2040 national planning strategy.  Such a positive vision for the future is in conflict with its approach to the funding of our rural transport system and its unwillingness to get involved in the resolution of this intensifying and increasingly bitter dispute is mystifying and untenable.<br/><br/>Bus &Eacute;ireann needs to remove its preconditions for talks and rescind its letters of 16, 18 and 27 January so as to facilitate an environment conducive to constructive talks.  The CIE companies need to honour existing Labour Court recommendations and WRC settlements in order to restore the credibility of those institutions within the wider CIE group.<br/><br/>SIPTU members within Bus &Eacute;ireann are resolute in their position to take strike action on 20 February should their employer again move to cut their pay, terms and conditions unilaterally from that date.  While the conditions of employment in Bus &Eacute;ireann are nothing more than bearable after almost nine years of a pay freeze, low rates of pay, etc., our members and this union owe it to our predecessors and future Bus &Eacute;ireann employees to carry the torch and uphold the pay, terms and conditions achieved over many decades arising from sacrifices made during previous Bus &Eacute;ireann cost saving-survival plans.<br/><br/>It behoves Bus &Eacute;ireann, its trade unions, our elected public representatives and the Government to ensure that we maintain our national bus transport system through Bus &Eacute;ireann so as to ensure that the travelling public, who acutely depend on such an essential service, are not disenfranchised or inconvenienced in any way.  I trust that my brief submission to the committee will ensure that this is so by encouraging Bus &Eacute;ireann to remove its written threats to cut our members' pay, terms and conditions of employment unilaterally from next Monday, 20 February and, in so doing, facilitate the overdue and necessary engagement of all protagonists on these most serious of matters.</p></speech>

We will focus on three areas: Bus &Eacute;ireann as a provider of public service transport; Expressway as a commercial operation; and a new strategic stakeholder approach.</p> <p>  Just as we showed in October when Unite presented its submission on Dublin Bus to this committee, research shows that our national public transport service is severely constrained due to low subvention levels compared with other European countries.  Deloitte, in its report "Cost and Efficiency Review of Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann", found that, in terms of subvention as a percentage of total revenue, Belgium was at 78%, Switzerland was at 51%, the Netherlands was at 49% and Ireland was at 12%.  While the subvention in other European countries is 50% or more of total revenue, Ireland's figure had fallen to 10% of total revenue by 2015.  There is a measurement issue.  Expressway is included in revenue.  The Deloitte report does not say whether subventions in other countries also include commercial revenue.  Therefore, while we cannot estimate with any accuracy the appropriate level of subvention that Bus &Eacute;ireann should receive to bring it to European norms, it would be substantial.  At the very least, an additional &euro;46 million.  From a very low level, the actual subvention has been cut further since 2009.  Factoring in inflation, the subvention has been cut by more than &euro;12 million in real terms, or 22%.  Whether measured against other European countries or historical subvention levels, State support for public transport services is poor.</p> <p>  Expressway's commercial mandate and the efficient operation of the transport market have been undermined by Government policy, agency oversight and management practices.  A significant factor in the company&rsquo;s finances is the underpayment of the free travel scheme.</p><p>According to a report in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>, the Department of Social Protection reimburses Expressway only 40% of the average fare for journeys taken by pensioners and pass holders.  The Department pays &euro;11.4 million for these journeys.  Assuming the report is valid, if the full cost were reimbursed, the Department would pay &euro;28.5 million for these journeys, an increase of &euro;17.1 million.  In effect, the Government is using a commercial company to subsidise in-kind social transfers.<br/><br/>The joint committee should immediately investigate the regulatory oversight of the transport market.  The issuance of licences for private sector operators may be saturating the market.  Efficiency requires that the methodology and data sources used to inform the issuance of licences is open and transparent in respect of estimated demand, future projections, optimal level of competing companies, etc.  Is the absence of Expressway from profitable non-stop routes due to managerial decisions or market regulation?  In either case, the downside is obvious, namely, the market is either being skewed against Expressway or Bus &Eacute;ireann management is failing to expand into profitable markets.<br/><br/>Expressway accepts free travel passes, whereas private bus operators do not accept them.  This places the company at a commercial disadvantage, one which is not acknowledged either by the market regulator, which could require private bus operators to accept free travel passes, or the State, which benefits from below market reimbursement.  Put another way, pensioners are denied access to the full transport market as only a public enterprise company vindicates such access, while private operators do not.<br/><br/>Expressway serves a number of communities on loss-making routes.  That it continues to do so is a social good but there is no regulatory mechanism to ensure the company, as a commercial operation, is compensated for what should be a public service obligation, PSO, route.  This is an example of Expressway being used to subsidise the underinvestment in a public service.<br/><br/>Regarding the failure to monitor the operation of companies, the Cork Council of Trade Unions claimed in a letter to the Minister that serious breaches of the road transport working time directive are taking place.  The National Transport Authority replied that this was not a matter for the authority.  As the issuer of licences, it is imperative that the NTA take a proactive role towards monitoring the activities of all bus companies as otherwise the market will become degraded and companies will compete on the basis of which one is more effective at breaking the rules.<br/><br/>There are numerous anecdotal reports of low wages being paid by private bus operators.  A survey found that one company paid an average wage lower than the living wage.  Not only does this drive down employees' living standards but it also undermines companies which pay proper wages.  Low wages mean that bus companies impose costs on the taxpayer.  For example, wages of less than &euro;30,000 mean that, depending on household circumstances, an employee could be eligible for family income supplement.  With lower tax revenue and higher social transfers, low road employers are appropriating benefit at the expense of taxpayers.  This requires removal of wages from competitive advantage through a registered agreement applicable to all companies.  This would protect workers' living standards save the Exchequer money and ensure competition was based on service quality.<br/><br/>The position in Bus &Eacute;ireann can be compared to <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i>.  A report commissioned by the Department was shown to journalists but not to employees and Bus &Eacute;ireann management responded to this secretive report in public.  Other reports have been circulated in secrecy but still employees are excluded.  Management has leaked information to the media, while the Minister has refused any kind of engagement.  Can anyone think of a private company that conducts its industrial and commercial relations through media leaks, while the principal shareholder openly declares complete disinterest in the conduct of the company?  Is this a way to operate a modern commercial company? <br/><br/>Expressway cannot be compared to a commercial operation.  It subsidises State social transfers, provides access to free travel customers and operates public service routes which should be subsidised by PSO payment.  Deloitte reports that Bus &Eacute;ireann used Expressway profits to subsidise PSO routes, while the National Transport Authority has raided Bus &Eacute;ireann for funds.  We have an opaque regulatory process in which the regulator, the National Transport Authority, refuses to regulate.  We have bus companies that can only operate on the basis of depressing their employees' living standards.  All the while, members of the public experience a degraded service while employees are left in the dark.  It is misleading to benchmark Expressway on a market basis.  There is a much better way to manage both the company and the market. <br/><br/>I will now discuss a new strategic stakeholder method.<b></b>Bus &Eacute;ireann management claims to have a stakeholder approach.  In its 2015 annual report, the company claimed to have developed a<i></i>&quot;strategic plan to work collaboratively with all stakeholders to return Expressway to profitability.&quot;  The word &quot;stakeholder&quot; was used 17 times in the report but the company's actions belie its words.  It conceals essential reports from stakeholders, makes demands upon employees which it cannot justify or measure and, more important, knows cannot be sustained.  It demands that employees enter discussions without conditions while it comes to the table with a suitcase load of conditions.  No dictionary in existence would define this behaviour as a &quot;stakeholder&quot; approach.<br/><br/>Bus &Eacute;ireann management now wants to re-embark on a substantial downsizing strategy.  This approach was tried and failed.  Between 2009 and 2015, payroll expenditure fell by more than &euro;15 million or 10%.  This did not solve the company's problems.  Management now wants a further &euro;12 million in cuts to payroll expenditure and a total of &euro;30 million in cuts overall.  It is repeating a failed strategy.  The real problem for Expressway is not the level of expenditure, which has fallen since 2009, but a decline in revenue of &euro;8 million.  If a company cannot generate revenue, no amount of downsizing will save it, as academic scholarship confirms.  According to Professor Freek Vermeulen of the London Business School, downsizing does not work and this view is backed up by detailed academic studies.  The simple reason is that downsizing incapacitates a company's ability to expand and, without expansion, it is incapable of surviving in highly competitive markets.<br/><br/>There are two complementary approaches to resolving the company&rsquo;s problems, both of which are grounded in an authentic stakeholder approach in which employees and employers are equal partners.  The first is to drive productivity and the second is to expand through investment, market expansion and rolling out new products and services.  The best transport companies in Europe increasingly practice what is known as employee driven innovation to achieve these goals.  In short, resolution of the company's problems begins with the worker.<br/><br/>While there are a number of models of employee driven innovation, the fundamental starting points are that management and employees must both want to enter the process; a guarantee must be provided that proposals adopted will not lead to job losses or a reduction in earnings; a process of adoption and implementation of the proposals must be agreed in which neither side enjoys a veto; the innovation process must be based on a bottom-up approach that takes place in work units; and the process must be open and transparent, both operationally and financially. </p></speech>

This is a radical break from hierarchical decision making structures and one in which trust is essential.  If Bus &Eacute;ireann management is serious about a stakeholder approach and building trust, it should immediately withdraw its letters and demands for downsizing.  If this were done, management and employees could sit down and agree a new strategic stakeholder approach.  This is not to suggest a solution will be easy.  I have no doubt, management will bring to the table proposals which employees will find difficult and we, too, will bring forward issues.  For instance, overtime has been abolished in place of outsourcing in maintenance work, yet outsourcing costs more than overtime would cost.</p> <p>  Has Bus &Eacute;ireann attempted to enter the lucrative non-stop market between major urban areas and, if not, why not?  Is this a failing of managerial strategy or the regulatory structure?  This process is not only about overcoming divisions between management and employees but also about identifying areas of co-operation.  There is much on which we could agree, for example, the low level of PSO support in the public service; underpayments in reimbursing free travel costs; the use of Expressway as a subsidiser of the Exchequer and non-commercial public services; and the race to the bottom process that undermines good employers and good employment.  If the company were to speak with one voice on these issues, it could direct the debate to significant issues in public transport services.</p> <p>  Ultimately, the issue extends beyond management and employees.  We have identified a number of defects in policy ranging across regulatory, investment and labour market issues.  For this reason, we need all those involved in public transport, specifically the National Transport Authority, Department and Minister, to sit down together to resolve these issues.  If these parties are not involved, the problems in public transport will persist.</p> <p>  The joint committee has a key role to play in this area by supporting a new stakeholder approach, helping to identify the problems that management and employees face together and urging all parties, including the Minister, to become involved in a new dispensation for public transport.  The committee should consider itself a key stakeholder.</p></speech>

The action of Bus &Eacute;ireann, in sending letters to staff in January, was unnecessary and unhelpful and was not a proper way to begin negotiations.  I note from the opening statements that the last thing anyone wants is strike action.  The effects of such action would be far-reaching and widespread.  I am particularly concerned for schoolchildren, especially those who will sit State examinations this year, as they have already faced strikes by teachers and the last thing they need is further disruption.  I urge all sides in the dispute, including the Minister, to sit down and engage in real and meaningful talks to sort out the current difficulties.</p> <p>  I note from the opening statements that all the trade unions represented have ideas on how to improve the current position.  I ask all the witnesses to elaborate on these ideas and provide details on what actions need to be taken by all sides?</p></speech>

In terms of solutions, while I am speaking on behalf of the NBRU, we are all ad idem on how to resolve this issue.  Our message for some months has been that it will not be resolved by the trade unions and the company.  There are many strands to finding a solution.  The Department of Social Protection, to which we referred today and on our previous appearance at the committee, has a role to play.</p><p>I note that the Minister stated recently in the D&aacute;il that he was in discussions with the Minister for Social Protection and one would think that would fit into any solution.</p><p> A point we make strongly and will not deviate from is the fact that Bus &Eacute;ireann is a State provider and carrier.  It is a State-owned company that has a social obligation to both its employees and, equally important, to those in rural Ireland that it services.  That point was lost in some of the debate I listened to in the House.  The examples that my colleagues in SIPTU and I gave about the number of towns being served off-motorway and adjacent to the motorways are examples of a social service.  People hide behind Europe an awful lot in this environment but we could not establish any State rule that debars the State from making an intervention in terms of supporting those towns, including the 16 towns between Dublin and Galway, the ten between Dublin and Waterford, the four between Dublin and Cork and the four between Dublin and Limerick.  No State aid rules prohibit such intervention.  That is another strand to the solution.</p><p> Are we on the workers' side afraid in terms of work practices and efficiencies?  No.  We have been pragmatic and proactive over many years when coming to the table and ponying up, as it were, through the recession, but a once in a generation pay cut will not happen again on our watch.  That is what we have been saying.  There are many strands to this but throughout our responses today my colleagues and I will make a fundamental point: As long as there are preconditions, which one minute are there but - verbally, at least - the next minute are not, there will be a barrier to the most immediate step to be taken which is to get into the discussions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.771" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Greg Ennis" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017021500002#F00200"><p>I will not reiterate what Mr. O'Leary from the NBRU has stated.  However, the first thing that needs to happen is that the employer, Bus &Eacute;ireann, needs to take the gun away from our members heads with regard to threats to cut their terms and conditions unilaterally from Monday morning.  This was referenced in a recent Private Members' motion and strongly supported in the D&aacute;il.  The motion also referred to the company being adequately funded and so forth.  However, the first thing that needs to happen is the pressure valve needs to be released.  The second thing that needs to happen is for all protagonists, including the Department of Social Protection, to play their role.  Third, if we could create the space to do it, in the longer term all parties should be considering the possibility of a sectoral employment order for bus drivers, in which they would be substantially represented.  Following a Labour Court decision and ministerial order and approval, such an order would set a rate of pay for bus drivers in the State, be they in the public or private sector.  We would always seek to achieve and achieve beyond the base rate, but bringing in a base rate for private operators would mean that some of the current unfairness in the market would go.  Many of those who are driving in the private sector are on the minimum wage or just above it.  This has been confirmed in public discourse and needs to be examined.</p> <p>  In the context of solution-mode, SIPTU is up for solutions.  We have made that clear in our submission and Deputy Fitzpatrick has picked up on it.  We do not want a strike to take place.  However, for probably the first time in a semi-State company - we have members across the semi-State sector - our members' earnings are under attack to the tune of 20% to 30%, depending on their grade.  Drivers with 20 years' and 30 years' service earn &euro;624 a week for a 39-hour week.  We will not sit idly by and see those people targeted.  The whole thing, including PSO and non-PSO routes, needs to be examined.  I am well aware of the direct award contracts that are due to run for the next number of years, but the routes that are not PSO obligated that pick people up in the rural towns and villages need to be examined.  It behoves all of us - all the protagonists - to get in and discuss it.</p></speech>

In fairness to us, we would be in an awful lot of a better position to answer it.  I will focus on his question about what we consider is required to repair the situation.  I think everyone in the country knows about the preconditions in the letters, which need to disappear, so I will not dwell on that as it is already referred to in the submission.  We cannot make a contribution and respond to the Deputy in as full a manner as we would like to in the current vacuum.  A number of reports have allegedly examined everything and outlined the problems to management and it appears that, on foot of them, management has made decisions to target our people with this lot of cuts.  It is telling us to swallow this first and that it will tell us at the end of March what is in the rest of the stuff.  We cannot work on that premise.  We need full disclosure of everything relative to this crisis that is available, that is, every available stitch of information and data on the issues that the consultants have identified.  At that point, we will not be found wanting in terms of giving it our all to be part of the solution and reaching a resolution that does not impact the members the way the company has sought to unilaterally impose and without any engagement.  However, without the information, we are snookered.  We are behind the eight ball, as the man said.</p></speech>

Much like my colleagues, our problem is that there are many facets to the issues at Bus &Eacute;ireann, but the sort of strategy or policy of Bus &Eacute;ireann management and others, which is trying to funnel this into an industrial dispute, is compounding the issue.  This is not an industrial dispute but a public transport policy issue that has many facets to it.  The trade union movement has always been willing to engage, but the engagement must be constructive, genuine and meaningful.  Were we to go to the Workplace Relations Commission to be told that the situation remains the same, that there is a gun to our heads and that management are going to cut our terms and conditions on 20 February itwould just create the dispute.  We are prepared to engage but the engagement must be genuine and meaningful and that can only occur if people wake up and realise that this is not an industrial dispute but a public transport dispute.  Let us deal with it as that.</p></speech>

What data do the delegates have on private operators and the free travel pass?  Do they know for sure how many do not carry passengers who hold a free travel pass?

The reality is that the Department of Social Protection's free travel scheme was frozen in 2009 and there were no new entrants after that initially.  As we understand it, no new company could have a contract with the Department of Social Protection between 2009 and 2015.  What happened in 2015 is very interesting.  The then Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, came under pressure in the D&aacute;il, the people's Parliament, relented and, as we understand it, allowed some private operators to access the scheme.  We believe that came on the back of the PSO contract that was awarded between Portlaoise and Cashel.  When the NTA put that route out for tender, in the initial contract - this is an important point that is hard to stomach on behalf of those who are entitled to free travel - the successful bidder, M&amp;amp;A Coaches, was told to charge OAPs and those with disabilities 50% of the fare, which caused uproar.  As a result, the Minister relented and allowed some private operators in.  I do not have any data - I have anecdotal evidence - but we read an article recently in the <i>The Irish Times</i>where Brian O'Donnell for Feda O'Donnell Coaches is quoted as saying, bizarrely, that the Department of Social Protection covers probably 70% of his costs.  We consider it would be worth exploring that further.  Whether it was a misprint or otherwise, he was quoted in the article.<br/><br/>There seems to be some variation on the ground.  The State provider rightly - we would say - carries those availing of the free travel scheme but it does not get paid enough for it.  There are then lots of private operators.  There is a company in Waterford that I will not name, but people in this room know it, whose bus stop is as close to the Bus &Eacute;ireann stop as the Deputy is to me.  We have evidence of the driver on the private coach telling those who hold free travel passes to go down to the Bus &Eacute;ireann coach.  That happens daily.  That is the reality on the ground.</p></speech>

A lot of issues need fixing.  In 2013 members entered the cost recovery plan and took cuts, having had no wage increases since 2008.  This was on the basis that the company had told both them and the Labour Court that if doing so would secure the future of the company.  The management which presided over the company from 2013 have run out of the door on big packages and we have not been told much about them, which is causing great suspicion.</p></speech>

I agree with the sentiments on how the NTA issues licences, and on increased subventions and increased funding from the Department of Social Protection.  I welcome the fact that the unions are going to the WRC this evening and the last thing they or their members want to is be out on strike and to discommode the tens of thousands of people who rely on Bus &Eacute;ireann to commute to work on a daily basis.  It is important that a State company such as Bus &Eacute;ireann provides an essential, public, integrated transport service but it is in a serious financial situation. I do not blame union members for this for one minute.  However, the unions and workers have an opportunity, and a responsibility, to engage on the efficiencies that have to be achieved.  One speaker said the unions were in the dark because they had not been party to all the reports that have been issued and I will be calling on the Minister, Deputy Ross, to make available all reports to unions so that they can be fully informed.</p> <p>  A sectoral employment agreement was called for.

The Deputy is talking about a briefing of 16 January that did not come through the trade unions but went directly to staff.  It was designed to provoke our members into a reaction and to hitting the picket lines.  They wanted to push us into an industrial dispute so that they could accuse us of hitting the barricades because overtime had been cut.  We did not succumb to this nakedly aggressive act by the company.  Our members toed the line, though this was very difficult.  A total of 80 services were cancelled, mainly at the Broadstone depot, as a result of the letter of 16 January meaning that some 2,000 people were left without a service.  That is what Mr. Hernan, his management team and his paymasters think of the people who rely on those services.   It was designed to provoke people and, as Mr. Ennis said, when we go to the WRC this afternoon, this is one of the issues that will loom large.  Provoking staff into a reaction and losing 80 services is no way to run a transport system.  It is appalling.</p> <p>  The company said the briefing of 16 January was covered by current agreements.</p><p>I would dispute that and I would also dispute many of the interventions they have made since.</p></speech>

This union wrote to the company the following day, on 17 January, about that letter but we have still not received a response.  To back up what my colleague from the NBRU said, within a week of that letter of 16 January, on 23 January, in the area where I live in Meath, for example, the Dublin to Ratoath 10.29, the Dublin to Kells 16.30 and 18.30, and the Dublin to Belfast 23.00 buses did not run.  They did not run because of the implications of the changes put forward on 16 January.  This crisis is escalating day by day without the threats that we believe will kick in from Sunday night, Monday morning.  There is a raft of other routes that have not taken place as well.</p></speech>

It will say that it needs to examine the cost base in a broader sense because 80% of people are using PSO and 20% are using the commercial line.  It is fair to say that we are at one in terms of where the commercial line can be brought back into profitability.</p> <p>  Given that PSO now has to go out for tender, do the unions have concerns about winning tenders when competing with private operators?  I understand that the Waterford service is currently out for tender and the Kildare network will be out for tender later this year.  Are the unions concerned about being able to compete actively for tenders in order to win future contracts?</p></speech>

In the last interaction he had with the committee, Mr. Ennis mentioned a sectoral employment order.  One of the fundamental problems with the tendering process is that people are competing on wages.  The direct answer is that it is going to be very difficult for Bus &Eacute;ireann, or any of the CIE companies, to win any tender in future when that is hanging over them, when people are allowed to pay under the counter, pay a minimum wage and behave inappropriately.  The latter is a mild word, but I could use much stronger language than that.</p></speech>

When that is all rolled into a private operator's costs, it would definitely make Bus &Eacute;ireann more competitive, if those private operators were organised in trade unions with reasonable terms and conditions.

All the members have not had a pay increase for nine years.  Going beyond that, on 1 June 2013, there was a 19-month pay cut to try to keep this company afloat.  This has been breaking down for some time.  We cannot have a situation where the workers in Bus &Eacute;ireann are being utilised to subsidise a system that is broken.  The only way to fix the system is to get all the protagonists in to solve it.  However, if the company continues with its line that it will do this unilaterally from 20 February, then we have no choice but to take all-out strike action.  We cannot be in a place where types of industrial action are intermittent and we go back into work on terms that are inferior to those we already have.</p></speech>

I recognise that they have been singularly targeted in this dispute and that they were not the ones who created the crisis.  This crisis was created through bad policy and mismanagement.  We are five days away from what can best be described as the chaos which will ensue across the State, affecting workers, commuters, students and hospital patients.  In light of that, I wish to reiterate the call to the Minister and the acting CEO of Bus &Eacute;ireann to set aside the letter that was sent out on 16 January, particularly the inflammatory contents, in order to allow for negotiations.</p> <p>  I wish to ask the various unions some questions.  What expectations do SIPTU and Unite have for the WRC talks this evening?  It was said earlier that a combination of issues needs to be addressed in order to resolve this matter in the long term and to protect our public transport service and infrastructure.  Would the unions agree that these issues include the need for an increased subvention, an increase in the Department of Social Protection's travel pass subsidy, and a review of licences issued on certain routes?  Would the unions also agree that, on top of all that, there is a responsibility to examine inefficiencies across the board?  Examples were cited of three buses leaving at the same time on one route.  That problem was created with licences, as there is one public bus and two private operators.  There are nonsensical inefficiencies such as those that have directly resulted in the financial loss.  There are inefficiencies everywhere, including in Bus &Eacute;ireann, every company, every board and in the Government.  Do the unions acknowledge that such inefficiencies exist and would they be prepared to examine them in conjunction with all the rest to ensure we secure and enhance our public transport network?</p><p>What is the NBRU's view on the role the Department has played in this dispute up until now?  On the NTA, National Transport Authority, and the issuing of licences, we know there are several routes which we can identify which have directly contributed to the financial crisis in the company.   From the point of view that the NTA has rejected more than it has accepted, what are the unions' opinions on that?</p><p> We have not got a straight answer from the Minister, the Department or the NTA but we know they have identified routes for targeting.  They have not been open or transparent in disclosing those routes.  There is a real fear right across rural communities about these routes and the interconnectivity between cities and urban towns.  Private operators only go from city to city or large town to large town.</p></speech>

On the review of licences, a direct award contract has to run for a period.  However, we agree it should be in the mix.  On inefficiencies, we rule nothing in and out of negotiations but they will have to start.</p> <p>  On the wider point the Deputy raised about the expectation for the WRC, Workplace Relations Commission, meeting this evening, in this job - I have been in it for 19 years - one becomes an eternal optimist.  If one did not, one would not get out of the bed in the morning.  While I am optimistic going to the WRC and I welcome the intervention of the LRC, Labour Relations Commission, we also need to be clear that they are exploratory talks.  We will not be engaging with the employer directly.  We will set out our position.</p> <p>  However, if the company, which may have attended already or be there simultaneously, holds the position that it will implement these cuts from 20 February, it will be a very brief WRC hearing because we will have nowhere to go but back to our members to report and prepare for something that no one wants which is not in the public or the workers' interest.  We had to draw a line in the sand but this line has now been passed by the senior management team in Bus &Eacute;ireann, which is unprecedented.</p></speech>

Each union has written three times to the company but has not received a response.  We want to unhinge the lock where the company has set down preconditions.  The Minister says, day after day, that each side should start with a blank sheet.  If we could get the WRC to bring about that position, then I think the door will be opened to meaningful engagement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-15a.822" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dermot O'Leary" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017021500002#J00600"><p>On the role of the Department, its fingerprints are all over the crime scene.  It is akin to a young kid lighting a gorse fire and running off.  Thankfully, the helpful leak of the Grant Thornton report gave us knowledge about the role of the Department.  It has been all over this for the past 18 months.  The Department asked the company to produce report after report, three in total.  The context is important here.  It asked the company to come up with solutions to the Bus &Eacute;ireann and Expressway crisis to avoid large-scale industrial unrest.  That was the remit the company was given.</p> <p>  Some 18 months later we are facing into that large-scale industrial unrest.  Something happened in between.  There was the small matter of a general election and the kicking of the can down the road.  I accuse directly the Department of being involved in that scenario.  It is all over this and it has a responsibility.  As long as I am breathing and my colleagues are representing people, I will not let the Department off the hook on that responsibility.</p> <p>  Of course, the NTA has rejected licences.  It is its job to do so.  That is not the issue, however.  The issue is what licences it has approved.  I made the point in my submission that it has issued five licences on the motorway network for Dublin-Cork, Dublin-Waterford and Dublin-Limerick while amending three.  For those five, plus the three amended, 104 extra services appeared on those routes.  That is madness and is just not sustainable.</p> <p>  On rural Ireland and connectivity, there are 3,000 Expressway services a week in this country.  A map of Ireland shows how this service goes into every nook and cranny of this country.  Without that connectivity, a minibus will not solve the problem or replace the 54-seater coach.  As I said in my submission, why the hell should rural Ireland citizens be treated any differently from those who want to live in urban centres?</p></speech>

The Minister and the Government stand idly by but, by doing so, they aid and abet the attack.  From what I have seen in Leinster House over the past two days, we are dealing with a Government which is considerably weaker than it was last week.  It is my personal hope that the weakened position of the Government will assist the unions' members in achieving justice and stopping these wage cuts.  The unions are now in a stronger position.</p> <p>  The longer this matter goes on and the longer I listen to Mr. Ray Hernan, the acting chief executive, I think there is another issue on the agenda.  When I am finished here, I am going around the corner to Baggot Street to talk to the strikers outside the Tesco store there.  There is a blatant and obvious attempt at union-busting by Tesco.  It is an upfront attempt at union-busting in the sense that union officials have been kept off the premises, no union literature is allowed on store notice boards.  I noted this morning in Bray that Tesco stopped union deductions from the payslips and so forth.</p> <p>  It is not as blatant as that in Bus &Eacute;ireann.  In reality, if a company has unions accept &euro;7,000 pay cuts, it has the unions in its pocket and, effectively, it has busted the unions.  There is a private sector example and another example with Bus &Eacute;ireann.  It is two sides of the one coin.</p> <p>  I noted Mr. Dermot O'Leary's point on shared depots.  Some depots are used by Bus &Eacute;ireann workers and buses and by Irish Rail workers.  I presume the import of what Mr. Dermot O'Leary said is that if there are pickets outside these depots next Monday, then there will be an issue for rail workers crossing a picket line.  Will he expand on that?  Some of the depots were mentioned.  I would like to hear which ones they are because that is a significant issue for the dispute.</p> <p>  I am also aware from my contacts and connections with public transport workers in Cork that while workers in Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus are in separate companies to Bus &Eacute;ireann, there is an element of a band of brothers to it.  They were all CIE workers at one stage and everybody knows that if one goes down, then the rest are liable to be next.  There is a sense of shared interests.  I understand the unions may not want to comment on this because there are talks this afternoon.  Is there a degree of pressure on the unions from Dublin Bus and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann workers to say they do not want the Bus &Eacute;ireann workers to stand alone?</p><p>Are the witnesses under a degree of pressure from below?  Would they care to comment on that?</p></speech>

He was at pains to deny that was the case.  He said that 40% of the costs are labour costs and that 40% of what he described as the savings would come from the labour side of things.  He is looking for &euro;12 million worth of labour cost savings.  In order for the figures to add up it is being said that there are now &euro;30 million worth of savings overall being looked for.  For a company that is losing &euro;9 million, looking for savings of &euro;30 million seems a little over the top.</p> <p>  Have the witnesses seen, or has anyone seen, what the exact breakdown of the &euro;18 million worth of savings over and above the labour cost savings?  Would they care to comment on those &euro;18 million savings?  Do they believe they are there?</p></speech>

There are two questions.  I will take the first and my colleague can take the second.  We are on common ground here.</p> <p>  In terms of the question about the shared locations, as we call it, we are under more than a bit of pressure.  I, again, have to be very responsible in my role as general secretary of the National Bus and Rail Union and ensure that my members in Irish Rail are very much aware of their obligations to their employer.  They are not in dispute with their employer but I cannot dictate, to anybody in this room and certainly not to my members, where their moral compass points or how responsible they may feel to the family that is CIE, a relationship the Deputy rightly mentioned.  Despite the ambition of the main party in Government today, and others, to dismantle the CIE family, they will get their answer as to what the family looks like or what it will do in terms of supporting each other very soon.  I am at pains, however, to point out that Irish Rail workers are not in dispute, but there are going to be pickets in Limerick, Athlone, Waterford, Galway and the Sligo next Monday, unless the acting CEO withdraws those cuts.  Those locations have railway stations direct centre and front of house.  People in Irish Rail are telling me, wrongly from a legal perspective I accept, that they are going to have severe difficulty passing those pickets.</p></speech>

Yes, there is pressure.  Clearly we have to work within the Industrial Relations Act, 1990.  We would always advise our members to stay within the law, but I can assure the Deputy that there is absolutely pressure building on this issue right across SIPTU membership across the public infrastructure network.</p> <p>  With regard to the issue of the &euro;12 million,  the first I heard of it, and I think most people heard of it, was on, if I am not mistaken, an RTE interview on the "Six One News".  This &euro;30 million figure came out of the blue from nowhere.  That is &euro;30 million a year on an indefinite basis in a company that had a problem of &euro;5 million, then &euro;6 million.  Within two days it was &euro;7 million and within three days it was &euro;9 million.  There is someone making this up as they go along and, instead of looking for the &euro;6 million, they are now looking for &euro;30 million.  Deputy Barry is right, 40% of this, to the tune of &euro;12 million, would come from workers who, as we said earlier, earn approximately &euro;30,000 a year.  It is not going to be acceptable and will not be rammed down the throats of our members.</p></speech>

To put it on the record, I would have regarded the letter of 16 January as putting down a marker and I am not surprised at the response there has been to it.  The one thing that would be very regrettable for everyone, workers and the travelling public, would be a strike, which would have to be solved at some point in any event.  Let us hope that the meeting today is fruitful.</p> <p>  To clear my own head on this, when we decided to have several hearings on public transport we were looking at it from the point of view of delivering a sustainable public transport system into the future, not that there was going to be a dispute imminent.  That was the context of this and there is an issue of sustainability in regard to the subject matter we are talking about today.  Would the 19% of Bus &Eacute;ireann passengers that travel on Expressway services be the only group affected?  Is that correct?  They are the only group that are affected by the letter of 16 January?  Is that the totality?</p></speech>

There are, in fact, quite a few in my own area which is quite lucrative because of a growing population.  It would be an area that would be cherry-picked if any were going to be.  What happens to the drivers on those routes if Bus &Eacute;ireann does not get the contract?  We are told by the NTA that if some Expressway services are discontinued at local level that it will, as its track record proves, step in and ensure that local demand for public transport is met and that it will not leave any rural community behind.  That is not quite dealing with the issue of lucrative routes going out, but what happens to the drivers?  What happens to the cost base there?</p> <p>  I do not see how this stacks up.  It does not seem logical to me that it will not cost, one way or the other.  Mr. Noone spoke about Irish Rail getting a bigger portion.  Could the witnesses give us a breakdown on that?  It would be acceptable to send it to us at some point in the future.  How does that break down?  Witnesses have also said that there was a loss of services on 16 January.  A number of services were lost where there is a commitment to provide a service but the service being provided at the moment is not necessarily comparable.  Do the witnesses have any indication of what services have been lost?  Even if that information were provided afterwards it would be useful.</p> <p>  The Minister keeps telling us that the state aid rules prevent intervention.  It seems that there is a degree of state aid in regard to the private operator as well by virtue of the fact that they are not required to have a public component to their operation.  Is it possible to build that into what the NTA is doing?  Could they force fare competition?  Has the Minister sought that from it?</p></speech>

In terms of drivers who would be discommoded if Bus &Eacute;ireann does not achieve the contract, for example for the route No. 126 in her area, this is unfortunately nearly a mirror of what happened back in 2015.  At that time the same Department, which has now gone to the hills, and the same National Transport Authority, which says it has nothing to do with it, were dragged kicking and screaming to the table.  As a result of a dispute, which unfortunately discommoded people that needed the service and people that work in the industry, we got around a table, which we should have done long ago in this dispute as well, and came up with an agreement that allowed for market growth.  More importantly this market growth was to be funded by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, which was not available before the dispute.  Thankfully all that occurred was that some of the drivers involved were discommoded from their locations.  That is unfortunate but thankfully, because of that agreement, the market growth is envisaged at this stage to go beyond what may be lost.  No drivers will lose their job with Bus &Eacute;ireann.  That is the first aspect.</p> <p>  In terms of state aid, I will say that certain private companies, which the Chairman will rightly not allow me to identify, are getting state aid through intervention from the Department of Social Protection, for example in terms of the family income supplement.  To go back to what the Minister said about state aid, and I have said it already, I would like to see the state aid rules in question.  I am not a legal expert but I have been reading up on this since the privatisation debate and before.  I would like to see them because as far as I am concerned there are no state aid rules.  I will say this to Deputy Murphy,  we are the best country in the world, certainly the best in Europe, at pointing towards Europe and saying it is its fault and that we have to do such a thing because Europe says so.</p><p>There are one or two individuals in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport who should nearly go over to Europe.  I believe they are probably speaking French at this stage they are so in love with Europe.</p><p> There are no state rules that debar the NTA from intervening regarding the routes off the motorway.</p></speech>

The letter of 18 January is even more concerning.  The issue of what would happen drivers was dealt with by my colleague, Mr. O'Leary.  In the letter of 18 January, it is stated there is no voluntary severance scheme and that the redundancy package will be two plus two - statutory - and so on.  This rings of something.</p> <p>  Private operators are using publicly funded roadways to make a killing.  Maybe one way of dealing with the private operators is to impose a tariff for using public roadways.</p></speech>

The letter from 18 January is the one I have to hand.  The proposals here are akin, perhaps, to those of the Croke Park agreement back in the noughties when we faced the first financial crisis in this country.  The last paragraph of the letter concerns the elephant that was in the room for a while.  He is not here now, he is gone back to the Minister, Deputy Ross.  In the letter, the acting CEO of Bus &Eacute;ireann tells the workers that the Government cannot, or will not, provide support and that it is up to Bus &Eacute;ireann to do what is required.  At the same time, he says free travel did not cause the problems and that an increase in revenue for such services will not fix the problems.  To address this, let me give a simple example from my own back yard.  The Cork-Dublin Expressway bus pulls into Mitchelstown.  Recently, there were 45 passengers on the bus but only two paid.  How can one justify the Government not intervening and paying a proper subvention in this regard?</p> <p>  The Minister comes back to us and says we are in conflict with EU regulations but one cannot compare the private and public services.  Private operators on the Cork-Dublin route are using the motorway and doing a magnificent job.  I use their service regularly.  The Expressway service has to pull in here and there.  How can one say the two are in competition with each other?  The NTA needs to elaborate on this issue and the Minister has to get involved.</p> <p>  Mr. Quigley had some interesting figures on PSO supports in other European countries.

Wallonia in Belgium is of a similar size to Deputy O'Keeffe's province, Munster.  It provides a subvention of 78%.</p></speech>

It was part of our national campaign on bus services.  All the unions here are fully supportive of the scheme of the Department of Social Protection.  We should change the title from the free travel scheme to something about entitlement.  A very small example of the value of the scheme was given to us at a meeting in west Limerick by a woman who sat very timidly in the audience on the night in question while listening to our presentation.  She was not going to raise her hand but did so since there was a lot of debate over the Department of Social Protection.  Listening to what the woman had to say was heart-rending.  She is a full time carer of her husband and is in her 50s or 60s.  She gets respite for ten hours once every two weeks.  The place is called Templeeglantine, a dot in the landscape.</p></speech>

They should set aside the obstruction to talks.  It is important that we express our view on this.</p></speech>
