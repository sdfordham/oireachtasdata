He is joined by Mr. Peter Kinsley, deputy director of audit.  Apologies have bee received from Deputy Pat Deering.</p> <p>  Are the minutes of the meeting of 8 March agreed to?

It is the audit report on the ICT directorate payment process which was requested by the committee.  It is proposed to note and publish the report.</p></speech>

When issues connected with ICT contracts, tendering and procurement were raised, the head of the Policing Authority, Ms Josephine Feehily, indicated that the Committee of Public Accounts had greater capacity to deal with issues related to tendering or otherwise and public procurement within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na than the Policing Authority.  Unless the authority's functions are extended, it will not be able to deal with this matter.</p></speech>

At yesterday's meeting which lasted for four hours the Policing Authority made clear that it was unable to address issues related to the expenditure of &euro;26 million without a tendering process.  This committee will have to address the matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-22a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018032200002#B00900"><p>Does the Policing Authority have a role in considering other expenditure by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?</p></speech>

My understanding is that while An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must engage in a process with the Policing Authority to appoint a clerical officer, the authority cannot do anything about Garda expenditure of &euro;26 million without a tendering process.</p></speech>

The reopening of Garda stations raises financial as well as other issues.</p></speech>

As I stated, representatives of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are scheduled to appear at our meeting of 31 May and we will raise this issue at that meeting.</p> <p>  Item No. 1155B is correspondence, dated 8 March 2018, received from Ms Hilary Murphy-Fagan, chief executive, National Shared Services Office, providing a detailed breakdown of the &euro;812,000 spent on training and an explanatory note on temporary rehabilitation remuneration, formerly known as pension rate of pay, which the committee requested at our previous meeting.  I propose we note and publish the document.</p> <p>  Item No. 1156B is a letter from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, advising the committee that it is not the intention of the Minister to issue a minute in response to the committee's report on Project Eagle as the minute would relate to matters which were the subject of investigation under the terms of reference agreed to for the Cooke commission by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We will note and publish the document.  As Chairman, I am satisfied with Mr. Watt's response.  The normal procedure when the committee issues a report is that the relevant Department will respond.  In this case, I did not expect to receive a detailed response to our report, given that the Cooke commission was in place.  This has been confirmed by Mr. Watt.  It is helpful, however, that our report has been acknowledged.  We accept that a response would cut across the terms of reference of the Cooke commission. </p> <p>  Item No. 1161B is correspondence, dated 8 March 2018, received from Mr. Des Fitzgerald, president, University of Limerick, enclosing the Crowe Horwath report, as requested by the committee.  We will note and publish the document.</p></speech>

I note that the secretariat circulated to members a note detailing outstanding issues in the education sector generally.</p></speech>

For example, correspondence has been received from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills on the religious congregations.  We must also deal with the audit of the Kildare Vocational Educational Committee and the report on Waterford Institute of Technology.  I ask for a comprehensive discussion on education issues.</p></speech>

We will discuss the matter when we complete our discussion on correspondence.</p><p>Item No. 1170B is correspondence received from Mr. Tony O'Brien, director general, Health Service Executive, enclosing a briefing note on the procurement process for legal services, as requested by the committee.  We will note and publish the document.</p><p>Item No. 1178B  is correspondence received from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills, providing notes on voluntary offers made to the State by religious congregations in 2009, a follow-up audit of Kildare Vocational Education Committee and the review of eligibility for Caranua.  We will note and publish the documents.  Some of the information provided is working its way into our periodic report which we will publish next Wednesday at a time to be confirmed.  We have compiled a periodic report on the six meetings held in November and December 2017.  The report includes a number of conclusions and recommendations.  It was finalised yesterday in private session and the secretariat is readying it for publication.</p><p><b></b>Item<b></b>No. 1180B  is correspondence received from Ms Julie Sinnamon, chief executive officer, Enterprise Ireland, providing an information note on Knowledge Transfer Ireland.  We will note and publish the document.</p><p>Item No. 1184B  is correspondence received from Mr. Neil McDermott of the Higher Education Authority, providing an update note on the independent review of the spin-out and sale of companies at Waterford Institute of Technology.  The review is still not complete.  The committee was informed previously that due diligence and a legal review were required before completion.  That appears to be the reason for the delay.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-22a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018032200002#B02300"><p>I have a different understanding of the position.  I understand a report was completed, at least in draft form, and sent to the Higher Education Authority, HEA.  It then had to be legally proofed.  I do not know whether changes have become necessary as a result of communications between the legal representatives of the HEA and the author of the report which was submitted to the HEA in November 2017.  With April approaching, I am informed that it could be several months before the report is published.  I am concerned by the length of time it is taking to publish it.  As someone who received at least 14 protected disclosures about some of the issues addressed in the report, I am aware that its author met dozens of people in Waterford Institute of Technology.  Complications may have arisen because the report may make adverse references to persons other than those who made disclosures, provided information or were interviewed.  However, I do not know if that is the case because we have not had sight of the draft report.</p> <p>  I am also aware that at one point the Comptroller and Auditor General was considering whether to produce a report on the FeedHenry aspect of the issue.  FeedHenry was the spin-out company that was sold.  It was a different piece of work from the broader report being produced by Mr. McLoone.</p><p>It was more global in terms of the sale more generally of intellectual property in the institute.  Is the Comptroller and Auditor General still examining the FeedHenry issue or considering producing a report on it at some point?</p></speech>

We have looked in detail at the FeedHenry spin-out and the development, or at least the disposal, of the institute's interest in it.  I was holding off on making a decision to produce a report pending the issuing of Mr. McLoone's report because I felt it would be better to see it.  I believed that if we had something additional to add, we could then make a decision, but, given the time, it is probably better that we press ahead with the report.  I am working on it, with a view to clearing it with the interested parties.  It will, however, focus exclusively on interests in FeedHenry.</p></speech>

We will note and publish that item of correspondence.</p> <p>  The final category of correspondence is category C which includes correspondence from private individuals and any other correspondence.</p> <p>  Item No. 1138C is correspondence received from an individual about St. Angela's College, Sligo.  Item No. 1144C, correspondence received from Deputy Marc MacSharry, refers to this correspondence.  The individual in question is calling for four things: first, that we critically review his latest correspondence; second, that we request cumulative officially reported expenditure on the subject of litigation in 2017; third, that we confirm that the Comptroller and Auditor General's branch, in all relevant years, namely, from 2007 to 2017, inclusive, tested under the money-laundering legislation, as applicable, in the case of St. Angela's College and, if not, that such testing be undertaken, as appropriate, this being a matter for Mr. McCarthy; and, fourth, that we recommend that an audit of corporate governance and management be undertaken by St. Angela's College Sligo Limited.  Does the Comptroller and Auditor General have remarks to make?  We are not encroaching on his work, just referring to correspondence received.</p></speech>

Like all audits we carry out, we are certainly aware of the necessity to consider the possibility of fraud, but I have had no indication of anything in that regard.  As the audit for 2017 has not yet been completed, I cannot speak about that year, but I have had nothing to report in that connection in the past.</p></speech>

The individual has forwarded a number of solicitors' letters in which a number of allegations are made.  If he believes the allegations, he should pursue the matter further through the courts.  If he believes there are criminal actions, he should report them to the Garda.  That is not our function.  For our part and with his agreement, I propose that we forward the correspondence to the HEA for whatever action it deems appropriate.  Beyond that, I suggest we do not involve ourselves further.  We are not asking the HEA to do anything; we are forwarding the material to it for its attention for any action it chooses to take.  We can also expect every attempt to be made by public bodies to reduce expenditure on litigation.  The individual in question has asked for details of expenditure on legal fees in 2017.  I propose that we do not go there.  He can take up the matter through whatever other channels are available.  It is essentially a legal dispute and we are not going to get into it any further.  I have made the committee's view clear.  We will forward the material to the HEA.  The individual in question has the option of going to the courts.  It is a legal dispute that has been in the courts before.  If there are criminal matters involved, the individual in question has the option of going to the Garda, but the Committee of Public Accounts is not the appropriate body to take the matter further.  We are concluding our correspondence on the issue on that basis.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Item No. 1139C  is correspondence received from Professor Patrick O'Shea, president, University College Cork, enclosing information requested by the committee on the appointment process for the chief operations officer in the Tyndall National Institute.  Can we note the correspondence and forward a copy to the individual who raised the matter?  It is an employment matter.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Item No. 1148C  is correspondence received from Deputy Niamh Smyth.  It concerns the issue of corporate governance at Creative Ireland and the allocation of funding for various events and festivals.  I propose, in the first instance, that we write to the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht for a response which we will discuss when we receive it.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Item No. 1149C  is correspondence received from Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll, Secretary General, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, enclosing information requested by the committee on the Irish Horse Welfare Trust, an organisation which is based in County Wicklow.  Can we note the item and forward a copy to the individual who raised the matter?  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Item No. 1158C is correspondence received from an individual who alleges the unlimited waste of taxpayers' money to harass her family.  She has copied correspondence to the committee and been in touch with the health committee.  The substantive matter seems to relate to the taking into custody by the Garda of her children on two occasions, in 2013 and 2016, as a result of a court order.  It is not within the remit of the committee to consider court decisions.  I propose that we write to the individual in question to suggest she consider obtaining legal advice on her options.  I also propose that we write to state our consideration of the matter is now closed.  We certainly cannot revisit matters dealt with in the Family Court.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Item No. 1159C  is correspondence received from an individual concerning what he describes as the SIPTU-F&Aacute;S slush fund.  He questions why the committee is not investigating the matter which has been ongoing for five or six years at the committee.  It was considered by the previous committee.  There is also an ongoing investigation into the alleged misappropriation of grant funds and the issue remains within the remit of the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau.  The last committee submitted the matter to the Garda to investigate whether there was fraud involved.  This was communicated to the individual in question last November.  I propose that we write to him to state we do not propose to pursue the matter further and that he not circulate further correspondence on it to the committee.  If at some point the investigation is concluded by the Garda and there are matters arising from it that are relevant to the committee, we may return to the issue at that stage.  It has been handed over to the Garda and we are not getting involved at this stage.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

I presented a report on the issues of concern to the committee.  Recommendations were made to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform which were related to the systemic management of grants.  A circular was actually issued in response to the report to tighten the regime in the administration of grants.  The systemic issues were dealt with after the committee's consideration.</p></speech>

We shall note and publish the corresondence.  We wrote to Deputies Mary Lou McDonald and Noel Rock to thank them for their contributions to the work of the committee.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 1162C, correspondence, dated 6 March 2018, received from Nursing Homes Ireland.  It concerns the cost of care in HSE nursing homes.  Mr. Tadhg Daly, chief executive officer, Nursing Homes Ireland, has indicated his availability to discuss the matter with the committee.

I was astounded when I read the correspondence because it was specifically the CEO of Nursing Homes Ireland who had written to us to alert us to what his organisation regarded as increased costs in public nursing homes.  We need to remind ourselves that very serious allegations were made against Nursing Homes Ireland about price fixing and the running of a cartel.  I stress the word "allegations".</p><p>A witness was here and made a lot of interesting points which, to this day, we have not been able to put to Mr. Daly and Nursing Homes Ireland.  It takes a brass neck to send a note to the Committee of Public Accounts saying they are concerned about prices in respect of public nursing homes.  We afforded Mr. Daly an opportunity to come before the Committee of Public Accounts to deal with the issues.  It was not taken up and I understand that legal issues were raised.  He has very generously written to us to alert us to what he sees as an issue and it may be so.  It is worth examining whether we are getting value for money for public nursing homes.  However, there was a meeting and we got a report which has not yet been shredded.  It raised serious allegations of potential price-fixing and the operation of a cartel.  I propose that we invite Mr. Daly to come before the Committee of Public Accounts and I would love an opportunity to put all those questions to him - not just those relating to the issues he raises.  It took a brass neck to send the correspondence in question, given that his organisation has not responded to the very serious allegations that were made against it.</p></speech>

Following receipt of the documentation about alleged collusion and price-fixing, Deputy Thomas Byrne sent it to the to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, which has investigated the matter independently of us and concluded that there was no evidence to support the allegations.  The State body charged with examining the allegations has done that.  Nevertheless, we may still have questions to ask and, even if there was no collusion, the issue of pricing is relevant to us.  We will put it on the work programme.</p></speech>

No. 1164 is correspondence from myself enclosing an internal audit report on the subject of the activation and family support programme carried out by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  I was very concerned about the content of the report and I propose that we write to the Department for a detailed note on what actions have been taken arising from it, asking for a timeline and the current status of the scheme.  The report has been circulated and it was also discussed on RT&Eacute; recently.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 1165, from myself relating to an individual who is employed by the Irish Prison Service and who believes he was unfairly treated over a number of years.  This matter has come before us on a couple of occasions and his case was before the Workplace Relations Commission recently, which found in his favour and was condemnatory of the Irish Prison Service in regard to its treatment of him over a period of time.  He was awarded &euro;30,000 and this is public knowledge, with his solicitor having spoken about it to the media.  I suggest we write to the Prison Service for a note on what lessons it has learned from its handling of the issue, and what action it is taking to prevent a recurrence.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Ryan for giving consideration to matters raised by our own committee and the justice committee relating to the matter of funds managed in respect of wards of court.

We have also received correspondence, No. 1182, from Deputy Cullinane on the same issue.

The findings of the Console report, which we might discuss in the work programme, were so bad that the report itself said that it pointed to potentially systemic problems within the HSE, that they were not just with the funded organisations but also in the relationship between those organisations and the HSE.  That was not accepted by the director general, yet almost monthly we seem to have problems with funding in these organisations.  This is serious because there is a potential conflict of interest.  The report itself cites that issue.  There are also questions around credit card expenditure.  This has all come about on foot of an internal audit by the HSE.  Is that audit public?  Has it been published yet?  If not, can we have a copy of it?  My understanding is that St. John of God may also have been dealt with and that it was not just the hospice in Harold's Cross.  There were other issues as well.</p><p> It is unfortunate that we are back here again.  While we have dealt with this issue, it does not seem that controls have improved to any great degree.  These things are still happening.  This is not a section 39 organisation.  It is a section 38 one which receives very substantial amounts of taxpayers' money.  There is a difference between the two types of organisation and there needs to be a higher level of scrutiny because of it.  We will come back to it in the work programme.</p><p> How many times do we have to be here?  People are very rarely held to account.  The Accounting Officer from the HSE will tell us that the problems are all on the side of the funded organisations.  In fact, the internal auditors of the HSE were in disagreement with the director general in terms of whether there were systemic issues for the HSE.  We have to deal with this once and for all because there is obviously a need to sharpen up governance arrangements.  Perhaps the Comptroller and Auditor General can inform us as to what work his office did in this area.</p></speech>

There is no sanction here.  It is not the committee's fault.  This committee was traditionally more powerful.  If issues arose, people were brought in and there was some sanction.  However, now outcomes from this committee are broadly noted.  When there is institutional culpability, the reaction is to announce a review or to ensure that a report is carried out.  Nothing will happen and everybody walks away freely without consequence.  This has happened with the Garda matters we looked at among others matters.  The lack of answers forthcoming and the lack of candour that we have seen demonstrates that this committee, which is the only constitutional committee of the State, can be treated with disdain and contempt without fear or favour.  The CEOs of State agencies need have no concerns about how money is spent or how things are done.  They will come to this committee and any issues will be noted on the audit report but there will be no net outcome.  The same thing then happens a couple of years later and we are here again.  There will be a slap on the knuckles and nothing happens again.  That is an issue for Government to consider.  It should not just allow us to continue as busy hard-working fools at this committee but should ensure that if we find misappropriation or make recommendations, tangible outcomes, including sanction, will follow.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-22a.67" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018032200002#E00300"><p>The latest piece of work we have done relating to HSE oversight of grant-funded bodies was in last year's annual report.  The committee examined that chapter last October.  The committee may have reported its consideration of that report.</p> <p>  The internal audit work on this particular section 38 body looked back at the period 2012 to 2014.  While it may seem that there has not been much reaction, I certainly feel that a better effort is being made by the HSE to get on top of the oversight issue.  Earlier I mentioned the tightening of controls as a result of the committee's consideration of the levy fund.  The complete effect of that tightening up has not worked its way through the system for the time period that the internal audit was looking at.  One of the things we have been pushing with the HSE is for it to acknowledge that there are problems and to outline the steps it is taking.  Each year in the statement on internal financial control it has acknowledged that weaknesses have been brought to its attention by my office and by its own internal audit and that it is making better efforts.  It still has things to fix and it will take more time to achieve tighter control in that area, but I do believe that it is happening, that the HSE has engaged with the matter and that it is trying to deal with it at a systemic level.</p></speech>

We have a lot on our work programme but it might be useful if we write to the director general of the HSE and ask for a detailed note on exactly what improvements have been made since the Comptroller and Auditor General's chapter on this issue was published and since the executive's appearance before this committee.  We should ask what improvements in governance service level agreements and oversight have been made and that might shape the debate on this issue and affect the decision as to whether we revisit the issue.</p></speech>

Based on our previous experience with Console, I expect we will get a copy of it but that it will be sent to us on a confidential basis and will not be for publication.</p> <p>  To explain to people watching why that is the case, a report carried out by internal auditors is not intended for publication.  If it were to be published, it would have to be legally prepared and tested in case anybody wanted to contest an issue.  It is essentially an internal matter.  To publish something that was produced only to a standard for internal circulation would be a different issue for the HSE.  The HSE has never published its internal audit report because it would have to proof every internal audit report legally and it would lead to different issues.  In terms of the Console audit report, we all received copies of it here and discussed it at length.  Neither the HSE nor this committee published it.  It was widely circulated in the media but we did not publish it because there was obviously some quite strong issues therein which might have led to legal issues.  We will ask for a copy of this report and consider it.</p> <p>  I want to remind members that as a result of our work with the HSE and the section 38 and 39 organisations, we received 100% of all financial statements from 2016.  The organisations were here last September or October and they had provided over 70% of the statements.  The HSE's record of getting section 38 and 39 bodies to comply with their financial reporting obligations was far greater than the public sector organisations we deal with here.</p> <p>  We all see a big gap in procurement.  Procurement always happens without the proper procurement processes being in place, and that to me is still the weakest link in the HSE at the moment. </p> <p>  On the issue of the section 38 and 39 organisations, all of the historic issues of people receiving double or extra payments or extra allowances have been brought into line bar the final few.</p><p>Apart from a small number of people at grades 4 and 5, they have all been brought into line with public service payment schedules.  Some people had to leave their posts because they did not agree to that.  There has been some improvement and we might refresh ourselves on that, although work remains to be done.  However, here we go again.  I accept everything Mr. McCarthy says in this regard.</p></speech>

If this was from 2012 to 2014 and if improvements have since been made and we have examined it, then we need to put that caveat out there in terms of this organisation.  That is an important point.  From recollection of our exchange with the director general, however, section 39 organisations might receive only 5% of their funding from the HSE, for example.  The valid point was made that we do not want to create too much red tape for small organisations that might not have the expertise to deal with higher levels of oversight.  However, a section 38 organisation is a horse of a different colour and there must be far higher levels of oversight of such organisations.  I accept what Mr. McCarthy stated in terms of this issue relating to some time ago, but it is only now coming into the public domain.  There is an internal audit report which we have a responsibility to examine.  We should get that report and get an update from the director general as to what changes have since been made, which would provide a basis for us to then make a decision.</p></speech>

Some are great on specific detail but miss the elephant in the room, which is a phrase I have used before.  How many internal audit reports are there?  Perhaps the committee should, as a matter of form, ask bodies appearing before it on an annual basis for the schedules of internal audit reports.  Mr McCarthy's office obviously sees those as part of his audit.</p></speech>

Internal audits and the consideration of those reports by the audit committee are key internal financial controls.  There is space for all public bodies to give more information about the internal audit programme they carry out, its completeness and so on.  In fairness to the HSE, many of its internal audit reports are published.  I am unclear as to whether that is as a result of freedom of information requests but it produces approximately 50 reports per year, some on individual grant-funded agencies and others on internal HSE systems, controls and the operation thereof.  Where possible, it has been willing to make those reports public and sometimes puts them on its website.  There may be specific problems with reports involving an allegation of fraud and such reports are trickier to handle than where there was a looseness in terms of spending but there was no fraud involved.</p></speech>

Representatives of the HSE will appear before the committee before the summer is out in any event.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 1169 from David Begg, chairperson of the Pensions Authority, enclosing a note requested by the committee on the CI&Eacute; pension scheme for regular wages staff.  We note and publish that.  I think it has already been widely circulated.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 1171 from Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, in regard to St. Conleth's Community College, Newbridge.  Members will recall that we came across this issue in regard to matters relating to Kildare and Wicklow ETB.  There were concerns about health and safety standards but the Department informs us they have been fully addressed.  Can we note the correspondence and send a copy of it to the individual who raised the issue with us?  Agreed.  We will also publish it.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 1174 from the whistleblowers known as B and C in regard to the University of Limerick.  They take issue with the Thorn report into certain matters and allegations relating to the university and wish to meet the committee.  If we proceed with our meeting with the other whistleblower, to which we have agreed in principle, then I propose we also meet these individuals as it would give us greater insight into the matter.  Although we have not decided the format of such meeting or whether it would be in public or private session, these whistleblowers have requested to meet us, so we will agree to that in principle.  That is agreed and we will discuss it again as part of our work programme.</p> <p>  Correspondence No. 1176 dated 5 March from an individual alleging several Departments are misclassifying employees as self-employed in order for some employers to evade PRSI obligations.  This is a large document and at first glance appears to be related to a matter previously considered by the committee in some depth.  I propose in the first instance that we write back to the individual seeking a summary of which Departments are involved and how such misclassification is being done.</p></speech>

Anybody looking at these financial statements should understand what the liability is and that there is an assumption being made that the State will meet the pension liability.  That is the second of the bullet points in the document the Chairman is reading.</p> <p>  There is a specific issue in Cork in respect of what is called pension added years.  There was a dispute between the university and the Department in respect of liability for certain of those pension add-ons.  The total value of meeting those liabilities is estimated at &euro;15.7 million.  Subsequent to the end of the period of account, an agreement was reached between the Department and UCC that they will meet those liabilities on a 50-50 basis.  What the university has done is to recognise the liability and to present it on the basis that the Department would meet 100% of it.  Because it is a post-balance sheet agreement, it should have been presented without that &euro;15.7 million of an asset.  It is a technical point.  In the future, if the value were the same, half of it could be recognised because the Department has given an undertaking to meet that liability.</p></speech>

I am not going to accept this.  We have been down the road on this a number of times.  I raised another issue in respect of the Cork Opera House, which they are now funding under own funded sources or whatever phrase they use.</p> <p>  The issue here is that there is an extra pension liability as a result of legal challenges to decisions that were made by the college.  As a consequence, that has to be met by the university and paid for proportionately out of that whole pie of funding by the taxpayer.  That is the bottom line here.  We need to get to the bottom of why we ended up in this scenario on these pensions from this university.  What professional decisions were made on employment that resulted in people getting their legal entitlements - I have no issues with that - ending up in court and winning?</p> <p>  Ultimately it is the taxpayer who pays.  I do not buy any of this rubbish about non-taxpayer funded sources.  They should be banned, in my opinion.  It all goes into one pot.  The total taxpayer-related funding could be 60%, 70% or whatever.  Whatever the net cost to the taxpayer of an issue like this because of decisions they made, it is proportionately being paid in that amount by the taxpayer in the first place.  We need to ask questions about this and dig into it.  The taxpayer is ultimately funding the majority of this bill.  It is not non-taxpayer related funding.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-22a.183" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018032200002#H02400"><p>From an accounting perspective, I can fully understand how one would and could label it as non-Exchequer funding sources.  From a financial or accounting perspective, that is fine.  We know there are multiple income streams, separate from State funding, for institutes of technologies and more so for universities.  The difficulty, as Teachta Kelly said, is that there is an added liability to this being met by the institution.  Even if we take the line that it is coming from non-Exchequer funding sources, that means the money is not being spent on other services.  It is sleight of hand in some respects.  It is still money that is spent by an institution that is primarily funded by the taxpayer.  Contributions from parents and students have also increased substantially in recent years.  Any added liability as a consequence of actions taken would obviously raise concerns for us and for those who pay the fees.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General might be able to help me unpack some of the language.  The document states, "This treatment is not in accordance with the requirements of FRS 102 Section 21 [whatever that is] 'Provisions and Contingencies' because the receivable is contingent in nature."  Will Mr. McCarthy explain to us what that means in layman's terms?  The document also refers to "the non-consolidation of Cork University Foundation DAC, which had accumulated reserves of &euro;4.1 million".  Teachta Connolly has raised issues about foundations before.  Is that a qualified opinion because the consolidation did not happen as quickly as it should have?  Is that what the issue is?</p> <p>  Reading the final reference in this section of the document, here we go again with procurement.  Going back to the point made by Teachta MacSharry on procurement, there is no sanction or penalty.  We have said this over and over again.  It is becoming really frustrating.  What is the point in having all of these accounts presented to us?  Almost every week, there is some public body that does not follow procurement guidelines.  Notwithstanding whether they are watching their backs in terms of being sued or if there is a party that did not get the contract that might sue them, that is separate in my view.  In terms of breaching guidelines set down and there being no penalty except a slap on the wrist, it really is becoming a joke.  Did we make recommendations in any of our periodic reports in this respect?  One of the things we can do is recommend to Government, to Departments and to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, DPER, that they should apply sanctions in this regard.</p></speech>

Throughout the year the committee has raised concerns about the amounts of money spent through public private partnerships, in the education and transport sectors in particular.  In 2016 the figure for commitments to PPPs was &euro;6.6 billion.  Members have been worried about the level of transparency surrounding some of the biggest infrastructural projects in the country.  This is an important meeting in trying to understand whether and how value for money is being achieved in the spending of public money on these projects.  We are joined from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform by Mr. Robert Watt and Mr. Brendan Ellison; from the National Development Finance Agency by Mr. Gerard Cahillane, Mr. Paul O'Neill and Mr. Sean Court; from the Department of Education and Skills by Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Ms Emma Leonard and Mr. Gary O'Doherty; and from Transport Infrastructure Ireland by Mr. Michael Nolan, Mr. Nigel O'Neill and Mr. Michael Kennedy.</p><p>We have picked Transport Infrastructure Ireland and the Department of Education and Skills as two of the key State bodies involved in PPPs.  Other Departments are involved in PPPs, but we could not bring everybody in and considered these to be two of the key bodies involved, with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and especially the National Development Finance Agency which is heavily involved in the entire process.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to airplane mode.

PPPs may take a number of forms, reflecting the manner in which investment project risks are shared between the public and private partners and the manner in which the private sector partners are remunerated for their input.  In many cases, the public sector partner pays the private sector partner for the provision of the assets or services in the form of regular agreed unitary payments over the life of the contract.  In other cases, including tolled roads, the private sector partner is remunerated through payments by service users or a combination of user charges and State payments.</p> <p>  The report before the committee aims to provide an overview, to mid-2017, of PPP-related payments and commitments made by central government agencies arising from contracts entered into in the past two decades and further projects in development.  Members should note that the report does not deal with PPP commitments entered into by local authorities, for example, in respect of the Poolbeg waste incineration facility or the areas of water and wastewater treatment facilities, responsibility for which has transferred to Irish Water.</p><p>The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform maintains a central website providing details of the Exchequer-funded payments under public private partnership, PPP, arrangements.  This indicates that as of end-2016, projects already entered into involve Exchequer payments totalling an estimated &euro;9.6 billion, with just over &euro;3 billion already incurred and an estimated &euro;6.6 billion in outstanding commitments.  This compares to total Exchequer payments and commitments on PPP projects at end 2012 estimated at &euro;6.1 billion.</p><p> In figure 4.1, the report outlines the status as at July 2017 of a programme of 12 major PPP projects in train or announced in July 2012.  Three of the projects have not progressed as PPPs.  Of the remainder, two were operational by July 2017, six were in construction and one was still in procurement.  Two further projects announced after 2012 - a social housing bundle and a second motorway services area bundle - had commenced procurement by July 2017, and a number of others were in development at that time.  Payments under Exchequer-backed PPP arrangements in 2016 amounted to &euro;225 million.  We noted that the infrastructure and capital investment plan 2016 to 2021 had indicated that a cash limit had been placed on the annual cost of PPPs.  The Accounting Officer for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will be able to update the committee in that regard.</p><p> The Department&rsquo;s public spending code requires that, before a State body commits to a major capital project, it should assess whether there is a clear socio-economic case for the infrastructure or service.  If such a case can be made, a follow-on exercise is required to establish whether it is more cost effective to procure the proposed investment via a PPP structure or to use a more conventional procurement approach.  This value for money testing of the procurement method is done by comparing the projected Exchequer net cost under the PPP approach with the estimated benchmark net cost of delivering the project using conventional procurement.  Responsibility for ensuring the value for money testing is done rests with the sponsoring Department or agency, and the National Development Finance Agency assists public sector bodies with this analysis as required.</p><p> Public bodies are also required to carry out look-back evaluations of PPP projects when they are up and running for a reasonable time, indicating how the outturn compares to the original project proposed, and what useful lessons can be learned for improving succeeding projects, including those procured conventionally.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland does this routinely, and the Courts Service reviewed the Central Criminal Court's PPP.  At the reporting date, however, the Department of Education and Skills had not carried out any look-back reviews, even though it has many PPPs in place.  I have previously reported that very little information is made publicly available about PPP pre or post contract with regard to value for money evaluation results.  Publication of the evaluations, or at least summaries of key evaluation assumptions and findings, should help to improve public understanding of the factors that influence the achievement of good value for the public money spent on PPPs.</p><p> Contract monitoring and enforcement are key to ensuring good value is delivered through PPPs.  Penalties provided for in contracts have been applied in some cases where service performance and availability of facilities have not met specified standards.  Periodic benchmarking and market testing of service costs have also been carried out in a number of cases but these have generally not resulted in significant changes in costs.</p></speech>

We welcome the report and its recommendation.<br/><br/>The primary role of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in PPPs is to facilitate the PPP process centrally by developing the general policy framework and the capital investment policy framework, within which the PPP operates.  The new national development plan, launched by the Government recently, is the new framework within which we consider these matters.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform also facilitates the PPP process by providing central guidance to Departments and other State authorities in that context.  Responsibility for individual PPP and concession projects rests with the relevant sponsoring Department or agency, where appropriate.  This includes financial responsibility and responsibility for compliance with the requirements of the public spending code and the overall PPP guidance set out by our Department.<br/><br/>The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform publishes a full suite of guidance to facilitate the PPP process, which is available on the central PPP unit's website at <i>www.ppp.gov.ie</i>.<br/><br/>To ensure that Departments obtain the best value-for-money from public capital investment, PPPs are subject to the same robust and rigorous project appraisal process as applies to traditionally procured projects.  All projects over &euro;20 million are required under the public spending code to be subject to a cost benefit analysis or cost effectiveness analysis.  In addition, the public spending code also requires that the sponsoring agency seeks the advice of the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, on all projects above &euro;20 million, in terms of the optimum means of financing the project on a value for money basis, to assess whether traditional or PPP methods of procurement are the best way to ensure value for money and to deliver the project for the taxpayers and citizens.  The public spending code also provides that the options should be considered by the sponsoring agency as part of the project appraisal.<br/><br/>The public spending code requirements ensure that all PPPs are subject to specific value for money tests at four stages during the procurement process.  There are particular requirements in respect of PPP projects.<br/><br/>Following completion of the project, all PPPs are subject to the public spending code requirement that a post project review be carried out, once sufficient time has elapsed to allow the project to be properly evaluated with sufficient evidence of the flows of benefits and costs from the project.  There should be two separate focuses of such a review - project outturn and the appraisal and management procedures.  These may be undertaken at the same time or at different stages, but they should be done as soon as is practicable.  In the case of PPP projects, once contract close has been reached, the cost of the project to the sponsoring agency is essentially set for the duration of the contract.  It is, therefore, possible for an element of the post project review to be undertaken on a provisional basis at that stage.  A final, definitive post-project review for PPP projects will effectively only be possible at the completion of the contract when the asset is handed back to the sponsoring agency and all costs arising under the PPP contract are definitively known.  This is normally after 20 or 25 years, which is the normal period over which these contracts are set.  An interim review conducted mid-way through the life of the contract could provide a useful indication of the likely final outcome at hand-back.<br/><br/>Post-project reviews are not the only mechanism for reviewing past experience in order to draw lessons which can be applied in the future.  The NDFA is the financial adviser on all PPPs and procures all accommodation projects on behalf of the sponsoring Departments.  Experience gained on each project procured helps inform the procurement of each subsequent project.  The NDFA also carries out an in-house lessons learned exercise following all PPP procurements.  This enables them to see what improvements can be made in processes and procedures.  This has resulted in a number of changes in the way PPPs are procured over the years.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform chairs a PPP steering group, which meets regularly to review progress across all PPPs in planning, procurement and operation.  This group provides a forum for the sharing of information and experience in the planning and delivery of PPPs, so that lessons learned on one project or in one area can be applied across the entire PPP programme.<br/><br/>The committee will also be aware that there have been two recent reviews of PPP policy in Ireland.  One review was part of the public investment management assessment, PIMA, of Ireland undertaken by the IMF in July of last year at the invitation of the Department of Finance.  We asked the IMF to review of capital planning and appraisal, including PPPs.  The second PPP review was undertaken by an inter-Departmental and agency group, which was established in 2017 to review Ireland's experience of PPPs and to make recommendations on the future role of PPPs in the context of the Government&rsquo;s new ten year national development plan.  The PIMA report categorised the institutional strength of-----</p></speech>

Aspects of it were referenced in the national development plan.  I would be happy to give a broad outline of where we are but the Government has not approved it yet.  This will happen shortly, at which time it will be published in its entirety.</p> <p>  The PIMA report characterised the institutional strength of the PPP management framework as good, and its effectiveness as medium.  The IMF made a small number of recommendations to further strengthen the process and procedures already in place.  The PIMA report was published last November and is available on the Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p> The report of the PPP review is with the Minister, who intends to bring the report to Government in the coming weeks for approval to publish.  However, the key findings and recommendations agreed were included in the NDP published in February.  These can be summarised as follows.</p><p> The review concluded that PPPs have been very useful in the past in facilitating the delivery of important infrastructure projects.  This was particularly the case when the Exchequer was seriously constrained in its ability to fund infrastructure directly during the fiscal crisis.  It was noted that this enabled projects to proceed which would not otherwise have been deliverable on the basis of the Exchequer funding available at that time alone.  However, under more normal economic and fiscal circumstances, the ability to use PPPs to deliver "additionality" in that context is now less relevant.  The NDP sets out the Government's plans to increase public capital investment to among the highest levels in the EU and sustain it at that level over the period to 2027.  In this context, the pursuit of further additional investment projects by PPP, over and above the planned NDP level of investment, is not recommended.  To do so would pose a risk that such projects could give rise to a level of public capital investment overall that is not consistent with macroeconomic or fiscal sustainability.  The PPP review therefore recommends that PPPs should continue to feature as a procurement option available to Government for appropriately structured projects which demonstrate value for money over a traditional procurement option and which meet the robust and rigorous tests for project appraisal that apply to all public investment projects under the public spending code.  However, projects to be pursued in this way by PPP should be progressed as part of the NDP, as opposed to additional projects.  This is consistent with the PIMA recommendations.  Accordingly, decisions on pursuing further PPPs will be taken on a case-by-case basis based on the merits of using PPP in the case of each individual project.</p><p> The PPP review recommended two other changes, the first of which was the discontinuation of the budgetary control mechanism limiting exposure to PPPs to 10% of the aggregate Exchequer capital allocation on an annual basis.  In effect, this was the approach we introduced a number of years ago which meant that unitary payments in any year could not be more than 10% of the Exchequer capital cost.  Therefore, if the overall Exchequer programme was &euro;5 billion, the unitary payments on PPPs could not exceed more than &euro;500 million on an annual basis.  The review recommended reinstating the previous budgetary control mechanism of charging the capital value of PPPs to the capital allocation of the sponsoring Department over the construction period.  This will ensure that PPPs and traditionally procured projects are treated equally in the selection of the most appropriate procurement mechanism for each individual project.  This approach was also recommended by the IMF in the PIMA report.  This is a significant recommendation which in effect ensures that Departments face the same incentives when they are choosing between a PPP project or an Exchequer-funded project because the capital cost of the PPP would be notionally charged to their accounts as if it were procured traditionally.  This means, regarding the accounting treatment, that there is no bias one way or the other in respect of the selection of projects.  This is a fundamental change which will impact how we select, approve and develop this programme into the future.  In addition, in order to improve transparency in reporting on PPPs, a number of changes in the reporting arrangements have also been recommended and will be introduced.  These involve publishing cost-benefit analyses, CBAs, and public sector benchmark reports and in effect making available the information that is used to make decisions to make that information available publicly.</p><p> I hope I have given the committee an understanding of the role of our Department in respect of PPP, some assurance regarding the guidance and procedures which are in place to ensure PPPs are used to provide a value-for-money option for the State, and an update on some of the key policy developments in this area.  I am very happy to answer any questions the committee may have.</p></speech>

I will keep strictly to the time, and people will get an opportunity to come back in a second time.  The term "public private partnership" has been used.  Before I call on the Deputies, will Mr. Watt explain to the public in straightforward English what precisely is meant by PPP?  They can be design, design-build, design-build-operate or finance.  It is a very broad term.  Will Mr. Watt explain why some are one kind and others are another kind?  We have used the term "PPP" probably 20 times already, so I ask him to tell people what a PPP is.  This is for the benefit of people watching these proceedings on the television.</p></speech>

I ask the committee to think about the building of a school.  Let us say the school costs &euro;5 million.  Traditionally, one would take two or three years to build the school and the cost would be charged to the Exchequer in the normal way.  This is the normal appropriation with which members would be familiar.  It is a standard, traditional approach.  It is how most schools, for example, are procured.  PPPs involve a contract whereby we enter into an agreement for 20 or 25 years.  The private sector builds, as it would in the case of traditional appropriation, but under design-build-operate-finance, DBOF, it would also provide the finance and would enter into an agreement to sustain, maintain and hand back the school after 25 years.  There is therefore a difference between this type of contract and the way in which we traditionally procure.  The unitary payments then would be made over 20 or 25 years.  That would be the standard.  These unitary payments would be a charge on the Exchequer each year over the period of the contract.  The unitary payment in effect would cover the capital cost, the financing cost and the operating and maintenance costs of the project.  That is the commonest standard form.</p> <p>  Road projects are a combination of concessions whereby tolling is involved as well, so there is a combination of user charges and unitary payments.  This is a little more complex, but in effect we enter into an agreement whereby company X would build a motorway and there would be a concession.  Some of the projects could be tolled, and the toll could meet a significant part of the payment.  Then there could be issues regarding guarantees.  Our colleagues from Transport Infrastructure Ireland can talk in more detail about some of these contracts.  They are quite complex.  Again, they are a subset of PPPs which are different.  Outside of tolling, the main one would be a DBOF, which is as I have described.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Watt think that public private partnerships, PPPs, on the basis that the post-project reviews have not been published, are transparent for the taxpayer and, indeed, the Comptroller and Auditor General, in terms of us independently assessing whether we get value for money?</p></speech>

First of all, there is the assessment, which we undertake, to assess whether we should build the school in the first place.  That is the cost-benefit analysis.</p> <p>  Secondly, it is whether the PPP option versus the traditionally procured option makes sense, and that is the public sector benchmark.  We now publish the public sector benchmark.  I think within the pack there are examples of that from the different sectors that are available.  We have committed to and we have set out, in our response to the report, that we are in favour of publishing the post-project reviews so that people can look and then see in detail.</p></speech>

A number of projects have been undertaken using the PPP model but no post-project reviews have been published.  In other words, I, as a taxpayer and as a member of this committee and, indeed, the Comptroller and Auditor General who audits these issues, are totally in the dark about whether these projects have worked, their effectiveness, whether certain variations are effective and whether they were value for money.  As we do not possess any of that data, how can Mr. Watt even remotely think that this matter has been transparent?  It is not as if we have not been provided with the information that would allow us to make those judgments.</p></speech>

So where there are variations in contracts we set that out.  There are changes in performance review clauses.  The Comptroller and Auditor General sets out, in detail, where that impact occurs.  That information is out there and it is reviewed.</p> <p>  In terms of the original value for money assessment, we set out for the committee the public sector benchmark where we say, at the time the contract was established and it was decided to go ahead with the procurement of PPPs, we set out the assessment there of the costs and benefits of the PPP against the traditional.  </p> <p>  In terms of, over time, looking at the value of any piece of infrastructure, so let us say one looks at a road that will be there for 20 or 25 years.  So the benefits of the road over time would be the traffic volumes, the time savings and the impact on congestion.  Reading a particular review would tell one.  </p></speech>

I am very concerned about the delay in publishing these reports because the taxpayer needs to be in possession of such information in order to make a credible judgment.</p> <p>  In terms of Project Ireland 2040 and the fact that the economy has significantly improved, has the State resiled from PPPs?  Has the State walked away from them?  </p></speech>

What we said is that during the crisis PPPs were there.  They achieved value for money but they were there also, in terms of additionality, because we were not in a position to fund all of the capital needs that we wanted to with funds from the Exchequer, in the normal way, because of the large deficit that we had.  There was merit in terms of looking at PPPs as a stimulus, and that was the policy.  That was set out.  Now that we are in different times we can fund more of our needs through the Exchequer through the traditional way.  There is not the same requirement for additionality from PPPs as an additional source of finance.  Within the accounting treatment that I mentioned, we have changed the rules where, in the past, it was set at 10% of the overall capital programme.  Now we are saying that the capital cost of PPPs should be charged against the accounts in the same way as traditional.  We are not resiling from PPPs.  It has a role to play.  Certainly, its role is different now given the changed circumstances in which we find ourselves.</p></speech>

One must ask the following questions.  Are PPPs value for money?  Do they impose huge risks on taxpayers?  Does Mr. Watt agree that PPPs are risky for taxpayers?</p></speech>

It is set out that the financing costs of PPPs are more expensive than the costs for the Exchequer because it is private finance so it is more expensive.  There is the cost of planned maintenance over a period, which can be expensive.  The higher cost to the State needs to be balanced against the benefits and the risk transfer, and that is always the calculation.  We are very cautious about PPPs.</p><p>We have a policy approach which reflects that caution.  Public private partnerships, PPS, will play probably less of a role in the future than they have done in the past, reflecting that caution.  It is a very difficult calculation to make.  Members would have seen the public sector benchmark and the details.  It is very difficult to make a comparison between a PPP project, which sets out the financing cost, the maintenance and so on, against a traditionally procured approach where the maintenance cost or something like that is a budgetary over time.  It is very hard to make that comparison, and members can see in the papers the discussion that is set out in reaching that conclusion.  I do not think PPPs will play as significant a role in the future but they do have a role to play and, as I mentioned, we are cautious about this type of financing because it can be expensive for the State.</p></speech>

Of the three projects in Ireland, one would be termed a PPP but I am at a loss to understand the reason for that because it was not completed.  "NA" is in all the boxes in the tabular format; they do not seem to reference it much.  In terms of the general points, however, the report indicates there are massive risks in terms of competition in the tendering process for PPS and that there is a potential exposure to the State.

They are more complex and more involved, and there are different stages in the process.  There is the procurement, the financial close area and so on.  It is probably fair to say it is more complex, and that complexity can lead to more risks.  As the Deputy will have seen from the papers, we have in place a very detailed approach to assessing, valuating and procuring to ensure we are minimising that risk and getting value for money for the Exchequer, but there is no doubt these can be incredibly involved and, with complexity, can become more risky.  The key challenge for us is to ensure the risk is transferred to the private sector.  That is part of the reason we pay higher financing costs.  For example, the risk of maintaining the school over 25 years is with the private contractor.  With traditional procurement, we build a school and then the school principal and board of management, with the support of the Department, is responsible for maintaining it so in terms of the risk on us to maintain that school, within a PPP that risk is transferred and they have to hand over the school in good condition after 25 years or there are penalties incurred.  That risk transfer piece is the key issue for us.  In terms of the higher costs we pay and whether we are getting the benefit of those risk transfers, that comes down to a judgment, and it can be difficult at times.</p></speech>

In terms of the M3 Clonee to Kells motorway or the Limerick tunnel and the potential huge risk to which the taxpayer is exposed, that is a huge challenge to meet.</p></speech>

There is also a risk with a traditionally procured motorway where we might have said that X number of vehicles would use the road and it turns out the number is not X.  In that case, there is not a financial penalty to the State in that sense but there is a significant loss to the State because the benefits of the road subsequently are not commensurate with the benefits we thought of.  It is not the case that there are no risks with those type of contracts.  In regard to PPPs, it is more transparent that we have not met the traffic projections, as opposed to projects which are procured traditionally.  Where there is a loss to the State it is a notional loss because the value of the investment we made has not been realised.</p></speech>

We have projections for the numbers of students in schools.  The majority of our PPPs have been second level schools.  The second level school-going population will continue to increase until 2026.  We track the numbers in each of the bundles of schools.  We are aware of the numbers in terms of the effective use and design of the buildings and knowing that the need exists.</p> <p>  One of the advantages of working with schools is that we have had good planning in place for the past ten years and we know the location of the bundles of population so that, other than where school choice arises, we know where the potential population for school children will be and therefore that the schools will be used.  Also, in terms of the type of schools we choose for PPPs, we have to go for new schools or newly built schools of an existing school, often after an amalgamation, so that we know there is a demand for a large number of pupils in the school.  We do not enter into PPPs for small extensions and things like that; they have to be major projects which are then bundled together.</p></speech>

We were very appreciative that while investment was cut across the board on the capital side in the downturn, we maintained a significant schools budget to deal with the additional places we needed, and we had to make sure we put the effort and energy into that.

The agency helps to design it and when the project is up and running, it goes back to the Department.

It is extraordinary that one review was carried out months or years ago and that nobody has chosen to even look at it.  Do the witnesses understand that this is really a Pontius Pilate job of washing one's hands of it?  Where is the joined-up public service?

It was completed in October 2012 and the complex had opened around 2009.  The stated overall aim of the review was to determine whether any stage of the courts project could have been done better, with any lessons applied to future projects.  The review approach concentrated on assessing the processes used rather than the outcome of the project in terms of impact on court business.  At an overall level, the review concluded that the project objectives had been realised within a timeframe appropriate for a PPP project of its complexity.  It concluded that the project processes had been satisfactory.  The review suggested that further analysis should be carried out to assess the operational impacts resulting from the delivery of the project.</p> <p>  In terms of learning lessons, the review included recommendations for the PPP process and some of the recommendations were specific to the project; others had more general application.  These indicated that future projects should report against a benefits realisation plan and strategy and an issues log should be produced and maintained to record details of key decisions in a single document.  It is important to distinguish between a process review, or seeing how procurement worked and whether it could be streamlined, and whether the value proposal or business case was realised.</p></speech>

We listed a summary of the findings in the report and as Mr. Nolan has said, they will be published in the near future.  One of the big lessons we learned was that forecasting traffic in a toll demand scenario was very difficult.  As Deputy Burke mentioned, there was significant risk and much of it was carried by the private sector.  There are two schemes with a floor on the exposure of the private sector but it means they are hovering at a low level in terms of where they thought they might be with traffic.  For the other six toll concession schemes out there, they carried all the risk.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General has said, the reviews we undertook were for the procurement and statutory approval processes, as well as how it was done and the out-turn and timing of processes.  In a number of cases, it was recommended, given that traffic had not been as expected, that additional cost-benefit analyses should be done.  These were done in two cases and there is another we ought to do.  We will do that.  In all cases, it found that processes were satisfactory and the decision to procure via PPP was correct.  The cost-benefit outturns proved that the roads continued to represent value for money for the State.</p></speech>

The committee met briefly in private session to discuss the progress of the meeting.  The committee is disappointed that none of the post-project reviews has been published.  It would have been of tremendous assistance to the public, the national Parliament and the Committee of Public Accounts to have a meaningful discussion in respect of value for money with regard to those projects.  There is a commitment to publish them.  It has not happened yet.  We are told that some will be published in a couple of months' time.  It is clear to this committee that, while we can have a useful engagement today, it will certainly not be possible for us to conclude our business as a result of today's meeting.  That will have to wait until such time as we see some of these reviews published.  We will be proceeding but we will not be able to conclude.  I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to give us some context in respect of where we are with this issue.</p></speech>

It is a recommendation which we have previously made.  On previous occasions, Departments had indicated that they had some concerns about the timing of publication and commercial sensitivities that might arise.  There are ways of working with the information and of putting useful information into the public domain which, as Deputy Burke mentioned earlier, would help to build confidence in procurement through public private partnership, PPP, where it can be demonstrated that it delivers good value for money.</p></speech>

As the Comptroller and Auditor General has said, we have now committed to publishing.  I do not think Deputies should have been surprised that we have not published them heretofore because that is very clear in our response to the recommendation on page 65 of the report.  We accept the merit of the argument and we are in favour of having a much more transparent and open approach to these matters in order that Deputies, on behalf of the citizens, can establish that these projects represent value for money.  It is an important issue and we have set out more information here than ever before in respect of public sector benchmarks, cost-benefit analyses and so on.  We are very happy to work with the committee.  I have spoken with colleagues and we will publish the reviews as quickly as we can and we will move on with it.</p> <p>  I do not think, however, that we can let go of the remark levelled at us by Deputy Cullinane suggesting that we have adopted a cavalier attitude to coming before the committee.  That is not fair.  We have presented a large amount of information to this committee in order to assist it.  We have worked with the Comptroller and Auditor General in the preparation of his report and we are all here.  Many of my colleagues are here to answer the committee's questions.  We have fairly answered all of the questions put to us this morning.  I want to put it on record that I do not accept for one moment that officials have adopted a cavalier approach.  In actual fact it is quite the opposite.  We have been quite upfront and honest in terms of the information we have provided and in terms of our responses this morning.  I do not want to strike a discordant note at this meeting, but I am very happy to take it up with the Chairman and Deputy Cullinane on another date if he really, genuinely believes that we have adopted a cavalier approach to this committee, because I do not accept that for one moment.</p></speech>

I think Mr. Watt would accept that the reports are not out.  As I said, we will not be able to complete our consideration of the PPP chapter in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General until we see some of these reports published.  They will help us conclude.  I do not think there is a bias involved.  It is good for confidence in PPPs.  People might have different views on the concept but many people are happy to see work going ahead.  The public, however, wants to be assured that it is getting value for money.  That is all we are trying to assist.</p></speech>

There is no reason why we should not undertake reviews of such projects, which should also be published.  The same issues arise.  As I mentioned earlier, if we build a road through traditional procurement, the issue is then whether we have met the volume and has the project delivered a benefit.  There is a wider question.  It is not just about PPPs.</p></speech>

It is my personal opinion.  It is not the opinion of every member here, but I have given my opinion.  Giving us huge volumes of information does not equate to proper public accountability.  What Mr. Watt seems to miss is that we have not got the information which we need.  Yes, we can welcome that he has now come to the view that the post-project reviews should be published but we are here today to ask questions.  The meeting is today, not next month, in three months' time or next year, whenever these reports are eventually published.  It is today and we do not have the reviews.  Our job is to examine and to probe.  One of the observations from the Comptroller and Auditor General, in his opening remarks and in his report, is that there is a lack of public scrutiny, public debate and public accountability in the whole area of PPPs.  I would not imagine that the Comptroller and Auditor General was talking about the political sphere alone, but also about academics and other outside organisations, which would also look at this area because reports are not published.  Let us be honest, some of these reports go back 16 years.  It has been 16 years and only one has been published.  That is why we are frustrated and if that upsets any of the officials here, so be it.  We have a job to do and we are to do it today, not tomorrow, next month, in six months or in a year.  We will be back.  How many of these post-project reviews that have not been published actually exist?</p></speech>

I accept what the Comptroller and Auditor General said when he gave the context.  If I am reading this right, and I want to be fair to everybody, there was opposition from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the past to publishing the post-project reviews.  We then had an analysis, review or examination by the International Monetary Fund.  It carried out a review and people would have been consulted.  On the back of that there was a change of heart.  A different position was adopted by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which is now open to publishing these post-project reviews.  That does not excuse the matter or answer the question as to why they were not carried out at all in one of the key Departments, namely, the Department of Education and Skills.  I do not believe that Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; has given a satisfactory answer as to why not a single post-project review has been carried out.  This goes right to the heart of public accountability.  How can we evaluate whether there was good use of taxpayers' money, whether benchmarks which were set were met, whether there were any legal issues or impediments, or whether we got value for money?  None of this can be evaluated by this committee because Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; and his Department have not carried out any post-project reviews.  Will he take me through that again in layman's terms?  He should help me, as a public representative, to understand why not a single post-project review was carried out.</p></speech>

The concept of a post-project review is a mid-term concept.  Our first completion was in 2002 and we are now 16 years on from that out of 25.  We focused on that.  We have undertaken a number of value for money tests.  We were the first Department to publish post-project public service benchmark, PSB, information.  We have also now made available to the committee the three PSBs for the first three schools bundles that had PSBs.  We are now publishing PSBs, as a policy, five years after so that commercial sensitivity is protected.  We have been very open with regard to being innovative in publishing information about PSBs and in publishing PSBs.  Analysis of those PSBs can be undertaken.  We saw the post-project review process as a mid-term review process.  We sought to do it a small number of years ago but we realised that we needed an intensity of engagement with it such that, given the pressures that we had to deliver school places, we had to prioritise school places.  School place delivery was prioritised over the last five or six years in a major way as we faced this demographic bulge.  We succeeded in providing school places for every child despite a huge increase in the number of places.</p></speech>

It is paragraph 4.46 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  He stated "no post project reviews have been published."  He made a recommendation and the response from Mr. Watt was "Part agreed."  It could have been last August but was probably last September at the latest.  Mr. Watt wrote, "A requirement to publish post project reviews (subject to redaction of any commercially sensitive information) will be included in a revision of the Public Spending Code currently underway and in revised PPP guidance to be issued in the near future."  Mr. Watt wrote that in his response seven months ago.  He is here today, saying that it is coming out in the near future, seven months later.  It is still in the near future.  When I would have read that last September, when this report was published, I would have expected to see that before Christmas, but we are here now at the end of March, seven months on.  When is the near future?  Mr. Watt's official response was that it would be the near future.  Is there a date for it?</p></speech>

I read the public spending code last night - all 147 pages of it - and it says on page 2 that "Nothing in the Public Spending Code should be taken as precluding Government or Ministers, under the delegated sanction arrangements set down by the Minister for Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform, from deciding to approve projects independent of the detailed application of the Public Spending Code."  In other words, the public spending code and guidelines can be ignored if a Minister so decides.  Why is that the case?  What is the logic for that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-22a.509" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Watt" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018032200002#S04400"><p>There may be occasions on which a Government needs to make a decision to do something quickly or where it is clear that the benefits of investing in that infrastructure or spending that money are such that they have to, out of necessity, due to time constraints, push ahead.  For example, with the recent flooding where there was significant damage to part of the country, it was clear that we needed to invest to restore the road or pavement and it would not necessarily be the case that one would need to do a cost-benefit analysis to demonstrate that one needed to invest in improving a road which had been subjected to damage.  That is just an example.  In most cases, the code is there to ensure that, when we look at projects over &euro;20 million, we have a full assessment of the costs and benefits.</p><p>We debated for a long time the question of whether the threshold is appropriate or should perhaps be lower or higher.  This issue is being kept under review to ensure sponsoring bodies have to develop strong business cases.  When they are deciding to commit to a project, they must be disciplined and have evidence that the benefits exceed the costs.  When we are dealing with cost-benefit analyses, in many cases the benefits of a project are uncertain or difficult to establish.  There are many issues with the actual methodology or the approach to assessing the costs and benefits of particular projects.  There is an element of subjectivity here.  What is stated in the code is very important in ensuring Departments meet value-for-money criteria.</p></speech>

I put it to the Chairman that when we consider this matter as part of a further periodic report, perhaps we should recommend that the code be put on a legislative basis so that it is not perceived as a fig leaf.

Perhaps they could be sent on for the next day.</p> <p>  I would like to ask Mr. Watt about risk.  When we discuss PPPs, we hear an awful lot about the risk to the private contractor.  What risk is there in building a school?  Is it that the pupils will not turn up?  What would it be?  I am struggling to try to understand how there is a risk to a private company in building a school.</p></speech>

There is risk associated with ensuring the school is maintained over a period and handed back in a good condition 25 years afterwards.  That risk is with the private PPP operator or entity that has to maintain the school.  I guess that is the main risk over a long period.</p></speech>

Obviously, there is a risk that something could happen to the building.  We have had issues in the past with buildings that do not perform as expected.  That risk is transferred to the PPP entity that finances and operates the school.</p></speech>

I would argue that the biggest risk with these PPPs is often to the taxpayer.  Projects relating to the construction of six schools collapsed because of Carillion.  I have looked at some of the press reports on that.  Obviously, that was not a very good exercise by the Department.  I imagine that it was not very desirable in any event.  I am sure Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; will agree that it was unforeseen.  Who carried the risk for the collapse of those six projects?</p></speech>

Clearly, it is undesirable that the project has been slowed down.  This is a good example of the construction risk being with the company that won the tender.  It is responsible for ensuring the project is delivered.</p></speech>

The PPP company is responsible for sorting that wrangle out.  It is seeking to sort it out.  We are very hopeful that it will be able to succeed in doing so.

I will try to calm things down a bit.  It is probably the first time I have attempted to do that at this forum.  Transparency is part of the issue with which we are dealing.  To be fair to the witnesses, some of the things we are analysing here predate their appointment to their current positions.  The economic circumstances in this country have gone all over the place since many of these PPPs were signed.  A great deal of decision-making needs to be contextualised.  It should also be remembered that political pressure on decision-making does not help sometimes.  There is some frustration about the process of getting information out there.  I accept that commitments have been given by the Secretary General in the context of writing to Departments.  I am sure everyone will get the information out there.  That will be co-ordinated.  We will take that at face value.</p> <p>  I have some valuable and useful information about the change in the PPP review and the mechanism for limiting exposure to PPPs to 10% of aggregate Exchequer value.  I think there is a need for a peer-to-peer review of PPP projects that compares such projects with directly-funded projects.  I agree that Exchequer-funded projects do not represent value for money.  This is not always evident, however, when such projects are subjected to line-by-line comparisons with PPP projects.  When value is being assessed, consideration must be given to whether something was a priority for spending in the first instance.  At a future date, I will, along with TII officials, review the analyses and algorithms used when decisions were made on some of the projects that were selected for inclusion in the 2040 plan, with a particular focus on those which may or may not have changed in the weeks before the launch.</p> <p>  We certainly need to conduct a peer-to-peer examination that compares Exchequer-funded projects and PPP projects.  There needs to be a breakdown by sector within that equation.  There is no one present from the Department of Health, but I would like to mention as an example the bundles that were drawn up for PPP primary care centres.  When I see the centres that are progressing, including the one in Carrick-on-Suir in my constituency, I look at the other options which have been set out in competitions for the construction of primary care centres.  Some of those who win contracts essentially flip them by selling them on.  It is speculation, basically.  Again, there is exposure here.  When we are doing comparisons, we should think about getting down to the unit basis.  It would be helpful if we were to look not just at roads, but also at the decisions made within that realm.</p> <p>  I want to focus on a couple of direct issues.  I had the pleasure of travelling through the Limerick tunnel going to and from a certain match last weekend.  I would like to go through the costs relating to this famous road, as set out on pages 67 and 68 of the report.</p><p>I am particularly interested in the total exposure as regards the traffic risk sharing component on pages 67 and 68 of the report.  I want to get into the real figures, if possible.  These questions are for TII.  No. 2 is a design, build, operate, fund and maintain, DBOFM, classification and the total project cost is &euro;281 million.  Note F reads: "Includes payments required under the traffic guarantee contract mechanism.  The nominal value of remaining payments does not include any amounts for future payments under this mechanism".  It costs &euro;4.6 million because of the traffic flows and there are low and medium traffic growth projections.  What has it cost as part of the traffic risk sharing component to date and what is the projected cost based on current levels?</p></speech>

To date, we have paid &euro;34.1 million for the Limerick tunnel and prepared future projections for what we consider to be conservative traffic growth scenarios.  The future payments would amount to approximately &euro;150 million.  We provided this information by year in the briefing documents submitted to the committee.  In total, we are looking at a figure of &euro;200 million in traffic guarantee related payments under the scheme.</p></speech>

There are two schemes in which there is a variable operation payment mechanism.  It allowed the funders and the providers to have a sense that there was a floor and enabled funders to provide good prices on these high risk schemes.  In respect of the Limerick tunnel, we have all learned that trying to forecast demand risk in an urban area is very difficult.</p></speech>

There are six road schemes where the private sector took all of the traffic risk.  Where traffic is not materialising, it affects their returns.  The level of traffic achieved on the eight toll road schemes we procured was recently 70% of what had been expected.</p></speech>

On these two roads we share some of the risk.  Our sharing of some of the risk impacts on the financing costs of the schemes.  There would have been higher costs for the financers of the other schemes where they took on the full risk.  On the face of it, there is no doubt that the moneys are significant, but motorway infrastructure is expensive, whichever way the cost is cut and diced.  Whether it is funded exclusively by the Exchequer or the private sector or there is a sharing of the risk, the cost is approximately &euro;10 million per kilometre.  The challenge for us is always to find exactly the balance between the taxpayer, tolls and public and private partners.  I agree that the numbers are significant.  In this case, because of the nature of the contract, they are very clear.  For projects funded exclusively by private finance, the equity holders are losing money.  We may not be delivering the benefits on other roads funded exclusively by the Exchequer because we made an over-specification or traffic volumes have not been delivered.  There are many ways to looking at the issue.</p></speech>

The expectations would not be as high as when we procured the scheme.  We did assess it and re-examined the scheme in the light of the traffic volumes known at the time and the information on the traffic guarantee amounts being paid and the cost benefit result was that it was still a viable scheme, given the volume of traffic using the tunnel every day.</p></speech>

Ironically, I was Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport when the Taoiseach was the Minister and I recall him being very critical of the payments made under schemes such as this.  It is unacceptable that there have been no reviews of projects.  The Secretary General knows that representatives of Cork Institute of Technology have been before the committee on several occasions.  They are among our favourite witnesses and will be back soon.  Two of the projects relate to the Maritime Institute which has been funded by way of a PPP since 2004.  I have photographs of the building which seems to be in rag order.  Has it been inspected?  There was to have been a review after ten years.</p><p>It seems that the people who were in charge were not qualified.  They were brought back by the college subsequent to being let go.  They were employed by companies that were subsets of the colleges.  It seems that the volume of funding that has gone into them means that there have to be questions asked about the product that has been delivered.</p></speech>

Perhaps a wiser person might stay quiet and listen more, but we have to ask questions.  I have looked again at Mr. Watt's opening statement.  I welcome the confirmation that there will be publication of the post-project reviews, I hope within the next few weeks.  That is the clear statement I hear.  However, it would have been more helpful if it had beenincluded in Mr. Watt's opening statement as a recognition of the necessity for it.  It would have been helpful in instilling confidence, particularly as it was the one item identified in the chapter by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It was the subject of a very specific request or recommendation, but it was not dealt with in the opening statement, which is to be regretted, but it is welcome that he is now saying he will progress the matter.</p> <p>  I will clarify a few little things.  Are we now saying the policy is to move away a little from PPPs?  Significantly, in the chapter the Comptroller and Auditor General points out that in 2012 the figure was &euro;6.1 billion.  In 2016 it was &euro;9.6 billion.  Does Mr. Watt expect it to reduce in the next few years?  Is there a change in policy?</p></speech>

The commitments set out are in respect of projects we have already built and are being operated.  In time, as the unitary payments for the original projects fall away and disappear, they may be replaced by new projects and some of the slack taken up.  What we have set out, I hope reasonably clearly, is that we are cautious about PPPs.  There is a new environment and we are in a position where the Exchequer is in a position to fund projects in the traditional manner.  In time, we will probably see the overall commitments number peaking.  There are a number of projects in the pipeline which have not yet been finalised and once they are completed, we will start to make unitary payments which will get up to a peak figure of about &euro;400 million.</p></speech>

According to this document prepared by the Parliamentary Budget Office, it quotes from a report saying:</p><blockquote>The increasing level of unitary payments which arise on PPP projects [...] is an issue of concern for the Education budget, given the large unitary charge in the budget for 25 schools built using the PPP model capital.  In 2016, for example, of the total Education capital expenditure of &euro;704 million, &euro;85 million, 12%, was allocated to PPP projects. </blockquote> <p>Will Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; give us some clarification on this concern?</p></speech>

Obviously, we operate within the overall Government policy.  We are cautious about having too high a proportion of our budget going on unitary charges.  This is an argument for the past rather than for the future, but at the same time, given the budget available to us and the demand for school places, it was very important that we use diverse methods of delivery.  I believe 12% of additional places in the school system have been delivered through PPPs in 6% of projects, because the projects are of scale.  While we are very happy with the engagement on the national development plan, and of course I am very ambitious for delivery on it, clearly its funding does not kick in in scale for several years and we are running with two more bundles of higher education PPPs.</p></speech>

I understand that the EU has put us in a situation with fiscal rules that things have to be shown off balance sheet and all sorts of magical accountancy rules that do not seem to be applied to direct public housing.  However, if one is using a PPP, what is the cost of the school?  What is paid to the private company over the 25 years?</p></speech>

Money was never an issue when it came to Government policy, but it is an issue for the direct build of schools or the other things that are necessary for a civilised society.</p> <p>  Returning to roads, I refer to the N17 to N18, Gort to Tuam, which I mention because it brings up issues at many levels.  It was very much welcomed in Galway as having come in before time, for which we all hailed it.  I look at the figures and see that it came in five months early, it was &euro;550 million for 53 km.  There were savings in relation to refinancing, which was great, but then there were variations which cost more.  Then there is an audit from the EU that says documentation was not handed over.  I will look through my papers here, in order to quote it in a moment.  Then there was a legal action, and a huge delay in the procurement of five years.  This particular project raises many issues for PPP.  I do not know who will respond on this, but it came in on time yet it cost more.  The audit from the EU says that when it requested documentation, there was a refusal to hand it over.  Who refused to hand over what? </p></speech>

We had got to a stage where we had a preferred tender appointed and then the financial crash occurred.  The funders would not come into the market to fund a private sector bid to build the scheme.  We had to engage with the European Commission to try to progress the scheme, to see how we might do it in terms of the procurement process.  We did not want to have to start the entire process again.  That was 2010.  It was 2014 when we awarded the contract.  There was significant downtime because of the funding crisis.  Had that not happened the scheme would have been built long before that.  Once we had got over that hurdle, and I am looking to my right at colleagues in the National Development Finance Agency who were our financial advisors on the matter, we eventually did get funders to come back into the market.  A very limited pool of banks was willing to fund then.  Earlier, additional schemes were mentioned.  These were developed at a difficult time for the economy and gave many jobs in the west at a difficult time for the economy.  It was very difficult.  The procurement was very difficult, and getting the scheme to construction.</p></speech>

They are things that we ourselves determine, the PPP company could make suggestions, but they are things that we would look at and want to apply to a scheme.  I do not know all the variations on a scheme but I know that there was a junction where an improved layout had to be considered.  It was a requirement over and above what the PPP company had bid for.  We specified that after it came to light that the initial design was not going to be quite as good as we would like it to be.  If we wanted to show signage, there may have been additional lighting requirements under environmental considerations, these are the types of variations which are things that we instruct on, and can happen on any road scheme, whether it was procured traditionally or through PPP.</p></speech>

Accordingly, the rationale in designing and procuring the project and in choosing the PPP option instead of alternative procurement methods (such as traditional procurement and concession) could not be assessed.</blockquote> <p>That has just come out this week.

They had provided funding to an equity provider who was on the private sector side of the scheme.  We met them and brought them on a site visit of the scheme.

That is a problem, considering the difficulties that have emerged since.</p><p>We will be getting into more detail on these matters with Cork Institute of Technology, CIT, but there was a whistleblower's report and a KPMG report into the issue, the latter of which highlighted that pages were missing from the whistleblower's report which it had received, in particular page 14.  The KPMG report was heavily redacted but states that it was felt the allegation was adequately addressed and may have related to somebody retiring today and coming back in as a consultant on Monday. I think this referred to the scientist who was the project manager.  I have managed to find the missing page 14 and, despite the then president of CIT calling the contents of the report malicious falsehoods in an article in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, page 14 highlighted all these matters.  Somebody was hired as a consultant on the Monday after retiring.  Is that normal?  We have heard of-----</p></speech>

There are huge issues with this particular institute.  It seems not only to go to building of things, public-private partners, re-employment of people, throwing out lavish amounts of public money, which is what this committee is about.  This committee is about taxpayers' money, Mr. Watt, and we are here to question that whether you like it or not.  If that means there are difficult questions about what officials knew and what they did not know, then that is what I am paid &euro;90,000 a year by the public to ask.  You can dislike it all you like.  If the question is relevant, can I ask, did you, Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, happen to participate in a retirement function for a gentleman who was rehired a few days later as a consultant?</p></speech>

We looked at contract management arrangements at that stage and I think the Deputy has already referred to an issue that I raised.  What we found at the time was that the CIT staff member acting as the contract manager for the two CIT projects had been involved with the project since the procurement stage and had been involved in managing the contracts since the two projects became operational.  The examination found that the contract manager had detailed knowledge of the project arrangements.  A matter that I raised in conclusion was that while CIT also had significant skills and experience in respect of the management of PPP contracts, there was a risk of over-reliance on a single individual as much of CIT's capacity in this area was vested in the contract manager for the two CIT projects.  The risk that was there would appear to have crystallised when the individual retired.  The college was left without a capacity and a knowledge base.  Based on what I have already reported, I do not think it is fair to characterise the individual as not having relevant skills or experience.  That would be my suggestion.</p></speech>

It just occurred to me.  When people pay tolls - on the N4 it is &euro;2.90 and on some of the other roads it is &euro;1.90 - and they do not have the electronic tag which I and I am sure many of us have, they throw the &euro;2 or &euro;3 in but do not get their &euro;0.10 change.  Is any assessment done on the amount of money that comes to?  Is it the PPP that gets it?  Is it much money?</p></speech>

It is the PPPs that get the money,  The change that people do not collect at the toll goes to the PPP.  Similar to most schemes, half of the vehicles that use the motorways have tags, so there is no issue.  A segment of traffic goes to the manual operator at the toll booths.  I cannot comment further on the excess coins because I do not know the position.</p></speech>

The alternative route is the N78 to Athy and the N11 corridor, which goes through Wicklow and Wexford.  The options for diversion did not allow tolling on the latter.  It would not be a viable corridor for tolling because the volume of traffic is not as high as on the other routes and the available alternative routes would lead to too much leakage.

I do not wish to be unfair to anybody.  It is correct that we are robust and that we ask the appropriate questions.  I will stick to the issue of PPPs but I believe we have a responsibility to reflect on today's meeting to determine whether we have made progress in terms of getting value for money.  There is a commitment to publish the post-project reviews.  When those reports are published, perhaps we will be in a better position to determine whether progress is being made.</p> <p>  Members have asked questions on whether we can really determine that the taxpayer gets value for money in terms of PPPs.  One of the difficulties we have is that we do not have any information.  I ask Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; and Mr. Watt to put themselves in our shoes.  A post-project review is like hen's teeth, the members of the Committee of Public Accounts have never seen them.  I have never seen one.  I do not know what analysis has been done and outcomes that have been achieved.  I would imagine if I were looking at a post-project review, I would see an evaluation of whether the benchmarks that were set were met; whether there were impediments, delays, additional legal costs, and whether mistakes were made and a range of other issues.  One learns from a review.  Does Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; understand that, from our perspective, if no post-project reviews were carried out by the Department, how can he learn or how can we learn so that we ensure we get value for money?</p></speech>

Before we begin that topic I wish to raise one other issue arising from a vote in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  The D&aacute;il has voted strongly on the motion in relation to the strategic communications unit, SCU, in favour of the Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach appearing before the Committee of Public Accounts at the earliest possible date to account for spending of public money by the SCU.</p><p>At a meeting two weeks ago, we decided to invite the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach to appear at the committee.  As the Taoiseach is due to appear in committee soon on the Estimates for his Department, we decided to await the outcome of that meeting before deciding what action to take.  However, in light of the vote of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann this afternoon to the effect that the Taoiseach appear before this committee, we will formally invite him to do so.</p></speech>

Risk is taken account of in terms of the public sector benchmark reports.  We have circulated some of them to the committee as part of these deliberations.  The challenge is the difficulty of comparing the benefit of the risk transfer when it comes to the PPP with the risk pertaining to traditional projects.  There are various formulae set out in the manual on how we do public sector benchmarking.  The NDFA officials may be able to elaborate in more detail about how that is calculated.  It is explicitly taken account of but it is challenging because obviously there are many uncertainties involved.</p></speech>

Risk workshops are attended by officials from the sponsoring Departments and by legal, financial and technical experts.  At this stage, we seek to identify all of the risks throughout the lifetime of the project, from planning stage to construction stage and in regard to facilities management and life-cycling to ensure that facilities will be handed back in a fit state after 25 years.  At the end of a PPP project, there is a residual life requirement.  For example, the roof would have to be good for 35 years, the plant and equipment would have to be good for ten years and the paint work would have to be good for five years.  Possible risks at each stage are identified and the cost of fixing any problems that arise are quantified.  We assign a probability to each of those risks and we develop a risk matrix.  We then identify who is the best party to manage the risk.  We only allocate risk to the private sector that it is best able to manage and we keep risks on the State side that we are best able to manage.  For example, in the case of a school in which there are pupils, we would not pass on that risk to the private school but we do pass construction risk to the private sector.  Once all of the risks have been quantified in a risk matrix, they are then translated into the contract and we ask the private sector to price in that regard as part of its bid for the facility.</p></speech>

It is built on assumptions.  If we were looking at it, we would be looking at the reasonableness of the assumptions and the basis upon which the estimates were arrived at.  It is fair to point out that in public sector benchmark risk does feature as a very significant cost element which is added to what one thinks the construction cost and running costs would be on the public sector side.  There is then a significant additional loading on the public sector benchmark.  It is an area that, if being reviewed, would require careful consideration as to how those figures are arrived at.</p></speech>

I understand that what happened in this regard is not new in that a private investor in a PPP was liquidated.  I understand that the all of the projects concerned have been completed and are operational.  In such cases, is there an additional indirect cost to the Exchequer?  For example, if a party to a PPP housing project goes bust the result would be a slowdown in the construction phase.  To my mind, there would be an indirect cost associated with that whereby, owing to the lack of availability of houses, the State would have to continue paying housing supports.  In the case of a school project, there would be an indirect cost around renting prefabs.  Are such costs factored in on the State side?</p></speech>

In terms of the most recent case, the State incurred some cost in regard to clearing the site and so on but the private financier incurred the capital cost of building the school.  We have not made any unitary payments yet and we will not do so until the school is handed over.  This is an example of where risk transfer is working.  In the case of a PPP, they have very clear incentives to complete works and hand over the schools because they will not get any payments until they do so.</p> <p>  In the case of traditional procurement, the implications of a company going bust could be even more severe because we have made substantial capital payments during the course of the construction stage.</p><p>That could be more difficult for the State as we would have to get a new contractor to finish when we had invested a significant amount of Exchequer funds in the project.  With a PPP, we have not invested the bulk of the funds which come rather from private finance.  It is an interesting example of how the risk transfer provisions with a PPP work and should be seen to work.  To answer the Deputy's question it is implicitly the case that within the comparator the risk is taken into account.  Whether we do it traditionally or by PPP, there is always a risk the developer could go bust.  I think of O'Devaney Gardens a number of years ago where the project did not happen.  One must then get a new contractor and there could be a delay where people who were relying on that housing may have to be housed elsewhere.  That is a cost or risk associated with any project, whether it is a PPP or official.  The point the Deputy makes is valid and those potential costs are inherent in all projects we do.</p></speech>

Certainly we could look at it.  The indirect cost would relate primarily to delay.  Pupils hoping to be in a school may be delayed and the question arises as to what the cost of that delay would be where they would have to stay in accommodation which is not as good.  There is that cost.  In the case of housing, people may have to be housed.  We can certainly come back to the Deputy if we can find historical examples where that has happened.  It is a challenge we face across the board.  There have been cases where we were building accommodation infrastructure, in particular during 2007 to 2011, which companies were not in a position financially to complete.  That creates numerous problems for the State which we have to manage our way through as best we can.  There were one or two cases where we decided not to finish the works and other cases where we had to take someone on to finish them.  The response is case by case by the various bodies.</p></speech>

The procedure up to now is that there is an affordability cap where we say the unitary payment in a given year will not be 10% more than the Exchequer or capital cost.  If the Exchequer budget is &euro;4 billion, the unitary payment should not be more than &euro;400 million.  We have moved back to the original budgetary control mechanism where in effect the capital cost of the PPP will be charged against the account of the body as if it were an Exchequer project.  That means that when the sponsoring entity or Department is looking at the project from an accounting perspective, there is no advantage one way or the other as to how that is accounted for when a decision is made on which option to go for.  If a secondary school costs &euro;20 million, for example, and it takes three years to build, that will be set notionally against the account of the Department of Education and Skills for its budget.  That means the PPP and the Exchequer or traditional approach would be accounted for in the same way when deciding on the merits of projects.  It is a significant change if one goes back to the way we were before.  We will see over time what impact it has on the decisions people make on these projects.</p></speech>

I will not argue it but someone could say there was a rationale for PPPs in the economic downturn.  However we are getting to a situation in which even that argument no longer holds water when only four or five other European countries use them.  The reason other countries do not use them is that there are questions over whether they provide value for money.  What is the situation on that?  We are third highest at 1.1 and Britain is in front of us.  I do not know who else is in front of us but countries like Germany are at zero.  They do not use them.</p></speech>

We had this debate today and Deputy Connolly referenced the Commission report.  Others referenced reports from the UK.  There is an increasing debate, which is important, on how we fund infrastructure.  Do we fund it by user charges or by Exchequer funds and traditional or by deferred or unitary payment PPPs?  There is a debate to be had.  We discussed this at length today.  Internationally, there is increasing debate about whether they stack up or constitute value for money.  That is why in the various studies we have done and the debates we have had there has been a strong focus on value for money, the comparator and the evidence, and whether we are sure this makes sense for the State.  I agree with the Deputy that during the crisis years, additionality was a reason and that reason does not hold anymore.  As such it has to be focused on value for money as opposed to the balance sheet treatment.  We accept that and we debate the role of PPPs in the future.  We are increasingly cautious about them which will drive the policy into the future.</p></speech>

We have got some figures in particular on costs or variations incurred by TII over the period 2013 to 2016 which amounted to &euro;13.3 million.  The two main ones are the N11 and the Newlands Cross scheme.  There was a &euro;4.2 million in relation to Newlands Cross and a variation of &euro;1.1 million in relation to the N17-N18.

There was a big variation there with regard to signage delineation lighting and whatnot.  Obviously it was a higher speed road open to 120 km/h as opposed to 100 km/h.  There were other variations with regard to drainage upgrades.  Part of the scheme was to revitalise a section of the road south of Arklow and Rathnew down as far as Gorey.  It was 40 km of old dual carriageway which had to be refreshed.  They were the main variations.  I do not have the detail on the N17-N18 project but I think there were a lot of accommodation works variations.  One junction was upgraded with a safer layout following a safety audit.  There was one accommodation road coming down from a property where we saw an opportunity to lengthen the road and provide alternative access in the event of flooding which was a regular occurrence in the area.  That provided some relief.  It is that sort of thing.</p></speech>

I am not sure we have the evidence to back that up.  There are many contracts - traditionally pure contracts - where we have a procurement process or planning issue which is challenged.  In his report the Comptroller and Auditor General set out some high-profile issues.  The one in relation to Grangegorman could have happened under any type of procurement contract and was not specific to PPP.  However it was very high profile and it was disappointing the development was delayed for so long.  People say that because there is more complexity in these types of contracts it leads to more litigation, but I do not know.  I would not want to say because I am not quite sure we have the evidence to confirm what the Deputy suggests.  Certainly they are more complex.</p></speech>

There are legal costs and the Comptroller and Auditor General has instanced examples where there are a number of legal challenges.  We can certainly come back to the Deputy.  I suppose the point I would make in relation to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report is that all capital works projects, not just PPPs, are vulnerable to legal challenge.  It is a fair point.  It is a constant challenge for us.</p></speech>

Most of the projects that we develop are traditionally procured; they are not PPPs.  We have an awful lot more examples on the other side.  Certainly, we can have a look.  I do not know if we have done a review.  It is a big job but, certainly, if there is any evidence that suggests, we can go back to it.  There is always a risk that people will challenge.</p></speech>

Where we were challenged, it has delayed the project significantly.  The good news there is that we won on all counts and the costs were awarded against the entity that challenged the State.</p></speech>

Because PPP projects are so big and they take so long to develop, underbidders tend to spend a lot of money to stay in the game for a period and they hate to lose and are likely to be quite litigious and try to recover some of their costs.  When we first looked at PPPs, there was a practice in places to pay some of the underbidder costs but a view was taken here, I think, probably rightly, that that was not a course that would be followed here.  The practice was where one would indemnify the bidders against high costs.  There is a kind of a trade-off in the matter.</p></speech>

I hear what the Comptroller and Auditor General is saying.  The cost of preparing the bids for the consortia are greater and that, obviously, increases the incentive for them to challenge if they are unsuccessful.  Everything else being equal, one would expect that there will be more challenges.</p> <p>  We just do not have the full range or database which looks at it because there is a lot of legal action.  Somebody might threaten to take action against the State in respect of something and then it is dropped pretty quickly or we decide we will settle, or we go all the way, we challenge and we win or we lose.  Sadly, there is a lot of activity down in those courts.</p></speech>

It is quite difficult to manage the threat of legal action.  I suppose the best defence against losses arising in that way is to ensure that one follows good process and good procedures, that, if you like, i's are dotted and t's are crossed, and that one protects oneself in that situation against losing a case.  What is interesting is that where the three legal challenges were referenced in the report, in all cases the State side won.</p></speech>

It is hard to square that.  It does not sit right with me.  My question to Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; is obviously a direct one as well.

We were the first ones to publish the information and we have also now made available the three benchmark reports.  There is substantial information to make judgments on value for money within those, if the committee wished to look at those in detail.  We collectively decided that it was a good thing to do to make those publicly available from the point of view of transparency.</p> <p>  We have a number of different areas to look at to make sure that we are getting value for money and to learn as we are going.  Particularly, the contract management is one, but also the NDFA referred to the review it puts in place after a contract is signed.  We have learned significant lessons and changed approaches significantly as a result of those steps, not just in PPPs but in school buildings and other education sector buildings.  For example, in one of the initial PPPs, in order to reduce wear and tear corridors were widened by the PPP company itself at its own cost.  We adopted that as a Department standard.</p></speech>

I have given one example of learning.  I will give a second.  There are more, but the second has been to change how we do the planning in terms of the processing.  We used to get outline planning permission and now we get full planning permission because that way there can be more certainty and it does not create a doubt, an uncertainty and a risk, especially given planning within the State.</p><p>That is very important.</p><p> I wanted to give a couple of examples to show that we have not introduced this, sat on our hands and not learned any lessons.  We have learned significant lessons.  I would prefer if we had completed a review and I am disappointed that we have not.  I referred to it as a mid-term review.  I would rather that we had done it a significant time ago but we have not been able to do so.  It is a very complex review.  We are going to take a bundle of approximately five schools to be compared to five other schools and analyse the effectiveness of how the facilities have been run, look at the standard of the buildings and compare and contrast all of those aspects.  It is going to be a huge piece of work.  We have tracked the numbers in the schools but the review will also consider that.  It is going to look at all of those elements and I expect that we will learn from it.  I do not think we will repeat it in the same way because it is so intense.  We started doing it four or five years ago and had to pause and rethink how we were doing it.  We have now restarted it.  I accept the Deputy's point that we should have done it earlier.</p></speech>

My point is that if that had been done over the past five years, this meeting may have gone very differently and members would have had the opportunity to ask questions and learn from the data and analysis that would have been done.  We will now have to wait until it is completed.  Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; is correct that a range of other reports and analyses have been done but post-project reviews do a very specific job and have a very specific purpose.  He made the point that he sees value in them and anticipates learnings therefrom.  If it had been done earlier, we might be in a better position.</p> <p>  I wish to turn to the witnesses from TII who have not yet accounted for post-project reviews of PPPs under their watch.  Is Mr. Nolan the appropriate witness to deal with this aspect?</p></speech>

He may have a different view on whether those projects were PPPs and I take his word that they were not.  My point is that, regardless of the examination carried out for that report, its title is Public Private Partnerships in the EU: Widespread shortcomings and limited benefits.  I am not being difficult but, rather, am saying that there are learnings in that report for everybody here.  It was only published a couple of days ago but, as we are here to discuss PPPs, its publication is timely.  It is another report and body that has examined this area and there will be learnings for the State from it.</p> <p>  Mr. Watt said earlier in response to my colleague that there is a very healthy international public debate on PPPs.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-22a.910" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018032200002#KK05500"><p>There is debate regarding how we fund capital projects, whether that be through direct funding, charges for the service provided, general taxation, PPPs or a hybrid version of any such measures.  Myriad options are available.  There is a very healthy debate on whether or not we get value for money.  The difficulty is that there is a dearth of genuine, transparent reporting and analysis in the State in regard to whether we get value for money.  One of the issues referred to by the Comptroller and Auditor General is that far more could be done to improve public debate in this State on PPPs.  If we take anything away from this meeting, it is that far more must be done.  Notwithstanding the robustness of the exchanges, I think all present will agree that we have shone a spotlight on the issue.  I am of the view that there has been insufficient scrutiny, oversight and genuine public debate because the data are not there.  None of the post-project reviews have been published.  How can any academic or think-tank evaluate them if the data or reviews are not available?  There is much we can learn and many improvements we can make in terms of what is going to happen.</p><p>It is just disappointing that it did not happen up to now.  Mr. Watt can respond to that if he wishes.  If I can just make a final point, the other thing I learned is that the code Mr. Watt referenced earlier is voluntary.  I want to come back to that.  It is not a legal requirement and it is not underpinned by legislation.  It is still a voluntary code.  That is something from a policy perspective, which is not a matter for Mr. Watt but for Government, to which we should return to in our own periodic report because it has been raised with us and we have had some discussion on it.  I do not know whether Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; or Mr. Watt would like to respond to my general observations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-22a.912" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Watt" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018032200002#LL00200"><p>As an observation, in order to have a debate we need to put out information.  We have provided an awful lot of information as part of these discussions.  The first step is to look at the public sector benchmark and the comparator between the assessment of cost benefits for traditionally procured projects and those of projects procured through PPP.  For the first time that information is out there and that could lead to informed debate around assessing which option we should go for.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned in respect of a previous issue around risk, there is an element of estimation here.  It is not clear-cut.  There needs to be debate about that.  People need to scrutinise the comparator and see if they are content with its robustness.  Based on the information which we set out, there is potential to have a much more informed debate.  Just having the information out there does not, of course, mean that debate will be informed, but it has the potential to be.  The post-project reviews could also help, but let us see how that contributes to the debate.</p> <p>  This issue is not exclusive to PPPs.  It is relevant for all public works.  The whole debate is very important because there is a lot of discussion about how we fund infrastructure.  People talk about off-balance sheet and innovative solutions and all the rest of it.  Many Deputies responding to many policy issues suggest that there is an innovative or off-balance sheet solution when in fact there is not and the options are that the people who use the infrastructure pay for it, that the taxpayer pays for it now, or that the taxpayer pays for it on a deferred basis.  It must be clarified that somebody has to pay for infrastructure and that how we pay for it is the key issue.  I fully agree with the Deputy in terms of the debate.  </p> <p>  On the public code, I do not think we would describe it as voluntary.  It is not voluntary for Departments to decide whether they will do a cost-benefit analysis of a project.  They have to do it or the Minister for Finance or for Public Expenditure and Reform will not approve the money because the Government will not approve it.  It is not voluntary in that sense but there is no legal sanction because it is not based on legislation.  Of course, there are many things which we do not put in legislation for very good reasons.  Administrative rules and regulations drive much of our activity.  Whether we want to go down the route of trying to codify it in law is another policy issue but it would raise many different questions.</p></speech>

I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General and his office for the work they have done because the fact that this issue was in the special report allowed us to put a spotlight on it.  He was very fair in outlining that there were difficulties, a lack of public debate and other issues to which he alerted this committee but also in outlining that there were changes under way which would be of benefit to all of us.  I just want to thank his office for the work it has done.</p></speech>

Our role is to highlight the issues, as is the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General, so that proper facts and information can feed a debate in the D&aacute;il which would lead to a proper policy.  That is the difficulty.  I do not blame the witnesses for that.  There has been no backup for the policy.  It was an <i>ad hoc</i>reaction to difficulties in the economy for a particular ideological reason.  We are here today and we cannot say that there is good value for money.</p><p>I would like to ask practical questions.  There is a significant change in respect of the 10%.  Am I correct that ceiling is gone?  Yes.  So it has gone back to each Department.  What was the price of the school which Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; gave me this morning when I asked? </p></speech>

If we use that as an example, would the Department of Education and Skills show that as an upfront cost as opposed to being spread over the 25 years?  Is that right?</p></speech>

When we account for it in cash terms, the appropriation account of the Department will show the unitary payment over the 25-year period of the school.  When it comes to comparing the projects for accounting purposes in the short run, the Secretary General, Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;'s Department of Education and Skills, has an envelope for the next number of years for a given amount.  If the Department decides to undertake a PPP project instead of a traditionally procured project, the capital cost of that will be set against the Department's capital envelope as if it had been procured traditionally, even if it goes down the route of PPP.  In effect, the Department of Education and Skills will not be able to spend that money again if it decides to go down the PPP route because it will take up some of the envelope set out for it.  In effect, there is a difference between the cash accounting, which is the unitary payment for PPP, and the notional accounting when it comes to our rules about how envelopes are managed when it comes to these projects.</p></speech>

What happens then with maintenance?  I presume that no school has come back yet.</p></speech>

Schools get a certain number of hours a year, I believe it is 300 or 400, outside of school time.  There can be usage after that which just pays the costs.  It is the usage after that which makes a profit.  There is then the issue of splitting where the profits go.  That has been quite limited.</p></speech>

I now wish to focus on roads and schools and I will turn first to the issue of transport.  My questions are based on the documentation supplied to the committee by Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  Reference was made to the list of the ten areas where some work has been done as part of the post-project reviews.  The list includes the Kilcock-Kinnegad motorway, the Dundalk western bypass, the N8 Rathcormac-Fermoy bypass, the N25 in Waterford, the Limerick tunnel, the N3 road Clonee north to Kells, the M6 Galway to Ballinalsoe, the M7 and M8 to Portlaoise, the M50 project, and the motor services areas.  These are the older projects.  The chart is going around the Oireachtas but it is based on this same information.  Is the operational date from the date the roads became open to use?</p></speech>

There has, however, been a little bit of a myth that has been going around here today that these became popular during the recession when the State encouraged this type of finance.  I do not believe this is the case.  These projects were in their height in the good times before the recession.  When the recession came along many of the projects that had been in the pipeline stopped.  This is the exact opposite to what some people have said at the committee today.  The Clonee project for example started in 2010.  That contract would have been made three years earlier.  The Limerick project and the M50 were also in 2010.  This means that all those contracts were signed in 2007.  The Kilcock-Kinnegad contract was signed around 2002, the Dundalk contract would have been signed in 2002, the Fermoy project signed in 2003, the Waterford project was signed in 2006, the Galway-Ballinasloe M6 project was signed around 2006, the M7 and M8 in Portlaoise was signed around 2006-2007, and the motorway services project was signed around 2007.  It has been said a few times in this committee that most of these projects were going when the State was not able to access finance and that they were good for employment and so on.  This is not the case at all.  The projects actually ground to a halt then.  I recall some of the decentralisation programmes under PPP, one of which was three big Government offies in Carlow, Mullingar and Portlaoise.  These went to final stage in the process.  The contractor had spent millions of euro as the preferred bidder but the project was pulled at the end.  This is an example of the risks borne by bidders in competitions.  I have asked if that person was paid.  That instance was offices for the Government so it was probably an OPW project.  My point is that these projects collapsed during the recession and they are now picking up again.  They were not countercyclical.  They were very much it.</p></speech>

That scheme dragged on at the procurement stage, not at the construction stage.  The procurement stage took quite a while to get signed.  The Chairman is right that the national development plan in 2000-2006 identified PPP and particular schemes we were to procure through PPP.

They were not.  The assessments were done as a comparison.  I refer the committee to pages 12 to 14, inclusive, of the briefing document.  The information looks at post-project reviews.  Page 12 contains the list I have read out.  Page 13 looks at the conclusion of post-project reviews.  These are the reviews that have been done which will be published shortly.  When the committee sees these reviews, we will talk again.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland has included some conclusions in the document forwarded to the committee today.  The conclusions cover planning, the implementation of projects, the objectives achieved in helping to reduce traffic volumes and congestion in towns and bypass routes, reduction in the numbers of fatalities, and the contribution to providing the motorway and dual carriageway network routes.  When Transport Infrastructure Ireland conducts its post-project reviews, how does it take account of the value of these motorways in the reduction of fatalities?  Motorways have done this.  Before these towns were bypassed by motorways, we know that people had been killed by vehicles in the towns.  It is a fact that the motorways have saved lives.  I cannot think of a town that did not have fatalities before the bypasses were constructed.  The bypasses also took the juggernauts out of the towns and allowed them to do a bit of local business instead of three miles of juggernauts each way every evening.  How does Transport Infrastructure Ireland incorporate this value or does it just do the review on specifics?  Does it look at societal benefits over and above cost values?  There are other benefits to motorways and does Transport Infrastructure Ireland take this into account?</p></speech>

There are standard values that would then apply to the new-build sections such as accident rates that are set out on upgraded road networks and agreed with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  These are standard appraisal values.  We publish them in our projects appraisal documentation section of our website as accident types by road type.  Going from a single carriageway to a dual carriageway or motorway, one gets a far improved road safety record.</p></speech>

It does not address the question of whether the project itself is worth doing.  The issue raised about lives saved relates to whether there is a socio-economic benefit to doing the project which is separate from the cost of procuring it.</p></speech>

An economic appraisal was carried out on day one.  It might have been years before the project got off the ground.  One of Mr. Kennedy's conclusions is that there was no interim reappraisal.  We would always say that there should be a full economic appraisal every five years.  It might have made sense five years ago but does it still make sense now?  I have seen projects take 15 years from beginning to end.  Mr. Kennedy has highlighted in his conclusions that there was a clear weakness there.  That is the only conclusion.  Then we talk about the concessions and the Limerick tunnel.  Essentially, a lay person reading about the Limerick tunnel and Clonee route would conclude that, without the State agreeing to that minimum payment for minimum traffic, that project might not have happened.  It could not have happened.  The traffic flow did not justify it so the State came in and said that it would put a floor on the income regardless and that possibly made the project viable for somebody to take on.  Am I giving a reasonable assessment?</p></speech>

It then took a number of years to get to the procurement stage of the scheme.  When we did the post-project review, the look-back concluded that it should have been reappraised.  As it happens, our guidance had moved during the middle of the decade.  We had already put into our new guidance that this should be done more frequently and be more up to date.  It is our current practice and we have addressed that matter.  The Chairman is correct that this was the issue with the scheme at the Limerick tunnel, the city centre scheme and such.  A tunnel scheme is a high-risk scheme.  In market consultations, the view was that people would not come in to tender.  We talked earlier in the day about competition and such.  It was important for us to get the competition in.</p></speech>

I want to move on to page 28 of that document.  The reason I ask this goes without saying.  It is the Portlaoise PPP scheme.  Without getting too detailed, will somebody explain page 28?  The witnesses have given us the ten value for money assessment analyses on doing a road project by the traditional method versus the PPP.  There are ten pages there.  There is a page for each of the ten on which reports have been done.  I presume that those in the system understand what that page means.  With regard to the traditional procurement, will somebody briefly explain what that page is all about?  The witnesses have given us ten pages.  Do they understand my question?  We are the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is not just for Sean Fleming to understand.

Does Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; see what I am talking about on his document, No. 1154?  We will not go through the details of that.  I see &euro;63 million.  That was in 2001 for 3,475 pupils.  That was an average of &euro;18,000 per pupil.  On the next page and the figures are in the same order, approximately &euro;20,000.  The chart here on the right states the capital value per financial model excluding VAT is &euro;60 million.  Is that just the capital?  That is not the maintenance and construction over the lifetime of the body but just the capital.  Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; is comparing the capital costs of that with what the traditional costs of building would have been.  That is one of the reports the Department will be doing and then it will try to-----</p></speech>

As Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; can see, I mentioned two big schools in Portlaoise.  There are several around.  The value from an education perspective is very important.  If a door has fallen off a hinge, someone broke into the school at the weekend or the central heating is not working, it is not the principal's problem.  He or she gets on with the job of education.  A company, Sodexo or one of that crowd, does all that.  It relieves schoolteachers and the board of management of much nitty-gritty of looking after the building, which leaves them with more time for the purposes of what the school is about, which is educating the pupil.  There are benefits.  Has Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; a way of building that in?</p></speech>

We are nearly there.  I wish to raise some issues.  During the lunch break Deputy MacSharry raised the issue in previous meetings of the PAC information had been sought in respect of the Cork Institute of Technology.  Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; has checked his records in the meantime and has confirmed that he did write back to the previous Committee of Public Accounts committee on 10 June 2014.  I wish to put that formally on the record as there was confusion about it earlier.</p> <p>  One of the reasons we are here is because public private partnerships have a role.  I am agnostic on the policy approach but not everyone is agnostic on the issue.  If they are good, they are good.  If they do a job, I have no issue, but the public is always entitled to know whether we are getting value for money.  In the course of the past year we have had Transport Infrastructure Ireland before the committee and the Department of Education and Skills.  When we see a significant payment going out each year through the appropriation account for PPPs and we are told it is for a school or a bypass, the PAC does not know if it provides good value for money and that gives some people an opportunity to say it is not good value for money.  It would be in the interests of the PPP disciples to put more information out there to show whether the projects are good value for money to prove their point but as long as there are no explanations a vacuum causes problems.</p> <p>  In recent months the committee has not approved any appropriation account with PPP payments because we cannot say whether we think it is good or bad.  There is a gap in the process from the point of view of the PAC.  I cannot stand over appropriation accounts on the Plinth if there is a figure for &euro;120 million for a PPP if I and the PAC are not satisfied that it was good value for money.  The witnesses can understand where we are coming from.  There has been a lot of secrecy in the past but society moves on.  Contracts are in place and there is printed information available.  As time goes on people will know that once a contract is up and running the commercial sensitivity diminishes and it is not necessary to wait for many years to pass.  Essentially, that is one of the reasons we are here.</p> <p>  I know the committee will not be satisfied to conclude this chapter in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report until probably much later in the year when we see some of these reports.  I do not say there is an issue but it will make it all the better if we can issue a report having seen more information but we are not at that point yet.  The witnesses seem to be saying we will get to that point soon.  In due course we will come back to that topic.  That is all I wish to say.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses.  I accept the exchanges in the meeting earlier on were robust but there is a bit of frustration among members due to the information that is not yet available that we would like to see.  We hope it will become available shortly.</p> <p>  I thank all the witnesses from the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Education and Skills, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff, and the National Development Finance Agency.  We will not dispose of chapter 4 for the reasons stated.  We will now adjourn until our next public meeting on Thursday, 29 March at 9 a.m. when we will be considering the grant funding to Galway's art house cinema, which is chapter 16 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  We will also be looking at the appropriation accounts 2016, Vote 33 for the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional and Gaeltacht Affairs.</p></speech>
