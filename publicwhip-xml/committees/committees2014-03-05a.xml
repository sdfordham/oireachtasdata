The White Paper also proposes encouraging member states to promote longer working lives, monitoring the adequacy and sustainability of pensions and supporting pension reforms in member states.  It has significant implications for Ireland with regard to financial and labour market issues, as well as older workers' issues.  Members will recall that when the committee recently considered a specific issue related to pensions, it heard presentations on the implications of the increase in the age at which the State pension was to be paid.</p><p>  I welcome from the Department of Social Protection Dr. Orlaigh Quinn, Mr. Tim Duggan, Mr. Finbarr Hickey and Mr. Darragh Doherty; from ICTU Mr. Fergus Whelan; and from the Irish Brokers Association Mr. Frank Lahiffe, Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Phelan and Mr. Aidan McLoughlin.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-05a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Orlaigh Quinn" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014030500003#D00400"><p>I thank the joint committee for the invitation to discuss the issue of pensions reform, including the implications of the EU White Paper on pensions.  In the past few years pension provision, in all its forms, in Ireland has experienced considerable challenges and changes.  The sustainability of the wider system is a particular concern because of the demographic issues Ireland faces and the associated increases in pension and other age-related costs.  These issues have been exacerbated owing to investment losses and the deterioration in the public finances since the recession.  Currently, there are 5.3 people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to approximately 2.1:1 by 2060.</p><p>  Life expectancy is also increasing.  In the mid-1990s life expectancy for males was 73 years and 78.5 for females.  For those aged 65 years today, life expectancy for males is 82 years and 85 for women.  By 2030 these will have risen to 84.1 years and 87.4, respectively.  This is very welcome news, but it brings with it a number of significant challenges in funding pensions into the future.  Key drivers of reform have included the need to achieve sustainability of our systems in the longer term, while also striving for adequacy in these systems.  This has included reforms to the State pension and public sector pensions and efforts to increase supplementary pension coverage, while working to ensure the continued viability of defined benefit pension schemes.</p><p>  Ireland has undertaken considerable research on pension issues, commencing with the Green Paper in  2007.  This included comprehensive consultation involving submissions from some 370 organisations and individuals, as well as a number of national and regional meetings involving some 500 people, and resulted in the national pensions framework in 2010.  A number of reforms have since been implemented.</p><p>  A number of reforms of the State pension have been implemented.  Significant reforms have been introduced recently and more will be implemented in the years ahead.  In order to provide for sustainable pensions and facilitate a longer working life, legislation was introduced to increase the State pension age.  This was discussed at the previous meeting.  In January 2014 the State pension age was standardised at 66 years, with the abolition of the State pension transition payment.  Pension age will increase to 67 years in 2021 and 68 in 2028.</p><p>  The changes to pension age also include consideration of measures to encourage longer working by older workers.  With effect from April 2012, the number of paid contributions required to qualify for a State pension increased from 260 paid contributions to 520.  From September 2012 new rate bands were introduced.  These additional contribution requirements and payment rate band changes more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement.  It is also planned to introduce a total contributions approach.  This will align the pension payment with the number of years a person has contributed to the social insurance fund.  Arrangements will also apply to cover periods outside the workforce.  This will more accurately award contributions made over a working life.  It will remove the current anomaly whereby some people qualify for higher pension payments, even though they have fewer contributions but a higher average than others who do not qualify or qualify for a lower pension owing to the average contributions test.  The proposed date of introduction for this reform is under review.</p> <p> Several regulatory measures have been introduced in recent years to support the sustainability of defined benefit schemes.  Legislation brought forward in 2009 removed the priority given to post-retirement increases for pensioners to ensure a more equitable distribution of assets in the event of the wind-up of a defined benefit scheme.  The introduction of the sovereign annuity initiative in 2012 gave scheme trustees an option to reduce scheme liabilities and better match their assets with their liabilities.  The introduction of the risk reserve in 2012 sought to improve the future sustainability of defined benefit schemes and incentivise schemes to improve their exposure to risk.  In 2013 there was a widening of the types of asset that could be used to reduce the reserve requirements of the funding standard.</p><p> Also in 2013, regulatory powers were strengthened to provide the Pensions Board with the power to wind up a pension scheme.  This power can only be exercised where a scheme is underfunded and the trustees and the employer are not in a position to adopt a funding proposal, or where the trustees of a scheme fail to comply with a direction from the Pensions Board to restructure scheme benefits.  Legislation was also introduced in 2013 to provide for governance changes to the Pensions Board and amalgamate the Pensions Ombudsman and the Financial Services Ombudsman.  These changes are aimed at strengthening regulation and ensuring greater consumer involvement.  The Social Welfare and Pensions (No.2) Act 2013 which was signed into law in December 2013 provides for a fairer and more equitable distribution of scheme assets in the event of the wind-up of an underfunded scheme.  It also facilitates a greater sharing of the risk between all of the beneficiaries when a scheme is underfunded, while still providing for priority protection of pension benefits.  A non-legislative initiative has involved the development of a pensions tracing system for the private sector to support those nearing retirement to identify previous pension benefits and enable the pensions industry to contact former contributors to schemes.</p><p> In February 2012 the European Commission published a White Paper on how to create adequate, safe and sustainable pension systems in the European Union.  The White Paper contains a range of initiatives intended to help to create conditions that will enable a balance between time spent working and time in retirement, ensure those who move to another country can keep their pension rights and help people to obtain adequate pensions when they retire.  The White Paper describes the ageing of the European population which reflects the situation in Ireland as the main challenge for the future of the European Union's pensions system.  Other challenges it identifies include financial sustainability, maintaining the adequacy of pension benefits and raising the labour market participation level of women and older workers.</p><p> In the light of these challenges, the White Paper makes a number of proposals for EU-level initiatives to support member states' efforts to reform their pension systems.  These include creating better opportunities for older workers by calling on the social partners to adapt workplace and labour market practices and using the European Social Fund to assist older workers into work.  Another proposal is to develop complementary private retirement schemes by encouraging social partners to develop such schemes and encouraging member states to optimise tax and other incentives.  There is a proposal to enhance the safety of supplementary pension schemes, including through a revision of the directive on institutions for occupational retirement provision, IORP, and the provision of better information for consumers.  The White Paper proposes to make supplementary pensions compatible with mobility through legislation protecting the pension rights of mobile workers and promoting the establishment of pension tracking services across the European Union.  Member states are to be encouraged to promote longer working lives by linking retirement age with life expectancy, restricting access to early retirement and closing the pension gap between men and women.  The White Paper also recommends continued monitoring of the adequacy, sustainability and safety of pensions.</p><p> The White Paper does not contain country-specific recommendations for Ireland owing to the memorandum of understanding which was in place at the time of its publication.  However, the challenges identified in the White Paper are the same ones Ireland has been seeking to address in recent years, challenges which are relevant to most member states.  Ireland plays a full role in EU developments and is a strong contributor in the various Councils dealing with pensions.  During the recent Irish Presidency we were successful in obtaining agreement on a portability directive.  This proposal aims to remove obstacles which hinder citizens' capacity to choose, with confidence, to live and work anywhere in the European Union without fear of losing their pension entitlements.  It allows EU workers who move to a different EU country to safeguard their supplementary pension rights.</p><p> In April 2013 the OECD published its review of Ireland's pension system, encompassing the totality of pension provision in Ireland - State, private, occupational and public sector.  The issues of sustainability, adequacy, modernity and equity were central to this review.  The good news is that Ireland was found to be in a relatively favourable position compared with most OECD countries, both in regard to pension spending and the adequacy of retirement income provision.  Most importantly, the economic position of pensioners in Ireland is comparatively good, relative  to other age groups in the population and international comparisons.</p><p> In terms of the adequacy of pensions, it should be noted that older people do not experience the levels of poverty experienced in the past.  For instance, the at-risk of poverty rate for persons aged 65 years and over fell from 27.1% in 2004 to 9.7% in 2011, compared with 16% for the population as a whole.  Over the same period, the consistent poverty rate for older persons also declined from 3.9% to 1.9%, compared with 6.9% for the population as a whole.  The OECD review shows that recent decisions in this area are in line with the roadmap needed for pension reform.  However, the report also raises question marks about aspects of the Irish pensions system.  The key recommendation made in the report is to improve the adequacy of pensions by increasing coverage in the funded part of the pensions system through a universal mandatory or quasi-mandatory employment-based pensions system.  This is in accordance with the recommendations made in the EU White Paper and a key issue to be addressed in the context of future pension reforms.</p><p> While the State pension has been successful in lifting older people out of poverty, the financial challenges of our changing demographics and ageing population mean we need to improve occupational and private pension coverage.</p></speech>

What is of critical importance in terms of the future of the pensions system is whether the Government decides to focus on an auto-enrolment or a mandatory system.  There are very useful lessons to be learned from other countries in this regard and the Government will be making a decision in due course.  Any new reform must take into account the pension charges report published in 2012 and address the key challenges outlined therein.</p></speech>

I now invite Mr. Whelan of ICTU to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-05a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fergus Whelan" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014030500004#E00500"><p>I thank the joint committee for the invitation to make a presentation on pensions reform.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions is concerned that this term has become a euphemism to cover policy and regulation failure, the transfer of pension risk from employers to workers, and neoliberal attacks on social security provision for the elderly.  I propose to focus on three main issues, namely, the crisis that has unfolded in recent years with regard to defined benefit occupational schemes and, specifically, the failure of the regulatory system in this regard; the fact that defined contribution schemes have not proved to be value for money or performed any better than defined benefit schemes; and the implications of the EU White Paper on pensions.</p><p>  Before the economic crisis in 2008, defined benefit schemes in Ireland were already under significant pressure.  In 2005 congress published a document entitled, Pensions Problems and Solutions<i>, </i>which highlighted the fall in equities in the previous three years and signalled problems ahead for defined benefit schemes.  Throughout the pensions crisis which began long before the financial crisis the State and pensions regulatory system have failed pension scheme members.  At times, in fact, they both appeared to be actively working against the best interests of scheme members.  In 2008 the regulator suspended the minimum funding standard, a move that was welcomed by all stakeholders.  It seemed that a breathing space was being given to allow steps to be taken which could ease the pressure on sustainable schemes.  Gradually, however, it became apparent that officialdom had no intention of dealing with the systemic problems; rather, it adopted a position that these problems were a matter for individual schemes and their trustees.  As trustees grappled with mounting problems, they were left in the dark for nearly five years as to what rules would be applied into the future.</p><p>  Congress gradually developed a consensus among the main stakeholders, including the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, the Irish Association of Pension Funds and the Society of Actuaries in Ireland, seeking changes that would help schemes to survive.  Most of our suggestions were ignored or dismissed out of hand by officialdom which either did not accept the extent of the crisis or, if it did, took the view it was not its concern.  Throughout the crisis officialdom has appeared indifferent to the views and interests of the workers who own the pension funds.  Recent changes to the priority order are most welcome but will serve only to bring some equity in the closure of distressed schemes.  The Waterford Crystal workers made a major breakthrough by puncturing the notion that pension funds in difficulty were no concern of the Government.</p> <p>However, this victory has not had much of an effect on the attitude of public officials.</p><p> The Government and the regulator clung resolutely to a funding standard that artificially overvalued liabilities and further increased uncertainty by announcing that defined benefit schemes would be required to hold significant risk reserves.  Meanwhile the Government raised a levy on all schemes, including those in trouble.  One consequence of this was to promote an attitude among employers that pension schemes were far more trouble than they were worth.  When it was introduced initially as a funding mechanism for job creation, the pension levy of 0.6% of fund assets was to apply for the four years to 2014.  The cost of the levy has generally been passed on to members whose benefits have been reduced by 2.4% over the period.  Despite reassurances to the contrary, the levy did not cease in 2014 and has been extended for at least a further year at a new rate of 0.15% but with a combined charge.  It remains to be seen how schemes will manage these extra costs and whether members will experience an apparently never-ending series of cuts to their benefits as a result of this State confiscation of pension savings. </p><p> Unions, employers, trustees and pension professionals tackled the problems which arose with great creativity and in a spirit of problem solving rather than adversity.  Many imaginative and inventive solutions were agreed to that saved schemes which otherwise would have gone under.  However, nearly all of the solutions arrived at led to significant losses for members and deferred members.  Coupled with the financial losses was the collapse of confidence in pensions generally.  The funding standard was reimposed in 2013 without anything significantly helpful having been done in the five year hiatus.  Owing to the successful strategy of officialdom in decentralising the problem to the level of individual schemes, it is difficult to know how deep the crisis has become.  We do know that there has been acceleration in scheme wind-ups, with 25% of schemes expected to wind up by the end of last year; most defined benefit schemes are closed to new members; a growing number of defined benefit schemes are closed to future service accrual; many schemes do not meet the minimum funding standard - some have been, and more will be, saved by section 50 applications, but this will involve major losses of pension benefits that workers have earned and paid for and it will also add to the crisis of confidence to which I have referred.  Nearly all solutions involve no further increases to pensions in payment; people will slowly descend into poverty from the moment they retire and if high inflation returns, the fall into poverty will be rapid.  In addition, the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission are dealing with an array of pension disputes.  If these disputes are settled, it is likely that many will be resolved on the basis that no further contributions will be made to the defined benefit schemes and there will be massive losses of accrued entitlements for the workers affected.</p><p> Unions have developed great expertise in influencing and constructing section 50 applications which seek to defend accrued and future core benefits.  It is a remarkable achievement to convince active members to stay with a scheme, continue to make substantial contributions and accept lower benefits in a climate of declining confidence.  Few well informed workers believe their pension funds savings are safe.</p><p> There is nothing to suggest the losses in defined contribution schemes have been any less severe than those incurred by members of defined benefit schemes.  Trustees of such schemes have been forced to crystallize.  The losses in defined contribution schemes are masked until a worker retires.  All that has happened in the move from defined benefits to defined contributions is that the risk has been transferred from capital to labour.  There is nothing to suggest the current regulatory regime can better protect defined contribution scheme members.  Nobody has monitored the underperformance of defined contribution schemes, the very low level of employer contributions to these schemes, the loss in defined contribution values during the financial crisis or the traditional over exposure of defined contribution schemes to equities.  Many thousands of workers took the rational decision and stopped paying into pension funds which were not safe, ineffectively regulated and subject to State confiscation.  Neither has there been a review of the failure of orthodox assumptions of what constitutes high, medium, low or even appropriate levels of risk.</p><p> There is little new in the European White Paper and it could be summarised in a few bullet points.  According to its authors, we are living longer, have to stay in work longer and save more for retirement and need safe sustainable complementary savings systems.  In addition, they describe the move from defined benefits to defined contributions as a "structural reform", whereas congress sees it as transferring the risk on a pension scheme from the employer to the employee and as a major deterioration in workers' pension conditions.  The authors indicate that the crisis clearly demonstrates that the ability of pre-funded pension schemes to mitigate risks and absorb shocks needs to be improved.  Unfortunately, they do not inform us about how this is to be done.  The White Paper does state the acceptance of reforms depends on whether such reforms are perceived to be fair.  All I can say is "Amen to that."  The authors of the White Paper are also of the view that genuine dialogue involving governments, social partners and other stakeholders is necessary to build a consensus on policies to create opportunities for people in working longer.  I addressed the committee on that matter previously and as far as congress is concerned, there has been no social dialogue on it to date.</p><p> Congress regards complementary savings systems, whether defined benefits or defined contributions, as far from safe and the pension regulation system has utterly failed to protect the funds or the interest of scheme members.  How can complementary savings systems be safe as long as we have a defective regulatory system and a Government that reserves the right to confiscate accrued funds as it sees fit?  With the race towards defined contribution schemes, the risk will not be mitigated and the shock will be absorbed by the workers alone.  Our reforms to date have been grossly unfair and inequitable and there has been no attempt to involve the social partners.</p><p> The recent pension changes in the priority order are late but welcome.  They at least bring an element of certainty in place of the confusion which reigned supreme for the past five years.  Stakeholders now know that they will get no further help from the Government or the regulator.  The only area of doubt remaining is whether the Government can kick the habit of raiding workers' pension savings for opportunistic purposes.  Nonetheless, stakeholders can make reasonable informed decisions about the future.  Unfortunately, many more schemes will move towards wind-up and this will involve huge losses for the workers concerned.  Those who are responsible for directing public policy on pensions and getting us into this mess -  successive Governments, highly paid doyens of risk management and public officials - got it utterly wrong, yet they suffer no consequences and have kept their Rolls Royce pensions.  The burden of their failure is borne by workers and former workers.  Most workers who have lost out have so far borne it stoically.  Perhaps this is because they feel no immediate pain.  A decade hence, when workers who contributed huge amounts of income to their pension are sunk in poverty, the pensions time bomb may finally detonate.</p><p> The White Paper has nothing to offer except perhaps the suggestion that reform should be fair and involve dialogue with the social partners.  Experience to date in respect of pension age and pension policy suggests there is no intention to ensure the reforms will be fair.  Pension reform in Ireland involves taking as much as possible from the vulnerable, while ensuring the elites are cosseted.  Making "social dialogue" dirty words means that unfair reform can be imposed on citizens without ever having to consider the hardship that results for individuals.</p></speech>

I refer to flood damage, mortgage arrears and the impact of the pension crisis.  Our members advise on 90% of private pensions in Ireland which, we believe, allows us to speak with some authority on the current state of private sector pension provision.</p><p>  It is not an exaggeration to say pension schemes in Ireland are in crisis.  We are all aware that we face a significant challenge as our demographics change and the population ages.  Given current and expected Exchequer returns, it is obvious that pillar 1 social protection pension payments are unsustainable at current levels and will inevitably reduce as a percentage of pre-retirement income.  In the light of this reality, it is imperative that private funding of pillar 2 and 3 pensions be increased in order to cover the deficit and provide a sustainable, as opposed to subsistence, income for citizens in retirement.  The latter, in the light of increases in longevity, could last 25 years or more, which is half a working life.  Government policy to date has been inadequate in addressing current and future crises.  Defined benefit schemes are terminal and employees are faced with the stark reality that promises made as part of their employment contracts and in lieu of salary will not be realised.  Government action on caps and levies has also had the impact of scaring people away from making sufficient contributions to pension schemes to ensure adequate provision when they reach retirement age.</p> <p> The self-employed have been completely ignored in the pension debate to date.  The costs regularly mentioned in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann attaching to pension reliefs are grossly exaggerated and, in our opinion, have led to flawed decision making.  Tax reliefs do not cost this State &euro;2.9 billion.</p><p> We have had the NPPI report in the 1990s, the Green Paper on Pensions in the 2000s and the OECD report last year.  The IBA would suggest we have ample reports and that serious action that encourages and makes pension contributions affordable is needed.  The OECD report recommends mandatory or soft mandatory pension contributions which we would agree will address the coverage rates in Ireland, moving the private sector from approximately 40% to close to 100%.  However, it will not address the adequacy issue - an important element overlooked in most debates on an Irish solution to pension provisioning.</p><p> The average pension fund in Ireland in the private sector is &euro;120,000.  On current annuity rates, it provides a pension of around &euro;6,000 per annum, which when coupled with the State pension will provide an income on reaching the age of 68 of &euro;18,000.  A public servant on &euro;50,000 per annum at retirement will retire on a pension of &euro;25,000, excluding the <i>ex gratia</i>payment of &euro;75,000.  In the private sector this would require a fund of more than &euro;500,000.  The Government needs to start educating citizens regarding the funding levels required to deliver a sustainable pension and to provide sufficient encouragement by way of incentives for people to make affordable reasonable contributions.</p><p> However, to date Government has cut reliefs, capped contributions, capped pension pots and imposed a discriminatory levy that only applies to funded pension schemes and hits the more prudent hardest.  Over the course of the levy, in excess of &euro;2 billion will be taken from the pension savings of the citizens of Ireland, and I hasten to add that if a similar amount was taken from people's deposit savings, there would be considerable anarchy.  While we readily acknowledge the difficult economic circumstances in which the country found itself, and the work of the Government to right the situation, it should acknowledge the contribution made by individuals pension funds to the recovery, and allowance should be made by way of tax credit on maturity of these funds to bring equality back into the system.</p><p> As an association that represents the majority of advisers in the pensions industry, we want to make a positive contribution to the solution of the impending crisis.  My colleague, Mr. Aidan McLoughlin, will discuss some plausible and possible solutions to encourage greater pension savings.</p></speech>

I would make a few general points.  There is a crisis in the pension system.  As the OECD report confirmed, over the course of the next few decades we will face a &euro;324 billion hole in our social welfare system if further changes are not made, and some of the changes already outlined are factored into that.  Therefore, something needs to be done.  Put simply, the benefits cannot be paid at the same level unless we adjust something.  Auto-enrolment is a positive measure, as Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Phelan said, but it does not fix that problem; it would only fix it if the benefits in auto-enrolment were used instead of some of the social welfare benefits that are being paid to date.  It is important to realise that it will only work if we were to cut social welfare benefits.  Kicking the can down the road is not an option as that would cause more difficulties in the future.</p><p>  The point has been made, and it has been reflected in the OECD report, that pensioner poverty in Ireland is currently low based on historical numbers.  However, in the paper I outline a number of steps that have been taken in the recent past that will substantially increase pensioner poverty.  As Mr. Fergus Whelan has outlined, those chickens will come home to roost in the future.  We must recognise that basing it on historical numbers does not give us a real appreciation of the degree to which changes made in the recent past will cut benefits available to pensioners and significantly increase pensioner poverty in the future.<i></i><br /> In the White Paper three adjectives are used in terms of benefits, namely, &quot;safe, adequate and sustainable&quot;.  Focusing on each of those in turn, we have a number of suggestions to make.  In terms of safe pensions, we think that the biggest threat to pensions in Ireland at present is the State itself.  People will not feel safe about their benefits unless that is addressed.  Our suggestion is that it needs constitutional protection.  Something should be written into the Constitution to give people the comfort to save over a 40-year period knowing that the benefit will not be subject to some form of confiscation, taxation or other imposition as they near retirement, as we have seen happen in the recent past. </p><p>  Second, the scale of the problems here is such that we need a long-term plan.  This is not a plan that can be delivered in the lifetime of any government, we need a 50-year plan to be able to deal with the issues.  Pensions are an extremely long-term issue.  One saves for 40 years and one could draw benefits for another 30 years.  Therefore, a long-term plan is needed.  We need somebody to be in charge of that plan, a pensions Minister.  Each time we look to a foreign jurisdiction for guidance, be it Australia or the United Kingdom, we note that they have had pension ministers in charge.  It helps drive through the process.  There are too many Departments involved and sometimes the good work of one Department can be undone by the activity in another.  </p><p>  In terms of adequacy of pensions, auto-enrolment will help.  We recognise there has been delayed implementation of it due to the current economic environment.  We think the Government should put forward when it will be implemented and what it will consist of in order that people can start planning now even if it is a number of years before it takes off.  We think the contribution rate needs to be significant to be of benefit and, by that, we mean double digit contribution levels combined between employer, employee and the State.  The system must also include the self-employed.  While it is quite comprehensive in all it does, everything is presupposed around the employees.  As we saw in recent times, much of the most employment is coming from the self-employed.  There are a significant part of the economy and they are equally entitled to be pensioned.  As Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Phelan has said, our tax reliefs system needs to be managed better to encourage that.  </p><p>  In terms of sustainability, the key features here are both our social welfare system and public sector pensions, both of which have been subjected to some change.  However, as the OECD pointed out, it has not been sufficient to fix the problem and further work needs to be done.  Simply put, we have made promises - we have written cheques as a State that we cannot cash.  The combined exposures in this respect are &euro;129 billion currently in the public sector and &euro;324 billion for social welfare.  They dwarf the national debt about which we spend so much time worrying.  The problem is that these numbers are not regularly tracked, checked and dealt with.  We believe a pensions Minister with responsibility for showing improvement in those over a long period is the way forward.</p></speech>

We are not being told anything that is not already in the public domain but the witnesses made their presentations well and succinctly.  I note what Mr. Whelan said about defined contribution schemes, and I agree with him.  I have long suspected that the defined contribution schemes are not a panacea.  I also agree with him that the way liabilities are calculated in defined benefit pension schemes is insane.  If Mr. Whelan's organisation has alternative models I would be like to see them.</p><p>  The European White Paper refers to complementary systems, etc., to support the State system and that if we have to have complementary systems, the need for tax incentives and so on but what we appear to have here are disincentives.  One of the gentlemen from the broker association made an interesting point about the actual cost of the tax relief on pensions but as we know the tax relief on savings for pension purposes has been severely curtailed.  In addition, we have a direct levy on pension funds, which is transferred directly to the members.  It is akin to what the Government of Cyprus did in taking money directly from people's savings.</p><p>  A number of interesting suggestions are contained in the submission, including constitutional protection, a long-term plan, a pensions Minister, etc.  All of us would welcome those.  I would appreciate it if Mr. McLoughlin would elaborate on his figures on the amount of exposure to which we are potentially liable.  I believe he referred to &euro;329 billion or-----</p></speech>

I am interested in some of the points made by the Irish Brokers Association and I will take up an offer it has made to meet to discuss further the points its representatives have made here and at other times regarding the issue of pensions.  One point made was the cost to the State of the tax relief for pensions does not amount to &euro;2.9 billion.  What is the cost, as calculated by the Irish Brokers Association?  A number of factors have been listed as disincentives for pension funds remaining in Ireland and seven changes that have occurred in recent years were outlined.  One point that has been made on an ongoing basis in this committee concerns the disincentive, to those who have been contributing to their pension funds, of the cost of administration, that is, what comes out of the money they put in.  The point is that in Ireland, the pension industry takes a far greater lump out of what is invested.  I ask the Irish Brokers Association to elaborate on this point and whether the comparison is wrong, as that would be useful.</p><p>  I am unsure whether the departmental officials referred to the European Union's discussion paper indicating the Union's future direction.  At a previous meeting on pensions that pertained to defined contribution and defined benefit schemes in particular, I made the point that if one is in work but one's job closes and moves somewhere else within the European Union, the European Globalisation Adjustment fund is available.  I asked whether such a fund or its equivalent could be created in the case of a company that closed and moved out of Ireland but which still existed or in the case of a global company that had other outputs or branches in the rest of Europe.  Such a fund would enable one to make a charge on that company for some type of compensation for its withdrawal from Ireland on behalf in particular of deferred members and pensioners.  Members dealt with this issue when discussing the changes to the defined benefits scheme in the most recent legislation earlier last year.</p></speech>

Mr. Phelan referred to a discriminatory levy and was challenging of Government decisions in that regard.  As for the intention of such levies at the time they were implemented, I seem to recall it was that some portion of these levies would come out of the funds themselves rather than being passed on to individual pension members.  To what degree has the burden of these levies been shared between the funds and their members?  Has the entire burden been passed on to members or did the funds themselves absorb much of it?  In a similar question to that asked by Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh concerning the association's charge that &euro;2.9 billion is not the figure, I would be interested in learning what, according to its calculations, is the actual figure.</p><p>  The next question is addressed to Mr. Fergus Whelan of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions  What would ICTU ask be done now to address the issues Mr. Whelan has described as being currently in crisis mode?  It has been stated that there has been an acceleration in the winding up of schemes.  Does that accord with the sense by the Department of Social Protection of what is going on or to what would it ascribe it?  Do the representatives from the Department agree with that comment?  I seek to establish what is the Department's understanding regarding the 1.5% levy that has been extended for one further year.  Is there any guarantee the levy will come to an end after this one further year and what is the Department's expectation in that regard?  As for the White Paper that is the subject for today's discussion, it has been suggested that the only additional feature to be introduced is some mention of fairness.  In the Department's view, what new elements will it contain that will pose a challenge in the Irish situation?</p></speech>

As Deputy O'Dea observed, this issue has been in the public domain for ages and all members are well aware that pensions are in great difficulty.  One point on which I picked up, which may have been made by Mr. McLoughlin, is that prior to 2008, pensions already were in trouble.  This was at a time when tax relief was available in respect of pensions.  Consequently, if they already were in trouble when tax reliefs were available, bringing them back will not solve the problem.  As Mr. McLoughlin mentioned constitutional protection, did the association make a submission on this issue to the Constitutional Convention when it was sitting and if so, what was its feedback thereon?  The association's suggestion that benefits should be cut is worrying.  They are low enough and the Government is trying to keep them intact.  Many people do not have a private pension and will rely solely on a social welfare pension.  As for even the thought of cutting such benefits, I certainly will not make any such recommendation out of this committee.  I also note Mr. Phelan's comment that the Irish Brokers Association's members advised on 90% of the private pensions in Ireland.  What advice were its members giving them if this train crash was rolling down the tracks?  If they were responsible for advising on 90% of the pensions in Ireland, what were they saying to them?  What advice were the association's members giving to them?</p></speech>

I was delighted to hear Mr. Phelan's observation that the self-employed were completely ignored in respect of pensions.  I come from a self-employed background and spent 24 years in the shoe business.  One good measure implemented by the present Government was that current statements now at least are being produced each year.  For 24 years, I paid into a pension administered by one of the biggest pension companies in the State but never received a statement.  One might telephone or seek such a statement and it might take five or six months for it to be produced.  Two years ago, for the first time, I received a statement telling me what was in the aforementioned pension.  However, when my business wound up, I found out to my detriment what it contained.  This was after 24 years of contributing approximately &pound;150 at the outset, rising to &euro;220 per month, which worked out at approximately &euro;43,200.  However, I will not reveal the final sum contained in the pension, because it would frighten one.</p><p>  The issue in respect of self-employed people is that accountants were selling pension schemes and many such schemes they were selling to self-employed people basically were gambling on stocks and shares.  Although some of it was placed in a pension scheme that was safe, other parts of it were put into a gambling system on stocks and shares, to the detriment of self-employed people.  I agree with Mr. McLoughlin's suggestion regarding having a Minister responsible for pensions.  However, to revert to the point about allowing accountants to sell pension schemes to the self-employed, it was akin to auctioneers when they became bankers.  In addition to selling one the house, they also provided the loan and one got everything under a single roof.  When one was advised to pay into a pension, basically it was by telling one its purpose was to stop one from paying a pile of income tax.  It should not be put forward in that manner, as pensions are there to make one's life better when one needs money in one's older years.</p> <p>The Government has taken many steps concerning pensions, including annual statements which have been a big improvement.  We need to examine the self-employed sector because, as with social protection, there are no pension provisions.  Other countries have pension Ministers, so it would send out the right message to appoint such a person here.</p></speech>

As regards tax relief, the alternative to paying somebody a pension is to pay them a salary.  Taking that as a base point of calculating tax relief, an employer will get tax relief on it whether it is paid as a contribution or a salary.  Therefore, the move to a pension contribution does not increase the tax subsidy from the State one iota.</p><p>  Similarly, although it gets tax-free growth when it is in the pension fund, when it comes out it is typically taxed fully to income tax on receipt.  </p></speech>

The only State subsidy is the tax-free lump sum, the rest is fully taxed.  The figures are calculated on the basis that if I promise to give Ciar&aacute;n &euro;100 at the end of the week, the State is assuming it has a right to take &euro;52 because I have made him the promise, and another &euro;52 when I give him the &euro;100.  That is a total tax rate of 104%, so the numbers are false.  We have discussed it with the officials involved who said the numbers were being misquoted.  However, there is not a &euro;2.9 billion subsidy there, far from it.</p><p>  A point was also raised about the advice we are given.  In view of this, the feedback from our members is that for the first time in their careers many of them with 30 or 40 years' experience are at the point where they are challenged to advise people to get a pension.  They are not convinced that it is in their long-term interest to join a pension scheme.  That is a frightening thought given all we have discussed here.  Simply because of that, they cannot say that the system can be trusted for the next 20 or 30 years that it will do right by them.  I cannot tell people that they are not safer with that money in their own pockets.  Without the tax relief that is notionally supposed to be there, and all the systems and protections that are supposed to be there, that doubt is in the minds of advisors at this point in time.  That is the position we are in.</p><p>  It is worth noting that the report the Minister commissioned on charges identified that Ireland offers as good or better value for money than is currently available in the UK, despite being a much smaller economic market.  Comparing his experience in Canada and the United States, the chief executive of Irish Life recently said that the value for money is there.  However, the issue of charges can be improved upon.  We believe that some form of measurement system, like total expense ratios to give clarity of charges to people, would be important.  It is not the fundamental issue concerning the problem with pensions, however.</p><p>  As regards the potential for some form of penalty on exiting DB schemes, my fear is that while it is a good notion it is almost too late to implement it.  As Mr. Whelan said earlier, we lost 25% of all DB schemes in the last year.  Of the schemes that are left, about two thirds of workers in them are in schemes that are exempt from the funding standard anyway.  Therefore they are already out from under the funding standard.  Only a small fraction of those left in DB schemes are subject to the funding standard.  The economic crisis itself is arriving at a solution but, unfortunately, that solution is the termination of all DB schemes that are subject to the funding standard.</p><p>  A question was asked about whether the levy was paid by others.  Certainly from my own experience, there is no overall record to say who is paying the levy.  All that Revenue will know is that the levy was paid by somebody.  As regards schemes in which we are involved, employers were asked whether they wished to pay the levy.  In some instances they did, while in others they did not on the basis that they were not even able to pay what they were supposed to put into the pension contributions in the first place.</p><p>  The suggestion was made that perhaps the industry itself could pay the levy out of its profits.  That did not happen in any instance and it was not a surprise.  I would have been party to that, as a trustee of the scheme.  It is worth bearing in mind that in terms of inflow, the industry experienced a 60% fall in income from 2007 to 2011.  At a time when some of the major players were being supported by the State, it did not seem logical that they would have so much fat there that the levy could be imposed and paid at that time.  It was not paid by industry participants and in some instances it would have been paid by employers.  In most cases, particularly with DC, it became a cost on the fund and was borne by members of the scheme.</p></speech>

I am also making the point that the industry itself, particularly the fund industry, is down 60% and is laying off staff.  It is not going to have profits.  Some of the major players, or their parent companies, were being supported by the State.  The economic existence of the major players in the pension industry was due to State support.  It is not a situation where there are excess profits to be voluntarily diverted to anything else.</p><p>  The self-employed are a discriminated class in much of what happens in pensions.  They have no ability to achieve the same level of benefits as anybody else because artificial limits are placed on them.  Their pensions do not even count as pensions so the pensions system does not recognise them.  They are not covered by the Pensions Board.  Only at EU level are they now considering bringing self-employed pensions within the regime.  </p><p>  I was listening to a debate last night about the importance of the self-employed and how they have helped to create employment, which is good.  The point was made that 60% of new employment will be created by small businesses getting up and running.  However, should we not at least give them an opportunity to enjoy a pension in their final years when they have given the State that benefit?  Currently, the system does not allow the self-employed to enjoy that benefit.</p><p>  We made a submission to the Constitutional Convention suggesting that pensions should be included.  There was a general conclusion dealing with social matters but I did not see pensions being specifically mentioned.  I am not aware that it has been taken on board.</p></speech>

I would strongly argue that efforts have not been made in this area.  Members of the Oireachtas will know that pensions legislation has been introduced every year since 2008, all of which has tried to protect defined benefit schemes.</p><p>  A specific question was asked about the acceleration of wind-up and whether it was happening.  It is happening but DB schemes have been winding up for the last 20 years.  Senator Moloney said this is not a new crisis.  The defined benefits sector really went into crisis in 2001 with the dot.com crash.  It has not recovered since then for a number of reasons.  As a model, it is not there to take account of longevity.  I cited the figures earlier, so a huge cost has not been factored in.  Investment losses have been colossal and far in excess of any other OECD country, so Ireland is an outlier there.  For a number of reasons, including those two in particular, defined benefit schemes have been closing.  However, they have certainly been closing for 20 years or more.  I agree with Deputy Ryan that they have accelerated in recent years.</p><p>  Some 820 schemes are currently subject to the funding standard, so they are regulated by the Pensions Board, but 190 are not.  Those are the correct data on that.  </p><p>  It was said that the regulatory structure is too tough.</p> <p>If it is too tough why are the schemes are underfunded?  When the funding standard was suspended, there was no evidence of schemes taking action to resolve their problems.  Since the funding standard has come back into play, we have seen a huge number of schemes working with the Pensions Board and, in the main, putting funding plans in place to generate their schemes.</p><p> Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh asked about a globalisation fund and the equivalent on the pensions side.  At EU level, all member states have very different pension schemes.  Only three have defined benefit schemes.  They are Ireland, the United Kingdom and Holland.  Most member states operate either on the basis of state-funded or defined-contribution schemes.  Decisions on pensions are taken at member state level and a suggestion such as the one made would have to be subject to discussion and debate.  I am not sure, given that pension schemes are so different, that such discussions would be high on the agenda.</p><p> Deputy Brendan Ryan asked about the White Paper and what is new in it.  There is probably nothing new as such.  The issues are ones with which we are very familiar and have been trying to grapple.  The paper is very much focused on the aging population.  On some issues, Ireland is ahead as we do not have differences between men and women in our State pension whereas other states would have significant gaps to make up.  Most countries are grappling with the same issues which include sustainability, adequacy and longer working years.  I cannot highlight anything that is really new and of which we would not have been aware previously.</p><p> Deputy Ryan asked specifically about the pensions levy.  It is a matter for the Minister for Finance who introduced the 0.6% levy in 2010 on the basis that it would terminate in 2014.  He announced a 0.15% levy.  All of that is connected with the jobs initiative and addressing future or pre-existing State liabilities.  The Minister has said the levy will apply in 2014 and 2015.  I cannot comment further.  It is the Minister's commitment.</p></speech>

At that time, the State told us those surpluses had to be reduced.  Schemes reacted to that one way or another.  They either took contribution holidays or they increased benefits.  There was a small handful of scheme closures which involved structural issues in industry not the defined-benefit nature of the schemes.  The print industry scheme went because the print industry ceased to be an industry with the invention of computers.</p><p>  I agree that Ireland performed worse in pensions terms than any other OECD country.  That is because we were hugely overexposed to equities, much more than any other country.  The regulatory system should have pointed that out.  Of our assets, 66% were exposed to equities.  The next highest country was the home of <i>uber</i> capitalism, the United States of America, where the statistic was 44%.  In the UK, 25% of funds were exposed to equities.  When the regulatory system should have been pointed that out and regulating it, it decided instead to regulate trustee behaviour.  That is what it is still doing.  Trustee behaviour has nothing to do with the collapse in pensions.  The collapse of our pensions system is a failure of the regulatory system.  We must recognise that.  We must get confidence back into the system, which we will not do by pretending defined-benefit schemes were always going to fold anyway.  That is not so.</p><p>  It is very late in the day for anything to be done.  What needed to be done and what could have been done was a softening of the funding standard to buy time.  The horse has now bolted to some extent.  Workers have lost their money and confidence is gone.  We had better start to rebuild confidence.  The only way to do that is to examine the regulatory system and admit where we got it wrong.</p></speech>

The self-employed have a very favourable situation with regard to the State contributory pension.  When one looks at all the actuarial calculations, self-employed people make a contribution of almost 5% and get the State contributory pension.  The issue of public versus private has come up.  Public servants have traditionally not got the State pension.  People say it is worth "X" amount, but in fact they are losing out on the State pension.  That is never brought into the picture when people make the point about how good public service pensions are.  Of course, there has also been the pension levy.</p><p>  What does auto-enrolment mean and entail?  Are any EU member states operating a system which is basically a state pension which covers everybody?  Is there one to which everybody contributes and everybody gets a pension?  While it is a political decision, is there room for us to move towards a system in which everybody is covered by a State pension with no one having a pension that is too high or too low?  I am not saying it has to be exactly the same but there should be a form of equality.  Are there any proposals in that regard and would such a model fit in with the White Paper?</p></speech>

It does not make any sense to me.</p><p>  I will tease through what an auto-enrolment system would look like but deal first with the Chair's last question about a State pension system for everybody.  In effect, we have such a system at the &euro;12,000 level.  An argument has been made about simply increasing that and using it as the pension.  It would mean the State taking on all the investment and longevity risk.  It is also the case that we face demographic issues.  At the moment there are approximately five workers for every pensioner.  As one moves out 20 to 30 years, one moves to a situation where there will be fewer than two workers for every pensioner.  It would simply be unaffordable.  There will not be sufficient income coming in from workers to facilitate a higher State pension.</p><p>  Looking at auto-enrolment, the purpose is that the first tier of one's pension would be State guaranteed but on top of that one will have a second tier whereby one contributes oneself and carries some of the investment risk.  A mandatory system is one in which everyone goes into the pension scheme and has no choice about it.  The contribution is set and they are in it for life.  In effect, that is the PRSI system we have.  Auto-enrolment would be different in that people would sign up and have their own private pensions in respect of which a contribution rate would be set.  While they would be auto-enrolled, which would be the mandatory element, they would have an option to come back out.  It might facilitate people who were trying to save for a house or were funding a child's education to come out of it.  It is based on inertia.  Once a person enters he or she will not tend to leave.  It is a bit like the situation whereby people rarely change bank account or mortgage.</p> <p>How many times do people change their mortgages?  They tend to go into the pension system, forget they are in it and then begin to built up their pension pot.</p><p> There is a series of tough decisions in terms of protecting people so the vast majority of people in these type of systems tend to go for what they call the default fund.  They do not make a choice so it is very important that this default fund is very safe and not very high risk.  A series of questions arise.  Who comes in first?  Does one phase it in?  Do employees come in first?  Does one extend it to the self-employed?  Would one extend it further?  They are all operational decisions.  Once a decision is made by government, there needs to be a huge implementation plan.  It relates to investment decisions, the question of whether it is State-run or run by the private sector and how one guarantees a certain level of benefit.  They are the big pieces.</p></speech>

However, we are still paying a lot of money in pensions to people living in other countries.  If someone worked here for five years, they do not even reach the minimum requirement in this country to get a pension.  If they work here for five years and then go to work in England, the US or another country with which we have a bilateral agreement and pay all their contributions in those countries, when they reach pension age, Ireland will then calculate a pension based on their work in Ireland and the work they did in other countries.  Why can we not pay an amount based on the work they did in this country because it is the other countries to which these people have contributed and we are supplementing their pensions from these countries?  Somebody living and working in England will get a British pension and a pro-rata Irish pension.  We are paying a lot of money out of the country through this method.  I know Dr. Quinn will tell me it relates to European rules, but the US, for example, is not Europe.  Why not have a European pension for people that would take what they paid in Ireland, England or France and put it all together in one pension for people working in different countries because each country is paying a pension separately?  It does not make sense that we are paying that much money out of the country while people in this country are not getting it.</p></speech>

The point I am making is that essentially we do not have tax relief, rather we have tax deferral.  If I agree to put &euro;100 into a pension scheme for Mr. Phelan from which he will draw down in ten years' time and it grows to &euro;125 in that period of time, the State gives tax exemption on the way in and tax exempts the &euro;25 that grew there.  However, if one ignores the tax-free lump sum, it will then tax in full the &euro;125 when it comes out so it will get all the tax.  The only decision made is when the tax will be paid.  The only actual tax relief it gives where it does not take tax is on the tax-free lump sum.  It says that this is exempt.  The rest is all tax deferral.  Whatever goes into a pension scheme will come out as taxed unless it comes out as a tax-free lump sum.  There is no-----</p></speech>

On the other hand, if one is on a very low income, if one put in the contribution when one had a very high income, one might have paid at the top rate and it came out at a lower rate.  It is a function of the amount of income one has that the State is giving the relief, not the fact that it is a pension in itself.  The tax reliefs attached to the pension schemes are mainly tax deferral.  Everything that comes out is taxed unless it comes out of the tax-free lump sum.</p></speech>

It is foregone because of the income they are on.  I do not think anybody is arguing that one should tax those individuals but it is wrong to think of &euro;2.9 billion floating around, which is the point I am making.  The reason it is not claimed is because people are not in the tax net as we have chosen as a State to say certain people should not be in the tax net.</p></speech>

Did the industry not look for that?  What about all the profits that are made?  When Mr. McLoughlin refers to pensioners, and most pensioners do not get a huge income out of their pensions, then somewhere along the line someone is making a lot of money.</p></speech>

A certain segment of the industry appears to have had discussions with the Minister but it is important to say that there is a lot of confusion about the industry and certain bodies within it would have been very upset about that, including our own association, which is not in favour of it.  Without naming individual companies in the insurance industry, if one looks at the largest ones, they are effectively in groups that have been sustained by State finance because they were broke so there are no large profits there.  If one looks at the returns published by the regulator in respect of insurance companies on their premium income, one can see that they fell 60% between 2007 and 2012.  If any industry or business is down 60%, it cannot be making the same profits so whatever theory there was about the potential to pay the levy, it will not occur at a time of financial crisis because that is being felt by all the participants in it.</p><p>  Our members would be as strong as anybody in arguing for value for money.  That is what they do all day, every day.  The fact that charges are quite competitive in Ireland is to the credit of those members.  In terms of how one can get better value for money, in our view, it is about clarity.  It relates to people being able to see exactly what it is.  We think a total expense ratio, which would be the equivalent of the APR on loans and is a number that allows one to capture what are one's total costs, would allow people to see exactly what they are paying and would help drive that further.  Basic competition will help after that.  </p></speech>

When one talks about money other than the tax-free lump sum being taxable after retirement, if no tax is paid on it, it is very hard to argue that there is some kind of equivalence when one is getting real benefits and no tax on the amount at the end.</p></speech>

The only people who would get that benefit at the end are by definition lower paid.  In terms of the cost to the State, if they were not receiving that benefit and had even lower benefits, the State would be stepping in with some form of subsidy to that income in terms of social welfare.  It is being presented as though the State is writing a &euro;2.9 billion cheque that it never sees back.  If it does not see it back, it is only because people have insufficient income.  Otherwise, it is a tax deferral system and the numbers do not calculate that.  It also double-counts numbers in the sense that it argues that when one gets a promise of a benefit of &euro;100, the State was entitled to tax that when the promise was made at 52% and again at 52% when it issued.  To me, that is double counting.  One promise of &euro;100 was made.  That was one benefit, not two.</p> <p>That is the way the numbers work.  I challenge it because the illusion exists that there is some money that could be spent elsewhere.  It is not there, &euro;2.9 billion would not flow back into the State's coffers if we abolished pensions in the morning.  There would not be an extra &euro;2.9 billion sitting in a bank account somewhere as a result. </p></speech>

I emphasise to members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that all mobile telephones must be switched off to avoid interference with the broadcasting of the meeting.  I welcome Mr. William Prasifka.  It is his first time before the committee since his appointment.  He is joined by Ms Jacqui McCrum, Deputy Financial Services Ombudsman, Mr. Diarmuid Byrne, head of administration, Mr. Tom Finn, head of legal services and Ms Mary Rose McGovern, head of investigation.  Mr. Prasifka and his colleagues are here at the invitation of the committee to discuss the 2013 bi-annual review of the Financial Services Ombudsman.  The committee will be particularly interested to explore the statistics and trends reported in the review, such as, for example, the sharp decrease in the number of complaints made to the ombudsman, which seems positive although there has been at the same time an increase in the number of complaints requiring full formal investigation.</p><p>  We also welcome the opportunity to discuss the way in which the relationship between the ombudsman and the financial services providers has been developing and whether this is resulting in better outcomes for consumers of financial services.  Members of the committee will, no doubt, have questions on the experience of the ombudsman regarding complaints concerning the mortgage arrears resolution process.  The committee will discuss this matter with the banks and organisations representing their customers in a series of meetings in early April.  We will began with opening remarks from Mr. Prasifka.  Following that, members may put questions to the Financial Services Ombudsman.</p><p>  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in respect of a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p></speech>

I understand the committee wants primarily to discuss the bi-annual review the office published last week, but I am happy to answer questions any other questions they have about my role as Financial Services Ombudsman and the workings of the bureau.</p><p>  The Financial Services Ombudsman Bureau was established in 2005.  Before that, there were two voluntary schemes, the Insurance Ombudsman of Ireland and Ombudsman for Credit Institutions.  Those were amalgamated and placed on a statutory footing.  The bureau was established to adjudicate complaints from &ldquo;eligible consumers&rdquo; against &ldquo;regulated financial service providers&rdquo;, FSPs.  It provides an impartial, alternative dispute resolution service.  It is neither an industry nor a consumer advocate, nor is it a court.  Our fundamental role of is to determine disputes impartially and in an informal manner.  The establishing legislation provides that the office deals with complaints &ldquo;efficiently&rdquo; and &ldquo;effectively&rdquo;, adjudicates complaints &ldquo;fairly&rdquo;, and deals with complaints in an &ldquo;informal&rdquo; and &ldquo;expeditious&rdquo; manner.  We are funded entirely by a levy on the industry.  We receive no funds from the Exchequer.  We do not charge consumers for making a complaint to us.</p><p>  The ombudsman operates in a larger institutional framework.  We adjudicate complaints based largely upon the contractual agreements which the parties have in place, but in the context of the relevant legal principles and statutory provisions, including our own establishing legislation, various codes laid down by the Central Bank and other general legal principles.  We adjudicate complaints but they do not establish legal precedents.  If we come across any complaints that raise matters of systemic concern, we bring them to the attention of the Central Bank, with which we have a very open and productive relationship.  The Central Bank has the powers to deal with FSPs on systemic issues.  Our role is clear.  We adjudicate complaints based upon the individual merits of each such complaint.</p><p>  The most recent review, issued last week, contains a great deal of information about us and some of the highlights.  In the second half of 2013, complaints were down by 35% on the previous period, the first half of the year.  However, as the Chairman stated, the number of complaints requiring full investigation increased by 8% during the year.  The reason for this is simple to explain.  Complaints that come in go through a screening process.  Information is obtained, decisions on jurisdiction are made and then a complaint proceeds to full investigation.  The changes we implemented took place only in the first four months of the year.  Therefore, the knock-on effect of fewer complaints to a decrease in complaints going into investigation will obviously be subject to some time lag.  That explains part of it.</p><p>  Another explanation for it is that many of the complaints that were not received, because of changes we made, perhaps were complaints that would never have gone to full investigation in the first place.  The simple explanation is that the dichotomy is not surprising.  We will have to see how the new process works over time.  There is some possibility that, over time as complaints go down, there should be some decrease in complaints going into investigation.  It is too early to tell.  We noticed during this period that complaints handling by FSPs improved generally, with the largest noticeable improvement occurring in the banking sector.  The largest source of complaints continued to be about payment protection insurance, PPI, and mortgages.  The sale of PPI made up 45% of all insurance complaints and mortgage issues accounted for approximately half of all banking complaints.</p><p>  As we noted in the bi-annual review, the changes in complaint trends in this period, which we had not observed in previous periods, require some further explanation.  The main driver of these changes was the changes we introduced on 1 September 2013.  On that day we tightened up our procedures in terms of accepting complaints, which we now do only where there is evidence that the substance of the complaint has been communicated to the FSP and the FSP has been given a reasonable opportunity to respond.  This new procedure more closely aligns our operations with the relevant statutory provisions.  We have always sought to do everything possible to facilitate greater engagement by the FSPs with their own customers.  We have seen much more engagement in the most recent period than before, and this is a positive development.</p><p>  Also on 1 September 2013, we acquired the ability to provide information in our review about the complaints record of individual FSPs.  In previous reviews all the information was aggregated across product lines, industries and other groupings of complaints.</p> <p>The public would know whether banking or mortgage complaints were up or down but they would not know against whom the complaints were made or against whom they were upheld.  That has changed.</p><p> It has been our experience that this additional reporting power has led to an increased interest by the financial service providers in the work of the bureau and greater initiative on their behalf to engage with customers and settle complaints, which obviates the need for the bureau to issue findings in some cases.  We again see this a positive development and its medium and longer-term significance remains to be seen.</p><p> This month I will have been the Financial Services Ombudsman for four years.  This is my first appearance before an Oireachtas committee in that role.  When I took up the position I knew we had an important job to do.  I sought to build on the work established by the bureau in its first five years of operation.  I believed at the time - and I believe more firmly now - that if we in the bureau do our job effectively, it should have the effect of raising standards throughout the industry, FSPs should learn from the findings we issue and adjust their behaviour and, in time, we should begin to see an improved performance in complaints handling from the FSPs.  The most recent review is the first time that it would be fair to note that some improvement in the performance of FSPs has been recorded.  I will be pleased to take members' questions.</p></speech>

How are systemic complaints dealt with by his office?  What happens when the ombudsman upholds a systemic complaint against a financial institution?  I refer, in particular, to tracker mortgages and the misselling of payment protection insurance, PPI.  For example, borrowers who were entitled to tracker mortgages when their fixed rate period ended were not offered the tracker rate because the bank said it did not provide the product anymore but the understanding when they went on the fixed rate was that the tracker rate would be restored as per the original agreement.  I understand the ombudsman dismissed the defence by the banks and told them to return the borrowers to the tracker rate.  What happens after that regarding systemic complaints?  Does the ombudsman tell the bank to review all such cases or only the cases that come to his attention?  If there are five complainants against a bank, is it only those five cases that are dealt with even though 5,000 people may be in the same position?  Has the ombudsman the power to instruct the banks to deal with all cases or must they just deal with the cases the office has addressed?  While I understand all the cases must be dealt with individually, if the ombudsman rules on a principle such as in this case or on a particular wording, can that be applied to other cases?</p></speech>

One of the big issues then was breaker fees relating to these mortgages.  Then the issue arose of the entitlement to trackers in circumstances in which the Chairman outlined where a party takes out a tracker mortgage and goes on to a fixed rate before coming off it to find that the tracker has been withdrawn to the public.  Currently, in our work we do not see as many mortgage complaints about trackers as we did.  Most of the complaints relate to the mortgage arrears process.  With regard to tracker mortgages, when we first took jurisdiction over these cases and began to decide on them, we noticed some financial institutions were learning from our decisions.  We had made decisions where people were entitled to tracker rates.  Our basic methodology is the subject of a High Court case, which has been appealed to the Supreme Court, but, as the High Court judge properly noted, we take the view that if someone is on a tracker rate and there are circumstances in which the bank asserts he or she is not entitled to it, the underlying documentation has to be clear and understandable to a layman.  That is our methodology and the court upheld our decision in that case to put someone back on a tracker mortgage.  That case in on appeal to the Supreme Court.</p><p>  The simple answer to the Chairman's question on our jurisdiction is that our decisions are legally binding on the parties to the complaint.  They are binding on the complainant and the regulated financial service provider.  They do not create a precedent but in circumstances where we believe the issue is much larger than applies to the parties in a case, whether it relates to tracker rates or any other area, that is the kind of case we refer to the Central Bank.  The bank has the powers to investigate the companies and to look back in terms of all their documentation.  It has other powers, including levying fines, and the ultimate power is to revoke someone's licence.  Our power is simply limited to issuing a decision that is binding on the parties in a case and our decisions are legally binding.</p></speech>

If I had to give an estimate, it is probably something we do a half dozen times a year.</p><p>  The Chairman asked whether we are happy with the Central Bank's response.  We are the ombudsman and we have an open relationship with the bank.  We give the staff there a great deal of information.  They have all the information on our complaints trends and against whom we are upholding complaints.  It is entirely appropriate that they have that.  It is a matter for themselves what they do with it.  I assume they use it to prioritise their own work to assist them in targeting areas.  Where the Financial Services Ombudsman is of great use in the entire regulatory framework is we can become the early warning system.  We see some problems before anyone else does but I cannot come before the committee and give an evaluation of what the Central Bank does with the information.</p></speech>

It may have been that the providers might not have complied with the code fully.  There are various specific steps they need to go through.  If we felt they had not allowed the complainant due process going through this, we will partly uphold it and send them back to a particular step to redo that step.</p><p>  Of all the complaints we received, we could see a trend coming through where people were potentially coming into us where they may have thought a write-down would be involved or they could get some different outcome at the end of it.  We are allowed to look at the process of the mortgage arrears resolution process.  We cannot get involved in the contractual arrangement between the provider and the complainant.  We have notices on our website and we let the complainant know at the outset that is all we can do.  That is our jurisdiction.  The complainant can then make a decision whether to proceed with that complaint.  During 2013, approximately 42% of the complaints that came through did not come back to us again.  Many people are not happy with the repayment terms or various other things but they did not actually proceed with those complaints.</p></speech>

The figure seems to be getting smaller.  There could be different reasons.  Perhaps we have wonderfully behaving financial institutions or perhaps, as the Financial Services Ombudsman's report seems to indicate, it wants the financial institutions engaging with the complaining customer at an earlier stage.  Therefore, they are not coming across the Financial Services Ombudsman's desk and it does not deal with them.</p><p>  One of the significant changes is that if three complaints are upheld against a particular financial institution, the Financial Services Ombudsman gets to publish that.  Avoiding publication may well be an incentive for banks to get the matter dealt with.  Is it possible that the publication of offending institutions is being distorted by people coming into negotiations or mediation earlier?  Should we review the publication of inappropriate behaviour?  If a bank mis-sells a product to me or there is some error with the system and I do not get to hear about a customer with the same product as mine complaining to the Financial Services Ombudsman about it and because it cannot force a precedent and a legal ruling on it, that difficulty will continue for me because I may not be aware of it if the Central Bank does not take any action.  Do we need to review the need for three offences leading to publication?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-05a.125" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. William Prasifka" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014030500005#D01100"><p>No.  Let me try to explain this.  The goal of the office is to resolve complaints fairly and expeditiously.  We try to do that.  I have always believed there is no reason for us to uphold the same complaints over and over again.  In this sense people often talk about an imbalance between the financial institutions and the customer.  In this sense of course there is, because the provider knows from interaction with us what kinds of complaints we will uphold.  Therefore, if we have a consistent message of what should be done, and the banks and insurance companies are doing this, we believe that is a very important service for us to provide.</p><p>  I will give one example of how this works in practice.  Last summer, as members will recall, Ulster Bank had a breakdown of its systems.  For many people for two weeks they had no banking systems.  They could not get money from the ATMs and their direct debits were not working.  This affected up to 500,000 customers.  When Ulster Bank representatives came to us, we were able to show them a printout of the banking account complaints we had upheld in the previous 18 months.  We pointed out to them how we deal with such things.  If missing a direct debit results in someone's insurance policy lapsing or credit rating being affected, we expect the institution to rectify expeditiously everything that has been done, reverse the direct debit, wipe out all the charges, make whatever amendments are needed to the credit record and provide some element of compensation for the aggravation and stress.  They knew all this.  We told them they needed to deal with their customers.  They knew what our methodology would be.</p><p>  Let us consider Ulster Bank's complaint record for the second half of the year.  In terms of accounts, it had two complaints that were partly substantiated.  The reason is as follows.  While we had received complaints, our experience was that all of its complaints were dealt with in this area in a manner consistent with our previous methodologies.  The only complaints that came through to us for final adjudication were ones where there was a complete mismatch between the expectation of the consumer and what we were prepared to give by way of compensation.</p><p>  We then need to ask what the best way forward is.  If we were not transparent in the way that we dealt with these cases and if we were not giving clear signals to the providers, they would have no ability to resolve these cases.  They would not have any instructions.  Therefore, yes, we would receive many more complaints and we would uphold many more complaints.  However, is that better customer service?  I hold the view that an important part of our job, as I said in my opening contribution, is that if we can do our job, we should be lifting the standards throughout the industry, sending it very clear signals.  Going beyond the figures, we know that since we got these powers on 1 September, the institutions have a renewed interest in what we do.  They are anxious to align their methodologies with ours in a way that we had not seen previously.  I regard that as a very positive development.</p><p>  I believe we should keep the current system.  We need to see how it works over time.  We have questions over the knock-on effects, but what is very clear to us by both our experience with the providers and looking at the complaints outturn is that the effect of the additional powers we have has certainly raised the profile of complaint handling in the institutions.  We think this is a very positive development.</p></speech>

Of course it is accurate to state the experience of PPI in the UK is very different from the experience here.  In the UK upwards of 400,000 complaints are received per annum, which is a huge difference.  We have not seen this level of complaint.  One reason for this is we report on complaints trends and we are not an industry advocate or apologist.  Some people have speculated there was a different business model of sale in the UK.  I state no opinion on this.  I just look at the complaints experience here, which is quite different.</p></speech>

Each complaint is examined individually so just because one has been examined does not mean a precedent applies across all of them.  Each complaint must stand on its own.  We examine whether there was contractual evidence the customer knew what he or she was stepping into and that it was an optional product.  We adjudicate our findings based on this.  In many cases through our investigations we found contractual evidence to show the provider and customer engaged at the very outset and that the customer knew what he or she was getting into, which is why they are not upheld.</p></speech>

International comparisons are sometimes very helpful but in comparisons between us and the UK, what must be understood is the Irish model and our operations are completely different from those in the UK.  We operate with a very high level of formality.  The UK operates with a high level of informality.  The UK strives to have many decisions made on a preliminary basis but we have no ability to do this and we must go to a final determination.  Many of the UK determinations and decisions are kept very brief and are on one page.  I have signed determinations which go to 10,000 words or 20,000 words.  We operate with a completely different level of judicial oversight than in the UK and this drives many of our procedures.  We have had some intervention from the courts on the legal standards which must be used, and this guides us and we must learn from it.</p></speech>

If we have a standard which requires a mini-finding, this will also have resource implications and will also perhaps cause delay in reaching a final determination.  What must also be kept in mind is it must be considered in a larger framework.  The consumer protection code requires financial institutions to keep records for six years so if we are to look beyond this, it must be taken into account.  If we are faced with a complaint relating to matters which took place not six years ago but ten years ago or longer, it puts us in a difficult position if the basic evidentiary material is not available, such as if people are claiming their rights under a contract or policy which no one has or can find, and this must be considered.  As I stated, it is very appropriate that we examine this matter and whatever the Oireachtas comes up with, I assure the committee we will adjudicate complaints on the basis of it in as fair a way as possible.</p></speech>

The typical insurance complaint we receive, whether with regard to payment protection, home or motor insurance, is the claim was not paid and the claim only arose recently.  The question which must be examined is the reason for this.  The difficulty we have is if the reason given is that the policy was missold, we must go back to the sale, and if it is beyond the six year rule, we cannot deal with it.  What we can do is deal with the issue of whether the policy was administered according to its terms and conditions, but if this is not the complaint, and the complaint is missale which took place more than six years ago, we have no legal ability to examine it.</p></speech>

Where that happens, where a complainant makes us aware that the direction in a finding has not been complied with, the first thing we do is write to the provider telling them we expect them to comply.  If they do not respond we indicate that if they do not comply that we have the ability to issue proceedings.  There have been occasions in which we have gone into court seeking to enforce our judgments.  By and large, they are cases of smaller providers, some of whom were in liquidation, receivership or have trading difficulties.</p></speech>

In those circumstances we contact the liquidator and take all reasonable steps to ensure that the direction is complied with but at the end of the day, our direction only goes to the provider.  If that provider does not exist any more, there is nothing that we or the complainant can do.</p></speech>

I shall move on to the two areas that stand out.  Clearly, they are the mortgage arrears which make up 50% of all banking complaints and the sale of payment protection which makes up 45% to 50% of all insurance complaints.  It is clear from the complaints that AIB had 24 complaints published, where they had three or more for the period 1 September to the end of December.  Of the 24, nine related to mortgages, approximately 40%.</p> <p>Some 50% of all complaints in relation to Ulster Bank were mortgage related and approximately two thirds of all complaints in relation to Bank of Scotland were mortgage related.  Perhaps Mr. Prasifka might elaborate on the reason the level of complaints in respect of both of those institutions were so high.  For example, only two of the 12 complaints in relation to Permanent TSB were mortgage related and two of the 14 in relation to Bank of Ireland were mortgage related.  In regard to AIB, nine of the 24 complaints, or 40%, were mortgage related, ten of the 15, or two thirds, of complaints in regard to Bank of Scotland were mortgage related and seven of the 15 complaints in relation to Ulster Bank were mortgage related.  Perhaps Mr. Prasifka would explain the reason for that.</p></speech>

I will put it in my context and then we can take it from there.  We have found that in particular areas some providers are better than others.  In regard to the mortgage arrears process, given the number of people in mortgage arrears we had identified this as a big area even before we started receiving complaints.  As the financial institutions were coming to talk to us about what they could do to improve their records, we knew mortgage arrears was going to be a big area.  We noticed when we first began to receive these complaints - they only started coming into us last year - that some providers were doing better than others.  The code of conduct on mortgage arrears requires that institutions go through a certain protocol and memorialise every step of what they are doing.  Some institutions were doing this better than others.</p></speech>

Reference was made earlier to the financial ombudsman in Britain and so on and there was a line of questioning in relation to PPIs.  I would like to focus on mortgages and credit availability and the complaints upheld in Britain and the North of Ireland in relation to two financial institutions that are the dominant financial institutions in this State.  I raise this issue because it appears that complaints to the ombudsman in Britain are in the main being upheld while here the opposite is the case.  For example, in regard to AIB five complaints have been substantiated and 23 have been partially substantiated.  In regard to Bank of Ireland, six complaints have been substantiated and 13 have been partially substantiated.  We know from the case studies outlined earlier what is meant by partially substantiated.  However, in respect of Bank of Ireland in Britain 19%, or 38, of the 190 complaints made during the last quarter of last year in relation to mortgages were upheld.  In regard to banking and credit, at least 55 complaints were upheld.  Leaving aside insurance, close to 90 cases in one quarter were upheld in Britain.  Here, only six cases in one quarter were upheld.  The percentages are very low.  We are all aware of the dominant space which Bank of Ireland has here.  Is it that the bank is better behaved in Ireland than it is in Britain or is it the case that we are applying different rules or that the way in which the Ombudsman's office here is set up is different?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-05a.224" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. William Prasifka" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014030500008#G02100"><p>As I indicated previously, we are familiar with the UK financial ombudsman service.  We have a very good relationship with it and participate in many exchanges and activities with it.  As such I am very familiar with its methodologies.  It operates completely differently than we do.  It has a high degree of informality and is not subject to any judicial review in the same way as the Irish Financial Services Ombudsman.  It does not operate according to the same degree of legal formality.  We largely apply legal principles and stray from those, as we are entitled to do under our legislation, only where we believe there is substantial reason to do so and are able to clearly set those out in a transparent way.  The British office operates a high level of informal decision-making whereas our decision-making is very formal.  There appears to be an alignment of our methodologies in many cases which the financial institutions are taking on board, which we do not see in the UK.  For example, it has been dealing with the payment protection insurance issue for some time.  I find difficult to understand why, when the financial institutions in Britain know what the outcome will be, they are not settling their cases.  The one thing I have learned from being an ombudsman is that much is dependent on the culture and legal system of each jurisdiction.  It is fair to say that the way in which we do things and the outcome is very different in Ireland than it is in the UK.</p></speech>

The amending legislation does not give us the power to do that.  We publish percentage cases we uphold across institutions.  That is very different from the UK.</p></speech>

As I have said, the figure for AIB and Bank of Ireland is 29% and 21%, and that takes in mortgages rather than insurance.  Mr. Prasifka recently hit out strongly at elements of the Judiciary in this State.  There is a statutory function in the office and one must consider separation of powers.  Mr. Prasifka mentioned the legally binding nature of the office, which is important.  One decision has been struck down by the courts and Mr. Prasifka felt it important to speak out about that and to challenge the Government about what it wanted to do with his office, as it could not have oral hearings in all cases.  That is not what the Judiciary suggested.  Does Mr. Prasifka seek amendments to the legislation because his office, as a statutory body, cannot ignore the rulings of the courts?  Should there be amendments to the legislation that would prevent the office from having to hold an oral hearing in certain cases, such as the example before the courts?</p></speech>

To be very clear, we have been highlighting in cases before the Judiciary that there have been two separate lines of decisions from the High Court.  Some decisions state quite clearly that the decision as to whether to hold an oral hearing falls within our jurisdiction as the ombudsman, and when we make a decision it can be set aside only for rather exceptional reasons.  The second alternative view, which is also stated clearly, is that the decision to hold an oral hearing does not fall within our jurisdiction, and therefore it is something that potentially can be set aside for lesser reasons by the Judiciary.  Our experience in the past 18 months, looking at just the number of cases, is that the first view, which is that the decision to hold an oral hearing is within our jurisdiction, is perhaps the more dominant view.  Whatever the courts decide on this issue, it is something we as a statutory body can only comply with it.</p></speech>

I am not saying the office was wrong but it felt it important enough to challenge that position.  There was also talk that parliamentarians such as ourselves - although the office was more focused on the Government - could shut down the agency if that is the direction we go.  Why would it not seek clarification in legislation on the issue of oral hearings?</p></speech>

That is the road we have taken.  To correct the Deputy, he referred to the most "recent" decision.  The most recent decision reported in the media indicated the second view that the oral hearing was not within our jurisdiction.  The most recent case, which unfortunately was not reported, took the opposite view that it was within our jurisdiction.  It is quite simple.  We are an alternative dispute resolution mechanism and we already operate with a high degree of legal formality.  If we are pushed in the direction of having more formality, we will reach a point where the fundamental ability of the office to carry out its mandate comes into question.</p></speech>

There is a major debate regarding IBRC and across much of the political divide there is frustration at the idea that the bank is selling its mortgage book to unregulated institutions.  An element of the debate is that people will not have recourse to the financial ombudsman.  My party has called for the sale to be suspended but the mortgage holders would still not have recourse to the financial ombudsman even in that case.  That is a position disputed by the Minister for Finance.  I have a letter from Mr. Prasifka's office to an IBRC mortgage holder, and it is points out that sections in the relevant Act mean the office is prevented from examining the issue.  I also have a reply to a parliamentary question from the Minister for Finance indicating that he has been advised that the Financial Services Ombudsman is not precluded from investigating complaints by mortgage holders against IBRC due to the Act.  Has the matter been discussed with the Minister for Finance?  Why is such a restrictive approach being taken?  If the legal advice for the Minister for Finance is that the office can deal with the issue, why not do so and let the State-owned IBRC challenge the office?  The only party which could challenge the office is a State institution but the Minister is on the D&aacute;il record as saying that will not happen.</p></speech>

At the time we had 17 complaints in front of us, and the legislation clearly states there is a stay on all legal proceedings, which under the IBRC legislation includes any form of legally binding dispute resolution.  That fits us to a tee.  We took the view then, as we have it now, that there is a stay on proceedings.  We cannot deal with these unless the stay is lifted.  We have no objection to having any stay lifted.  There are 17 complaints in the context of thousands, so they are not the issue; the issue is what is the ombudsman, and there is a disagreement about whether we are a regulatory authority.  Simply put, we are not a regulatory authority for very simple reasons.  One can go to the 2005 Act or the 2004 Central Bank Act which established us, which defines "regulatory authority" as what was then the Financial Regulator and which is now subsumed into the Central Bank.  That was not done for a trivial reason but rather to establish a clear separation between the regulator and the Ombudsman.  We adjudicate complaints and the regulator has a different function, as it makes rules, can investigate companies and can fine or take licences from bodies.  It is very important that we are not a regulatory authority for our independence, which is fundamental.</p><p>  We receive many complaints from many angry people, who may be angry for very good reasons.  The question may be "why would we trust you?".  People might think we are just like everybody else, as we come from the same-----</p></speech>

The only party which could challenge the office hearing the complaints is IBRC, which is owned by the State.

I will finish my point.  It is very important that we are not a regulatory authority because if we were, it would undermine the independence of the office.  Anybody making a complaint would ask why he or she would trust us, as we would be the regulator, ensuring the banks and insurance companies are solvent.  We would be asked why we would ever decide anything against them.  We operate in a jurisdiction with a high degree of legal oversight.</p> <p>What would happen if the courts took the view that we are a regulator?  How would they look at our procedures?  We are supposed to operate informally and expeditiously, but then somebody appeals a decision saying, "They are a regulator.  They must have an entirely new set of procedures".  The reason we took that view is that, first, it is firmly grounded in the legislation and, second, to take any other view would, I believe, act as a significant threat to the future of this office.  I was not prepared to do that.</p></speech>

That report would give the public information as to what AIB, Bank of Ireland or any other financial institution might be doing.  I offered the example of a bank which might have moved its customers from tracker mortgages to variable rate mortgages and the ombudsman upheld three decisions where that was wrong on the part of the institution.  I said the ombudsman should be able to say that in the case of AIB, for example, three claims were upheld and should further be able to say that not only was it just mortgages, but it was about tracker rates.  The reason is, and there was a lengthy discussion on this in the House, that it informs the public so people can check their documentation to see if they should make a complaint to the ombudsman.  The Minister accepted the premise and put forward an amendment, No. 77.  He said it was the considered view that there had been a response to Committee Stage proceedings and the need to free up the opportunity for the Financial Services Ombudsman to describe such complaints in his report, and there was no difficulty around that.  He went on to say that the amendment-----</p></speech>

There is a statutory instrument which sets out the level of detail we are allowed to give in respect of financial providers.  It simply indicates what we have done, which is to set out the providers, to divide it between banking, insurance and investments and to further break it down by the various sub-groups which we had in the previous bi-annual reviews.

He said he provides an impartial alternative dispute resolution, ADR, process.  I assume that in using the word &quot;impartial&quot; he means a fair dispute resolution process.  I will frame my questions around that ADR process.  The perspective I bring to it is that of somebody who has worked within another ADR process.  The witness said when responding in a law conference in Dublin that his was one of the most powerful ombudsman offices in the world and that he could award compensation of up to &euro;250,000 and that his findings were legally binding.  I assume that is legally binding subject to the High Court on a point of law or subject to judicial review.  Clearly, the witness has a significant power in the context of alternative dispute resolution.</p><p>  I will outline my concerns.  First, I noted that the witness accredited the fall in the number of complaints to the fact that he is now asking applicants to give him evidence that they have communicated the substance of their complaint to the original financial service provider, FSP, and that the FSP has been given a reasonable opportunity to respond.  Having practised as a solicitor, I am conscious of the fact that there is a very significant difference, in most instances, in the capacity of somebody dealing with a financial institution and the capacity of that financial institution.  That is the reason there is the <i>contra proferentum</i> rule in law.  In other words, the contract should be constructed against the person who drafts it where there is any issue of unfairness.  I am concerned with the statement that the substance of a complaint must be communicated.  How high a bar is that level of communication?  Does he offer any assistance to people who are making complaints to financial service providers to enable them to make an adequate complaint?  That is the first part of one question.</p></speech>

It relates to the holding of oral hearings.  I listened to the witness's response to Deputy Doherty.  My concern is from a different perspective.  I note the courts criticised the fact that oral hearings were not held.  In that instance, it related to the complexity of the complaint.  Many individuals who approach the ombudsman's office might have difficulties, including difficulties in communicating.  As the Financial Services Ombudsman does not provide the service of an oral hearing, I assume all of the business is done through the exchange of documents.  In my experience of dispute resolution processes, that is extremely difficult for people with low levels of education, for the sake of argument, or who have difficulties with language and so forth.  How does the ombudsman try to balance the field for somebody who is trying to deal with his office when complaining about a financial institution?  He said he operates on a very high level of formality, so how does he try to level the playing field here?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-05a.250" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. William Prasifka" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014030500010#J01600"><p>The first question was about how high the bar is before we will entertain a complaint and what level of service we provide for somebody at the initial stage.  As I said our objectives are to be informal, expeditious, fair and accessible.  That is a very important part and an important distinction.  We are accessible.  People come to us and the only thing they know is that they have lost money, their investments have gone down or perhaps their insurance claim has not been paid.  That is all they know.  We engage with them at the initial stage.  We do not expect them to do anything more than to give us the information they have.  It might be their policy, their terms and conditions or their exchanges with the financial service provider.  In terms of framing the complaint, putting it into a legal framework, looking up the relevant provisions of the consumer protection code and looking up the relevant provisions of law, those are the things we do.</p><p>  In terms of accepting a complaint and my comment that we look for the substance of the complaint to have been given to the provider and the provider to have been given a reasonable opportunity to respond, that is doing nothing more than repeating what is in the legislation.  As to how high the bar is, we do not think it should be a bar at all.  We have people at the initial stage to take people through the process.  Let us be very clear here.  Sometimes people say we are putting words in their mouths.  We are not doing that.  We are putting it into a structure that can allow us to have adjudication.  We think that is working reasonably well.</p><p>  Second, with regard to the point about oral hearings, we hold more oral hearings now than we ever have because of legal direction.  I believe we will continue to do that.  The oral hearings have a high degree of formality.  What do we do to balance it?</p> <p>It is very simple.  There was an oral hearing a few weeks ago at which an individual represented himself against a provider that had a full legal team.  In these circumstances the burden falls on me, as ombudsman, to cross-examine the witnesses for the provider.  We tried to make it as sympathetic a setting as possible and I was there to hear what the complainant had to say and ensure the questioning by the provider was fair.  It was my job to bring out what evidence I thought should come from the complainant, as well as to cross-examine the bank's providers.  Obviously, my role is quite different in circumstances where both parties are legally represented.</p><p> I am seriously concerned about moving to an ombudsman scheme under which there will be more oral hearings.  By comparison, my counterparts in the United Kingdom, for example, do not have oral hearings of the same kind.  When one reaches that level of formality, there is an imbalance; therefore, we must become more proactive during the actual hearing and process.  For example, we had one case in which the complainants had great difficulty, were in substantial financial distress and inexperienced, but they were also deaf.  We brought in sign language interpreters.</p></speech>

If I understood the statistics correctly, the ombudsman found in favour of 202 applicants out of a total of 7,700, which seems to be a very low figure and implies one of two things.  First, people are applying with absolutely no idea of what they are applying for and have no chance whatsoever of winning.  Perhaps they should be told this from the outset, rather than allowing them to engage in the process.  Alternatively, the low level suggests something is wrong with the system.  I will briefly focus on the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  The ombudsman has indicated that over 50% of cases revolved around mortgages, to some extent or other.  He has said 81% related to mortgage arrears resolutions processes and that he can only judge on the basis of a contractual arrangement.  Therefore, it seems that there are some serious difficulties with the protection offered by the code of conduct on mortgage arrears if the number of findings in favour is so low.  Does he accept my view?  As he mentioned in his evidence, he has made proposals to the Central Bank about cases that he feels should be brought to its attention.  With regard to the mortgage arrears resolution, CCMA, process, is he at liberty to tell us what improvements he has recommended to the Central Bank?</p></speech>

The Senator is right that the figures speak for themselves.  In the most recent period we did not uphold 78% of the complaints made.  Why is that figure so high?  A lot of complaints are driven by anger and frustration.  As I said, there has been a paradigm shift in the country.  It used to be the case that a bank manager was someone who garnered a combination of respect and awe from the local community such that people were reluctant to make complaints.  We are now in an entirely different situation.  A lot of people are suffering from financial distress, which drives a lot of complaints.  We have seen some institutions taken our methodologies on board such that they know which complaints to settle and which to allow go forward.  Let me outline an important part of the service provided by my office.  When someone makes a complaint, he or she may know little about the underlying situation, other than he or she does not like the outcome and insurance was not paid.  We must explain everything to him or her such, including the policy, what he or she was told and what his or her reasonable expectations were.  This is an important service to provide.  Complaints are not going to change significantly until the economy changes, but we can lay the groundwork now to try to restore confidence in the sector.</p></speech>

A question was asked about whether the Central Bank was notified when systemic errors or a broad range of similar difficulties were identified.  The flipside of the argument is where the ombudsman receives many complaints about the same issue but does not uphold the cases made.  There may be a lot of people who think there are grounds for a grievance, but the process has been dealt and it has been found that there are no grounds for a grievance on that issue.  Does the ombudsman post this information on his office's website?  Is there a way to obtain this information?</p></speech>

Does it have any role in alerting the Central Bank or the Government to problems or injustices that may not be illegal or outside the regulations but that any reasonable person might consider to be a problem?  Does the Financial Services Ombudsman have any role in that area?</p></speech>

There is also a wider remit in terms of upholding complaints.  We do not adjudicate on the basis of legal technicality.  That is provided for in the Act, which also provides we can uphold a complaint if the conduct complained of was in accordance with law or established regulatory practice but was otherwise unreasonable, unjust, oppressive or improperly discriminatory in its application to the complainant.  We have always taken that to mean we have a more broader equitable jurisdiction in terms of deciding complaints.  This analysis is also reflected in the consumer protection code, which requires the provider to get to know the customer and give the customer suitable products.  This is a more equitable type of jurisdiction.  We have a more equitable jurisdiction in deciding complaints but Deputy Boyd Barrett asked a different question about us advising the Central Bank and the Government about broader issues.</p><p>  Properly working, the Financial Services Ombudsman could be part of the early warning system of the financial services sector.  Many issues first emerge in terms of the Government framework with us.  That is why we have an open relationship with the Central Bank and we bring it to the attention of the Central Bank when we feel it appropriate.</p></speech>

Mr. Prasifka places an emphasis on the difference between the formal and informal approach of the office as opposed to the UK office.  From the statistics, it appears the formal approach leads to a lower level of complaints being upheld while informal leaves to a higher level of complaints being upheld.  If I understand the statistics correctly, the ombudsman in Britain upholds more complaints, which appears to be linked to the fact that it is more informal.  If I am correct, Mr. Prasifka seems to be concerned that he is being pushed in a direction that is too formal.  The further we go down that road, the more problematic it becomes.  Should we move to a more informal approach?  The informal approach appears to favour the complainant more.</p></speech>

There are many different models throughout the State and in other jurisdictions.  Looking at them all across the spectrum of formality, some have low jurisdictional limits and operate very informally.  In some cases, the jurisdictional award can be a few hundred euro.  As far as I am aware, we operate the most formal form of dispute resolution in the entire world.  That is simply a fact.</p></speech>

Can Mr. Prasifka elaborate on what informal means in the context of the alternative model that operates in Britain?</p></speech>

Many decisions could be made on a preliminary basis, where people come in and we give them a preliminary view on where they are going.  Second, in terms of the actual proceedings, there is no requirement to hold a formal hearing with each ombudsman having discretion on how to decide cases.  They could decide cases through people coming into a room and having a chat, with no stenographer and no lawyers.  It can be done quite informally.  As someone who has spoken out in the area, I must say that we need a word of caution.  With a high degree of informality, it is much more difficult to come up with a predictable and transparent decision-making process.  Our primary goal is to decide cases fairly.  If we can do so in a transparent and predictable way, we can raise standards within the financial services industry.  The operators will know what to expect.  If we become very informal, what we gain through ease of decision-making, we may lose in terms of its effect on the industry.</p></speech>

It is the difference between sorting out cases with the Department at the level of the clinic and pushing for policy change.  It is an interesting balance.  Perhaps we can have a bit of both.  Perhaps there could be an informal starting point.  If it does not work or if it is not appropriate, there can be a higher threshold of formality.</p></speech>

We have had limited success in doing so because we can catch a lot of cases that are appropriate to fast-track but the question is how to avoid including in that collection cases where it is not appropriate to deal with them on that level.</p></speech>

That is something to be examined.</p><p>  There are two areas I want to ask about in respect of the volume of complaints.  In respect of reckless lending, there is no legal prohibition and no category of reckless lending.  Some of us argue there should be.  Did the Financial Services Ombudsman receive many complaints about reckless lending, which is something that may be hard to prove?  In many of the cases I have heard about, it amounted to a bank manager or someone selling loans in a bank saying that it is a good deal and that people should get on board.  That is difficult to prove.  Were there many complaints in the area?</p><p>  There was uproar in England about RBS and Lloyds and what they did with their restructuring divisions for small business, with claims that, in order to maximise the money they could get back on loans that were in trouble to businesses that were generally held to be viable by the people in the businesses, the banks put massive pressure on the small businesses to liquidate assets.  This amounted to doing things to effectively close down the business so that the banks could get back the money.  Is this something the Financial Services Ombudsman came across?  One person told me that the global restructuring division of Ulster Bank is essentially trying to put him out of business.</p> <p>They were getting direct rental revenue and they were holding back VAT which should have gone to the Revenue Commissioners and were going into people's personal ---</p></speech>

Second, I have to say that in my experience over four years, the number of cases of complaints of reckless lending is less than one can count on one hand.  It is not an issue that has driven complaints.  In terms of small businesses, restructuring and issues that have come up in the United Kingdom, our jurisdiction is limited to eligible consumers, namely persons in companies with a turnover of &euro;3 million or less.  Therefore, larger businesses cannot make a complaint to the Ombudsman.  In my experience, we have not seen this as a significant source of complaints.  I cannot say it has not happened but it is certainly not something which comes to us in any great volume.</p></speech>

The bank suggested that they had taken it out themselves but they were adamant that they had not done so.  They had been customers of the bank for many years, both were working and were in a different part of the country at the time that the money was withdrawn.  They lived in Dublin and the money was taken out somewhere in Limerick.  They made a complaint but it was not upheld.  It would appear from this case that it comes down to one person's word against another's.  We know there are mechanisms through which cameras taking photographs of people inputting their PIN can lead to money being taken out of people's account without their knowledge.  What if someone cannot prove it one way or another?  How does the Ombudsman deal with a case like that?  If the Ombudsman does not uphold such a complaint because there is no evidence to prove the case one way or the other, is there somewhere else such people can go?  These people feel that their good name has been impugned because the suggestion implicit in the decision is that they must have taken out their own money and then tried to con the bank.</p></speech>

If I happen to be browsing on the Internet and I see that there were 11 partially substantiated rulings against Bank of Ireland, nine against Irish Life, 19 against Allied Irish Bank and so forth and I am a customer of one of those institutions, how would I go about finding out whether the complaints that were upheld might also apply to me?</p></speech>

That is as much detail as we are allowed to give.  We cannot go down into the detail of the specific issues.  We looked at the themes coming through the review.  As we have discussed this afternoon, the themes related to payment protection insurance and the mortgage arrears process.  For the first time in our bi-annual review we have put some cases at the back and they demonstrate where findings were upheld, partly upheld and the type of complaints coming through.

My question relates to the six-year time limit.  Will Mr. Prasifka indicate how many complaints he gets, the sectors to which the complaints refer and how many he will have to refuse to hear because of the six-year time limit?  I understand there is a time limit in respect of all complaints.</p><p>  A number of members dealt with the IBRC.  The liquidators and the Department of Finance appeared before the committee last week.  It is indeterminate as to where the IBRC loan book will end up and all we know is that the phase 2 bidders have agreed to a voluntary code of conduct, but it may not develop to phase 3.  The loan book could end up in NAMA and not be sold.  Bearing in mind Mr. Prasifka's earlier comments, if the loan book is taken over by NAMA or an organisation that has agreed to a voluntary code of conduct, will he be able to hear complaints about them?</p></speech>

As a part of our process every single complainant and provider is offered mediation.  We have trained mediators within the office but it is rarely taken up.  We fully accept the fact that by the time a complaint comes to the Office of the Financial Services Ombudsman, the parties are too far apart for mediation.  It has always been my belief that there is scope for more mediation and that providers should consider it more often.  Very often when they come in they find it is quite productive but it is never going to be a substantial source of dealing with much of our complaints.</p></speech>

I note from one of the examples, partially upheld, which was just about the processes, the substance was not upheld and that the compensation was &euro;300.  It  was referenced earlier that the Financial Services Ombudsman is a powerful institution which can impose penalties of up to &euro;0.25 million.  How is compensation calculated?  Does the office have a model for calculating the compensation?  In terms of the three strike rule, following which one can be named, how many companies have had a finding upheld either partially or substantially by the office but has not been named?  I am not asking Mr. Prasifka to name them.  How many companies such as Carphone Warehouse - I am not suggesting it is - are there where only one or two cases were upheld and, therefore, they have not been named?  Perhaps the witnesses would give the committee an idea as to whether it is just one company or two or three or four that fall into that bracket?</p></speech>

A penalty is an issue for the regulator.  We operate a system only of compensation.  In terms of dealing with the substance, if the financial provider has not lived up to its responsibilities under the consumer protection code or under various legal principles or equitable principles, the goal is to put the customer in the place he or she would have been if everything had been done. It may, therefore, mean the claim is paid on the insurance policies, that they get their money back.  It is a separate issue, apart from the economic loss about stress, inconvenience and getting the run-around, so to speak.  Within the office we have a certain protocol whereby we grade things generally up to &euro;250 to &euro;500 and &euro;500 up to &euro;1,000.  If one is getting more than &euro;1,000 in terms of stress, one is talking about things which are getting into the substance of it generally.</p></speech>

To give the providers some guidance we break out separately the substantive complaint, for example, should the claim be paid?  Let us say, we think the claim did not have to be paid, however, someone was given the wrong information or it was not dealt with expeditiously, we separate that out and, effectively, give that person a sort of customer service award.</p></speech>

The total number of complaints we substantiated for that period of time that we are allowed to declare, up to 31 December, is 42.  The total number upheld in the third and fourth quarter if we doubled up would be 84, but that is not quite right.  There is certainly another 20 odd companies.

One can understand that if one is dealing with one organisation that has one complaint upheld every ten years it could skew it.

I do not believe there is any magic number and I do not believe that the additional incremental benefit of going down to two or one complaint is demonstrable.</p></speech>

We have got the council which advises the office and sets regulations and the bureau is yourselves which furnishes this report, but this was done hand in glove.

It was quite clear from all our interactions that it took an enormous effort to get this over the line, to enable us report on individual providers.  My understanding is that this was less a case of the ombudsman and the bureau hand-in-glove, we were hand-in-glove with the Department of Finance, which guided us on what it would be appropriate to include in this report.  It was quite clear that the statutory instrument would be very prescriptive, setting out what we were permitted to do.  We drafted the report fully in anticipation of what was going to happen.</p></speech>

It is my view, and it was the Government&rsquo;s view, that the report should not describe every substantiated claim because some may be minor or insignificant and have an undue effect on the company.  Where, in Mr. Prasifka&rsquo;s opinion, it should be set out this concerns, for example, people being moved from a tracker to variable rate, that should be reported on.  Does Mr. Prasifka support that part of the legislation that allows his office to report the description of a substantiated claim?</p></speech>

Any public servant or official who is charged by the State cannot be asked whether he or she agrees with policy.  One can ask whether he or she complies with the policy.  Asking somebody whether they support the legislation is a political question.  I understand what the Deputy is saying but I have to ask him to rephrase the question.</p></speech>

Maybe you have not read the letter but it was very clear about the difference regarding examining witnesses&rsquo; positions about policy.  I will have it re-issued to you.</p></speech>

I am talking about consistency.  If you wish, Chairman, I will point out where a Senator questioned a witness about the six-year rule, with no intervention from the Chair.  It was a completely appropriate line of questioning.</p><p>  I do not intend to put Mr. Prasifka on the spot by asking whether he supports legislation or the rule of law in the State.  Does he think it would be of benefit to the office if he had the discretion to describe a substantiated claim where he or his office felt it appropriate, as the legislation allows?</p></speech>

I will answer it this way.  Generally speaking, I would support anything this office can do to make its decision-making and findings more transparent and easily available.  The UK has gone down a long road, for example, of publishing individual decisions, with the identity of the complainant redacted.  We could go further down the road.  We have tried for four years to be able to publish what we were able to publish last week.  I was extremely anxious to get that over the line, to do what we did.  I fully accept there is more to be done but one has to stand before one can walk and run.  That was a very important first step.  I am happy we got over that, we published the information, and guess what, the next day the sun rose and set.  Institutions did not collapse.  We think it has a positive effect.  Can we learn from what we did?  Can we improve?  Can we make it better?  Of course we can but it was very important to get past that first step and we did that.</p></speech>

I know my line of questioning might have been critical.  I was considering some of the challenges facing the office but I commend Mr. Prasifka.  Many of my constituents have approached the office and been dealt with speedily and kept up to date, even pending an appeal.  I commend Mr. Prasifka and wish him the best, and good luck for the future.  I hope we can take those necessary next steps together in a shorter time than it took to take the first one.</p></speech>

They have stepped into a difficult breach.  The work they do presents big challenges.  The Ombudsman is really the non-cost crushing opportunity for people who buy services from the financial institutions, have a very unhappy experience and want it sorted out.  The Ombudsman&rsquo;s objective is to be transparent within the privacy of the resolution hall, and to be fair.  That is great.  I have been there.  In the early 1990s I approached the Insurance Ombudsman on a personal matter.  One needs the patience of Job to get there with the financial institutions.</p><p>  Over the past few years, I have wondered whether the industry should not be called the financial self-services industry, rather than services industry because the institutions really put it up to their customers when things do not go right.  They are always inclined to think they cannot have an exception because if the exceptions are multiplied by their many thousands of customers they will be at Armageddon.  That is why they bring down the shield.</p></speech>

That is not good enough.</p> <p>They eventually say, "No, take your case to the financial ombudsman and you have the right to take it to the High Court."  It may be a minor matter but it is a matter of principle.  I do not think this is acceptable.  If there is a request from a complainant to be heard and the financial services provider says, "We prefer it to be dealt with on a file review basis", that is not good enough.  Even though they have been asked under freedom of information and in other ways, to produce all the evidence, I know for a fact in the case that not all the evidence is there and that evidence that had been given back to the financial institution has not surfaced for review purposes.  That is not a happy situation.  If that type of case occurs it should be an automatic full hearing situation.  If the money amount is small there is no chance of it going to the High Court and that is absurd.</p></speech>

We decide whether an oral hearing is to occur.  Occasionally some complainants have said they do not wish for an oral hearing.  One complainant said he would drop the case.  Some complainants are unable to attend because of illness and in those cases we need to act appropriately and take that into account at all points trying to deal with the situation as fairly as we possibly can.  We have had cases where the complainant has come to an oral hearing completely unprepared and at sea and intimidated by the situation.  In such a case, as the ombudsman, I must take a more proactive role in terms of cross-examining witnesses from the provider and assisting the complainant in bringing out the relevant evidence.  We are accessible but at the same time we must be fair in adjudication.</p></speech>

It was declined by the insurance ombudsman but I am a persistent person and I brought the case and the evidence to the chief executive and director of the insurance company-----</p></speech>

Is there a conflict between the legislation which informs how the ombudsman is to operate and a statutory instrument which disagrees?  The ombudsman is governed by the statutory instrument in the publication of details of individual judgments.  That situation is bizarre.</p></speech>

As I recall, the legislation provides that in circumstances where the ombudsman is directed to issue a report, the manner of publication is governed by regulations that are issued.  The legislation provides that whatever enabling provisions must be implemented by way of regulation.</p></speech>

However, I find it strange and bizarre that the legislation can allow for the ombudsman to do one thing and then the regulations put in place - presumably to implement the legislation - preclude the ombudsman from doing something that the legislation allows it to do, namely, a quite important issue of being able to report on individual rulings made by it.</p></speech>

In almost every case of mortgage difficulty that I encounter, people tell me that they are making great efforts to contact financial institutions to engage with them but they receive no response or else merely a letter written by rote.  I wonder about this.  The banks have come to our meetings telling us that they are making great efforts and that the distressed mortgage-holders are not contacting them.  Which is the correct version?  I have met a series of individuals who have shown me the correspondence they have received from the banks.  They told me that they begged the banks to meet them in order to have a proper discussion of the situation.</p> <p>They are minimal, tick the box requirements.  Does Mr. Prasifka receive many complaints about banks acting bureaucratically but not really engaging and how much latitude does the legislation allow him in terms of telling the banks they ticked the box but did not try to engage?</p></speech>

That is what we are entrusted with doing.  The code of conduct is quite prescriptive and it requires that certain stages and options are pursued.  We examine whether the provider has done this in the context of the individual circumstances of each complainant.

He has been a very good friend to the committee since his appointment and has come into Leinster House regularly to meet members.  I have met with him regularly myself and always find him very open and frank.</p><p>  We are all aware of recent events in Ukraine, including the ongoing crisis in Crimea.  The ambassador is here to give his perspective on the situation, which is changing almost on a daily basis.  We hope the crisis will be settled by diplomacy and that Ukraine can return to settling its own political affairs, with fresh elections and a bright future.  The ambassador is very welcome and we look forward to hearing his views.  After he has made his presentation, I will invite questions from members.</p></speech>

Mr. Sergii Reva" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014030500002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to address the committee at this crucial moment in the history of my country.  I know that members are sincerely concerned about developments there.  In fact, we in Ukraine are facing a moment of truth.  For all civilised states and people, for each and every European to whom human values ​​are not blank words, the situation is clear - Russian troops have invaded the territory of Ukraine in Crimea under the illegal and groundless excuse of protecting its Russian-speaking population.</p><p>  Invasion by Russian troops of the territory of sovereign Ukraine is a brutal breach of international law and the guarantees of security to our state given by Russia itself.  It is an evident violation of the United Nations Charter.  As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, Russia bears a special responsibility to safeguard peace and security.  The invasion is also a breach of the OSCE Helsinki Final Act, as well as Russia's specific commitments to respect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity under the Budapest Memorandum of 1994 and the bilateral Treaty on Friendship, Co-operation and Partnership of 1997, under which it recognised existing Ukrainian boarders.  Russia's actions are likewise a clear breach of the Ukrainian constitution, which specifically recognises the territorial integrity of the country and states that the Autonomous Republic of Crimea may only organise referenda on local matters, not on the modification of the territorial configuration of Ukraine.</p><p>  Nobody should be susceptible to Russian propaganda which seek to persuade the world it is a peacemaker, wishing only to protect ethnic Russians within the territory of our country from so-called fascists and nationalists.  Nobody and nothing threatens Russians or representatives of other nationalities living in Ukraine, including in Crimea.  Being a Crimean by origin - I was born in Sebastopol and my mother still lives there - I know the situation in the region quite well.  Russians, Ukrainians, Tatars and other nationalities have been living there peacefully for decades.  The only bone of contention is to do with language.  However, allegations that the Russian speaking-population in Crimea has been deprived of its right to speak Russian are just not true.  The abolition by the Ukrainian Parliament of a controversial and mainly politically motivated law on state language policy, adopted two years ago, has been vetoed by the acting President and hence remains in force.  There is no reference to depriving Russians of the right to speak their own language.  That is not true.</p> <p> Other problems in Crimea, which are primarily social and economic in nature, occur in every country in the world and are similar to those in other regions of Ukraine.  In any case, it is my strong conviction that all problems and misunderstandings which are natural in difficult times can and must be solved through peaceful means, without foreign intervention and with the assistance of international security and human rights institutions, such as the United Nations, Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and Council of Europe.</p><p> Russia is finding more and more excuses to try to justify its aggressive actions.  On Monday, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations stated that the former President Yanukovych had appealed to the Russian President to bring troops into Ukraine and produced a sheet of paper with Yanukovych&rsquo;s signature.   I deliberately do not wish to dwell on the moral side of this issue.  Even the closest allies of Yanukovych in Ukraine were outraged at his disgusting act of using a foreign army against his own people.  According to the Constitution of Ukraine, only the Verkhovna Rada - the Parliament of Ukraine - can legally allow foreign troops to enter the country.  As this power is not available to the President, former President Yanukovych did not have the right to invite foreign troops to enter the country.  The unprovoked Russian aggression is the price Ukraine is paying for its wish to determine its own future and live as a free and independent state.  It is destroying democracy and the European choice gained through struggle by the Ukrainian people.  </p><p> I will not rehearse the events that led to the current crisis as the facts are well known.  The joint committee is well informed about the agreement reached on 21 February between the opposition and ex-President through the good offices of the Foreign Ministers of Poland, Germany and France.  The key element of the agreement was the restoration of the Constitution of 2004, which limits the powers of the President.  On the day after it was signed, Yanukovych publicly renounced the agreement and stated that he had no intention of signing the law adopted by the Parliament to this end.  He later fled Kiev for an unknown destination, leaving behind a ruined economy, a plundered state budget and many luxury private estates and other belongings.  Members will be well aware of the details from television broadcasts and reports in the <i>The Irish Times</i>.</p><p> Taking into account the absence of a legitimate Government of Ukraine, which resigned in late January, and the President's decision to remove himself from exercising his functions, the Verkhovna Rada, being the only legitimate authority, assumed all power and responsibility for Ukraine on 22 February.  Mr. Turchynov was elected as the new speaker of the Parliament.  The Verkhovna Rada, in full compliance with the Constitution, conferred on the new speaker the powers of the President of Ukraine until pre-term presidential elections are held on 25 May 2014.  I ask that the D&aacute;il and Seanad send representatives to monitor these elections.  Many Irish parliamentarians visited Ukraine for previous parliamentary elections and we very much appreciate their objective, unbiased and impartial position.  I hope, therefore, that the Irish Parliament will consider the possibility of sending representatives to Ukraine for the forthcoming presidential elections.  Mr. Turchynov is the acting President of Ukraine and only assumed this role because someone must exercise the function.  Under the Constitution, this role should be assumed by the Speaker of Parliament.</p><p> A new Government was formed last Thursday and all European Union member states, including Ireland, as well as the United States and other democracies have recognised the legitimacy of the new state power in Ukraine.  However, Russia considers it illegitimate, stating that the opposition has not abided by the agreement of 21 February.  This allegation is groundless and non-constructive.  The agreement was not fulfilled by ex-President Yanukovych who, as I stated, refused to sign the new law restoring the previous Constitution.  Moreover, the Russian position is surprising given that Russia had a representative on the negotiation group, Mr. Lukin, an experienced diplomat and former ambassador to the United States and, I believe, a former ombudsman.  Mr. Lukin refused to recognise the agreement before it was signed.<br /><font color="#2F2F2F"> On 1 March 1 2014, Ukrainians and the whole civilised world were shocked by the adoption by Russian law-makers of a decision that gives consent to unleash a war against Ukraine.</font> As of today, a large number of Russian troops have been deployed in Ukraine.  I do not propose to discuss this deployment in detail.  President  stated yesterday that there was no need to send Russian forces to  at present.  I would welcome these words if Russia started to act accordingly.  This will require it to take a number of steps.  Russia must stop aggression and immediately withdraw its armed forces to the areas where they are permanently stationed in accordance with bilateral agreements on the stationing of the Black Sea fleet in Sevastopol.  It must disarm the so-called self-defence forces, which are heavily equipped with Russian arms and munitions.  It must start negotiations through the good offices of the United Nations and OSCE representatives, with the aim of de-escalating the situation.  It must also agree to hold consultations, as foreseen in the bilateral treaty of 1997 and the Budapest memorandum. </p><p> We are grateful to the Government of Ireland and Irish people who have shown that they are not indifferent to recent events for their support for Ukraine at this difficult moment in our history.  Ukraine appreciates Ireland's firm position enunciated in three successive statements by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  We believe this support will continue to be effective, sustainable and concrete.  We see we are not alone at this difficult moment.  I call on you, distinguished Irish parliamentarians, to raise your voice and use all your political influence and authority to stop the aggression and prevent a war in the very centre of Europe.</p></speech>

He may be aware that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade came before the joint committee yesterday to discuss a post-European Council meeting report.  The meeting dealt at length with various issues.</p> <p>In his concluding remarks the ambassador referred to successive statements made by the T&aacute;naiste as being supportive and understanding of the position of his people.  As an Opposition spokesperson, I fully concur with the sentiments expressed by the T&aacute;naiste on behalf of the Government.  Those sentiments reflect the views of my party.</p><p> The ambassador referred to 16,000 Russian troops in Crimea.  As he is aware, President Putin has denied that the Russian-speaking soldiers who are occupying key military sites in Crimea are members of Russia's special forces.  Is the ambassador in a position to indicate whether the identity, status and allegiance of these soldiers been independently verified?  The Chairman quite rightly referred to the OSCE mission.  There were early indications that observers from the OSCE might be prevented from entering the Crimean Peninsula.  Can the ambassador provide an update on that matter?</p><p> Media reports this morning indicated that there had been a failure to reach agreement at the Budapest talks involving Britain, the United States and Ukraine and that Russia did not participate in those talks.  Is there any indication of a change in attitude on the part of the Russian Government in respect of the Budapest memorandum?</p><p> I must inform the Chairman that I am due to attend another meeting and that I may not be able to be present for much of the remainder of this one.</p></speech>

In the context of Russian statements regarding the origin of the troops in the Crimea, a well known argument has been put forward to the effect that they are not Russian military personnel but are rather members of the local militia or self-defence service.  Look at those people.  The argument to which I refer would sound ridiculous if the situation - and the consequences relating to it - were not so dangerous.  Nobody can deny that they are wearing Russian uniforms or carrying Russian machine guns, grenade launchers and other equipment.  However, it has been stated that - allegedly - they could buy these uniforms in stores.  They could buy jackets and perhaps even helmets, but what about weapons such as machine guns and grenade launchers?  Do members believe that the weapons to which I refer could be bought in a store?  I am from Sevastopol and I have never come across a store in which such armaments are sold.  What about the armoured personnel carriers they are using?</p><p>  The Deputy referred to the OSCE mission.  From the very beginning we were in favour of the latter and we invited international observers to come to Ukraine.  Members may have doubts about or may wish to question the information I am supplying, particularly as I am an interested party.  They can also doubt any information provided by our Russian colleagues.  Let the international community send impartial and unbiased observers into Ukraine in order to see what is happening.  Who are the people who seized administrative buildings?  Who blocked Ukrainian military units from performing their duties?  Who are they?  Are there any doubts as to who they might be?  I think I was clear enough when I referred to this matter earlier.</p><p>  As far as the Budapest memorandum is concerned, I referred to many international laws breached by Russia.  What is the Budapest memorandum?  Members may recall that Ukraine was the first state in the world to renounce its nuclear arsenal.  I have been involved in the arena of diplomacy for 35 years and I can inform the committee that I was there and I recall how difficult was the decision we made in this regard.  If we still had nuclear weapons, perhaps Russia would not be behaving in quite the same way.  However, we gave up our nuclear weapons and passed them - through international control - to Russia.  We received clear-cut guarantees from the Russian Federation, the United States, the UK and, later on, France and China in the context of the Budapest memorandum.  What are the provisions of the memorandum?  All the countries to which I refer are guarantors.  According to the memorandum, Russia is a guarantor of our territorial integrity.  Can members imagine this?  What are the obligations under the memorandum?  Not only is Russia a guarantor, it must also refrain from exerting economic pressure.  I do not want to recall the gas war and other problems with Russia in the economic sphere since the memorandum was signed.</p><p>  Let us speak about security.  Another provision is that when problems arise, Ukraine can call for immediate consultations with the guarantors.  We did so.  We immediately asked for a meeting with the Russian representatives in order that we might discuss and de-escalate the situation at the port.  What was the answer we received?  We were told that it was an internal matter and that Crimea was part of Ukraine.  It was stated that Crimea was ours and that we should settle our own problems.  We were also informed that this was not a matter in respect of which the Budapest memorandum should apply.  So far, I have no information about changes in the Russian position.</p></speech>

As Deputy Smith stated, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade came before the committee yesterday.  There is a general consensus among those of all parties and none in the Houses of the Oireachtas with regard to condemning what is happening in Ukraine.  We have been brought to the brink in respect of this matter and I hope people will pause and consider the direction in which matters could potentially move.</p><p>  I disagree with the ambassador's comments on nuclear weapons.  If Ukraine had access to nuclear weapons, Russia would have moved in much more quickly.  Will he outline his opinion on how the EU has dealt with the crisis in Ukraine since it first began?  At yesterday's meeting, there appeared to be consensus on the point that Ukraine was placed in an unfair position in that it was given only two options, namely, to tie its future to the EU or to tie it to Russia.  Many of us believe that it might have been possible to reach a compromise between the two.  Those responsible for negotiating with the Ukraine on behalf of the EU should be given their P45s.  I am of the view that the individuals in question performed poorly and that they were not very supportive of Ukraine in the lead-up to the current crisis.</p><p>  Russia is playing out its hand and has taken <i>de facto</i> control of Crimea.  I commend the authorities in Kiev on showing such resolute restraint in the face of the aggression we have seen.  What should happen now?  Is the ambassador of the view that a political deal can be struck by the parties involved?  Could such a deal be arrived at soon?  Is he of the view that sanctions should be imposed on Russia until it removes its forces?  Many people believe that the EU is merely huffing and puffing and that there is very little it can do.  If sanctions are imposed, they will have an adverse impact on many countries throughout the EU.  I do not know how effective sanctions would be in the context of affecting Russia's strategy in Ukraine.</p><p>  Like many others, I am very concerned about the level of involvement of the far right in pro-EU protests and violence in Kiev.  This matter was also touched on at yesterday's meeting.  Those on the far right have used the power vacuum in order to secure posts in the new Ukrainian Government.  I include in this the new Deputy Prime Minister and the head of the defence forces.  As his country's ambassador to Ireland, I do not know if Mr. Reva can comment on that matter.</p> <p>The Secretary of the Ukrainian National Security and National Defence Committee is Andriy Parubiy, who was the founder of the Social National Party of Ukraine, which in my view was a fascist party styled on Hitler's Nazis and whose membership was restricted to ethnic Ukrainians.  Alongside him is the Deputy Secretary of the National Security and National Defence Committee, Dmytro Yarosh, the leader of Right Sector, a group of hardline nationalist street fighters who previously boasted they were ready for armed action to free Ukraine.  We now have the new Deputy Prime Minister, Oleksandr Sych, who is a member of the far right Svoboda Party which the World Jewish Congress called on the EU to consider banning last year along with Greece's Golden Dawn.  There has been a huge increase in anti-Semitic attacks against Jewish citizens in Kiev and the Rabbi of Kiev has advised Jewish citizens to leave the city.  There are shades of the past in the attacks on Jewish citizens and people.</p><p> The ambassador may not be able to answer, but many of us cannot understand how a neo-fascist party like Svoboda has been given the Deputy Prime Minister's position as well as two other ministerial posts.  I realise that Svoboda got 10% of votes in the last election, but now seven Government Ministers have strong links to the extreme right.  I find it extremely worrying.  It sends a disturbing message to all ethnic and linguistic minorities in the Ukraine.  I note that when the new Government came to power, it removed Russian as a national language.  How was this done?  Was that mistaken?  In this tense and hostile environment, why was this decision seen as necessary and important?  It sent out negative signals.</p></speech>

To what extent, if any, was consideration given in 2004 to joining NATO?  Was it possible to join NATO at that stage?  Most eastern bloc countries at that time made an application to join NATO as a first step before making an application to join the European Union.  If that had been done at the time, would it have averted the crisis and Russian invasion?</p><p>  Many references have been made to the extreme right and extreme left who are involved in street protests.  I can understand how people may exploit a situation when there is a breakdown in law and order, as has happened.  Notwithstanding that, there were 70 to 100 people killed by snipers in the course of the demonstrations which took place.  That was deliberate killing involving the selection of targets, as has been a feature in some areas over the past 100 years.  To what extent were those targets selected and what was the background of the people killed?  Were they supportive of, or participants in, any particular groups?</p><p>  Is it accepted that Russian-speaking minorities or majorities have the right to use their language as they see fit?  Is it recognised that minorities as well as majorities have a right to democratic processes, including due process, and equality of treatment?  I acknowledge that a difficult situation obtains, but it is important from the point of view of neighbours in the European Union that those rights are accepted and exist in fact.  No group can be excluded or deemed not to be entitled to democratic procedures.</p><p>  Yulia Tymoshenko was released.  Some of my colleagues do not agree that she was a positive influence, but she was in prison for a number of years, as were others.  Some of us believe that prison is not the appropriate place for political opponents.  They are entitled to democratic procedures in the normal way.  What condition are those prisoners in now who were released?</p></speech>

I do not distinguish in my attitudes to the Ukrainians.  I do not distinguish between those from the east and those from the west.  I do not distinguish in my definition of a Ukrainian between Russian speakers, Romanian speakers, Ukrainian speakers, Hungarian speakers or Polish speakers.  My vision of Ukraine is as a united entity.  I have been critical of the fact that the west, through the European Union, did not pay due consideration to the rights, role and significance of Russian speaking Ukrainians.  When they were forging the eastern partnership, unfortunately, from my political perspective and view of life, they neglected desperately an engagement and dialogue on the future of Ukraine in an agreement with the European Union.  They spoke with those they thought were the pro-western, pro-European side.  I have been critical of Europe in that it should have seen the tell-tale signs when Armenia pulled out of the partnership under duress from Russia.  Antennae should have gone up and attention should have been paid to what the Russians were doing to pressurise those countries engaging with Europe in the context of an eastern partnership.</p><p>  I will not apologise in saying to the ambassador that terrible mistakes were made in Kiev.  The role of Europe was very important when the French, Poles and Germans  negotiated an agreement with the ambassador's Government.  They negotiated that very important agreement on 21 February 2014.  As Europe was looking for a long period for the release of Tymoshenko, she was released.  She did not do the Ukrainian cause any great favours by asking those at the barricades to continue the very next day after the agreement was made with the French, Poles and Germans.</p></speech>

Having said that, I want to look on the bright side for Ukraine.  It is not right that Right Sector has four ministries.  Svoboda does not play a progressive role but it is a voice and it has to be listened to and engaged with.  Therefore, the very next day after the agreement was struck on 21 February, the parliament made a silly decision to revoke the language agreement whereby the regions could have a second language.  I congratulate the acting President, Mr. Turchynov, who vetoed that decision of parliament which was taken in haste in what must have been a very fraught atmosphere.</p> <p>I believe the parliamentarians made a mistake.  His Excellency will appreciate that all of Europe, in particular the French, the Poles and the Germans who had negotiated the deals were very disappointed with that decision.  Having said that, we must condemn out of hand the role of the Russians in Ukraine.  The diplomacy that the Russians seem to engage in, and there is history attached to it, is that if one does not listen to what the Russians say, one will get a hard fist.  An invasion has occurred.</p><p> It is to be applauded that the OSCE has put in observers very quickly.  It is a rolling issue and we do not know if the OSCE observers have been allowed into the country.  One member of the Defence Forces is assigned to OSCE.  Thirteen countries have sent in observers with the OSCE.  I hope the Russians will allow this observation mission to play a role in Ukraine.</p><p> I hope that Ireland will play a more significant role, given the history of the OSCE and that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade recently served as its chairman.  It would play a more significant role in the presence of long-term observers and short-term observers of the elections in Ukraine, which are planned for the 25 May.  Tragically, Ireland has only sent one LTO to Ukraine.  That is an amazing miscalculation by Ireland Inc.  Does<b></b>H. E. Mr. Sergii Reva think it would be possible to have presidential elections throughout Ukraine on 25 May?  If it is feasible, my argument is that our Government, other European governments and all affiliates of the OSCE must flood Ukraine with observers to reassure the people from the eastern and western sector that personnel with OSCE election monitoring hats to ensure that whatever way they vote the people are guaranteed that votes will be interpreted fairly by the OSCE.  I understand some 900 STOs are spoken of and the more we can send to observe the pre-term presidential election the better.  I would appreciate a reply to my question on whether it will be feasible to hold elections in the current circumstances.</p></speech>

We in Ireland would empathise with H.E. Mr. Sergii Reva in respecting the integrity of Ukraine's boundaries.  We are a small island that still suffers from occupation by a foreign power.  We very much stand with Ukraine on the integrity of its borders.  In the course of his submission, the ambassador stated: "[I]t is my strong conviction that all problems and misunderstandings which are natural for difficult times can and must be resolved peacefully without foreign intervention with [the] help of [international] security and human rights".  I fully agree with that statement.  I do not know if the ambassador saw a programme on TV 3, which showed an excerpt of a tape between the US ambassador to Ukraine and one of the female senior diplomats in the US State Department.  It showed quite a degree of involvement by the US with some of the political parties in Ukraine.  It could be classified on one hand as being of assistance but also, others might interpret it as interfering.  What is the ambassador's interpretation of that discussion?</p><p>  An issues that arose yesterday was that the peaceful protest that emanated in Kiev, since the abandonment of the agreement with the EU at the end of last year, at some stage morphed into something more serious than just peaceful protest.  Will His Excellency comment on some of the radical elements who may have infiltrated the protest, and may have gone beyond peaceful protest, ultimately creating the situation that it has given rise to?</p><p>  Will the ambassador give us a flavour, from his perspective, of how important Crimea is to the Russian Federation, in particular as a source of access to the Baltic Sea?  My understanding is that of the 16,000 troops, some 10,000 were already in Crimea, and an additional 6,000 special forces came to buttress them, giving rise to fear of a serious threat of occupation.  It is interesting that one army officer who defected from Ukraine to the Russian side yesterday endeavoured to get his colleagues to join him but apparently they all refused.  That is significant and shows the degree of solidarity among the Ukrainian military in the Crimea area.  That is a positive development.</p><p>  His Excellency referred to the economic difficulties.  I know that Ukraine has suffered from economic difficulties for some time.  Will he give us an idea of the fiscal deficit, the rate of unemployment so that we can get a flavour of the severity of the difficulties?  Does he agree with the proposition that if Ukraine is to extricate itself from financial and economic difficulties, it will require external assistance that will come from the east and the west, in other words that Russia, the European Union and others have a part to play in that?</p><p>  Will the ambassador comment on the OSCE observer mission?  I understand the mission will only be in the Ukraine for a brief period.  Does he have any suggestions on what needs to be done to buttress that initiative?</p></speech>

Mr. Sergii Reva and his colleague to our meeting.  I commend the restrained and measured response shown by the Ukrainian State in the face of extraordinary aggression from the Russian Federation.  It is clear to me that the Russian Federation and President Putin feel threatened by the demands made by the Ukrainian people in terms of constitutional reform, liberal democracy and freedom.  I am aware of the view of the T&aacute;naiste and the European Union that a solution to this dreadful series of events has to be found but it must be achieved through the multilateral frameworks that exist and that have been used successfully in the context of resolving similar issues over the years.  I would not agree with some of the remarks, if I heard him correctly, made by Deputy Crowe that the far right took to the street to support closer relationships with the European Union.  In fact, the far right in Ukraine has more to fear from closer relationships with the European Union than the <i>status quo</i>.  It is demonstrably clear that this would be the case.  The type of institutional reforms encouraged by the European Union would ensure that Ukraine would be a very cold place for neo-Nazis and for those who occupy positions on the far right.</p></speech>

I am glad it is acknowledged that Crimea has been invaded.  The territorial integrity of Ukraine has been undermined and has been violated and international law has been violated.  That is a demonstrable fact.  In the context of the de-escalation of the dispute and the hope of a negotiated peaceful resolution to it, I would be anxious to see it ensured that the constitutional reform path that Ukraine was on would not be diverted from.</p> <p>I also hope that the EU will continue to support the aims of the Ukrainian people in the type of constitutional reform that a significant number of them believe is required.  Is it the ambassador's view that the Ukrainian people still continue to demand the type of institutional and constitutional reform that they demanded prior to the integrity of their border being compromised by invasion?  I do not want the reform path that Ukraine was on to be diminished or undermined by any settlement that might emerge.  I appreciate that resolving this difficult and complex set of circumstances may involve a sacrifice from all sides to the dispute, but is it the ambassador's opinion that Ukraine should remain on the reform path and that this not become a casualty of any settlement?</p></speech>

We cannot but thank the EU for its prompt reaction to the events.  The EU countries and the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, were instrumental in settling the internal political situation in Kiev.  For three months, there were unrest, clashes and riots in Kiev.  European Ministers, the High Representative, Commissioner &Scaron;tefan F&uuml;le and others visited there practically every week.  They watched, gave advice and tried to help settle the situation.  It was finally settled.  Of course, the agreement of 21 February is not perfect, but there were riots in the street and police were shooting people.  I remind the committee that almost 100 people were shot dead on the streets.  I will be frank - at the time, I prayed for any agreement that could stop the violence and bloodshed.  Do not be too exigent of agreements made under such pressures.  I will not hide the fact that we were on the brink of civil war.</p><p>  I believe the questioner meant our relationship with Russia when referring to a compromise.  A compromise is possible and we always strive for compromise in our dialogue.  That was our exact intention.  In diplomacy, when a menace arises, the first step generally is to sit down at a negotiating table to discuss it.  There are many problems to be discussed in this case.  I have never stated that the situation in Crimea and other regions of Ukraine is ideal.  I am not just referring to the east, but also to the west.  The country is in crisis, that is the bitter reality, but we should discuss all matters at the negotiating table through dialogue, not at gunpoint.</p><p>  I welcome any positive step taken by Russia in reaction to our constructive proposals to start negotiations and consultations.  I will be frank - Russia does not recognise our new power.  Mr. Sergey Lavrov, whom I have known personally since the 1990s or so, did not reply to calls from my Minister.  The Minister did not ask him to discuss the Olympic Games or football.  He wanted to discuss the threat of war in our home.  The Russian side did not react to our appeals.</p><p>  The Security Council's sitting and the rather firm stand taken by the EU and the US are positive movements, but the situation is fragile.  Please do not believe that, after yesterday's statement by Mr. Putin, everything will go smoothly or there is peace.  There is no peace.  Russian troops are still trying to seize our military units.  Those units have their own arms, though.  A spark can explode this situation at any moment.  Even as we discuss it, there may be clashes breaking out and soldiers firing.  There is no guarantee.  The two military forces are in place and it could happen at any time.</p><p>  The first precondition necessary to start negotiations is to take a step back and withdraw troops to their permanent bases.  We can then start the negotiations.  We are open to having them.  We have never tried to avoid or hide from negotiations on the acute questions of radical forces, secessionists, nationalists, Nazis and so on.</p><p>  I did not refer to another matter in my statement because I did not want to take up too much of the committee's time.  Regarding the question of why this situation came to bloodshed and riots in the streets, it was down to ex-President Yanukovych.  Reverting to a part of my speech that I did not read out, what happened was due to Yanukovych's sudden reverse from the path of Ukraine's European integration last November and his unwillingness to listen to people who were on the streets for more than three months in the fog and winter when the temperature was 25 degrees below zero.  People are still there.  The first protests were peaceful.  My son, an 18 year old student, protested because he was frustrated with the decision to postpone signing the integration agreement.  What did these people receive from the President?  Nothing.  Quite the contrary, a peaceful gathering on the night of 30 November was dispersed brutally.  People were beaten with sticks to their hands and legs.  The committee should remember these facts.</p> <p>The protest then became more radical.  Is it good or bad?  Of course, it is bad.  Nobody denies that there are many radical extremist forces among the protestors.  The committee saw this.  They have thrown Molotov cocktails at policemen and have thrown stones.  I never justified those actions and nobody could justify them but I would like the committee to understand why those radical forces appeared, became stronger and now have a voice.  They were more active on the street and through their own sacrifices forced the authorities to come to the negotiating table.  It is a rather complicated process.  I do not have an open and unconditional answer to the Deputy's question.  </p><p> Of course, there are radical forces.  They are everywhere and in such difficult moments, they appear, become more active and gain some support among the population.  It is always like this when a crisis takes place.  It is everywhere but I would like to stress one thing.  They are facts but these radical forces and ultra-nationalists have nothing to do with Crimea.  There was no extremist, radical or representative of Svoboda or the right in Crimea, Donetsk, or other eastern regions.  They are in the western part of the country and in Kiev.  Nobody can deny this.  </p><p> As far as the permission of the Government is concerned, being a diplomat, I cannot command this.  When assessing this situation, I ask the committee to be impartial, unbiased and objective and to take all of the circumstances into account - what has led to such a situation.  As has always happened in our history, such situations can be overcome.  It will be settled.  Professionals and constructive people will come to the Government.  To this end, it is very important to hold presidential elections on 25 May 2014 because the Russian Federation and possibly some members of the committee still question the authority of the acting president.  He is not pretending to be a president.  He understands that he is acting president.  He is mainly serving as speaker of the parliament.  Of course, he must sign because according to the constitution, in order for a law to come into force, it should be signed by the president.  Somebody must sign them.  I did not hear any statement from Mr. Turchinov proving that he pretends to be a fully fledged president.  I think that in two months' time, we will have a new legitimate legally elected president.  I ask the committee's support once again to help in this matter.</p><p> I think all the political forces and population of Ukraine support holding elections because there is no other way out of this situation.  Everybody supports it.  Even people in Crimea support the idea.  At least, they supported it before the Russian invasion.  Even now, they support this idea.  I did not hear about any opposition to the idea of holding pre-term elections.  Of course, the conflict in Crimea can impede in some way the holding of these elections.  I thought about this in Crimea but I hope that the situation will be settled and elections will take place.  </p><p> As far as the Russian language is concerned, nobody denies their right to hold power.  It was always like this in our history.  Our former prime minister was Russian who did not even speak Ukrainian.  I am half Russian and have never hidden the fact that I am a Russian-speaking Ukrainian.  I am from Sevastopol.  I did not study Ukrainian at school because there was no Ukrainian school in Sevastopol at that time.  Now we are accused of undertaking so-called Ukrainianisation but think about this.  For centuries, the process of Russification took place in our country.  I am a vivid example of this but my children speak excellent Ukrainian.  My daughter wrote poems in Ukrainian.  This is natural because if a member of the committee speaks a bit of Russian, he or she can confirm that Russian and Ukrainian are very close.  It is not like Irish and English.  The languages are very close so it just needs a small effort to study Ukrainian.  Every Russian understands at least 60% of Ukrainian without special knowledge so it is not a source of conflict.  As I said in my presentation, for decades, people have been living peacefully in Crimea.</p><p> I will be frank with the committee.  Yesterday, I asked my mother who is Russian and lives in Sevastopol whether she has any problems with the Ukrainian language.  She told me that she did not.  She told me that she always spoke Russian and did not have a word of Ukrainian but she had no problems because all people in Sevastopol and Simferapol and even most people in Kiev speak Russian.  Language is not a problem.  The only problem my mother has is with instructions on some medical prescriptions which are in Ukrainian.  Of course, I fully agree that this is stupid.  I know our health minister gave instructions long ago to make instructions available in Russian and Ukrainian.  Would the committee agree that all these problems, which I believe are minor, should not justify military action?  Let us not call it aggression or intervention.  How can one sovereign country which calls us brothers intervene with this military force and their troops just to ensure whatever end?  No radical force, fascists or extremists are there.  They are in the capital and western Ukraine but they are not in Crimea and Sevastopol so this allegation is completely groundless.  </p><p> The committee knows that Yulia Tymoshenko was released, which was one of the first decisions of the new configuration of the parliament.  Elections took place in October 2011 as members of the committee know because they were there.  The composition of the parliament has not changed.  A new coalition has been formed.  I draw the committee's attention to the fact that all decisions on changes to the constitution of 2004 were approved and adopted by a constitutional majority of more than 300 votes out of 450 members of the parliament.  Even representatives of the party of the former regional governor and Communists voted for this so there is general consensus in the parliament and there was no question about this.  </p><p> What about the constitution?  Of course, it is not perfect.  A member asked me about the importance of constitutional reform.  Of course, it is important.  Let us be frank.</p> <p> No constitution is perfect and the constitutional changes in 2004 were not perfect.  As the committee may know, there was a big divergence between the President and the Parliament after the so-called Orange Revolution in 2004 when the constitution was introduced.  That was due to the fact that the division of power was not clear, specific or perfectly stipulated in the constitution.  That is still a problem.  That is why even in the Yanukovych period a special working group was created and now its work has speeded up.  It has a special target to prepare and elaborate a new constitution.  Nobody wants to stop it or say that the constitution was our goal and it is perfect - No.  I would like to explain to the committee that coming back to the constitution was a compromise at this stage on 21 February this year when all of the riots and unrest took place on the streets.  People and protestors agree that the constitution limits the power of the President but nobody imagined that he would flee.  Mr. Yanukovych had a right to put forward his candidacy to be the new President but he fled.  He is hiding somewhere in Russia but issues statements, holds press conferences, etc., and invited Russia to send its troops into our territory.  Can the committee imagine that?  </p><p> The OSCE mission is clear on presidential elections.  How important is Crimea to Russia?  It is very important and we realise that.  Perhaps members already know the history of the region.  Before 1954, Crimea was Soviet Russian Federation territory.  In 1954, in honour of the 300th anniversary of Ukraine's reunification with Russia, a decision was legally adopted by the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Soviet Union to make the territory Ukrainian SSR territory.  When the Soviet Union collapsed and ceased to exist there was agreement that all former soviet republics remain within their borders as stated in the 1997 Treaty on Friendship, Co-operation and Partnership between the Ukraine and Russia.</p><p> We realise as important the fact that there is a large Russian-speaking population in the country but it is difficult to say how many.  Some Russian mass media claim that they are in the majority but that is not true.  The last reliable data is the 2001 census, 13 years ago, and the situation will have changed since then.  It is my assessment that the part of Russians and maybe Ukrainians also have diminished because the area is part of the Tatars who are Muslims and the birth rate is higher in that population.  That is my assessment of the situation and my view does not come from official data.  I think that the part of Tatars has increased.  If we rely on the 2001 data, then in Crimea the population is comprised of 58% of Russians, between 24% and 25% Ukrainians and between 12% and 13% Tatars.  Of course 58% is a substantial figure but it is not 90%.  The Crimean population is not so homogenous as the Irish population.  Perhaps the committee cannot imagine such a situation because the Irish population is comprised mostly of Irish people.  In Crimea there are tens if not hundreds of nationalities.  There are Tatars - and this is difficult to say in English - Armenians, Jews, Romanians, Bulgarians, etc.</p><p> As far as the rights of Crimea, last December the Vice Prime Minister of the autonomous Republic of Crimea led a visit of a high-level delegation to Ireland.  The Chairman of the committee met him and spoke to him.  He was also greeted by the Taoiseach and Ceann Comhairle.  The delegation visited the D&aacute;il and the Seanad and attended a plenary meeting of the D&aacute;il.  They were received as an official delegation and shown all due respect.</p><p> We understand the role of Russia and we are ready to hold open discussions with it like partners, neighbours, and peoples who share historical roots and lives and are connected economically, historically and culturally.  Russian writers are our writers and the Ukrainian poet Shevchenko is well known in Russian.  There is nothing to divide or split us.  With such a background how can we accept actions and the introduction of force?  We would understand if Russia expressed its concern and try to initiate negotiations and express openly, as we say "in the face", all of its dissatisfaction, concerns, etc.  Instead, without any negotiations and consultations, Russia introduced force.</p><p> It is no secret that the economic situation is very difficult in the Ukraine.  I do not want to infer but I think that this is the direct consequence of Mr. Yanukovych's policy.  The figures were well known but when he came to power our foreign indebtedness was three times less than now.  It is $75 billion now, which is a huge sum for Ukraine.  Of course Russian help and financial assistance would greatly assist in overcoming such debt.  Russia has now adopted the position of not recognising our Government and it does not abide with previous agreement with Mr. Yanukovych.  Of course we cannot insist now but yesterday I heard that Gazprom, a well known state company that supplies gas to Ukraine, said it would announce a lower price which we agreed last December.  While had an indebtedness problem before now, Russia did not do like this announcement.  I think its reason is quite open.</p><p> In these circumstances we need international help.  Let us recall the slogan used by Mr. Yanukovych when he came to power.  He said, "I promise you improvement tomorrow".  Everyone can see what improvements there was.  Mr. Yatsenyuk, Prime Minister of the Ukraine, speaking before his appointment said openly, "Dear Competitors, I don't promise you improvement either today or tomorrow because we are in crisis but I promise you reforms - real reform".</p><p> I very much hope that if the reform process is started we will receive a loan and stand-by credit from the IMF in addition to bilateral help.</p> <p>I know the recession is not over yet, but I hope Ireland will join the common efforts of the EU member states to help the Ukraine at this very difficult time.  Ireland has proved to be our friend.  I will never forget that Ireland has consistently supported the process of Ukrainian integration and the T&aacute;naiste took part in the meeting of the EU Friends of Ukraine.  I appeal to the committee to help us in this very difficult moment.</p><p> I thank the Chairman and members for their time and I invite them to put specific questions.</p></speech>

As my <i>curriculum vitae</i> shows, I was the political director in early 2000 and members may remember that back in 2002, if I am not mistaken, we took a historic decision to establish a Council for Defence and Security of Ukraine, stating that our strategic goal was to join NATO.  Many may have forgotten the background to this decision.  At that time Mr. Putin said that he did not rule out the possibility of Russia joining NATO.  His statement is to be found on the historical file.  At that time joining NATO would not have been viewed as anti-Russian.  Unfortunately, step by step, the Russian position towards NATO has changed.  Russia openly opposed all our steps to join NATO.  The NATO summit in Bucharest in 2008 was a crucial moment.  Mr. Putin attended that summit and spoke to each and every Head of State or Government, stating that Ukraine was not a state but merely an entity and therefore had no right to become a member of NATO.  He tried to persuade his partners in Germany and France and other European states.  The decision was to grant Ukraine membership of the action plan, a programme of preparation.  I tried to explain to my colleagues the role of NATO.  Many people in Ukraine and in Russia still live under a regime of Soviet propaganda, which views NATO as an aggressive military bloc.</p><p>  Having studied the substance of the NATO treaty, I understand it is a political, defence and military organisation of democratic states.  We were not admitted to NATO because we did not meet the requirements of NATO.  To be a member of NATO, states must respect human rights.  States do not usually have significant armed forces.  When Mr.Yanukovych came to power, one of his first steps was to adopt a law on a so-called non-bloc status of Ukraine.  That was to take account of the concerns of Russia about our intention to become a member of NATO.  </p><p>  As of two weeks ago, during this turbulent time, they should not raise the question of joining NATO.  I am afraid that after these events public opinion in Ukraine will be radicalised and will be pro-NATO.  The people believe NATO will guarantee our security and territorial integrity.  Unfortunately Russia proved that it cannot guarantee it.  I do not want to repeat these words, but do members understand what the Russian Federation is doing to Ukraine?  Many people in Ukraine see that NATO can guarantee it.  Because of our relationship with Russia we should not discuss this very delicate topic.  </p><p>  We will see what will happen in Ukraine, Russia, Europe and NATO.  I believe we should come back to this issue at some stage in the future, but we should not discuss it now, especially in the current circumstances where it could provoke a more furious response from Russia.  I do not think it is wise to raise the matter now.</p></speech>

While I question the Government's commitment to the Irish language no politician could question the Minister of State's commitment.  I make that distinction, despite the fact that the Minister of State was appointed by the Government.</p><p>  Students have attended Gaeltacht colleges over many years and have benefited from the massive contributions of the mn&aacute; t&iacute;.  I wish to acknowledge that contribution publicly.  The mn&aacute; t&iacute; are very special characters who take young people under their wings and show them the benefits of the Irish language and the ordinary simply things that are important to us such as c&eacute;il&iacute; nights and all of what goes on in Gaeltachta&iacute;.  The bean an t&iacute; is a very special type of woman.  The mn&aacute; t&iacute; run the houses and do excellent work.  That should be acknowledged.</p><p>  The Minister of State knows that mn&aacute; t&iacute; are finding it harder to get students to come to Irish colleges.  Grants have been cut and running an open house for students is not as attractive as it once was.  In many cases scholarships are no longer available to children to attend Irish colleges during the summer months and there is not the same financial wherewithal.</p></speech>

What is the Government's plan to ensure that the institution of Irish summer colleges, which was an industry in itself, will continue in the future?</p><p>  What are the Government's plans for keeping Irish as a compulsory subject for leaving certificate students?  The removal of Irish as a compulsory subject in the leaving certificate would be the death knell of the Irish language.  I know the Minister of State believes that to be true.  I would like to hear what the Minister of State has to say about that.</p><p>  In the past there were 19 Irish language institutions, such as Comhdh&aacute;il N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta na Gaeilge which has existed since 1943.  There are now only six such institutions.  These were great promoters of the Irish language. While no one would question the Minister of State's commitment to the Irish language, the Government has let the language down.  Could the Minister of State respond to this? </p><p>  I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for your indulgence.   </p></speech>

I agree that mn&aacute; t&iacute; have made a huge contribution to the promotion of the Irish language down through the years.</p> <p>I am speaking from personal experience because students used to stay in my house when I was very young.  I agree with the Deputy in that regard.  I am glad to say that the Irish colleges are still going very strong.  Over 20,000 people attend Irish courses in the Gaeltacht and stay with the mn&aacute; t&iacute; every year.  This is of great benefit for the language.  It also has economic benefits for the mn&aacute; t&iacute;.  I am very supportive of this scheme.</p><p> Nothing in the Government's Irish language policy, as published when we took office three years ago, envisages that changes will be made with regard to the leaving certificate.  I believe the Government is very supportive of the language.  I disagree with the Deputy on that point.  I believe we are as committed as any Government has been.  The Deputy also mentioned Comhdh&aacute;il N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta na Gaeilge.  There are 19 voluntary community language organisations under the North-South Ministerial Council structure.  It was decided some time ago that we should reduce that number as part of a rationalisation programme.  It has been agreed that there will be six lead organisations.  Unfortunately, Comhdh&aacute;il N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta na Gaeilge is not one of them.  This decision has been arrived at by Foras na Gaeilge.  It will probably come before the North-South Ministerial Council at its next meeting in April.  We will get an update on what has happened so far at the meeting, which will take place on 3 April.</p></speech>

Mar sin, cuirfidh m&eacute; mo cheisteanna tr&iacute; Bh&eacute;arla. This committee is concerned with the role of the Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga and the commissioner presents his annual report to the committee.  The commissioner expressed strong concern in his report regarding the proposed amalgamation of his office under the Office of the Ombudsman.  He mentioned legislation would be published to enable this and to redefine the role of the Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga.  Can the Minister of State provide clarity on this and when will the legislation be published?</p><p>  Does the Minister of State agree that the majority of issues identified by the commissioner in his report, in terms of the public interacting through Irish with public services, arose because of an inability by officials within the public service to deal with issues through Irish or bilingually.  There are issues in this regard.  The public service has been reduced from 300,000 to 270,000 and this may be part of the reason there has been a 3% increase in complaints.  In his report, the commissioner mentioned the transfer of training from Gaeleagras to the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and identified significant potential for improvement.  Will the Minister of State outline what plans there are for reform or what improvements can be see as a result of that transfer of powers?</p></speech>

He will continue to operate under the provisions of Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la 2003.</p> <p>There are service level agreements between the Departments of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and Public Expenditure and Reform.  We have been given the responsibility of organising retraining in conjunction with an outside agency, namely Gaelchult&uacute;r, which is a private company based in Dublin that provides training.  Approximately 300 civil servants have already received training there.  It is not just a question of attending - one must also receive certification.  We are familiar with what Gaeleagras did over the years when it was in operation.  Civil servants used to spend two or three weeks in the Gaeltacht.  I suggest that the course now being provided is more focused.  As I have said, there will be examinations to be sat and standards to be attained on the completion of this programme.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Hugh Creegan, director of transport investment and taxi regulation at the NTA.  Apologies have been received from Mr. Gerry Murphy, who cannot attend.</p><p>  I draw Mr. Creegan's attention to the fact that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, he is protected by absolute privilege in respect of his evidence to the committee.  However, if he is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and he continues to do so, he is entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of his evidence.  He is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and is asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, he should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p> <p>I also wish to advise the witnesses that the opening statements submitted to the committee will be published on the committee's website following this meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or persons outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> I now invite Mr. Creegan to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I understand that the committee wishes to focus on the draft Small Public Service Vehicle (Consolidation and Reform) Regulations 2014 which have recently been the subject of public consultation.  Small public service vehicles include taxis, hackneys and limousines.  Following a Government decision of June 2011 a wide-ranging review of the industry, chaired by the Minister of State with responsibility for public and commuter transport, Deputy Alan Kelly, was carried out.  The resultant review report was published in January 2012.  The aim of the review was to secure consumer confidence in the taxi system by ensuring that an appropriate regulatory framework is in place and is adequately enforced.</p><p>  The National Transport Authority was given responsibility for implementing the vast majority of actions, including enactment of the necessary statutory instruments.  Certain actions required primary legislation to be enacted.  The Taxi Regulation Act 2013 was enacted at the end of last year and it included all the required legislative changes needed to deliver on the review&rsquo;s actions.  Some sections of the Act have been commenced but the main body of it is to be commenced in the coming months in tandem with the consolidated regulations.  The draft regulations were released for public consultation on 19 December 2013.  Submissions could be made until 31 January 2014.  A total of 242 submissions were received.</p><p>  The advisory committee on small public service vehicles, a statutory group appointed by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to represent the operators within the industry and various other relevant stakeholders, will also set out its views directly to the authority.  All of these views will be considered by the board of the authority when it convenes later this month to decide on the regulations.  As part of this deliberative process, I will bring the views of this committee to the attention of the board of the authority.</p><p>  As regards what is contained in the draft regulations, first, they consolidate all existing taxi regulations into one statutory instrument, bringing together regulations made over the past 50 years.  Second, various new regulations have been included to give effect to the requirements of the Government review.  The appendix overleaf includes a list of key changes proposed.  I hope I can address any queries arising.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-05a.675" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="09:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014030500004#F00300"><p>I thank Mr. Creegan for his presentation.  I would like first to establish the reason the decision was taken to enact these regulations by way of statutory instrument.  In my view, the volume of information contained in the regulations should be included in primary legislation.  In my experience statutory instruments are used for updating rules and procedures.  They are generally not of the volume contained in the draft regulations before us.  I would have thought it better to have this dealt with by way of primary legislation.  Perhaps Mr. Creegan would comment on that.</p><p>  I would like now to discuss with Mr. Creegan some concerns which I have raised previously at this committee.  Based on the consultations I have had with taxi drivers and various groups there is a lack of belief in the taxi advisory committee.  The information I have from a diverse group of taxi drivers and representative groups is that it is not working from a taxi driver's point of view.  Perhaps Mr. Creegan would also comment on that matter.</p><p>  There is concern in the industry around the decision taken by the National Transport Authority regarding the introduction of a new class of taxi licence, namely, a smaller wheelchair accessible vehicle.  In this regard changes have been made to the regulations to provide that a small vehicle may carry only one passenger together with the person in the wheelchair.  A further change is that such vehicle must be only six years old or newer, while previously the requirement was that it be only three years old or newer.  The general understanding around the necessity to improve the qualitative nature of taxis was that it also provided a way of dealing with the quantitative issue that has arisen because of the proliferation of the issuance of licences, which has had a negative impact on the industry as a whole.  This leads me on to the Indecon report, in which it is suggested that in the issuance of the licence the NTA would outline to taxi drivers the fact that there was a level of over-subscription in the business and that it was virtually impossible to make a decent living out of it.  This appears to have been excluded from the overall approach taken.  The Indecon report states that initiatives to produce credible market information on the extent of low incomes and low taxi utilisation in the sector should be implemented and highlighted to discourage uninformed new entrants to the sector.  In providing increased market information, it would be beneficial to ensure that potential entrants have accurate information about possible earnings in the sector.  Information on utilisation rates and earnings with dispatch firms might also be beneficial for existing as well as potential entrants.  This does not appear to have been taken on board.</p><p>  There is also concern in regard to the new licence grade for the smaller wheelchair accessible vehicle in that it must be loaded from the rear, which may have implications for people seeking to get into the taxi at a taxi rank and may have some implications for road safety.  I would welcome Mr. Creegan's comments on that matter.  It appears to be yet another backdoor way of increasing the volume of licences and the concern is that the market will be flooded with this type of vehicle with no guarantee that it will in any way increase the level of response from those with that particular licence grade to attend or meet the needs of the wheelchair community.</p><p>  Another concern is the dormant or inactive licence in respect of which the duration has been reduced from five years to one year.  That is overly restrictive.  There are many reasons why a person might find himself or herself out of the business for a period, including inability to keep a car on the road, ill-health and so on.  I would be hopeful that the authority could find its way to restoring the duration in that regard to five years.</p><p>  Other concerns relate to the preclusion from advertising.  I do not see the logic in that.  To me, it does not appear to be a problem.  I use public transport and have not as yet seen any advertising which I believed to be distasteful or overly commercial.  There is concern among some in the industry that this is a case of the NTA taking control, with it ultimately charging a fee to allow for advertising which it deems appropriate.  I believe that would be a retrograde step.  Concern has also been expressed about how dormant licences are being bought up.  It is suggested that these are being connected to a vehicle within the three year age group and later transferred on, which is not helpful to the business generally.  </p><p>  Questions have been raised about the driver check application and the glitch in the system that appears to allow a third party to change a driver's details without permission.  I would welcome Mr. Creegan's comments on that issue.  Concern has also been expressed about the Luas construction works in Dublin and the impact it is having on the ranks and the lack of replacement ranks during the period of construction.  </p><p>  The taxi industry generates approximately &euro;5 million annually by way of licence fees.  Despite this, there is no investment by the NTA in the infrastructure of the service.</p> <p>There is real concern about the transfer of licences and particularly the inability to transfer them, and the witness would not be surprised to hear that.  There are concerns from drivers who would like to see the national car test and SGS verification provided at one location.  That is an operational issue.  There are also concerns about driver vetting, although I must be careful as I should not give the impression that we are being racist in any way.  There may be an inability to do an appropriate background check on somebody who does not come from this State, so will the witness comment on that?</p><p> Regulations deal with part-time drivers and there is a requirement to notify employers, which seems to be a box-ticking exercise rather than actively seeking confirmation from the principal employer of the individual concerned that notification has been given that the person is participating in part-time taxi work.  My understanding is the regulations set out a requirement that somebody cannot drive a taxi or small public service vehicle for greater than 11 hours at a time but how can that be enforced?  There is also the introduction of the credit card system and the expectation that drivers will have to carry the cost associated with that credit transaction, with drivers not being able to charge for the additional cost of providing the service.</p><p> These are a flavour of the concerns expressed to me by numerous taxi drivers.  There are others, and I am sure others will be able to add to them.  Will the witness provide the rationale for this from the National Transport Authority?</p></speech>

There was a question regarding the reason behind enforcing regulations rather than putting them in primary legislation.  The primary legislation sets up the framework and a recent piece of primary legislation went through this committee last year and was enacted at the end of 2013.  The drafters of the legislation had access to existing regulations and took the view that they would put in place an appropriate framework; it would be up to us as the licensing authority to develop details in regulations, which is what we attempted to do.  There are 50 or 60 sets of regulations and this is much smaller than the composite that currently exists.</p><p>  The Deputy mentioned that there is a lack of belief in the taxi advisory committee and it is not working from the taxi driver's perspective.  It is a separate statutory body so I will not speak for it.  From the National Transport Authority perspective, we have engaged with the advisory committee a great deal and it contains several representatives of the taxi industry in its membership, along with people from other interest groups from other sectors of society.  We value the input from the group and we will amend draft regulations based on the feedback from that group.  We believe it is working and it is a valuable resource giving direct feedback of industry views and those from other parts of society.  In the final regulations that we hope to adopt, we will take on board some of the views given to us.</p><p>  The Deputy mentioned a concern about smaller wheelchair-accessible vehicles.  One of the biggest issues facing the industry is the very limited number of wheelchair-accessible vehicles.  In 2008 there were 1,600 wheelchair-accessible vehicles serving the country but the number is now 916, which is almost half of what it was.  The 2008 number was not an oversupply because of the number of wheelchair users needing these vehicles.  The balance was more or less right at that stage but now we are at half that number.  We get much information about people in wheelchairs waiting for long periods to complete a journey so the issue must be addressed.</p></speech>

There was a requirement to have a newer vehicle but that requirement was abandoned at a later stage, meaning the required upper age limit went from three to six years.  Is it not the case that the approach taken has, perhaps inadvertently, pushed people out of the business?  If people are getting out, they clearly do not see a business in this area, so introducing a possibility for a smaller vehicle that is cheaper to licence still does not guarantee that individuals will pick up the fares of people who need it most.  This is a cheap entry point but will these smaller vehicles ply the regular trade like everybody else?  The unfortunate individuals depending on wheelchair-accessible vehicles will still be in the same position.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-05a.679" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hugh Creegan" time="09:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014030500005#G00400"><p>It would be hard to pick up somebody in a wheelchair if the taxi is not wheelchair-accessible.  We are aware of the possibility that people may get these vehicles and perhaps not use them for their intended purpose.  It is in the regulations that priority is meant to be given to bookings for wheelchair-accessible vehicles, and that is something we can police to a certain extent, although I do not want to present the picture that we can police it totally.  If we become aware of people not giving any bookings to wheelchair-accessible vehicles, we can deal with the issue.  The core issue is that if the vehicle does not exist in the fleet, a person cannot be picked up.  I would prefer to deal with the previous problem rather than not having enough suitable vehicles in the fleet.</p><p>  The Deputy referred to regulatory changes.  The taxi regulation review report adopted by the Government at the start of 2012 set an age limit for vehicles in the longer term of no more than nine years but allowed that existing vehicles in the fleet could operate up to 15 years.  That position was reached as part of the process we went through and it was adopted in the report and introduced to use approximately 18 months ago.  A number of wheelchair-accessible vehicles were reaching the age limit and when that happened, people had the choice to replace the vehicle with another wheelchair-accessible vehicle and licence or buy a second-hand taxi licence with a standard saloon car.  The truth is it is much more expensive to provide larger wheelchair-accessible vehicles, so many people exited the wheelchair-accessible market and bought standard licences and vehicles.  In order to stem the tide of people dropping out of the industry, we provided a band aid in removing the age limit.  We would then try to remedy the issue by way of regulations.</p><p>  The vehicles in question are top class, with type approval and meeting all safety standards.  They are used across the UK in a myriad of jurisdictions, as I checked before coming here.  There are different licensing authorities across the UK and 119 of them use the type of vehicles that we are proposing for use here.  I can understand some of the concerns of the industry if we consider the bigger picture and see there is a massive problem in the insufficient number of wheelchair-accessible vehicles.  It would be inappropriate if we do not allow this type of vehicles in common use elsewhere and say they are not suitable for Ireland.  We have mentioned the taxi advisory committee and it had a demonstration of a model.  It was recognised that this is a modern vehicle capable of carrying people very easily, successfully and safely.  As the vehicle is in wide use, it is perfectly suitable for use here, and there is no rational reason it is not suitable for Ireland.</p><p>  The Deputy mentioned the three-year and six-year limits.</p> <p>With regard to buying a new wheelchair accessible licence, there has been no three year rule in existence for a number of years.  In fact, if one buys a new wheelchair accessible licence now, one is allowed to put a vehicle up to ten years of age on that licence, so there is no three year age rule for wheelchair accessible vehicles.  There is for people who are transferring certain taxis, but that is not what the Deputy is referring to in this case.  We still want to get a degree of quality in the industry so we have proposed a six year maximum age at the point of entry in the draft regulations.  We are coming down from the current situation, which is larger vehicle only but it can be up to ten years of age, to the proposed situation which is large and medium-sized vehicles - I would not call them small - but the vehicles should be less than six years of age at the point when one gets the new licence.</p><p> In the report regarding the over-supply in the industry and the provision of information on wages and income performance, as part of a taxi fare review in 2012 we carried out surveys and published them.  They indicated fare income levels.  We will carry out another fare review this year and conduct the same survey.  We will try to capture some indication of the income level and we will happily publish that as well.</p><p> In terms of the dormant and inactive licences and the reduction from five years to one year, in the past people could let their licence lapse and reactivate it within five years.  Again, the taxi regulation review report which was adopted by the Government contained a recommendation to reduce the five year period to a one year period, so we are merely reflecting the outcome of that process.</p><p> On the advertising on vehicles, we proposed in the draft regulations that there would be a prohibition on advertising.  At present, there are no controls on advertising and we get complaints, particularly about electronic signs at the back of vehicles because people travelling behind them get distracted or blinded by those signs.  We are coming from a situation where there are no controls and we proposed initially that there should be a total prohibition but we think, on reflection, that the position is some place in the middle.  We will be proposing to our board is that we would preclude the use of the electronic signs, about which we have received complaints as they cause problems, preclude the use of advertising on the front doors of the vehicle, because we have just branded them with the signage one sees on the front doors, and so we can monitor the industry we would preclude the use of advertising that has discriminatory or racist content - that is not a problem but it just gives us a tool whereby if there was a problem we could deal with it - but after that we recognise that the current position we adopted is not correct.  We will be proposing that advertising continues to be allowed in vehicles, subject to the limitations I outlined.</p></speech>

In my local area elderly people use a taxi to go to Tesco, Dunnes Stores, Lidl, Aldi or SuperValu and to an elderly individual they all look the same, but they know whether it is a particular taxi company.  A few people have told me they are deeply concerned about that so if it was permissible, it would be appreciated.</p></speech>

The only people who can do that are people who have log in details from us.  If the Deputy did it, for example, we would have in our records the fact that he was the person who did it.  The concern was that we might be prosecuting the poor driver who was inadvertently knocked off the system.  We would not do that.  As soon as he tells us he was logged on and something must have happened, we have the record available to see what happened and see who did it.  We are going to add into the draft regulations a provision to state that such malicious behaviour is an offence and we can deal with it.  It is not there at present, but it will be added.</p><p>  On the Luas ranks issue, there is disruption to many people as a result of building the Luas project through the city.  We are trying to manage that.  There has been a great deal of engagement with the taxi industry.  In terms of the temporary works, each time a rank is affected replacement ranks are identified.  That is not to say everybody is happy all the time because they are not, but people are doing their best to try to get the best replacement package possible.  With regard to the longer term, a certain amount of rank space is being lost in the long term and there are plans for an equivalent amount of replacement.  For the drivers, 56 full-time ranks will be lost through the Luas work but we expect to have more than 56 full-time ranks back by the end of it.  Indeed, there are proposals for a significant amount, potentially 125, of additional night time rank spaces.  We are in dialogue with Dublin City Council because it is a city council function to decide on the ranks.  However, I believe there is enough effort being made to get the right solution to the ranks issue.</p><p>  Concerns about transfers of licences were mentioned.  Transfers of licences are one of the matters affecting the wheelchair accessible vehicles.  If somebody has a choice between spending &euro;10,000 and getting a wheelchair accessible vehicle or buying a second-hand licence and getting a cheaper vehicle, many will take the latter route.  In accordance with the primary legislation, the Taxi Regulation Act 2013, transfers would cease as soon as the relevant section is commenced, which we expect to happen quite soon.</p><p>  With regard to the streamlining of national car testing, NCT, and our taxi licensing, that has been raised with me.  While we will end up with the same service provider doing our testing as does the NCT testing, like everything else it might not be that simple, but we will undertake a commitment to streamline it in so far as it is reasonable for us.</p><p>  As regards vetting, that is carried out by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I know the Garda is conscious of the issue of information from outside the jurisdiction, but I cannot go any further than that.</p><p>  On the issue of credit card charges and drivers to carry the cost of credit card charges, there is a fair amount of uncertainty at present as to what is allowable or not allowable on credit card charges and we wanted to bring clarity to that.  There are people who charge significant fees on top of the fare for accepting payment by credit card.  It appears to be unreasonable that a tourist coming into Dublin Airport takes one taxi and is charged one fee and no credit card charge while in another taxi the fee is in double digits, such as 10%, 11% or 15%.  That has happened and we wish to address it.  It was never our intention that the drivers would have to bear the cost.  Our intention in drafting the regulations was to state that one could not charge anything extra for payment by credit or debit card and that we would follow that through by adjusting the fare structure to add a cent or half cent or whatever was necessary on the euro to compensate drivers, so they are not at a loss.  Again, in consultation with the taxi advisory committee, whether that is the best model or whether another model where we should just put a cap on the fee or credit card charge has been the subject of a fair amount of discussion.  Currently, the NTA is biased towards amending that regulation to simply propose a cap and state that 4% or 5% is the maximum that can be charged for credit card charges.  We are confident that this would at least bring some control to it.  However, the issue was never about trying to impose the charge on the drivers.</p><p>  As regards the declaration of other employment and driving more than 11 hours, the rule about driving more than 11 hours is one of the consolidated regulations.  It has existed for years at this stage.  It is correct that it is very hard to prove that.  Unless somebody honest volunteers that they have done it, it is very hard to prosecute.  However, it is a regulation and we did not wish to lose it for the time being.  On the declaration of other employment, perhaps we could do more on that front but I believe we have brought it a fair distance from where it was.</p></speech>

In common with most Members of the Oireachtas, we would acknowledge the benefits of a taxi industry review.  Some of it is good and some of it, as outlined, has not been entirely favourable.  The principle behind it was much needed.  Whether one is a consumer, taxi driver or legislators, there is no objection to that principle.   </p><p> I wish to focus to the overall taxi industry.  I favour the position held by full-time taxi drivers.  I take the view that one of the curses of the taxi industry in the past has been its part-time element, a view which is sometimes unpopular with people judging by the mail that some of us have received.  Some of the review's recommendations are good and were needed, such as those regarding working hours and I do not need to list them.</p><p> The two principle aims of the review were to make the industry better for the consumer which I agree with and to make it a better industry for taxi drivers.  However, it falls down in one area.  The economy has changed so much and a lot of people invested in the taxi business during the Celtic tiger years when none of us walked anywhere, we could all afford taxi drivers and taxi drivers made a few bob.  At the same time the industry was saturated with a high volume of cars.  The industry has completely changed because we are no longer in the same economic situation.  One of the pitfalls of the review is that it does not focus and has not gone as far as it could have to protect and make a better life for the people who work full-time in the industry.  First, we should take that matter into consideration whether it is Mr. Creegan in his role as director, or ourselves as legislators.  Second, the forthcoming legislation should do as much as possible to protect and make life more bearable for anyone who engages in the industry on a full-time basis.  Deputy Dooley outlined some of the frustrations experienced by full-time taxi drivers.  He is right about them and I agree with him that we must examine these matters.  </p><p> As I stated in my submission, I do not agree with prohibiting taxi drivers from advertising.  I take the director's point about distractions but I can give him a list of distractions that are on the back of buses and other things that are more of a distraction to drivers than a neon sign on the back of a taxi but I shall not go there. </p><p> I am not quite convinced about the small vehicle wheelchair issue.  The director cited the situation in the UK for such a vehicle and the fact that there is input from the local authorities in Britain regarding licences.  My understanding of the matter - the director will correct me if I am wrong - is that it is not a free for all for anyone who wishes to buy a small vehicle because there is a quota.  Perhaps that is not the right word to use.  Not everybody can buy such a vehicle.  We are making a mistake by opening up the sector and allowing everybody and anybody who has the financial resources to buy one of these licences here.  It will be a mistake to do it that way.  Perhaps the director is more familiar with the UK legislation.  From my limited knowledge, the UK has a much better way of policing this new type of licence that may be introduced and protecting full-time taxi drivers who are presently engaged in the industry.</p></speech>

The Deputy alluded to whether a quantitative limit could be put in place.  He is correct that the authorities in some UK locations have found some ways of doing so.  However, as part of the taxi regulation review report in this country it was decided that it was not going to be possible and I think that is correct.  It would not be legally possible here to do that in the way that people might like.  Let us leave put that matter to one side as being incapable of being done.</p><p>  A lot of the other things have been put in place to give some protections to the people who devote themselves to the overall business.  Let us consider the decals on door signage.  It might not be obvious on first glance but a decal makes a difference in terms of whether a part-time person wishes to use his or her vehicle and have it permanently branded.  It means that his or her employer will be aware of it in a way that he or she was not aware of before now.  There have been some benefits that may not be obvious at first glance.  I accept that the scheme is far from perfect.  I do not think that we will ever get perfection but a fair bit of work has been done.  </p><p>  With regard to advertising, neither the current position of being totally uncontrolled nor the position we advocated in draft regulations of full control are the right positions.  We want the middle ground of having only a limited amount of exclusions which would not affect many people.  Most of the advertising that people have on their vehicles would be unaffected by the revised proposals that we are considering taking forward.  </p><p>  I shall repeat what I said earlier about the smaller wheelchair accessible vehicles.  For us it is one of the biggest issues to face the industry.  The provision cannot serve the needs of the mobility impaired.  I am happy that we must keep a watch over the matter in order to make sure that we do not bring it to an incorrect position.  The actions that we propose to take are needed and correct. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-05a.689" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1022" speakername="Dessie Ellis" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014030500007#J00300"><p>I thank Mr. Creegan for his input.  I have raised an awful lot of issues and I ask everyone to bear with me if I repeat them because they are issues that I am still not fully satisfied with.</p><p>  I have always believed that single taxi drivers did not get proper representation on the taxi advisory group.  I have argued the matter with the Minister and the National Transport Authority that the multiple taxi drivers had more of an input and that bit was missing. </p><p>  The local area hackney licence is the second hackney licence that we hope to bring in.  Local authorities will have an input and potential hackney drivers must undertake a specific test that comprises knowledge of the area and what it entails.  I would like to hear more about the new scheme.  It will impact on other hackneys and taxis in certain areas.  I accept that the new scheme is very specific but I fear that its introduction will have an adverse affect. </p><p>  With regard to the issues of pooling, its legality and insurance issues, the Minister has flagged the issue on a number of occasions.  Is a driver acting outside of the remit of pooling if he or she picks up people while pooling?  Perhaps people have to assemble at one spot before they can be picked up.  I would like Mr. Creegan to elaborate on the matter.  </p><p>   I am still baffled about applications where an operator can type in the number of another vehicle and remove a name.  That seems to me to be a huge security breach.  The matter has been dismissed even though the authority knew there was a problem.  It does not make sense that a name can be removed.  I do not have the answer and I am not satisfied with the answer supplied that the problem is acceptable and we knew it was going to happen.</p><p>  Will a grant be provided for the purchase of disabled vehicles?  We know that there are three types of vehicles being considered by the authority, they are the same as the ones in the UK and the entrance is from the back.</p> <p>Recently I learned of an issue with a family where they could not get down the path and had to go up the road, half a mile, to get onto the road and access a vehicle.  How can we deal with entrances now being located at the back?  I have been led to believe that the entrances will be at the back.  I assume that money will be made available to provide ramps or something.  Maybe it will come out of the money the NTA accumulates on ongoing basis.  The local authority will not have the resources, unless it is provided with resources, to dig paths for people in these situations.  It will become very difficult.  A makeshift system is not good enough.</p><p> The Minister referred to 600 people with criminal convictions in the industry.  It was a bad remark and I do not know whether the NTA had any input.  Making a remark like that without backing it up worries consumers and people who were going to use taxis.  It was inappropriate.</p><p> With regard to money raised from licences, money was transferred to the NTA when this started off.  Some of it has been used.  What will we do?  We know about the issue of the rank in O'Connell Street with the works that will take place there.  It looks like there will be more spaces, as the NTA says, but that they will not be on O'Connell Street.  We must have a proper, accessible situation in O'Connell Street.  The Gresham Hotel rank has been there for years and is the most widely used.  There must be a solution and we cannot have all other vehicles going up and down O'Connell Street as well as a place to get a taxi.  People must go down a side street and they will not be prepared to do so.  I know that from my experience.  Perhaps the rank can be brought around the corner so that people can queue and taxis can come around the corner onto O'Connell Street.  There is some sense in that idea but there must be some solution with local authorities.  When works will be is completed, we still will not have access.</p><p> The licence period reduced from five years to one year.  In one case, a taxi man had a car crash.  The case has been settled and the man has received no money.  He has waited over one year and has now been told that he will lose his licence.  There is no mechanism to deal with it.  It is absurd.  I do not know the answer because I keep receiving the same stark answer that the person will lose his licence.  There is no mechanism to deal with it.  Perhaps the witnesses can tell me how to deal with it.</p><p> The retrospective aspect of licences was raised earlier.  Some licences were going to different cars to reactivate the licences.  I would like to hear comments on this.  An analysis was supposed to be done on the economic reality of making people aware of the cost to the industry.  Has the analysis been done and is it available?  Many people entering industry do not know that there have been additional costs and rules added.  The analysis was supposed to be done and I am not sure whether it has been brought forward yet.  </p><p> Are there additional enforcement officers?  Will there be contracts for them and do we know who will avail of the contracts?  Where will the enforcement officers come from?</p><p> A vetting Bill will come before the Houses and I assume we will need to lay down rules.  I am not saying I agree with rules but in Spain drivers must be citizens.  In other countries, there are different rules.  We must have something more steady.  We can check the backgrounds of EU nationals but there in other areas throughout the world we cannot check people's backgrounds for a variety of reasons.  We must have clearer indicators on that point.  I would like to hear the view of the witnesses on this.</p><p> Is it still the case that people have taxi plates just to use bus lanes and are not actively using the vehicle as a taxi?  Are we examining such people and taking licences from them?  In the past, criminals got taxi licences just to use bus lanes.  I would like to hear some comment on this.</p><p> When someone flags down a taxi, the taxi will pull up but the driver may be told taxis cannot pull up in certain places, such as bus lanes.  There is a possibility of prosecuting people but there must be some flexibility.  There is talk of CCTV being used in evidence against people in these cases.  This is very unfair to taxi people, who must drive around the city waiting to collect fares.  We have the issue of people driving around and there must be some flexibility by not applying penalty points or fines in those situations.</p></speech>

The membership of the advisory committee is outside the ambit of the NTA.  The Minister appoints the membership so we have no role.</p><p>  The Deputy had a number of questions about how the local area hackney works.  It was one of the recommendations in the Government review.  In rural areas, where people find it difficult to access services, we needed to devise a solution and the solution was a local area hackney.  It tries to strike a balance between catering for people who genuinely do not have their transport needs met and not taking away the livelihoods of industry people trying to deliver the service in the area.  It tries to strike a balance between the two.  It is a hackney licence and, before it can be granted, the applicant needs two key elements.  The first is the endorsement of a local not-for-profit group, a registered charity or a local business group endorsing the need for it.  Step two, which is more important from our perspective, is that the local authority in the area must be involved by carrying out a simple assessment of the needs in the area and must confirm that transport demand is not capable of being met in other ways.  That was brought in at the end of November.  These are the key components.  Costs are kept low so that cost is not an impediment.  The Deputy also mentioned area knowledge but, because it is a local area of operation, there is no local area knowledge test.  No area knowledge test is required because it is specific to a local area.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-05a.693" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hugh Creegan" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014030500008#K00400"><p>The licence for this only allows people to drive a particular type of vehicle and to operate in a particular area only.  The licence does not allow people to drive a taxi, a normal hackney or a limousine.  It is purely to serve the needs of the local rural area.  An area knowledge test does not apply and would not make sense.  Someone coming from the area knows far more about it than any test or set of questions we could set.  A test is not part of it.</p><p>  With regard to car pooling or sharing, this is tied into the draft regulations.  We have excluded from draft regulations the need for people involved in non-commercial car sharing to get a licence.  There was a doubt about this.</p> <p>The phrase in the previous Taxi Regulation Act was carrying somebody "for hire or reward", with reward being the key word.  In those circumstances, one must potentially have both a driver's licence and a vehicle licence.  Definitions of "for reward" are much wider than one might think at first glance.  To avoid any problem over two people deciding to share journeys to work and somebody alleging they needed both a driver and a vehicle licence, we simply excluded them categorically.  It is non-commercial car sharing only that is excluded from the licensing.  In terms of insurance for that type of activity, my understanding is that if there is no reward involved, insurance companies have said they are fine with it because it is not a commercial service.  They do not have an issue with private car sharing, as I understand it.</p></speech>

If someone drove from point A to point B and picked up several people along the way, how would that be viewed?</p></speech>

A person could be picking up two or three people along the route.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-05a.698" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hugh Creegan" time="10:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014030500009#L00500"><p>My understanding, on foot of correspondence with insurance companies, is that if it is genuinely not for reward, non-commercial and is literally what is says on the tin, that is, car sharing between people who probably know each other, then they deem that to be covered by normal domestic and social use policies.  However, if it crosses the line and takes on a commercial or reward aspect, then special insurance is required.</p><p>  In terms of the driver check application to which the Deputy referred, any taxi driver can potentially be driving any licensed taxi vehicle.  Therefore, we could not devise a system that said that the taxi driver, Mr. Smith, can only be connected to vehicle X.  Potentially, he could be driving any vehicle.  We have had to devise a system whereby the driver tells us which vehicle he or she is driving.  In the main, we have had no problems on this front.  If a problem arises, we have the information available to understand categorically what has occurred and we would not prosecute somebody for a problem that was not of their making.</p><p>  On the question of grants for wheelchair accessible vehicles, it is our intention later this year - if these regulations are adopted - to try to put some kind of grant scheme in place to increase the number of wheelchair accessible vehicles in the fleet.  That is important to us and we acknowledge that we need to do something on that front.  On the Minister's remarks regarding those with criminal convictions working in the taxi industry, I did not hear those remarks first-hand and would prefer not to comment for that reason.  I do not know the ins and outs of it.</p><p>  We understand the concerns about the rank on O'Connell Street.  We have had a lot of discussions with Dublin City Council and the taxi representative groups about the rank.  It is a very busy street in the context of the use of kerbside space but I know that Dublin City Council has developed a number of different options.  It is envisaged that a preferred option will be identified in the coming months and we will then determine if that meets everyone's needs.</p></speech>

That may mean that drivers queue along the side streets and come onto the rank as spaces become available.  That might alleviate the problem.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-05a.700" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hugh Creegan" time="10:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014030500009#L00700"><p>I understand that one of the options is that drivers would queue on a feeder rank on Cathal Brugha Street for the main rank around the corner on O'Connell Street.  I do not know if that would give rise to problems but it is one of the options that is being actively explored at the moment.  It will take a little bit more time before a preferred solution emerges but everyone is conscious of the sensitivity of that particular location.</p><p>  The Deputy also referred to people activating multiple licences using the same vehicle.  We are conscious that this occurs in a number of places but it is in compliance with the regulations.  While it might not seem satisfactory at first glance, it is actually compliant with the regulations.  However, if a vehicle is moved from one licence to another, the licence that was taken off the vehicle is then on a time limit.  It must be attached to another vehicle within one year or it will expire.  We will see what happens over the next while in that regard but we are aware it is going on in a very small way.  When we looked closely at it, however, we could not say there was anything technically wrong with it.</p><p>  I referred earlier to the analysis of costs for people entering the industry and it is our intention to conduct a fare review later this year.  As part of that review, we intend to gather and publish information on driver income or potential income.  The issue of enforcement officers was raised and from our point of view, because the taxi industry is a 24-hour, seven days a week industry, across every county in the country, with only eight enforcement officers we cannot police the whole country.  We very much rely on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which has the capability of covering the country, even though we totally understand that it has numerous other priorities at any given time.  We are going to supplement our enforcement team in 2014 with the engagement of an external service provider.  That service provider will appoint 15 personnel, all of whom are ex-garda&iacute;, and once the Taxi Regulation Act is commenced and we are able to authorise them in the way we want to, they will supplement our own eight enforcement officers.  We will do our best to increase enforcement throughout the country using that additional resource.</p></speech>

Mr. Creegan has used the term "external service provider", so these people will not be enforcement officers of the NTA.  They will be working alongside the eight enforcement officers already on the ground.  Is that what Mr. Creegan is saying?</p></speech>

A company called Applus, which also runs the NCT, won the contract.  We have agreed with Applus that it will provide 15 personnel to perform enforcement functions throughout the country.  All 15 are ex-garda&iacute; but until the Taxi Regulation Act is commenced, we cannot give them the same powers as those of our own authorised officers.  As soon as the legislation is commenced, we intend to give them equivalent powers and they will be able to provide the same service as that provided by our own enforcement officers at present.  We will have 23 enforcement officers in place during 2015.</p></speech>

It is more difficult than we would like it to be.  Effectively, what we have to do is engage the driver, take the journey, pay the fare and then we can prove in court that a journey was taken for hire or reward.  As one can imagine, because we have only eight compliance officers, they have become pretty well-known around the country so it is very hard to do that.  We get a lot of co-operation from the Garda which gives us people from other counties to take the journey, but it is more difficult that we would like it to be.</p></speech>

It is not that we have a solution and are seeking legislative change.  We do not have one but I am pointing out that it is a difficult exercise to catch an unlicensed operator and prove it in court.

I know it is very difficult for the Garda to get information from certain jurisdictions, but beyond that, I would not feel competent to deal with the Deputy's question.</p><p>  On taxis being used by people to access the bus lanes, I have no evidence of that happening.  I am aware some taxis were bought in the past for that purpose, but at that time, all one needed to do was to put on a roof sign and one could take it off again at the end of one's journey.  Now, however, the fact that taxis must have permanent signs on the front doors has diminished the attractiveness of that proposition.</p><p>  Pulling up in unsuitable places and the use of CCTV has been mentioned.  There is an issue with a lack of rank space in various places and drivers are queueing in inappropriate places to try to gain fares.</p> <p>I understand the reason for the argument that those who pull up should not be pursued and prosecuted, however, the drivers who have queued legitimately are just as upset that we are not dealing with the issue.  We get as many complaints about not dealing with the issue as we get about dealing with it.  We try to be pragmatic.  We understand the difficulties and are not terribly draconian.   Drivers who have been in a queue for between 30 minutes and an hour are upset when somebody who gets ahead out of turn gets the fare.</p></speech>

In my view we may have been able to kill two birds with one stone if we had offered a dual licence, the small public service vehicle licence with the rural hackney licence?  Will Mr. Creegan say whether these licences are compatible?  If I were living in a rural area and applying for the hackney licence and thought it would be beneficial to get a licence for small public service vehicle, I think I would do so if it were incentivised.  The only way we can incentivise the take up of this licence is by offering a grant.  People in wheelchairs are more affected if they live in a rural area that has no taxi or hackney licensed vehicles.  If we were to consider a combination of the three licences, that might incentivise a greater take up.   Mr. Creegan may have evidence to contradict that point.  Some people in wheelchairs have no way to leave their homes.  I think the rural hackney licence is a very good idea, but I have no idea how many will take it up.</p></speech>

My perception is that if a service were commercially viable in the area, it would already be offered.  Our assumption is that a person who uses his or her own vehicle operates on a part-time basis and provides the service locally.  In the absence of any other service in the area, that seems the right thing.  If we were to demand that the licence holder must have a wheelchair accessible vehicle, which is much more expensive, that might create a difficulty.   The service may evolve in the future but we would not want to do this at the start.</p><p>  On the question of servicing the wheelchair needs in rural areas, we will consider whether we need to be very targeted when we decide our grant scheme for wheelchair vehicles.  When one looks at the provision of wheelchair accessible vehicles on a county basis, there are certain areas of the country which have less wheelchair accessible vehicles than other areas and I think we need to be clever about how we target this to try to get appropriate solutions.</p></speech>

The reason is that those who have a hackney licence already would not have a hope of passing the knowledge test, which is now a condition of the licence.  I would expect the Chairman to have a good knowledge of County Mayo but I can guarantee if he had to sit the test for a hackney licence in County Mayo, he would not pass it.  I have tabled parliamentary questions on this test umpteen times.  If one has the misfortune to be from one of the larger counties, the greater the likelihood of failing the test.  Rather than examining the reason that people are failing the test - those who fail are not in anyway out of touch with the local community - the test is out of touch with the service that people want.  I have cited the following example many times but nobody appears to be listening.  Shannon Banks is in County Clare but is near Corbally, County Limerick, and a hackney driver would need to know where Patrick Street, Roches Street and the roads out as far as Patrick's Well down to Castletroy are in County Limerick to serve the needs of his customers, however a person from Shannon Banks must pass a knowledge test on Doolin, Cooraclare, Ballynakelly and Loop Head, areas in County Clare one will never service.  The knowledge test is not based on the functional area but on the geographical area.  I have seen a knowledge test and the questions that a person from west Limerick would be expected to answer, for example, " On what street in Doon is the post office?".  Doon is approximately 50 miles from Abbeyfeale.  Anybody who sits into a hackney car in Abbeyfeale and asks to be taken to Doon is a delight for the driver and by the time he gets to Doon he will know where the post office is located.  </p><p>  I think it is absolutely bonkers that a hackney driver on the Mayo side of Ballaghaderreen would be expected to know about places in Blacksod and Bellmullet and expected to be able to deliver the person there.  I think nobody can pass those tests.  I agree with the concept of a knowledge test, but a person from Abbeyfeale should know about the streets in Knocknagoshel, County Kerry, as well as Finuge and Ballylongford in County Kerry, but these places do not come up in the test at all.  This is the area in which he or she will work. </p><p>  I think the knowledge test is designed to make people fail.  Unfairness is built into the design of the test.  Nobody will convince me otherwise.  It appears that the test is designed to limit the number of licences because nobody knows if those who have a licence will pass the test but very few others will pass that test.</p></speech>

I agree there should be a knowledge test, but it should be based on the functional area of the licence holder not an aspirational area.

I am not going to win this argument.  We have looked at this issue previously.  The Deputy thinks the current 26 geographic areas should be subdivided into a myriad of local areas.  I think that scenario is unworkable.  Enforcement would be unworkable.  Every driver with a hackney licence is entitle to drive not just a hackney car but a taxi and a limousine.  If one gets a licence in County Limerick, one is entitled to drive a taxi across all of County Limerick.  One puts an "L" on the roofsign and one is entitled to ply for hire.  I could not contemplate how one would could limit a driver to a radius of his or her local area.</p></speech>

It is very easy to apply the knowledge test to the area of the grid which relates to the area in which the person has applied for the licence.  If a person picks up a fare in Limerick and is being asked to drive to Donegal, good luck to him because he will do well but by the same token would Mr. Creegan accept that the majority of the work will be inside a defined functional area?</p></speech>
