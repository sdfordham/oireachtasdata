Agreed.  There are no matters arising.</p> <p>  We will now deal with correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers.  Correspondence has been received from the HSE on prompt payment compensation, to be noted and published.  This is an ongoing issue, particularly within the health sector, and chapter 19 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report deals specifically with this issue.  The HSE will be before the committee on 22 October and this chapter and particular issue can be dealt with at that stage.</p> <p>  Correspondence has been received from Dr. Maria Hinfelaar, president of Limerick Institute of Technology, LIT, regarding the issue of surplus staff in LIT, to be noted and published.  This letter clarifies the position of staff who were supernumerary following the amalgamation of Tipperary Institute to LIT.  I note the four surplus staff have been redeployed and the whole amalgamation, on the basis of the points being made by the president, is delivering a better utilisation of resources.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1058" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015100800002#E00400"><p>Very briefly, on the concept of supernumerary positions, this is the first time it has come up regarding the positions in LIT.  I received recently correspondence from the HSE stating it is unable to provide information on the number of supernumerary positions, if any.  Does the Comptroller and Auditor General examine this in the other organisations he audits?  It hit the headlines when it came out that three people did not have positions for a number of years.  How widespread is this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015100800002#E00500"><p>A distinction needs to be made.  A framework level of employment is set for each public body.  We can have a situation where further people work in the organisation, and a distinction needs to be made regarding people who have jobs even if they are in excess of the permitted level, and this does arise and we do look at it.  Most, or all, of the appropriation accounts should declare numbers.  Financial statements should also declare the number of staff employed in the organisation.  This provides information and feedback to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and supervising Departments in order that they can state they told an organisation it could only have 400 staff but it has 450.  This is the feedback mechanism.  I draw a distinction between additional nurses or teachers working in classrooms or wards and a situation where staff have no specific purpose delivering outputs or services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1058" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015100800002#E00600"><p>This is the question I wanted to get to, because the HSE told me it does not provide details of staff who may be in supernumerary positions.  Based on the LIT experience, do we have any indication as to how many more of these types of positions there are in the public sector whereby people turn up for work who do not have a job?</p></speech>

It can happen for frictional reasons, let us say, within a year, but when something is ongoing for a number of years, we certainly report it.</p></speech>

Correspondence has been received from an anonymous source regarding funding to Mannix College, County Cork, to be noted and forwarded to Cork Education and Training Board for a note on the matter.</p> <p>  We will now deal with documents relating to today&rsquo;s committee meeting.  Nos. 3C.1 to 3C.6 are the opening statements and presentations for today&rsquo;s session, to be noted and published.</p> <p>  No. 4 is reports, statements and accounts received since our meeting on 1 October.  I will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to comment on some of the audit outcomes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015100800002#E01200"><p>There is clear audit opinion in all cases.  With regard to the Irish Blood Transfusion Service and the matter reported last year, the same situation was continuing but obviously the aggregates had become greater and I have drawn attention in the audit certificate to two notes relevant to this.  Note 2 discloses that pension related deductions from staff salaries held by the Irish Blood Transfusion Service stood at &euro;10.3 million on 31 December 2014 and had still not been remitted as of that date to the Department of Health.  On the pension scheme side, the deficit shown by the Irish Blood Transfusion Service financial statements on 31 December 2014 had risen to &euro;92 million from &euro;42 million at the end of 2013.</p> <p>  The 2013 financial statements of the national paediatric hospital development board were listed for consideration today, but the financial statements for 2014 were signed on 1 October and have been submitted.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015100800002#E01300"><p>Is it agreed to note these accounts?  Agreed.</p> <p>  We have received further correspondence from HL Commodity Foods regarding previous comments and hearings of the Committee of Public Accounts and I will circulate it to members.  I want to have it noted and published in due course.  We should get a reply alongside it.  Members will not have seen it, so perhaps we should also ask for the reply from the Department in order that we have both before us when we are considering it.</p> <p>  With regard to the report on Cork Institute of Technology, CIT, and our meeting with the Secretary General of the relevant Department, the cost of doing the report was noted at &euro;65,000.</p><p>New figures indicate that the cost was &euro;100,000.  I am referring to the redacted report which we received.  We need to get back to this issue and deal with all the aspects of the report that have been raised with us.  I will ask the clerk to put the issue of the CIT on the agenda for next week.</p><p> The Committee of Public Accounts seems to be mentioned a great deal in the D&aacute;il these days.  Yesterday, the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy Damien English, responded to a Topical Issue matter on the University of Limerick that was dealt with by this committee.  The correspondence dates back to 27 April 2012 and March 2012.  There are serious issues to be addressed and yesterday it was revealed that it had been brought to the Minister's attention that there are now legal proceedings in this case.  We should receive an up-to-date report on the University of Limerick and the issues that were raised yesterday so that we can discuss them with the HEA when its representatives are next before the committee, which will be shortly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1058" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015100800002#F00200"><p>I agree with the Chairman.  There is a reputational issue for the University of Limerick and it is in everybody's interest that it be clarified as soon as possible.  These allegations are serious and have been around for a while, so the sooner either the Comptroller and Auditor General or the committee itself deals with this the better.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015100800002#F00300"><p>The allegations that were brought to the attention of the committee in March 2012 were sent to my office but they were also sent to the university, which responded to them by the end of April 2012.  We subsequently examined the issues.  We were finishing the audits at the time and the fieldwork had been completed on the periods in which these incidents had occurred but we also examined them when we went back in again.  Our focus was on whether control lapses, if there were any, were continuing in the organisation.  We have followed up on the nature of the problems that were identified and have drawn to the attention of the university matters in the management letters concerning control lapses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1058" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015100800002#F00400"><p>Is Mr. McCarthy satisfied that those control lapses are being dealt with?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015100800002#F00600"><p>I will ask the clerk to circulate the correspondence from Deputy Niall Collins and the attachment to it, which outlines everything - as well as the correspondence from the University of Limerick - so that members are kept informed.  I will also seek an up-to-date report on the position from the Department.</p> <p>  Our work programme is on the screen.  We have agreed with Inland Fisheries Ireland that its representatives will come before us next week.  The HSE and the Department of Justice and Equality will also be coming before us in the near future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015100800002#F00700"><p>As the Chairman will be aware, the Dublin Docklands Development Authority (Dissolution) Bill is before the D&aacute;il.  When it is passed it will have transferred the functions of the authority to Dublin City Council.  I do not know what are the implications of that for the relevance of a non-existing board coming before this committee.  How are we getting on with the report we are putting together?  At the last meeting, we referred to Longboat Quay and whether or not a couple of paragraphs could be included relating to that.  We also asked whether we could have the DDDA before the committee.  I do not know what the Comptroller and Auditor General would have to say about that but there is not much sense in a non-existent board coming before us after this legislation has passed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015100800002#F00800"><p>The report will be completed tomorrow and then circulated.  The request to have a comment in it, including the possibility of some recrimination, relating to Longboat Quay was agreed at our last meeting and it will be included.  If the legislation is passed and the board no longer exists then we cannot bring them in.  There will be recommendations in the report but if members want to make further strong recommendations on the current issue and any other issues that arise in the report they should contact the clerk.  That, then, will be our work done.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015100800002#F00900"><p>I suggest that in the context of the work programme we would agree a date for them to come in before the legislation is passed.  I do not know how long it will take but the legislation will be dependent on a ministerial order stipulating the date on which the functions will transfer, so I imagine it will be at least some weeks, at the very earliest, before the legislation can be passed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.26" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015100800002#F01000"><p>There will certainly need to be an audited wrap-up set of financial statements in any event, even if the dissolution was to happen immediately or before the end of the year.  I would expect there to be continuing accountability arrangements in place.  Members should note that it is the chief executive who is accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts, rather than the board, and it is unusual to have a board before the committee, though it has occurred occasionally and, indeed, the chairman of the board was before the committee relating to the Irish Glass Bottle site report.  I cannot recall if the 2014 financial statements have been examined.  The audit has been completed but they may be available and the committee could centre a hearing around these.  I can check the position and get back to the Deputy.</p></speech>

We can have a session based on the accounts and on our report.</p></speech>

Would it be possible to get a report from the CEOs of the four Dublin local authorities on why, in the context of what is on the news every day, they refused the houses offered to them by NAMA?  Would it be possible for us to examine this closely again?  The numbers aired here last week took people by surprise and I would like to have an understanding of why they refused them.</p></speech>

I will confine my remarks to Vote 38 and to the report on the IBTS pension issues.  I will comment on the children&rsquo;s hospital at the later session.</p> <p>  In 2014, Vote 38 for health received Exchequer funding to meet the cost of salaries and expenses incurred by the Office of the Minister for Health, to provide grant funding for a number of bodies under the aegis of the Department of Health, and to meet the cost of certain other services.  Members will be aware that for 2015, the Vote for health includes Exchequer funding for the Health Service Executive.  In 2014, this did not go through Vote 38, the HSE had its own Vote.  As a result, the structure of the Vote for health will be radically different in the future.</p> <p>  Gross expenditure of &euro;194.8 million was incurred on Vote 38 in 2014, against an estimate of &euro;205.9 million.  The  underspend of &euro;11.1 million, combined with higher than budgeted receipts of &euro;800,000, resulted in a surrender of &euro;11.9 million to the Exchequer.  By 2014, most Votes had moved to presenting information on a programme basis.  The objective of that format is to try to present financial information in a way that facilitates a focus on the objectives of spending, rather than on inputs or on spending types.  Vote 38 was an exception; grouping spending under headings related to administration, recurring grants, capital grants and a miscellaneous other services category, which accounted for 55% of the overall vote expenditure.</p> <p>  At an individual subhead level, the most significant Vote expenditure in 2014 was on: recurrent grants to development, consultative, supervisory, regulatory and advisory bodies for the health sector, totalling &euro;47.8 million; research grants totalling &euro;34.9 million; payments totalling &euro;27.2 million related to ongoing compensation for victims of hepatitis C contamination of the blood supply, and payments totalling over &euro;17 million in relation to inquiries, legal fees and settlements.  Administration costs incurred by the Department totalled &euro;26.9 million.</p> <p>  A primary aim of appropriation accounting is to report and explain variances between the sums voted by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and the outturn.  Explanations for significant variances in expenditure are given in note 3 and for variances in amounts receivable by the Vote in note 4.  The main areas where the expenditure outturn was significantly lower than the amounts provided were in respect of administration costs, which were some &euro;4 million less than the estimate.  Amounts of recurrent grants paid to health sector agencies was &euro;8.8 million lower than budgeted - this was largely due to unfilled posts in agencies, including the Health Information and Quality Authority HIQA and the Mental Health Commission.  The lower than budgeted expenditure in these areas was partly offset by higher than budgeted expenditure of &euro;6.9 million under subhead D, which is provided to cover the cost of inquiries, legal fees and settlements.  The Department noted that the excess on this subhead arose largely as a result of higher than expected payments made under the Lourdes Hospital and symphysiotomy payment schemes, and in relation to medical negligence claims.</p> <p>  The Irish Blood Transfusion Service is a statutory body established in 1965 and operating under the aegis of the Department of Health.  Its primary functions are the collection, processing and supply of blood and blood products.  The safe supply of such products is a critical element in the provision of health services in the State - the importance of this activity is underscored by the number of citizens who in the past suffered serious infection through the blood supply, and the ongoing cost to the taxpayer of compensation payments and of the provision of services to them.</p> <p>  The IBTS does not receive State funding by way of an annual grant.  All of its recurring income is derived from charges in respect of the supply and testing of blood and blood products.  The charge out rates are decided by the Minister for Health.  In 2009, IBTS earned income in the region of &euro;118 million.  By 2013, its income had fallen to approximately &euro;66 million, reflecting the transfer of responsibilities to St James's Hospital, changes in demand for certain products and price reductions.</p> <p>  The Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2013 includes a chapter in respect of a long-standing dispute between the Department and IBTS about amounts deducted from staff salaries in respect of pension-related deductions.</p><p>I should point out here that pension-related deductions are not the same as employee pension contributions.  In effect, the deductions are a salary reduction measure.  The 2009 FEMPI legislation provided for pension-related deductions from the remuneration of public servants from 1 March 2009.  Between 2009 and 2013, IBTS deducted &euro;8.7 million from staff remuneration in this regard, but at September 2014 had not paid over any of these amounts to the Department of Health as provided for in the legislation.  The 2014 financial statements indicate that the amount due to the Department at the end of that year had increased to &euro;10.3 million.  As a result, funding of that amount receivable by the Vote for health has not been received, and the provisions of the FEMPI Act are not being complied with in that regard.</p><p> The second issue in dispute relates to IBTS pension funding.  IBTS operates a funded defined benefit pension scheme for its employees, which is contributory.  In common with many other funded defined benefit schemes, the IBTS scheme is a balance of cost scheme.  This means that while the contribution rate for employees is fixed as a percentage of salary, the contribution IBTS, as the employer, is liable to pay into the fund goes up or down as required to ensure that the funding will be sufficient to meet the liabilities when they fall due.  Between 2011 and April 2014, IBTS made additional contributions of &euro;9.3 million to the pension scheme.  Notwithstanding the additional contributions, at the end of 2013 the pension fund deficit was estimated at &euro;42 million.  By end 2014, this had increased to &euro;92 million.  The movement year-on-year illustrates the volatility of pension liability estimation, which can be seen in the accounts of many State bodies.  At the time I reported, discussions were ongoing between IBTS, the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the resolution of both of these matters.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.57" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Breslin" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015100800002#H00200"><p>I am here today to deal with the annual report and appropriation accounts of the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of Vote 38, the Department of Health.  I am very happy to be here on my first occasion as Accounting Officer for the Department of Health's Vote.  The Department of Health is relatively small, with 350 staff directly on its payroll.  In 2013 it was responsible for a budget of some &euro;248 million and, as the Comptroller and Auditor General has said, that budget was &euro;206 million in 2014.  The budget covered the salaries and expenses of the office of the Minister and certain other services administered by that office, including grants to research, consultative and advisory bodies.</p> <p>  After more than a decade of change in the wider health sector, it is important that the Department of Health redefine its role to take account of these developments and to meet future challenges.  The Department's statement of strategy for the period 2015-2017 identifies the following four main elements to the Department&rsquo;s role: leadership and policy direction for the health sector to improve health outcomes; governance and performance oversight to ensure accountable and high-quality services; collaboration to achieve health priorities and contribute to wider social and economic goals; and the creation of an organisational environment where, on an ongoing basis, high performance is achieved and the knowledge and skills of staff are developed.  A programme of change is under way in the Department and our aim is to create an organisational environment that will position us to fulfil our role and achieve our priorities in the most effective way possible.  This programme of change also includes new assignment of management team responsibilities and the recruitment of new members to the management team, including a deputy secretary general for governance and performance and a deputy secretary general for policy and strategy, together with an assistant secretary for research and development and health analytics. </p> <p>  I will turn now to the IBTS pension fund.  When the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 was initially introduced, the IBTS questioned whether its staff should be liable for the pension-related deductions provided for under the FEMPI legislation, as employees of the IBTS are members of a long-standing private pension scheme.  The Department communicated to the IBTS from the outset that its staff were subject to the pension levy and stressed at every opportunity the necessity of remitting the pension-related deductions collected from employees.  The IBTS, which subsequently accepted that the legislation applies to its employees, linked the non-remittance of pension levy funds to the need to address a deficit in the IBTS pension fund.  Various efforts have been made to resolve the issue and considerable progress has been made in recent months.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Health are participating in conciliation talks with the IBTS and employee representatives under the auspices of the newly created Workplace Relations Commission with a view to reaching a sustainable conclusion.  In line with the IBTS pension fund's trust deed, any changes in pension arrangements have to be agreed by the employees.  At a Workplace Relations Commission conciliation conference attended by all parties on 2 October 2015, a proposal was put forward by the commission.  This proposal will be considered further by the IBTS and its employees.  However, the proposal is acceptable to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Health, and it is the hope of both Departments that it can bring resolution to the matters set out by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his report.</p> <p>  I will now set out the main points of the 2013 accounts as they pertain to Vote 38.  Funding is allocated to the Department of Health under Vote 38.  Through this Vote, funding is also allocated to bodies under the aegis of the Department, such as the Mental Health Commission, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and the Health Information and Quality Authority.  The 2013 provision, current and capital, for Vote 38 was almost &euro;248 million.  The 2013 outturn was almost &euro;220 million, leaving an overall saving of &euro;28 million.  The 2013 provision for current expenditure was &euro;233 million and the outturn was &euro;208 million, giving a saving of &euro;25 million.  In 2013, &euro;20 million of this saving was used to offset the Supplementary Estimate requirement for Vote 39, the Health Service Executive, thereby reducing the call on the Exchequer.  The 2013 provision for capital expenditure was almost &euro;14 million and the outturn was &euro;11 million, a saving of &euro;4 million.  The majority of this saving was due to timing issues on projects, particularly the construction of a clinical research facility at University Hospital Galway, which, I am delighted to say, was recently opened.  The contingency allocation was not required.  Further detail is provided in the opening statement on the breakdown of the appropriation account, and I might skip over that in the interest of time.</p> <p>  As members will be aware, under the provisions of the Health Service Executive (Financial Matters) Act 2014, the Vote of the Health Service Executive is disestablished and funding of the HSE is now provided from the Vote of the Minister for Health, Vote 38, with effect from 1 January 2015.  I look forward in future years to accounting to the committee for this expenditure as part of my Accounting Officer duties.  </p> <p>  In my capacity as Secretary General I am seeking to develop the Department&rsquo;s policy and performance oversight of the entire range of complex services falling within total public health expenditure.  I have mentioned the change programme under way in the Department, including the revised management team responsibilities which seek to equip us for this aspect of our role, amongst others.  I look forward to working with the committee, and with the Oireachtas generally, on this objective.  I am happy to take any questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.58" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrew Kelly" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015100800002#H00300"><p>My opening statement will deal with the issue of the IBTS pension scheme under four headings: the background to the scheme; pension-related deductions; the funding requirement; and discussions to resolve the issue.</p> <p>  The IBTS, formerly the Blood Transfusion Service Board, was established by a statutory instrument, SI 78/1965, to organise and administer a blood transfusion service.  The pension scheme was set up under indenture, or a trust deed, in 1963.  When the Blood Transfusion Service was established in 1965 to replace the National Blood Transfusion Association, one of the functions of the new body was "to take over the property (including choses-in-action), assets, rights and liabilities of the Company."  This would have included the pension scheme.  </p> <p>  The IBTS operates a defined benefit pension scheme, which is a balance of costs scheme.  Under the terms of the trust deed, any increase in contribution required to be paid following an actuarial valuation to ensure that the benefits under the scheme are funded falls to be paid by the employer.  Currently the employer pays 30% of payroll and the employees contribute, on average, 6.3%.  The benefits under the scheme are broadly in line with other public sector models and these have been actuarially evaluated and found to be comparable.  </p> <p>  I will now discuss the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 and the pension-related deduction.  The background to the application of the FEMPI Act 2009 is dealt with in detail in the briefing paper.  The FEMPI Act was introduced at a critical point in the consultation process with employees regarding funding of the scheme where the employer was seeking an increased contribution from employees to address the funding issue.</p><p>However, it is necessary to reiterate that initially the IBTS was informed that the Act did not apply.  This was subsequently changed to state that the staff in the IBTS were covered by the terms of the Act and should pay the PRD.  The board sought legal advice from senior counsel, which advised that the IBTS pension scheme did not fall within the definition of a public service scheme in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest  Act 2009 and, therefore, the terms of the Act did not apply.  The board decided to deduct the PRD from staff but the moneys were not remitted to the Department of Health.  Since April 2015, the IBTS has remitted the PRD collected from members of the single public service pension scheme and the amount in excess of &euro;10 million in respect of all other staff.  The total amount remitted to 30 June is &euro;1.268 million.  In addition, the IBTS pension scheme was deemed a private pension scheme for the purposes of the Government levy on private pension schemes.  This resulted in &euro;2.44 million being deducted from the value of the assets in the IBTS pension fund.</p><p> I refer to the funding requirement.  As with a large number of defined benefit schemes, there is a deficit in the IBTS fund.  The deficit from the most recent actuarial valuation on 1 May 2014 was &euro;27.921 million.  The funding requirement has increased substantially over the past decade.  The following shows the increase in the employer contribution required to fund the current level of benefits: 2005, 14% equation to a value of &euro;2.93 million; 2008, 19.5% or &euro;5.33 million; 2011, 20.7% or &euro;5.74 million; and 2014, 30% or &euro;7.22 million.  This is placing an unsustainable burden on the employer and it is clear that the current situation cannot continue.  The IBTS has recognised this for some time and has been in negotiations with staff on changing the terms of the scheme.  This level of increase is having a serious consequence on the funding of the IBTS.  In the current financial year, the core business is performing well except for the increased cost of the pension contribution which has put the organisation into deficit.  This is a very serious issue and needs to be addressed if the IBTS is to continue to provide a blood supply as safe as we can make it.  This means continuing to be current with technological developments.</p><p> The IBTS in the period 2009 to 2014 has, like all public sector bodies, undergone significant change and has reduced its cost base significantly.  This has occurred through a mixture of reductions in pay, controlling and reducing non-pay costs and reducing staff numbers.  In this context, the following reductions-savings have been achieved: pay , &euro;8.578 million or 20.85%; and non-pay, &euro;6.2 million or 18.96%, giving a total of  &euro;14.8 million or 20.1%.  At the same time, there has been a reduction in whole-time equivalents of 89.95 or 15.46%.  These have been achieved at a time the income of the IBTS has reduced by &euro;20.969 million, or 25.7%.  This is primarily as a result of the reduction in the use of blood and platelets.  These have reduced by 13.45% and 14.64%, respectively, in the period 2009 to 2014.  Consequently, the scope for further significant reductions in spending is minimal.  Therefore, the provision of pension arrangements for staff must be addressed In the context of the funding model of the IBTS.</p><p> With regard to discussions to resolve the issue, the IBTS has been engaged with staff and their representatives since 2002 on finding ways of resolving the increasing cost of funding the pension scheme.  To prevent the problem becoming worse, the IBTS changed the pension scheme for new entrants after 1 May 2009.  There is now broad recognition by all parties that the current situation cannot continue and that the measure taken in 2009 is not sufficient.  This means there needs to be a change to the benefits for existing members of the scheme.  The current series of negotiations is about finding a solution that will resolve the pension issue and secure the necessary funding for the IBTS into the future.  These negotiations are being held under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission.  The Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform are involved in this process.  Progress has been made and we will all continue to work together to resolve this outstanding issue.  We are hopeful of a successful conclusion to these negotiations and then the proposal will have to be put to a ballot of all members of the pension scheme.</p></speech>

I will put questions to the Department of Health first.  With regard to the financial statements, a contract was awarded relating to University Hospital Galway, UHG, to the value of &euro;62,000 but there was no public procurement process.  The reason cited by the Department was that specialist expertise was required.  What expertise was required?  To whom was the contract awarded?  Had the person who got the contract any connection with the Department or the HSE?</p></speech>

A report into patient safety was conducted by HIQA.  That report recommended that a national clinical guideline be developed to try to assist in similar situations in the future.  The urgency of that, and public concern attaching to it, meant that it was necessary to develop that guideline as a matter of some urgency.  Added to that was the very particular skills set required.  Although in the period since then, we have developed this capability within the Department, this is not an area in which the Department had expertise nor is it an area in which there is a range of providers in the country.  It involves of a mix of specialist clinical and economic skills that are not easily found.  The Department was able to source a person with the requisite skills to conduct that research.  They were not employed by UHG; this was an investigation into UHG.  We provided the rationale for this in the annual report.  I was not in the Department at the time it was done but when I did my 2014 return, because I had not signed off on this myself, I asked that the file be looked into very carefully and that the internal audit unit review it.  It conducted a report for me and I was fully satisfied that the rationale given for conducting that, through a non-competitive procurement process, fully stood up both in the context of the public concerns around the tragic incident in Galway and the requisite experience, which is not commonly found within the jurisdiction.</p></speech>

There is also an issue in respect of narcolepsy, which resulted from the vaccine given for swine 'flu.  The lives of some young people and families have been transformed and they are waiting for support from the Department.  This is a huge burden on families as they need extra support to physically manage the effects of the vaccine and support is also needed by schools in respect of these young people.  Will there be another long waiting period?  How will incidents such as this be managed where vaccinations have resulted in the health of individuals deteriorating?  Another case was brought to my attention last week.  It relates to a young girl who had the recent cervical vaccination and who has been in chronic pain since.  Her hip is affected.  She is on a crutch and is constantly on medication.</p><p>She is a teenager.  I appreciate that these things cannot be foreseen but do we have a process in place that can make it easier for people and families to adjust?  I would like to hear more about that, as opposed to spending the money on legal fees.</p></speech>

In 1996, the first awards from the hepatitis C compensation tribunal were made.  Sizeable awards have been made in the interim period and as the Deputy can see, they are set out in regard to both 2013 and 2014.  In total, &euro;689 million has been paid out in awards under the hepatitis C tribunal over that interim period.  There is a further reparation fund payment that totals &euro;152 million and, as the Deputy rightly points out, there are significant legal costs attaching to the operation of the hepatitis C compensation tribunal, which is a statutory tribunal, of &euro;165 million in legal fees over the period 1996 to 2014.  The number of awards made is 3,423 and in each of those awards there is representation of the tribunal itself in regard to counsel and also representation in regard to the claimants.  The Deputy can see that there are significant legal costs attaching to the tribunal based on it being a statutory tribunal where people are allowed to engage counsel to represent them in the tribunal.</p></speech>

They continue to make their way through for two reasons.  Cases will come before the tribunal for the first time but mostly at this stage they are cases of people not infected themselves but relatives of people who are infected.</p> <p>  There is also the ability to re-enter a case.  Over the years, the tribunal will have made a provisional award to somebody but if that person's illness associated with their having hepatitis C were to deteriorate, they might seek to re-enter the tribunal at that stage.</p> <p>  The State's involvement in this is a very sorry tale.  The Deputy can see the size of the compensation being made and the absolute imperative to try to ensure the safety of our blood supply and that we never have this issue arise again.</p> <p>  The only positive I can mention in regard to this entire area is that in the current year, 2015, Ireland has taken account of the developments that have taken place internationally and we are now funding therapies for people with hepatitis C, not just those contaminated through the blood supply but people in Ireland who have hepatitis C.  Those therapies now have a very good effectiveness in delivering not just improvement in the person's condition but, in some cases, curative.</p> <p>  We put in place a &euro;30 million programme in 2015, and that is being rolled out on a clinical basis where consultants identify those most urgent in clinical terms to be treated.  The Government has announced that as a multi-annual programme so I hope in future years to be talking about the money we spent on curing people with hepatitis C rather than compensating people for hepatitis C.  We cannot undo the damage of the past-----</p></speech>

Work was undertaken internationally and in Ireland to try to identify the association between people with narcolepsy, mostly young people, and those who had taken the vaccine.  An association was found.  There was a further requirement to prove causality, which is very hard to do because somebody may take a vaccine but something else may happen at the same time.  That being said, the Health Service Executive has worked with relatively small numbers of people in that category to try to put services in place around their needs.  We have increased the staffing around some of the specialist services that are needed for that and I know that is the case across Government, including in places like the Department of Education and Skills where people in the leaving certificate cycle, for example, have needed extra support with that and at university level.</p> <p>  There are likely to be some claims around that issue.  There has not been a settlement.  That has not reached a conclusion at this stage.</p></speech>

Obviously, the merits of the case are being looked into.</p> <p>  To move it into another associated area, also in the account is the symphysiotomy compensation scheme.  We would all prefer not to be in a very legalistic place.  Our learning over the years is to try to put in services early and address genuinely the life circumstances of people in these situations and, where issues arise, not to go to the Four Courts or even into very judicial processes.  The reason I reference the symphysiotomy situation is because that is operating under the Department's Vote in 2015 in a very speedy fashion where the same level of legal representation is not required, awards are being made and people are getting on with their lives.  All those processes have to be worked through as a general policy matter.</p> <p>  Regarding any specific vaccine, we have to look at the fine detail of that to determine the merits of the argument so I do not want to prejudge that.  In any event, what we try to do is tackle the underlying issues around services because in terms of people who have narcolepsy, other issues the Deputy flagged, a medical condition or who require other supports, the first thing we should do is try to address that as the most immediate need, and we are seeking to do that.</p></speech>

The general practitioner would then report on that adverse reaction.  The pharmaceutical companies are required to follow up on adverse reactions and the Health Products Regulatory Authority monitors all adverse reactions.  Adverse reactions could be something relatively minor such as swelling on the arm when one gets an injection to something more serious, and the regulatory authorities work across Europe to share information on adverse reactions.  One isolated event would not be a pattern.  One would look to see a pattern established that showed some causality between what happened to somebody and the actual vaccine.

The most vital thing, both for the health service and for the individual, is that we try to get to the underlying issue and get it resolved.  We are probably not in the first week of it but if we are in a situation where somebody has a chronic or long-standing condition, the health service has a range of services, including counselling and patient support services, to support people in that situation.  I do not wish to speak about the individual incident but my guess in something so proximate, if it happened last weekend and the issue is now present, is that the concentration of the effort, both by a GP and by specialists, would be on trying to get a handle on what the underlying issue is.</p></speech>

Is there a process in place whereby if something happens, somebody can say, "I believe I have had a reaction here.  I have been to the doctor and the family needs support", and a team can go in and help the family?  I get the impression that there is not.  It is a case of going back to the doctor to get the proof and going back to the hospital.  Mr. Breslin and I, as non-medical people, know that this can take a year or two.</p></speech>

If we were to put up a hurdle of proof, that would not be the response that should be given in this situation.  The response should be proportionate and in line with the underlying condition, regardless of where the origins of the condition lie.  It is a separate, subsequent and perhaps a parallel process to try to establish what its origins are.  I have no clinical evidence that the origins could be related to the vaccine.  It could be coincidental.  It really does not matter in terms of the underlying condition.

That refers to its own financial systems, operating systems and skills set.  There is a programme of reform being led by the chief financial officer in the HSE.  It has both skills and capability in staffing and also technology.  Over a period the HSE has had to come from a situation where it had multiple financial systems across former health board areas into a consolidated place where it has a single financial system.</p></speech>

We are at a peer review process for procurement of a national financial system.  However, the learning is that a great deal can happen before we implement a new national financial system.  There is a huge amount of process change that must be consolidated and made consistent across the country.  The way in which information is captured and recorded must be made consistent, and the processing of financial information can be streamlined through reducing the number of points in which it is being captured.  The overall reform is not simply about a piece of technology.  It must be about a changed way of managing the financial recording and management within the HSE.</p></speech>

They are commissioned by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to look at projects objectively, to bring their expertise to that across a range of areas, including ICT, and to question the project approach that is being taken.  We have just entered the peer review stage.  When we conclude that stage we would hope that we would finalise a procurement process that would lead to phased implementation.  It will be a multi-year implementation, probably starting with those areas of the country that have the most urgent need for new technology in this area.  We will phase in the implementation of that.  It will be a major multi-annual programme.  It will run to tens of millions of euro in terms of budget.  In the capital review announced last week by the Government additional provision has been made for a national financial system for the HSE.</p></speech>

Investments have been made to do that both in terms of technology and also the right calibre of skilled staff.  That is the HSE's piece of this.  It has been working on it and the committee will have heard about it in the past.  The piece for which the Department has assumed an added responsibility is that from 1 January I take Accounting Officer duties for that expenditure.

After the organisation was established, the pensions scheme was established in 1963.  There was a pension fund and every three years under the Pensions Act an actuary made a valuation to see what contributions were required to fund the benefits payable under the scheme at the time.  The trustees or the board of trustees, three of whom are appointed by the employer and three by the staff, operate the scheme on behalf of members and it was deemed that there would be a private pensions scheme.  The issue then arose, as there was a deficit in the scheme.  We were in discussions with staff at the time - in 2009 - to make increased contributions to secure their benefits under the scheme.  We were actually involved in conciliation on the day we found out that this scheme did apply.  The conciliation process broke down and they were not willing to pay any more if there was to be a pension-related deduction also.  They were not going to have a PRD of 6% or 7% and pay a further 6% or 7% to secure their benefits.</p></speech>

In the very early stages there was uncertainty, which went on for about two months maximum.  The board sought advice from senior counsel on whether the IBTS pensions scheme fitted the definition of a public service persons scheme within the terms of the FEMPI legislation.  The view of senior counsel was that it did not, that it was not a public service pensions scheme within the terms of the legislation.  Under our scheme, on retirement, the trustees calculate a person's pension based on the final salary given to them by the employer.  An individual member of staff retired and the employer told the trustees that the retirement pension was to be based on final salary which had been cut a number of months earlier.  The person concerned challenged this in the High Court saying, "If you cut my pay on the basis of FEMPI 2, then that Act should also apply in giving me the benefit of a grace period and retiring on a pension based on pre-cut salary."  The trustees said, "Not according to our trustee rules; therefore, it is to be based on final salary."  The person concerned did not accept this and took a case to the Ombudsman.  He supported her case and also determined that we had a public service pensions scheme.  The trustees then had no option but to appeal the decision to the High Court.  Even though he said at the beginning of his judgment that he was not going to deal with the substantive issue, the President of the High Court asked the hypothetical question whether the Oireachtas had intended to exclude the IBTS from the FEMPI legislation when it was brought forward and, using section 5 of the Interpretation Act 2005, decided that it had not been its intention to do so.  He, therefore, decided that it was a public service pensions scheme.  He went on to deal with the individual case later in the judgment.</p></speech>

The IBTS collected it for one purpose.  It is bad enough to see the Government raiding moneys that were collected for road tax and sending them off to Irish Water.  In this case, the IBTS collected a sum of money, which was intended to be given to the Government for a particular purpose under particular legislation, from its employees.  Therefore, the IBTS is legally obliged to hand over that money.  This has actually been tested in court.  The IBTS lost the case and now the money is due to the Department.  Does the IBTS have that money in a separate account?</p></speech>

The Act commenced on 1 March.  On 4 March, we corresponded with the Department of Finance, as it was at that stage, in response to a question that was raised about the application of FEMPI to the IBTS and the Department of Finance responded to us.  On 6 April, we gave our definitive position in writing to the IBTS, which was that it needed to deduct the levy and remit it to the Department.  That has been our position ever since.  Predecessors of mine and Ministers have written letters on this issue.  We have maintained that position.  The IBTS has linked the two issues of the FEMPI reductions and the financial position of the pension fund.  I do not underestimate the pension fund issue.  We have actively tried to work on that with the IBTS in the latest manifestation of this process.  In fairness to the IBTS, this is not simply an issue between two organs of the State as there are also employees involved.  The agreement of the employees will be needed if the issues in the pension fund are to be resolved.  The Workplace Relations Commission has been engaged on that part of this piece of work.  I think all of us, including the two Departments and the IBTS, are optimistic that the basis of a resolution is on the table.  That will require employees to sign up to revised pension arrangements.  If that is done, the two Departments have indicated that a contribution towards resolving that can be made in some or in part of the &euro;10 million that is outstanding.  We would like to bring this saga to a close.</p></speech>

They owe the Department the money and the Department has to get it back from them.  They are in a bit of financial bother and the Department has to resolve it.  That is the answer.  If the figures in what the Department is saying are correct, the cost so far in relation to hepatitis C, for example, is approximately &euro;1 billion.  I was just reading the different figures off the screen.  It is a little over &euro;1 billion.  That is the cost in terms of the compensation.  Then there is the &euro;132 million, the &euro;165 million for legal fees and so on.  Separate from and parallel to that, concern is also expressed in the report that this "could also seriously impact the organisation&rsquo;s capacity to deliver a safe and sustainable blood service, to the appropriate standards of quality and efficacy".  It is in everyone's interest that this matter be dealt with immediately.</p></speech>

The Department would take a view on that, working with the HSE, based on our own calculations and information sources.</p><p>That would form part of a negotiation process led by the Minister for Health with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform that would lead to an Estimates settlement that would be voted on in the Oireachtas.  Prior to 1 January, that Vote went directly to the HSE from the Oireachtas with the director general of the HSE as Accounting Officer.  Since 1 January this year that money passes through the Department of Health Vote and then we allocate it to the HSE as part of an allocation.  That would be a more normal funding arrangement between a Department and an agency.</p></speech>

One would have to factor in items such as medical inflation where technology is introducing extra cost.

One would come up with a set of estimations across the major budget headings.  That sounds like a very technical exercise and there is a lot of technicality to it, but I think it is only proper to reflect back since 2008 on the reality of where we have been, which is that we have faced the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform saying: "It really doesn't matter what the technical calculations are."  I am doing them a disservice; we are interested in the technical calculations, but in the final analysis, this is the only money that is available.</p></speech>

Let me talk in general and I will try to put figures on it, but it will be different in different years.  As the Chairman knows, in the current year one will often have an overspend, as has been the pattern in recent years.  So one will have an over-expenditure in 2015.  That would be one of the first things that one would try to address in the 2016 Estimate.  One would also seek to put in place something to provide for demography.  I have given the example of &euro;200 million.  One would then adjust it for movements in pay rates.  So, in relation to next year, there would be an increase in pay rates.  In some of the years over this period, that has been a reduction in pay rates and, therefore, one could reduce it down.  One will look at the cost of drugs and we have been successful in reducing the price of drugs, but the volume of drugs that are being prescribed continues to rise as it does in most jurisdictions.  So we would put in an estimate of that.  So they are the constituent elements that we would build up to an overall figure and it would depend on the given year as to what that would be.</p></speech>

That is my concern.  Over the years we have seen Estimates that have simply been way too low in the context of the eventual Vote and what was there.  It would be good for someone in your position to come out and simply say, "Look, we asked for &euro;15 billion and we got &euro;12 billion, which is totally inadequate."  Alongside that presentation we need Mr. Breslin to answer the question as to how many, if any, HSE employees within middle management or senior management are surplus to requirements.  Has he estimated that?</p></speech>

What we have at the moment is quite a lot of transactional processing going on.  The best-in-class approach to that would be to bring technology to bear on that.  I would like to see more people doing the job that the Deputy in her questioning asked which is really getting under the information and seeing what can be done to make a difference and make more value out of the money we are having.  So I do not think we are overstaffed and over-managed relative to other countries.</p><p>However, we are not asking the right questions, and are not using the intelligence that it is possible to generate through modern systems, to the benefit of patients, primarily, but also the taxpayer.</p></speech>

In these areas, changing the approach around process could free up staff.  However, if we simply took away the staff at the moment without changing the process, we would grind to a halt.  Improving financial processes and bringing technology to bear will release staff.  We are keen to see them deployed into higher value work involving analysis and trying to manage to a higher level.</p></speech>

It relates to the integrated national financial system - I understand that is how you describe it.  The last time I asked about this I was told that a proposal had been made to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and that it was generally being considered.  You have given us far greater detail and clarity in that you are looking at delivery in five years and a roll-out of eight years.  This means the Department is at a given stage now in terms of determining what it wants within that system and how it will operate.  Up to now we have had the most evasive answers from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the same from the HSE.  I am pleased to hear now that at least we have got this far with it.  However, I had thought it was far more advanced than it appears.  You have said the delivery of the system will be in five years.  When will we be at the point of delivering an agreed system with the ability to talk to the other systems in place?</p></speech>

The second answer is that we will not try to implement that in every part of the HSE all in one go.  We will undertake a phased implementation throughout the HSE.  The timeline I have referenced is to the end of the process.  In advance of that, proven technologies are available to us which can suck the information from existing systems and make it more accessible, including data warehousing and use of technology in that area.  We are doing it in two stages.  The first is to get to an endpoint with one financial system throughout the health service, that is, the same proprietary financial system everywhere.  That is the real endpoint.  However, in advance of that, as we develop our instances of implementation, we will draw that information into a central source and have better and more reliable information.</p></speech>

This is something you have brought up as well.  I imagine you know what I am going to bring up.  It relates to the foster home we have dealt with and the HSE's involvement.  I thank Mr. Breslin for coming in and he is welcome.</p> <p>  Mr. Conal Devine was commissioned to undertake a report on everything surrounding the foster home located in the south east of the country where some serious allegations have been made.  We are getting conflicting views with regard to the position of a Garda investigation in this regard.  The Chairman was formally notified that there would not be any prosecutions in this case.  That much has been repeated to several people.</p> <p>  As far as the Department is aware, what is the status of a Garda investigation?  I am asking because those responsible in the HSE are using the excuse of an ongoing Garda investigation.  They maintain it precludes them from releasing the report, even in redacted form.  What is Mr. Breslin's understanding of it?  Frankly, we are getting two stories.</p></speech>

The Chairman may have been informed differently.  Obviously, we do not try to intervene in the process, but we have sought to check where the process is at.  We have been told it has not concluded and this may relate to a number of lines of inquiry.  That rings true with the line the HSE has given us, which is that the executive is precluded from publishing until it gets word from the Garda on the matter.  That is the current situation, as we understand it.</p></speech>

People have contacted the Garda and have directly asked the Garda whether there is an issue with publishing this report and the Garda have said "No."  Some people are making the point to us that they do not believe there is an issue with the publication of this report.  Can Mr. Breslin shine any light on that?</p></speech>

I have written to the committee on the subject.  The Minister has requested that we organise a senior counsel, Mr. Conor Dignam, to look into the matter.  One particular aspect that the senior counsel has been asked to look into relates to the reasons the reports have not been published and whether these reasons are well grounded.  An interim report is due back shortly from Mr. Dignam.  We hope that will assist the Deputy in the question he is asking.</p></speech>

This report was commissioned using public money.  The Department of Health funds the HSE budget.  I have to ask a particular question but no one seems to know the answer.  What is the natural course when it comes to a report like this?  Public money has been used and spent to commission it.  It has been lying somewhere for years now.  What role does the Department have?  Do we need to ask counsel every time to examine why a report has not been published?  Does Mr. Breslin get to see this report once it is finished?  Does the Minister get to see this report?  Does the HSE keep it locked up?  I am beginning to suspect that HSE is not releasing some of these reports because they would damage the organisation and some individuals and because the HSE is potentially protecting some individuals by not publishing.</p></speech>

We get many reports in these scenarios.  Situations could arise which are more local and are less obviously matters of public concern, but the HSE may take the view that they are worth looking into in any event.  We would not necessarily get all of those.  However, in such instances where we do not have An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's involvement, we would request the report.  In this situation where we have done so, we have not been content to wait.  We have agreed with the HSE that a senior counsel will review the reports.  The Ministers have been at a disadvantage in the debate on the matter because they have not seen the reports - nor have I.  However, they will have the benefit of a senior counsel having reviewed the report as well as a clear position from the senior counsel.</p></speech>

Social workers and people who have been around this for the past ten years have seen fragments of this report.  They know that it is hard-hitting.  They know it is a good report, and that is how they have characterised it to me.  Mr. Breslin does not know; they do.  A lot of people who are working in this area know exactly what has been written in that report and are very keen that it be made public, and they are very clear about their opinions as to why it is being held back.</p> <p>  I take everything Mr. Breslin said at face value.  He stated that the Department of Justice and Equality and the Garda have made it clear that there are still issues that need to be dealt with.  I am beginning to get worried, though, that the HSE sits on such reports and then redacts them, and it is in the public interest for that to change.  A second set of eyes needs to be brought into this to make a decision on whether it is good public policy to continue that system.</p> <p>  As for some of the issues, I have never dealt with anything like it.  I have been in politics since 1999 and I have never dealt with anything as serious and as disturbing as these allegations.  I think Mr. Breslin gets my drift.  I note the Chairman has been involved in this and we are on the same page when it comes to this.</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, has written to the HSE suggesting that there are already processes in place in acute care to ensure that nominations of people to undertake reviews are not done by the HSE; they are done by an external party.</p></speech>

Deputy Lynch has written to the HSE to say that the selection process around that could benefit from it being more independent.  In particular, the HSE's attention has been drawn to a practice that has developed, and one that I am very aware of, in the child welfare area where an external party to the HSE, somebody of objective standing who stands apart from the HSE - a professor in a university, not an employee of the HSE - selects from a panel of people who might undertake the review.  There is the occasion where members of that panel have worked in the HSE because that is by far the biggest provider of health services but a studied eye is given to the composition of the panel, to ensure that it has clear independent status to it.  We think this is an area, and the HSE is working with us and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to try to develop a methodology that in the future would not lead to the kind of the concerns that members at the committee here have expressed, and we will have that.</p></speech>

We have been dealing with this for the past year.  We have been dealing with the methodology, the panels and the independence of these reports and reviews.</p> <p>  That is news.  That is something we have not heard previously.  We put a lot of work into this with regard to the independence of these reviews.  Mr. Breslin states that the Minister in question, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, has written to the HSE stressing that the reports should be more independent.  Is it a bit more concrete than that?  Does she have a proposal that she sent to the HSE or is it merely a request?</p></speech>

Indeed, she has met with people involved in the panel in the children area to try to get the methodologies right as we implement something similar in this space.</p></speech>

I would like it if the clerk to the committee, without saying anything, could correspond or communicate with Mr. Breslin's office so that we could get a copy of those proposals so that we can take a look at them.  We made some definite recommendations in this area but if Mr. Breslin can give us that information, we would like to take a look at that.</p></speech>

I am happy with that.</p> <p>  What I am deeply concerned about is the fact that the health boards, dating back to their time, and therefore the Department of Health, failed a high number of vulnerable young adults in this State, and probably continues to do that in this case.  Within the organisation of the health services, someone knows what happened in relation to this.  It did not go unnoticed.  A senior social worker and an independent organisation felt strongly enough about it to make a protected disclosure on a number of different occasions, and felt so strong about it that they raised it at a restricted public meeting of employees with the HSE.</p> <p>  It also was raised here.  Deputy Deasy and I raised it, and I made a disclosure to Pearse St. Garda station.  This is what annoys me about it.  Some employees of the health board at that time must have known about this and that was said by the whistleblower in greater detail.  I have not heard from the HSE or from the Department of Health to say they have identified the various persons who engaged with this issue at that time.</p> <p>  I want to put this on record because of what Mr. Breslin said.  I was asked to attend a meeting in the Garda station some months ago where I was told that the evidence had been presented to the DDP and that no action would be taken.  Mr. Breslin states that he is waiting on the Garda report or the Garda is dealing with it, and I have been told that the Garda has dealt with it.  They either have or they have not dealt with it.  In my opinion, someone is covering up or playing games, and we need to come clean on all of this issue, not only in the interest of accountability, transparency and all of those words that are used nowadays, but in the interest of the families concerned.</p><p>Some of those young adults may have continued through their lives being affected by what happened.  I have read some of the reports and, quite frankly, in my time in the public arena I have never read anything so horrifying.  Both the reports and the verbal explanations given to me by the social workers are horrifying.  That is what disturbed me most about this.  We had an exchange here with the HSE on this matter and I must say that its arrogance and stonewalling on the occasion in question was breathtaking.  A bit of truth and a bit of effort would really change things around here and would also the circumstances of the people affected.  In light of what I have been told and in view of the fact that the Department of Health, at some stage in its history, employed people who were directly responsible in this area, there is an onus on the Department to conduct some sort of investigation into both itself and the individuals concerned.  It should not be held back by the report or the information to the effect that there is a Garda report.  The witness can say that I told him there were no prosecutions to happen.  That is what I was told.  I will leave it at that but I could not leave it at the exchange with Deputy Deasy because so much has happened since. </p></speech>

I do not want this to be an ongoing issue.  The purpose of commissioning the senior counsel is to get us to a point where we can put whatever we can into the public domain.  One of the key issues the senior counsel is to examine is whether this concept of not publishing the report is well grounded.  That finding will answer at least part of the question that the Chairman has posed.  Officials at the Department and Ministers have met some of the people who have concern and local knowledge of this issue and everybody's concern is shared here.  This is not something where we lack concern on this issue.</p></speech>

I think he should seek the names of the individuals who were at the forefront of this at that time and determine whether they have all been questioned or made a contribution to the investigation.  Quite frankly, it does Mr. Breslin, the committee, and the Garda no good to say that such a serious issue has not been brought to a conclusion one way or the other.  I have two questions for Mr. Breslin.</p></speech>

I want to reiterate one thing.  Mr. Breslin has made it clear that the process involving the choosing of the individuals who do these reports will now change which will end potential conflicts of interest that have arisen in the past.  Very clearly, that is what we have seen and that is good and the people involved in this will be pleased with that.  I have to return to the reports that are commissioned using public money and the way they are treated once they are completed.  I think Mr. Breslin's office, on the basis of good public policy, needs to take a look at redaction and the circulation of those reports and, in my opinion, the continual suppression of these reports within the HSE.  I could make a good argument that, for the public good, that system can no longer continue.  I think Mr. Breslin needs to provide a second set of eyes or a different system or proposal to the HSE.  I think, as a matter of good public policy, that needs to be considered at this point.</p></speech>

I speak with some knowledge of the children's area because that was my former posting.  The approach that is taken there is that the reports are published.  The important thing in the terms of reference when something is set up is that the person who is doing the inquiry is told that the report will be published.  If they go off and do the report and then one decides whether to publish it or not, one gets into redaction terrain, so it is important that we set up a process that is for the publication of reports.</p></speech>

We have sought to work with the NMBI to get this issue resolved.  We have recruited additional staffing for the registration process and the NMBI is about to introduce a proper call centre for taking calls and working through inquiries from people who are in the registration process.  Although it will not be completely resolved, we hope to put a very big dent in it in the coming weeks and there is work under way on that.</p></speech>

As I recall it, it was &euro;1.4 billion, which I think is correct, but &euro;610 million was provided to the HSE following the negotiations on the Estimates process.  Alongside that would have been savings initiatives to try to find further resources.  One can see that the HSE tends to go for the desirable funding and then we have to go through a process with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to see what is achievable.</p></speech>

Between 2007 and December 2013, the board had incurred costs of just under &euro;42 million.  Funding for the project was provided by the Health Service Executive.  The cumulative expenditure by year is shown in figure 1 of the document circulated.  The breakdown of total expenditure at the end of 2013 is shown in figure 2.<br/><br/>By December 2013, the business services team had incurred expenditure of &euro;24.5 million in respect of business and health care planning and programme management.  Cumulative expenditure of the integrated design team, of &euro;6.4 million, related to engineering, architectural and quantity surveying activities.  The project management team had incurred expenditure of just over &euro;3.2 million, mainly relating to design costs and &euro;7.6 million had been incurred in respect of administration costs, including salaries.  All of the expenditure incurred had been capitalised and recognised as an asset in the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board's<b><i></i></b>balance sheet.  The carrying value of the asset was impacted upon by the Government decision on 6 November 2012 to change the location of the hospital.<br/><br/>In December 2012, the term of the existing board expired.  Following its appointment in August 2013, the new board undertook a review of asset values, which took account of the extent to which the outputs produced could be used on the project at St James&rsquo;s.  The audit of the 2013 financial statements included a review of the impairment calculation.  The financial statements for 2013 reflect the writing down of &euro;35.5 million of the accumulated expenditure.  The breakdown of total expenditure to December 2013, as between amounts written off and value retained by type of expenditure, is set out in figure 3.  At December 2013, taking account of the write-down of &euro;35.5 million, the asset was valued at &euro;6.2 million.<br/><br/>My office completed the audit, including examination of the impairment review and its impact on the 2013 financial statements, by 14 October 2014, which was just before the committee&rsquo;s previous examination of the board.  However, the Department of Health and Children wished to consider the impairment further in consultation with the HSE and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  My office received signed accounts for 2013 from the board on 17 February 2015 and these were certified by me on 20 February 2015.  The audit certificate noted a clear audit opinion but drew attention to the significant impairment charge in the year.<br/><br/>The 2014 financial statements were certified on 1 October 2015, again receiving a clear audit opinion.  Further impairment was not required.  As I mentioned earlier, they have been presented for the committee.</p></speech>

On 2 August 2013, the current board was appointed and a new executive recruited.  Total expenditure for 2013 was &euro;1.71 million.  This can be summarised under the following headings: payroll and related costs, &euro;460,000; site clearance cost &euro;260,000; design team fees, &euro;260,000; health planning, &euro;200,000; and administration and other costs, &euro;530,000.  The 2013 balance sheet includes assets valued at &euro;39.98 million at the beginning of 2013 in respect of the planning and development work for the children&rsquo;s hospital planned for the Mater Hospital campus.  This value relates to accumulated expenditure in the period 2007 to 2012.  These details were discussed at a previous Committee of Public Accounts meeting with the NPHDB on 23 October 2014.</p> <p>  The current board of the NPHDB was announced in August 2013 and commenced familiarising itself with the overall project details, including the 2012 and 2013 accounts.  On page 14 of the 2013 accounts, note 3 identifies that, arising from the Government decision to change the location of the new children's hospital to the St James&rsquo;s hospital site, the board spent considerable time ascertaining potential reusable value of the accumulated expenditure.  The development board initiated a process in 2014 to review and analyse the asset impairment.  The review was carried out based on guidelines in financial reporting standard, FRS, 11 ensuring any impairment or loss is measured and recognised.  The board has reviewed all expenditure for construction work in progress, identified the deliverables which were supported by that expenditure, set out the sections of the deliverables which can be utilised on the St. James's campus and carried out detailed analysis on the value of the sections of work which can be utilised or modified to provide future value.</p> <p>  The impairment analysis comprised detailed examination of all expenditure, divided into separate, distinct components being examined by the staff of the board who have project knowledge of the individual components involved.  The review involved detailed analysis of the costs up to November 2012  - the date of the decision to move to the St. James&rsquo;s campus - and the costs in 2013 that relate Mater site project.  The staff members then reviewed the data to assess what portion of each individual component could be reutilised on the St. James&rsquo;s site.  The review was completed in September 2014.  The proposed impairment was reviewed by the NPHDB audit committee, the board of the NPHDB, the HSE, the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform, the Comptroller and Auditor General as part of the audit process and PricewaterhouseCoopers has reviewed and confirmed that the process is in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles, GAAP.</p><p>The Comptroller and Auditor General, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the HSE, as funder, were in agreement with the approach taken by the development board and the Department confirmed to the development board that it had no objection to the write-down in the development board&rsquo;s 2013 accounts.  The review resulted in an impairment of &euro;35,501,586 which related to the provision of services as set out in page 15 of the of 2013 accounts, which were specific to the activities and services supporting the Mater site and cannot be utilised or transferred to the project on the St. James&rsquo;s site.</p><p> I will now turn to the current status of the project.  A strategic infrastructure development planning submission for the new children&rsquo;s hospital was submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la on 10  August 2015.  We expect an oral hearing to take place in November 2015.  A planning decision from An Bord Plean&aacute;la is expected on 15 February 2016.</p></speech>

There are two issues to which I wish to draw attention.  The first is the impairment charge and the second is where we stand regarding delivery of the new hospital.  The impairment charge is &euro;35.5 million and the total expenditure was just short of &euro;40 million.  To anyone looking at this, it would seem extraordinary that a figure of more than 90% of the expenditure relating to design, business services, administration and project management was written off and was not reusable or transferable.  When the witness was before this committee on a previous occasion, questions were raised about this matter.  It was indicated that a full review was taking place.  What is here before us today is the outcome of that review.  Perhaps the witness might give the committee some detail as to why so little of the funding that was made available, and the expenditure that took place, has been transferable to the new proposed premises in St. James&rsquo;s hospital?</p></speech>

In looking at the impairment charge, we broke it up into 15 separate work streams which we saw as deliverables.  By deliverable it is meant something that was a tangible asset for us.  Therefore, items such as the civil structural engineer&rsquo;s design for the Mater project was very specific to the Mater site as it was for a16-storey building on a totally different footprint.  So even though we have drawings and calculations, that particular deliverable would not be transferable.</p></speech>

Most of that related to the architects&rsquo; drawings: how the hospital was laid out and the adjacency of the rooms; the configurations of single-bed wards and operating theatres, offices and open-plan offices; and the configuration of the accident and emergency department.  It was possible to transfer those drawings to the new design team and they were handed over at the time that the team tendered so they could say &ldquo;Well that is the layout of a room that was configured and set out, therefore we can retain a value for that.&rdquo;</p></speech>

The reason previously given to this committee for the rejection, which, of course, was totally wrong, was that the footprint was too small and that there is a much bigger footprint at Saint James&rsquo;s Hospital.  That was not the reason An Bord Plean&aacute;la rejected the initial planning application.  It rejected it because it was totally loony.  It was for a 16-storey building which could not accommodate a helicopter landing on the roof.  It was in breach of the Dublin city development plan and the local area plan - two statutory plans.  How in God&rsquo;s name could a design team have gone in to An Bord Plean&aacute;la with these breaches of statutory compliance?  I do not see any of that in the analysis that has been presented to this committee.  There is a serious question to be answered.  How could a development board spent five years and all of this money &ndash; not just on the design but also on administration and business services, the cost of which was &euro;24 million &ndash; and yet come up with such a poor design that was totally rejected by An Bord Plean&aacute;la?  The business of this committee is to find out why taxpayers&rsquo; money was spent so badly, and I do not see an answer to that in the financial statement in the survey conducted by the new board.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, we cannot rewrite history, but we have to learn and make sure that in every step we make along the way, in respect of any of perceived weakness in the decision-making processes during the five years, we ensure this will not happen.  Mr. Pollock might set out the steps we have taken from the outset in ensuring there is robustness to what we are doing.</p></speech>

Previously, it had had a dual remit.  It had to concentrate on delivering the building and the medical-clinical integration of three children's hospitals.  The Government decided to have two boards - our board, that is, the development board, and the group board, which is chaired by Jim Browne from NUI Galway.  The skillsets in our board relate very much to building.  The chairman has 30 years experience in the construction sector.  We have two urban planners who worked with local authorities, one of whom was a member of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The Chief Government Procurement Officer is on our board because, given the amount of procurement work we have to do, we also have a lot of financial work to do.  We have an architect who is the chief architect in the Northern Ireland health service.</p> <p>  The next thing was to make sure the executive was put in place.  Again, my background is in engineering.  I have worked on health care and building projects for 30 years.  The other members of my team, from the commercial director to our design director, come with engineering and architectural backgrounds; therefore, we know what it takes to deliver a building.  </p> <p>  Having these two streams in place, we said the next thing to do was to get in place a world-class design team with experience in designing children's hospitals.  We said we would not accept a design team with no experience of designing a children's hospital.  BDP Architects is leading it.  It delivered Alder Hey Children's Hospital and the Royal Alexandra Children's Hospital in Brighton in the United Kingdom.  During the procurement phase the board was making sure we could minimise risk.  When St. James's Hospital was originally proposed as the site of the national children's hospital, a smaller site was offered.  I think we discussed this issue the last time we met.  The site comprises 12 acres of land in the middle of Dublin and three times the size of the site proposed at the Mater Hospital.</p></speech>

Why did the original board decide to build up to 16 storeys as it was just not going to happen and was not good practice in the case of a children's hospital when there was a footprint that could have been extended and which became available immediately after An Bord Plean&aacute;la had rejected the application?</p></speech>

As we are talking about the financial accounts for 2013 and the impairment charges, we want to know.  Mr. Pollock has said the board has learned lessons, but it cannot really have done so unless it knows what happened in the past.  How did it happen that a footprint far in excess of what was available originally became available immediately after An Bord Plean&aacute;la had rejected the planning application?  If it had been available, there would have been a different design.  We ended up with an explanation that it had something to do with the footprint of the Mater Hospital when, in fact, it had had nothing to do with it.  It was related to the flawed planning application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p></speech>

The square footage of the hospital we are now building is quite similar to what was available at the Mater Hospital; therefore, the scope of the project was always defined.  It was a defined site.  The lesson we have learned is, as Mr. Pollock said, that before we appoint a design team or engage in any expenditure on behalf of the State, we need to stress-test the decision making.  If we were to roll back six or seven years, the answer to the question of whether making sure all of the stress-testing was done before proceeding was the right thing to do is probably "Yes".  We are reinforcing it, but that was our first step.</p></speech>

There are a few things that are fundamentally different in the way we are structured compared to the Mater Hospital.  In the Mater Hospital there was a board which, as Mr. Pollock said, straddled the integration of the hospitals in delivering the project.  In essence, at executive level, much of the work was outsourced to a business services team.  Our structure involves a board the remit of which is to design, build and equip the hospital.  The board has appointed an executive who has ownership of the project to deliver it.  That is fundamentally very different from outsourcing the work to a business services team.  Certainly, we are happy with the robustness of the structure in terms of the executive, the sub-committees and the reporting to the board such that there is ownership all the way through.  When the Deputy asks why somebody did not ask, I can guarantee that on an ongoing basis there is a lot of questioning every day of the week in making sure we-----</p></speech>

Why was the decision made to fit the national paediatric hospital into that site when there was a broader footprint available?  There is a question mark over the initial decision of the then board to develop a national paediatric hospital on the Mater site, the length of time it spent on that process despite precedent in that regard and the availability of a site that could be expanded, and was expanded following the rejection by An Bord Plean&aacute;la of its application in that regard.  What occurred in relation to the planning is an unholy mess.  There is no adequate explanation for any of this in the submission, other than figures around expenditure in relation to this process and a statement that the board has taken on board the lessons learned.  We have to take the boards' word for all of this.  I accept that the new board comprises architects and that it is going about the process in a somewhat different fashion but the impression is given that the only reason we are where we are is because the Minister made a decision to transfer the children's hospital from the Mater site to the St. James's site.  That is not the reason we are where we are at this point in time.  The reason we are where we are is because the previous board made a cock-up of the plan to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  That plan was rejected because it was flawed and that should be reflected in the document.  It is not sufficient to state that arising out of the decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la the Minister made a decision to transfer location of the hospital to another site and, therefore, we have incurred this, that and the other.  The submission to An Bord Plean&aacute;la of a planning application that was flawed left the Minister with little choice other than to vacate the original site.</p></speech>

I think what we have done is correct in the sense that we were appointed on a Government decision to deliver a new children's hospital at the St. James's site.  In that regard, we were required to do two things - analyse the value we could get from the documentation and information inherited from the Mater site project and to learn from the lessons of the Mater site process.  I genuinely believe that that is our obligation and that is what we have done.</p></speech>

It is a bit anomalous here in that the original project was not completed but the write-off is very significant.  It is appropriate that the write-off is explained from an accounting perspective.  In line with the principle of the public spending code that a review be carried out of the project, it is appropriate for the Deputy to raise questions as to the reason it failed.</p> <p>  In undertaking a capital project of this kind a business case analysis is required.  Again, this is set out in the public spending code which was issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The purpose of pre-appraisal of a project is to identify the critical project risks, one of which in this situation would be where the obvious requirement for planning such that a project would not get into the detailed design phase until the major risks had been analysed.  I would imagine that there would have been a blocking analysis in terms of the height of the building in the context of the footprint available and how that would get through the planning process.  One would expect to see that kind of analysis being done.  I am the sure the board has done that since in relation to the St. James's site but if it was not done previously then that may be where the fault lies.</p></speech>

The point that then arises is who should be doing that review given that the previous board no longer exists and the current board has a project which is forward-facing and of a different character.  In order to sanction a project there is a sanctioning authority which I think in this case is the Department of Health.  By definition, the onus must revert to the Department of Health in that situation.</p><p>Would that be DPER's view as well perhaps?</p></speech>

We need to know more than the accountancy side of the matter.  It was the same with the Thornton Hall prison project.  Significant additional work is required in terms of the history of the project as distinct from where and how the money was spent.  I would like us to be a position to examine this matter further because we need details relating to the history of it in order to get to the bottom of why so much money was spent in such a way that none of it was transferable to any other project.  Is it possible to make a request to the Department of Health to look at this aspect of it?</p></speech>

That might be the general learning point that would form a recommendation on the part of the committee.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.524" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015100800002#Y01100"><p>I will first go through the list of questions.  These relate to the question the Deputy has asked about the review.  Mr. Tom Costello said the main work on the original plans was carried out by a business services team.  Therefore, the board or whomever gave most of the work to this team, which, presumably, appointed the architects and worked up the plans in the context of making the original application for this 16-storey hospital building.  The decision of the board at that time was to refer essentially all of the elements of this work to a business services team.  I think we need to question that team in the context of what led it to believe that a planning application in respect of a 16-storey building could be successful; whether it examined the city or county development plan, as would be done for a normal site; whether it decided the footprint of the site was such that it would be allowed by the planners; and what analysis was conducted of services on the site and so on.  Is Mr. Costello aware of the analysis carried out by the team in the context of the lead-up to an application being made?  In other words, had it ticked all the boxes along the route to planning and then reached a point where it said, "We have ticked all the boxes; now we will make an application"?</p></speech>

That was not entirely clear.  Again, our lesson learned from that is no matter how brilliant the architecture is, stick to the rules.  If one does so, one is far more likely to be successful.</p></speech>

I am trying to get to the point before the board started to learn lessons from this saga.  To assist Deputy Joe Costello, I am simply asking if there is documentation that can inform the committee, the Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as to what happened in the course of the business services team's analysis of the potential in terms of planning permission.  Can we have documentation?</p></speech>

The strategic infrastructures legislation was not in place at the time and then they lodged the application for the Mater.  The proposal was to go to DCC and the council was supportive of the planning application, including the 16-storey development.  The team would have relied on the local area plan, which referred to buildings of 12 storeys and, as Mr. Costello said, possibly more for buildings of significant architecture.  DCC was supportive of the application but it never went to the council because the Government changed the legislation and brought in the strategic infrastructures legislation and, therefore, rather than going to a local authority with major health care projects and potentially an appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, it was decided to go straight to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p></speech>

I am looking for the evidence that would show us the process that convinced the business services team and 1.5 or two people who were involved at executive level that they should go with the possibility of a successful planning application and the support of DCC to An Bord Pleanal&aacute;.

I am seeking the documentation that helped that team to reach a conclusion that there was a possibility of securing planning permission.  If the two people gave the contract to a business services team, they must have had a set of instructions and the team took a set of actions.  They must have reported back to the two people and that is what I would like to see.</p></speech>

At the outset, Mr. Pollock stated, "The Comptroller and Auditor General, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the HSE, as funder, were in agreement with the approach taken by the development board and the Department confirmed to the development board that it had no objection to the write-down in the development board&rsquo;s 2013 accounts."  That could be read as, "All is okay".  However, it is not okay and that is the point made by Deputy Joe Costello.</p><p>It has been suggested to undertake a review of that expenditure.  Arising from this hearing and the wishes of the Committee of Public Accounts, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, either alone or in conjunction with the Department of Health, should undertake a speedy review of that expenditure.  I think that is what is required here.  That would lead us to the minutes of the meetings and the decisions being made with the service providers and so on.  Someone was responsible for the spend of &euro;35.5 million of taxpayers' money.  We are not talking about nickels and dimes here.  It is a significant amount of money.  While I understand the new board will take it on and learn lessons, I certainly would not be satisfied without a commitment from Mr. Costello's board, from the Department of Health and from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that a review will be undertaken and that it will be done efficiently and brought back to us within a reasonable timeframe.  Deputy Costello is that where you----- </p></speech>

The public spending code pushes the responsibility for the projects onto the sanctioning authority, which is effectively the Department of Health.  In terms of the wider implications for other Departments which the Comptroller and Auditor General has pointed out, we would certainly be amenable to looking after that and trying to deal with that issue.  However, the review is a matter for the Department of Health.</p></speech>

Almost a year to the day later, on 10 August 2015, we had completed the design to a stage where we could lodge the planning application.  So that went in to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, because it comes under strategic infrastructure.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la then basically writes out to prescribed organisations, of which I think it has identified 19.  We had to issue them with copies of the application and the planning documentation.  The time period was from 10 August to last Friday, 2 October, for any members of the public to lodge observations, either in support of the project or with concerns about the project.</p></speech>

However, we are aware that about 30 of those are positive observations from people like the Liberties Business Forum, and some of the local community groups who are in support of the project and want to see it happen on the campus.

An Bord Plean&aacute;la has not confirmed that yet, but we would be surprised if it did not have an oral hearing given that the project is more complex this time because we have the satellite centre in Connolly Hospital; the satellite centre at Tallaght; that construction compound at Davitt Road to mitigate impacts; and the St. James's site.  So we actually have four different sites that are impacted by the children's hospital.  Previously the oral hearing-----</p></speech>

So we think it will probably be about three weeks of an oral hearing; it might be two, but we think two to three weeks of an oral hearing and An Bord Plean&aacute;la has said it is working to try to have a decision made by 15 February next year.</p> <p>  Obviously there has been a huge amount of engagement with, I suppose, all the stakeholders, who are many, starting, obviously, with the staff in the hospitals - the consultants, nurses and clinicians who will operate this hospital as to what will make a world-class hospital.  In the community, we have done a mail drop to 4,000 residents and we organised, I think it was, four or five drop-in sessions at the local community hall, in the F2 in Fatima, where we had our architects and design teams and boards to present what the hospital would look like.  We took on board, where we could, comments and feedback from the locals.  For example, they were concerned about the height of the balconies.  We raised the height of the balconies.  We put screening on it.  We lowered the road to reduce potential overlooking.  We took on board comments about the family accommodation unit which is for mums and dads who could be staying there for months on end.  That is not a project that is going to be funded by the HSE.  Residents in Cameron Square were concerned about the impact of that and what it might look like.  So we agreed that we would include it in our planning application.  So it is a two to four-storey building that is residential in nature and it backs on to their property.</p></speech>

It would be up.  Maybe it might be 20%.  There is not a radically different shift because a lot of the work that is done is highly specific.  If one gets all the site investigations, the bore holes, the topographic surveyors extracting the water from the ground and do the business case, that is all specific to the St. James's campus.</p></speech>

For instance, in St. James's, we share a lot of services, whether it is around facilities management, FM, clinical sterilisation or corporate services, and that impacts on the area of the building.  The more one can share, the more one keeps the cost the down.  If one moves to another location, one might have to then put those back into the building which means it is a very different design.</p></speech>

That was one of the key requirements we set the design team, that not alone had they to design the site for the children's hospital, they had to provide a minimum of 20% expansion.  We have in excess of 20% expansion.  Also, within our design, we have future-proofed that we could share an energy centre with St. James's adult campus which would be a more efficient way to have one shared energy centre and that, in turn, would free-up further capacity so we will be able to expand well beyond the 20%.</p></speech>

I suppose that was one of the risks that the board would have identified, that traffic is an issue.  This is where our partner in the project, St. James's Hospital, which wanted this project on its campus so that we eventually deliver the Holy Grail of adult services, paediatric and maternity all on the one campus, is handing over the 12 acres of land and in doing that, it will be forfeiting car parking.  At its simplest analysis, traffic is at its worst first thing in the morning and last thing in the evening.  That is when we all are going to and from work.  However, when the children's hospital opens in 2019, there will actually be 240 less car parking spaces for staff than currently exist.  Between now and 2019, a whole change in culture and behaviour will take place within the children's hospitals and within the adults'.  Public transport is there.  It is the best served hospital in the country for public transport.  By forfeiting those 240 car parking spaces off, first thing in the morning and last thing in the evening, that frees up a bit of capacity.  That is when people are coming to the outpatient services and we use up that capacity.  What the analysis shows is that we are at 5% increase at peak, morning and evening.</p></speech>

I suppose it is quite early in the project to be at the philanthropy stage.  At this stage, the proposal is that we would appoint a committee member to the children's hospital group board with expertise in philanthropy and that there would be an executive that would work with that committee to ensure that the right approach is taken from the outset to secure the right type of philanthropy that can be secured for such a project.  It is really only the starting point of philanthropy for this project.</p></speech>

We have designed it as a stand-alone building and the construction phase for that would be approximately two years.  The construction phase for the main hospital is approximately four years, so there is a potential two-year lag.  The research building would not actually need to start being constructed until two years after the children's hospital.</p></speech>

I also thank Deputy Thomas Pringle for organising the meeting.</p> <p>  The introduction of double funding has impacted very severely on farmers with a few hectares as they can no longer benefit from both the GLAS and organic schemes.  A severe financial cut has been imposed on the smaller producer.  We seek to have the schemes front-loaded to lessen the impact on those with small farms.  We have a copy of our submission on the CAP and rural development plan.  We want to know the reason the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine decided to ignore our submission in favour of the completely one sided scheme it has introduced and disregarded the financial implications for the smaller producer.  We are not looking for more money but want the funds to be fairly distributed to allow those with small farms to continue to farm organically.  We also have a copy of the observations made by the planners which point to the major problems from their point of view.</p> <p>  The Department needs to define clearly the role of a certification body.  We ask why the Department cannot do this work?  What the certification body is charging farmers is absolutely scandalous.  Sums ranging from 9% to 25% of the organic payment have to be paid to the certification body.  I have three examples of fees paid to the certification body in the five year lifetime of the scheme: a farmer with 12 hectares pays &euro;2,200; a farmer with 30 hectares pays &euro;3,000, while a farmer with 50 hectares pays &euro;3,100.</p><p>The body not only collects fees from farmers, it also collects from factories, co-op marts, shops and butchers, etc.  It is also funded by the Department.  In its present form the scheme is completely biased in favour of the big farmer to the detriment of the small operator and needs to be reviewed urgently.</p><p> A problem with payments came to light once again this week.  We always have a problem in getting paid.  There seems to be an ongoing problem in paying out under the organic farming scheme.  Payments under all other schemes are made on time; the single farm payment, the rural environment protection, REP, payments and payments under areas of natural constraint schemes are all made inside the year, usually before Christmas.  The organic farming payment which had been due at the end of 2014 was not made until February 2015 and it took a protest by our members at the agri-environment schemes, AES, office in Athenry to force the Department to pay out.  The Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, gave us a commitment that this would never happen again as the organic farming scheme would be included in the electronic system, like all other schemes, but that has not happened.  We were in contact with Johnstown Castle earlier this week and informed that the electronic payments system would apply only to new entrants and those included in the scheme previously would remain on the old system.  I asked what progress had been made with the applications not included in the electronic system.  The man said no files had yet arrived in Johnstown Castle from any area office in the country.  This can have only one outcome - our payments will be late again this year.</p><p> We had to face into last Christmas without the organic farming payment.  The position this year will be far worse because the REPS 4 scheme has finished and many of the farmers in that scheme will face a far more serious financial problem this year.  It is essential that the organic farming payment be made in line with all others.  Farmers are keeping their end of the deal, but the Department is not.</p></speech>

Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v wanted to be here, as he is concerned about the problems of the delegates.</p> <p>  Like some of the others around the table, I come from the west.  While many farmers in the area are not engaged in organic farming, they do farm areas of natural constraint, whether it be natural heritage and endangered species, NHES, areas or special areas of conservation, SAC, etc.  The Government has set a target to increase the current rate of organic farming from 1.1% of land in Ireland.  The EU average is under 6%.  We are, therefore, not in line with the European convention.</p> <p>  Food Harvest 2020 and Food Wise 2025 set out a pathway to developing production in agriculture, but they do not recognise the need to protect the environment, to look after areas of natural constraint and to advance organic farming to bring us more into line with the rest of Europe.  That is a mistake.  Under Food Wise 2015 there is an over-emphasis on production.  My information from the European Commission is that Ireland will face penalties, unless this issue is addressed before we travel down the road to a production-based system.  We all want to increase production.  The previous Government brought forward Food Harvest 2020 which was the template for Food Wise 2025.  Northern Ireland wants to follow that blueprint, too.  Unfortunately, the environmental lobby within the European Union is very strong and under the Kyoto Protocol Ireland must meet its targets; otherwise it will be fined and the taxpayer will carry the can.  There is, therefore, a need to embrace organic farming and entice more people into the sector.  </p> <p>  The delegates say the farmers already included in the system are finding it exceptionally difficult to deal with it.  How, therefore, can we entice new people into it?  There is a need to deal with this issue.  The delegates have identified several issues.  The discontinuation of the REPS will have a major impact.  I did not realise the certification fee was so high, but it is exceptionally high.  Are there two or three simple things we could do for farmers already involved in the sector and to entice more farmers into it?  Organic farming is not for everyone, but it does suit certain farm holdings.  It should be linked with areas of natural constraint which need to be supported.  The European Commission is advancing the argument that they should be given more support, but that comes down to a departmental decision.  What are the views of delegates of Food Wise 2025?  Are the environmental benefits of organic farming sufficiently recognised?  Is there something simple the committee could suggest or recommend to the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, in regard to the payments made?  The payments should be in line with all others.  I do not see why there should be a delay in making organic farming payments when all the others are made and there has been a 75% advance, in October, on payments due this year.  Are organic farmers not receiving payments other farmers receive until February or March the following year?  That does not make any sense and needs to be addressed forthwith to bring the payments into line with all others.  I was not aware of this problem.</p> <p>  It is fine to set out performance or outcome targets to increase production from 1.1% of land used for organic farming to 5%.  Departments are very good at setting targets, but sometimes they are not specified on performance outcome measures.  Going from 1% to 5% is a 500% increase in organic farming over the lifetime of Food Wise 2025 and the Department does not have a pathway or framework to achieve that target.  What the delegates are bringing to the table today is vitally important and the Department needs to react to it.  I will support the delegates because Ireland needs to market itself on the international stage as a green, clean, agriculture friendly environment.  We can use organic farming to our advantage in that regard.  </p> <p>  I thank the delegates for coming and look forward to further interaction during the meeting.</p></speech>

Organic farming is a very poor relation in the overall farming sector.  It is neglected politically and discriminated against, not just by this but also by previous Governments.</p> <p>  Mr Finnegan has mentioned that while some organic farmers can no longer benefit under both schemes, the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, and the organic scheme, larger existing organic holdings can do so.  To me, that is absolute and total discrimination.  What reason for this was given to the delegates?  Has it something to do with the size of holdings?  If that is the case, it is a policy driven by a desire to get rid of the smaller and weaker person.  Was this also the case under the previous Government?</p></speech>

The delay in making payments is inexcusable because those involved in all other sectors are being paid.  A figure of 75% has been paid out this month, for whatever reason.</p><p>We can suspect the reason for it, but it is being paid out this month.  I am delighted that is the case because everybody involved in the agricultural sector has many bills to pay coming up to Christmas and receiving early payment in this respect makes a big difference.</p><p> I note the figures involved in respect of the certification body.  For a farmer with 12 hectares the amount to be paid is &euro;2,200, for a farmer with 30 hectares it is &euro;3,000, and for a farmer with 50 hectares it is &euro;3,100.  I cannot honestly understand that.  I could understand it if a farmer with 12 hectares had to pay &euro;1,500 and a farmer with 30 hectares had to pay &euro;2,800 or &euro;3,000.  A farmer who increases his hectares from 12 to 30 has to pay &euro;3,000, which is an increase of &euro;800 on what he would have to pay for 12 hectares but a farmer who increases his hectares from 30 to 50, which is a difference of 20 hectares, has to pay only an extra &euro;100.  That is mind-boggling, to say the least.</p><p> What does the certification process entail?  It was said the certification should be done by the Department, but an outside body is to be involved in this context  It is a money-gathering exercise that is being paid for by the organic farmer producers.  The representative body should raise with the Equality Authority the fact that smaller organic farmers are being denied the two payments while the larger organic farmers are getting the two payments.  Has the representative body considered raising that issue with the Equality Authority or with the Ombudsman, both of which entities are supposed to give those who are more discriminated against an opportunity to get justice?  The representatives should consider doing that.  I thank them for their presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.683" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1198" speakername="Michael Fitzmaurice" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015100800002#D00200"><p>I welcome the representatives.  There is a problem in terms of the double payment for those farmers who have 17 or 18 hectares.  I understand a farmer who was a participant in the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, could be a participant of that scheme and of the organic scheme and receive payments under the two schemes, but now a farmer will get only one or other of those payments.  If a farmer has ten hectares under the organic scheme, that farmer cannot get a GLAS payment in respect of that land, so he is caught in that way.  There seems to be a gap in terms of the scheme for the farmer who has between five to 17 or 18 hectares.  If a farmer had 20 hectares, he could apply ten hectares to each scheme.  It is not possible for the smaller farmers to do that and that is the problem.  It is a front-loaded system and comprises Pillar 2 funding.  Such funding will go out one door or the other.  If, as the representatives said, farmers are getting out of the organic sector, they will move into GLAS and the Pillar 2 funding will go out that door.  To keep people in organic farming, they should be given an incentive or front-loading in respect of payment for the first 20 hectares.</p> <p>  To be fully compliant with the organic farming scheme, I understand a farmer must be in it for two years before his cattle, sheep or other animals will be recognised as organic.  A new plan has been embarked upon this year to bring many larger farmers into the sector.  Am I correct in understanding that those farmers' cattle, sheep or other animals will not be recognised as organic for two years?  Do the representatives know the number of farmers who are engaged in organic farming, the number of smaller producers who will jump ship and are ready to leave the sector due to the lack of incentive in it?  That will leave a gap in the sector over the next year and a half until the other animals as recognised as organic.  That will cause a major problem in that we will not fulfil what we have said to Europe we would fulfil.</p> <p>  In respect of the delay in payments, there was an industrial dispute about that last year.  The representatives are correct in saying that the process is being dealt with manually.  That was supposed to be sorted at that time and obviously the issue is arising again.  Have the representatives been given a reason they cannot be put onto the system if new entrants are being put onto it?</p> <p>  It is mainly smaller farmers who are engaged in the organic sector.  Do the representatives know the number of farmers who intend to leave the scheme, be it this year, early next year or the end of next year?  We need to know if there will be a gap in the market in terms of the loss of recognised organic meat.</p> <p>  Serious questions need to be asked about the categories of payments to be made to the certification body.  Will there be one or two, or more, certification bodies?  Will they do the work of the Department?  That is the key question.  There may be a sufficient number of inspectors in the Department to cover that work.  What is the representative body's view of the certification process?  In terms of over-pricing in that respect, the figures presented indicate that the smaller the producer's operation, the harder he is hit.  That is not the way it should be if we want to keep the smaller farmers in the sector.  It may be worthwhile inviting in the people who are in charge of the certification body and asking them directly what is the problem or why the small farmers are basically being screwed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.684" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1169" speakername="Mary Ann O'Brien" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015100800002#D00300"><p>I thank all the representatives for coming in and making a presentation and for taking a day off because I would say they can afford to take a day off like the can afford to have a hole in the head.  I also thank Deputy Thomas Pringle who invited the representatives to appear before the committee.  Is it possible in a timely fashion to invite in the management of the organic certification board to make a presentation and share their figures?</p> <p>  I have a limited knowledge of organic certification in the food business because we have organic certification in Lily OBrien's, and it is a pain in the neck and it is also costly.  That is all I will tell the representatives about that.  There is need to have it.  It is a great business to be in.  One can charge a premium for one's product but I have always been quite resentful about the certification aspect because it is very difficult.  However, I am not comparing myself to the representative body or its members.  I have a few friends who are organic farmers and it is a tough way of life, but I am a great believer in marketing.  Mr. Aidan Cotter from Bord Bia said that if one were to take a satellite picture of any country in the world, what other country looks green and is a little island on the edge of the Europe?  Therefore, what country is better positioned to have a strong organic sector?  However, from the figures the representatives shared with us and those that Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill shared in response, we are using only 1.1% of the land in this respect while the average in use is 6%.  I am not surprised about that when the representatives have told us about the mess the payments are in.  Could we invite in a departmental representative from Johnstown Castle?  It is not acceptable in this day and age to have electronic payments in the mess that has been described whereby a bigger newer entrant is getting their payment but another applicant might have to wait until February to be paid.  If I were one of the representatives before us, I would just go to the pub.  They have voluntarily set up this group to look after the interests of the organic farmers.</p> <p>  The organic certification body concerns me greatly.  As Deputy Martin said, the payment in respect of 30 to 50 hectares will be &euro;3,000 to &euro;3,100.  What genius worked that out?  The payment in respect of 12 hectares is &euro;2,200 and in respect of 50 hectares it is &euro;3,100.  I agree with the strong words the Deputy used in terms of the smaller producers being politically neglected and discriminated against.  I am very pleased that the representatives are here.  They are members of a small group and therefore are not sexy.  We all want to talk about the dairy sector and the fact that the quota has been lifted.  I believe in this group and they will do the environment of Ireland, the environmental cause, climate change and tourism a great deal of good.  All of us here will do anything we can to assist the group.</p></speech>

Many of the issues have been dealt with.  I understand the problem the representative body has with late payments because cashflow is very important, regardless of the sector of farming in which one is engaged.</p><p>If payments are being held up since February, the committee has to take up the issue and contact the Department about it.</p><p> Everyone has spoken about a certification body but no one has identified it.  Is it a private company?  Is it a closed shop or is there more than one body or group that carries out certification?  Will someone identify the certification body to us?  We do not know the structures for the payments.  Is there a basic payment for certification plus an additional cost per hectare?  Is it something like that?   It is important that the body be identified. </p><p> Organic production is a lot lower than that in normal farming.  It is therefore necessary to be able to realise a premium price in the market.  I know we are not dealing with that issue here, which concerns supply, but, as already stated, 1% of land is involved in organic farming.  If we can get more land used in organic farming, retailers and sellers would be more sure of the supply and, especially, that the products are of Irish origin.  It may be beneficial in that regard to have more people producing organically. </p><p> The new GLAS scheme and the fact that people cannot receive both payments was mentioned.  The latest scheme is the beef genomics scheme.  Was there any concession by the Department to the practice of organic farming in the beef genomics scheme?  Has anything been done on this issue?</p></speech>

I have been a long-time supporter of the concept of organic farming.  When it first became official, if one were to put it as such, and guys such as those here today got involved in it, I welcomed it because I thought it was great.  As Senator O'Brien said, what better place than this green and pleasant land to produce organic farm products?  I remember reading about the Italian market, in particular, which was very susceptible to premium Irish beef selling at big prices.  However, I cannot understand the situation the witnesses have been telling us about today.  There seems to be a lack of urgency among the various State agencies in the development of organic farming.  I agree with Senator O'Brien and others that we as a committee have a responsibility to the group here today to pull in all the various people involved.  It is disappointing that a Minister of State would make a promise to the group that was not fulfilled.  That is very significant.  I am not playing politics here, but it is unacceptable that a Minister of State would sit a person down, face him or her eyeball to eyeball and say that he sees the problem and that it is going to be solved, only for the person to find that it has not been solved.  If we cannot have faith in the system, it will lead to chaos.  I propose that the Minister of State with responsibility for organic farming and his officials be brought before this committee.  I agree with Senator O'Brien that those who are involved in the certification process should be brought in here also, along with officials from An Bord Bia.</p> <p>  The witnesses are absolutely right when they talk about targets.  In other committees, we have been going through performance targets set by Departments, which are currently going through a mid-term review.  It is becoming apparent that Government Departments are falling well short of the mark in terms of what they say one day and what they do the next.  There is a big gap between the two realities.  The group is not alone in that regard.  We are increasingly finding this to be the case as well.  I am appalled by some of the results obtained from the process.  I am on another committee which yesterday went through the targets with a Minister.  The Departments are not meeting their targets, but they look lovely.  They all look very impressive.  It is the responsibility of this committee to get the people who are making the decisions before it and have them made accountable.  They need to answer the questions that have been put here today.  We would be doing a good day's work for the group if we were to do that, and I am sure everyone in this committee would support that initiative.  I am sure the Chairman has a view on it, but I am specifically asking that the Minister of State and officials from An Bord Bia come before the committee.  They are talking about organic farming being at 5%.  As my colleague, Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill, has said, that is a 500% increase.  Based on my little experience, as explained, of performance targets set by other Departments, the target is pie in the sky, yet the group here today is being penalised under the inspection regime.  I do not understand it.  It seems as if someone somewhere is saying organic farming is a great concept but is doing everything possible to restrict and inhibit it and stop its progress in every way.  That is not on.  It is not good for the witnesses or Irish farming.  </p> <p>  That is my proposal.  I am sure the Chairman will be able to formulate the necessary request to the relevant bodies.  I wish the witnesses well and am grateful that they have come before the committee.  I have been working in tandem with Deputy Fitzmaurice on this issue.  He has been filling me in a lot over the past couple of days on the problems and difficulties faced by the group.  As Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill stated, we are all west of Ireland people and we understand fully the difficulties the group is facing.</p></speech>

Many years ago, all of us on the old system were told to send in a bank account number or we would not get paid.  If it is online, at least it gets processed and cleared and goes out in a batch.</p> <p>  I have just taken a few minutes to read the rules.  Is the issue that the GLAS scheme is excluded, or is it the restrictive nature of the measures?  For instance, the rules state that the GLAS action of "consolidation of solitary bees" is "allowed along with the OFS payment," but the next one, which is breeding waders, is allowable only where the OFS payment is foregone for that area.  Is that the issue?  Can the witnesses clarify whether it is completely out, or is it the selection of measures that makes it restrictive for smaller organic farmers?  The group now has a list of questions, one of which concerns the certification body.  No one knows who or what it is or whether it is private or public.  Is it the Organic Trust?  Who or what is it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.694" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Padraic Finnegan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015100800002#E00900"><p>I did not write down the questions, which is a problem.  To clarify one point about the smaller operator who cannot, as Deputy Fitzmaurice said, qualify for both schemes, a double-funding issue was brought in from Europe in the past few years.  A person cannot apply for two schemes on the same piece of ground.  If a person has 60 ha of land, that has no effect at all.  If a person has 20 ha of land, he or she has to choose one scheme or the other.  To maximise payments, a farmer with 20 ha might decide that he will put 10 ha into the GLAS scheme.  He is then left with 10 ha in the organic scheme because he cannot claim on both schemes.  He still has to pay the certification bodies for the entire 20 ha, which, again, makes it far less viable for him.</p> <p>  For financial reasons, questions were asked about the possibility of farmers' leaving the organic scheme and concentrating on the GLAS scheme.  The Department is now telling us that if an organic farmer pulls out of organic farming, he will be kicked out of the GLAS scheme as well.  The Department knows what it has done.  This is an attempt to trap the farmers.  If there was a mass exodus from organic farming by smaller producers, it would look bad for the Department, so it has brought in this ingenious rule which provides that if a person leaves the organic farming scheme he or she will be automatically kicked out of the GLAS scheme.  In the new scheme, the Department says that if a person is in organics, he or she will be given automatic entry into the GLAS scheme.  It is called priority access to GLAS.</p></speech>

At the other end of the scale, perhaps in the west of Ireland where farms are small, the fact that REPS is gone means that this double-funding is the worst thing that ever happened.  For some reason, neither the Irish Government nor the MEPs nor anybody else seem to have fought against it.  The only people affected by the double-funding issue are the smallest and most vulnerable farms in the country.  They have been absolutely hammered.</p></speech>

We have been told that one could be kicked out of it if one got into it, and that if one has owned meadow or pasture up to now - I accept that this is changing - one might get into GLAS down the road by not being in organics.  I am saying that if the money does not go out this door for the organics scheme, the farmer can go out the other side.  It is going to go one way or the other.  We thought were better advised to keep the witnesses in the organics scheme.  Can the witnesses address the problem of the two-year scenario before one is recognised as organic?  Are we going to have a drop in the number of organic cattle or whatever between one phase and the other?  Do the witnesses understand what I am saying?</p></speech>

Cattle cannot be killed as organic.  They are in what is called "conversion".  One is in conversion for the first two years.  One is paid at a slightly higher rate for those two years because one has to farm organically, but one cannot sell any organic produce.  The conversion period is two years.  If many farmers were to leave now, as has been suggested, there would certainly be a major shortfall in the two years before the next round, when much bigger farmers come on stream to take up-----</p></speech>

He will join GLAS.  I would say he had approximately 20 ha.  We originally got together as a group three and a half years ago when we saw the double-funding issue coming to light and decided to do something about it.  We have been highlighting that issue since then.  We knew that CAP would be coming on stream, so we put in our submissions and said there was a need to ensure whatever was planned as part of the new organics scheme was compatible with the new REPS.  The Government knew that the double-funding issue was there.  We were looking to front-load the payment to the smaller farmer, but they did not front-load it.  They actually increased it from a 55-ha payment to a 60-ha payment.  I think there are approximately 44,000 farmers with less than 20 ha.  Many of them are in the west of Ireland.  We could understand - to a point - why this was being done.  They wanted to get the acres in and they did not mind about the production.  It was handy for them to get in a bigger amount.  They were also saying they needed to get more crops grown and more protein.  We accept this is an issue.  They were hoping bigger tillage farmers would get into it.  We would prefer the payment to the smaller farmer to be front-loaded because that would allow him to grow his own crop or compensate him for the price he would have to pay.  We have been highlighting the double-funding issue for three years.  I suppose they have increased the organic payment from &euro;106 per hectare to &euro;170 per hectare.  It is a big increase all right.  We came up with our own figures and costings and we sent all of that in.  They gave us the &euro;170, but then they came along with the GLAS which gives &euro;315 to a farmer with 10 ha.  The figure of &euro;3,000 for certification equates to &euro;600 a year.  A farmer over the wall might not have been paying that &euro;600.  We actually have to pay it for six years because our year starts in the middle of the year, in May.  We need to have certification from the start of the year.  In the final year - the fifth year - we are in the middle of another year so we need to pay our certification costs again.  That means we actually pay &euro;3,600.</p></speech>

I think we were saying it is another 28% on the smaller farmer.  The certification cost is not 28%, however; it is actually over 30%.  It is 32% or 33%.  We wanted to front-load the small lad to enable him to pay the certification costs.  If a 20-ha farmer, who could get &euro;170 under the organic scheme for each of his 20 ha, wants to join GLAS, he cannot get the &euro;315.  He can get a payment for stone walls and hedges, etc., but he cannot get the &euro;315 unless he drops 10 ha out of the organic payment.  He would still have to farm it organically.  In my own case, I have 28 ha.  I was delighted that the increase under the organic scheme was &euro;1,800, but I had to drop 10 ha.  This meant I had to drop &euro;1,700 from my organic payment to maximise the GLAS payment.  I am kind of in the middle.  We have some lads with larger numbers of hectares.  One of our lads who cannot be here today would have 55 ha or 60 ha.  He could get the full organic payment of &euro;170 per hectare for the 60 hectares.  He does not need to go for the &euro;315.  He has enough stone walls, hedges and the other things one can do to get the full GLAS payment.  He is able to get his full organic payment and his full GLAS payment.  He is paying &euro;3,000 or &euro;3,600, whereas the small lad is paying &euro;2,000 or &euro;2,400 and therefore cannot-----</p></speech>

It was actually cut by approximately 70%.  If one divides the &euro;44 million into six years, it is approximately &euro;7 million per year.  The original budget was &euro;10 million, but they were spending just &euro;4.5 million.  I will explain the way they were calculating it in order to say it had gone up by 40% or 50%.  They said they had been spending &euro;4.5 million and now they were going to spend &euro;6 million or &euro;7 million.  I suggest it was actually cut.  When we were setting out the measures we wanted, we calculated how much it would cost on the basis of 1,500 farmers being involved.  We estimated that there were 1,100 or 1,200 farmers involved in the organic scheme and that an increase of 20% or 30% was expected.  On that basis, we calculated that this would cost approximately &euro;2 million if it was front-loaded.</p><p>They said the money was not there.  A few months ago they put another &euro;12 million into organic and we were looking &euro;2 million to front-load it.  They have put another &euro;12 million in and now there is &euro;56 million in it.  The member spoke about the 1% in organic going to 5%.  If they were serious about organic and they wanted to go up to 5%, one would want a 500% increase in the organic budget.</p><p> One could say all the mountain areas from Kerry to Donegal are organic but they do not have the paper.  In the context of Food Wise 2025 and going from &euro;10.5 billion where we are now up to &euro;19 billion, we could increase our export value if all the food produced along the west coast was organic.  We do not need to increase calving or the stocking rate.  The food would be there if it were labelled organic.  If there was a good scheme for them, it would come down from the mountains and could be fattened on the lowland.  The market in Europe is &euro;22 billion for organic and the Irish market is worth &euro;100 million.  We are way down.</p></speech>

All the commonage land in the west is organic essentially because it is commonly owned and no one spreads fertiliser there.  The only thing running through it is the water coming through the rocks, which is organic water nearly as well.  The biggest mistake in the CAP reform was not to front-load payments for smaller farmers across the board, including organic.  Our spokesman, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, championed that cause because it would have helped smaller farmers to stay in business.  There are some smaller farmers who might be getting on in years and want to hand it over but there is no incentive to do so.  They are cornered because they are not able to expand.  They do not have the resources, they are not making the profit and they cannot expand.  The bigger guys are coming in and taking over the land.  Unfortunately, the structure of the CAP is helping the big guy and penalising the small guy.</p> <p>  While it has increased to &euro;170 per hectare, that does not even meet the average hectare payment in Ireland, which is about &euro;250 or &euro;260 per hectare.  They are not even getting the average hectare payment.  Some people are getting &euro;500 or &euro;600 per hectare.  Others earn &euro;100 and they have been taken up-----</p></speech>

However, they are still not getting the average basic payment even taking that into account.</p> <p>  We should have a solution or a recommendation we could make to the Minister.  The Department has a target of 5%.  To keep people farming organically and to incentivise new people to come on board, should the Minister increase the payment for the first 20 or 30 hectares?  What figure would Mr. Monaghan propose?</p></speech>

It was &euro;340 for the first 20 hectares and &euro;225 for the next one and then &euro;115, which is much less than &euro;170.  We were doing it on 55 hectares because that is what the original one was.  They came in across the board with &euro;170 for everything.  That could still be put back to 50 hectares.  If a farmer with 60 hectares is getting &euro;170 and ten hectares are taken off him but he is given twice as much for the first ten hectares, he will still get the same amount of money, but it will help the smaller lad survive.</p></speech>

At the moment we have to carry half a unit per hectare and on the mountain areas they are not carrying that.  They might have three or four hectares for a half unit.  Our payment is based on a stocking rate.  However, if the stocking rate were reduced for the mountains or even front-loaded, we would get them on it then.  It would be essential for the mountains to have a good organic scheme.  As Mr. Lambert said, they will get Pillar 2 anyway; there will be a scheme for them.  To bring them into it, certification costs would have to come down to zero and their stocking rate reduced or front-loaded.</p></speech>

Going back 20 years everything was done on paper.  There was a big packet of forms sent out, some of which were needed and more which were not.   Now everything is done online so that role is greatly diminished and there is little or none of it to be done.  They used to go to livestock marts and the farmers had to straw-bed all the cattle.  They would have their biros out and be writing things down.  That is gone.  We can sell organic cattle now at an ordinary mart.  We have actually a sale coming up in Castlerea next Saturday and there will be a few pens of organic cattle.  Their role has diminished.</p></speech>

As producers, we have one or two outlets and feel there is a bit of a cartel.  None of us here today went to the local butcher's shop and bought organic.  It is too costly for the local butcher; he would have to pay about &euro;1,500 a year for a licence and would have to keep everything segregated.  He is not going to do that for maybe 5% of his food sales.  If he was given an incentive, if the licence was brought down or if he could avail of an introductory one for a couple of years, then I would have some place to go locally.  All the local people would have an opportunity to buy organic food from a local butcher or shop.</p></speech>

We are one of the few schemes that are inspected every year by certification bodies.  We have a document here that came from Frank Macken from the Department saying this was discussed at EU level, and the EU has no problem with going on to what they call a risk-based inspection arrangement.</p><p>This means farmers' properties would not have to be inspected every year.  In my case - I have been involved in organics for 13 or 14 years - I have never had a black mark against me and would be seen as low risk.  However, my property is inspected every year.  Mr. Connelly and I went to Brussels in the spring and met some people from the European Commission who told us this issue had been raised there but that, oddly enough, Ireland had voted against it and wanted to retain the existing system.  It would be interesting to know who voted against it in Brussels.  Clearly, the European Union has no problem with setting up a risk-based system that would lower the cost of certification.</p><p> On the issue of certification, a document from the IOFGA's annual general meeting asks questions regarding the association's lobby group or certification body.  The answer to these questions was that IOFGA is a certification body.  However, it had extended its scope to include promotion for members.  It is contracted to the Department as a certification body, not as a promotion group.  Therefore, it should be required to do what it is contracted for.  If we look at the document, we can see the various people involved.  There is a Jim Carew, who is-----</p></speech>

We should also discuss the scheme, as it is tailored, and the restrictions that apply in respect of the double payment.  They are the key points.</p> <p>  I would like to bring to the witnesses attention the fact that we made a contribution to the debate last November because, during its Presidency of the European Union, Italy produced a position paper on amendments to the organic area in regard to transition, certification and rules.  This committee put forward 11 observations on the paper, which would have had an impact on Irish organic farming potential at the time.  We can provide those observations, which were sent to both the Commission and the Minister, to the witnesses.</p></speech>

What happens at present is that a regulation is introduced without any contact being made with farmers and then we discover the regulation is unworkable.  We then have to go back to try to get it changed.  Consider, for example, the regulation being introduced now in regard to straw beds under which farmers will be obliged to put straw beds on concrete floors for livestock.  However, nowadays we have modernised to slatted sheds and could put straw on them.  However, the rule now states that we cannot put straw on slats and must fill the slat channels with concrete to do so.  Anybody in his right mind would know that if we put straw on slats and put animals in on that, all the waste will go straight through and it is still a dry bed.  This new rule defeats that purpose.  The rule was brought in, but no contact was made with us to ask whether it was workable.</p> <p>  We have carried out significant research here in Ireland and, in the context of livestock housing, we are ahead of Europe in many ways in regard to mats, etc.  We cannot have mats on the floors under the stock.</p></speech>

I am old enough to remember when we did not have fertilisers or sprays.  Everything has advanced significantly now.  These rules are taken from back then instead of being operated in the current, up-to-date procedures in agriculture.  Teagasc needs to do more research.  It does a certain amount but it is limited in resources at the coal face.  The people working in Teagasc are very good at their job, but they are limited in numbers.  Teagasc had an organic farm at the college in Athenry, but it was closed down two or three years ago.</p></speech>

None of the rest of us got an opportunity chance of buying any of the stock that had been certified as organic.  The animals were brought to the local mart and sold off.  This is the type of thing that is going on.  We are trying to fight a rearguard action.  If the regulations had been laid before a committee of some kind, we could have taken the opportunity to discuss with it what might and might not be workable.  That would give us some chance but it is not what happens.</p></speech>

That is correct in regard to the Department and payments because the payment we receive is a five-year one.  However, in regard to the certification body costs, the scheme starts in May, so a farmer has six years of licence fees.  In the first year, when starting off, there is a reduced rate or introductory-type fee, which is perhaps half of what is expected.  Once the first five years are up, if the farmer wants to continue with organics, he proceeds on to another five years.  However, it is a six-year contract for which he pays for licences.  He is paying for licences for six years but the figures we provided are for five years.  Therefore, the amount a farmer with 10 ha of land would have to pay would be 31% and the amount for a farmer with 30 ha would be 14%.  There is quite a difference in the figures.</p></speech>

I again thank the witnesses for their attendance.  In respect of witness privilege, I advise witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in respect of a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I call on Dr. Croke to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for the invitation to appear before it to discuss dental regulation.  The Dental Council of Ireland has been in correspondence with the joint committee following a letter of 16 October 2014 from Mr. Paul Kelly, principal clerk.  This letter resulted from the meeting of this committee with representatives of the Clinical Dental Technicians Association Ireland, CDTAI, on 1 October 2014 and I will return to the matter of that letter in the course of our submission.</p> <p>  First, I will outline the role of the Dental Council of Ireland.  The council was established by the Dentists Act 1985.  The primary function of the Dental Council of Ireland is to protect the public.  It does so by promoting high standards of education, as well as professional, ethical behaviour for all its registrants.  The council is composed of 19 members.  There are three main committees of the council, namely, education and training, fitness to practice and auxiliary dental workers.</p><p>The council's term of office is five years.  There is mandatory registration for dentists and specialists, of which there are two recognised specialties - orthodontics and oral surgery.  Mandatory registration is in place also for dental hygienists, clinical dental technicians and orthodontic therapists.  The council has a voluntary register for dental nurses and is working very closely with dental technicians to establish a voluntary register.</p><p> The Dental Council of Ireland awaits a new dental Act.  The council has been consistent in seeking new legislation that would permit effective, flexible regulation which is evidence-based, equitable and proportionate.  The council acknowledges the progress made by the Department of Health in the lifetime of this D&aacute;il but regrets the continuing delay in the enactment of new legislation.  The council met with the representatives of the professional regulation unit of the Department of Health recently to discuss its summary of policy issues for inclusion in the new dental Bill, of which members have a copy.  </p><p> I will introduce the major topics which arise from the summary of policy issues.  Key policy issue No. 1 is fitness to practise.  The council urges in the strongest terms that the wording in Part V of the Dentists Act 1985 on fitness to practise be retained and amended rather than introducing the very prescriptive provisions of both the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 and Nurses and Midwives Bill 2010.  The council's experience of operating the provisions of Part V of the current Dentists Act is that the procedures work well for managing fitness to practise matters.  The Dental Council of Ireland broadly supports the main provisions of both the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 and the Nurses and Midwives Bill 2010 in providing for a preliminary proceedings committee which is separate from the fitness to practise committee, the establishment of a health committee and for a wider range of sanctions.  In the Dental Council of Ireland&rsquo;s view, the same range of sanctions that apply to practitioners should apply to all registrants and to the entity registering dental premises including, in the case of the latter, the power to temporarily or permanently close dental premises and to attach conditions to the ongoing registration of dental premises.</p><p> Key policy issue No. 5 is the regulation of the allied dental health professions.  The Dental Council of Ireland strongly disagrees with the provision in the summary of policy issues that only those allied dental health professions who work independently will be registered.  The Dental Council of Ireland believes this proposal to be regressive and potentially harmful to patient safety and the development of the dental team.  To ensure it has the capacity to fulfil valid regulatory function, to enhance patient-centred safer, better health care, the Dental Council of Ireland requires the new dental Act to provide mandatory registration for all members of the dental team, including dental technicians.</p><p> The issue of registration and regulation is at the core of illegal practice, which the Clinical Dental Technicians Association Ireland, CDTAI, brought to this committee's attention.  In that meeting the representatives alleged "that there are significant numbers of people illegally practising as dental technicians in Ireland" and further alleged "there has been a complete failure on the part of the Dental Council of Ireland to regulate the profession".  The registrar of the Dental Council of Ireland repudiated the false allegations made against the council in his letter to Mr. Kelly of 23 October 2014.  The Dental Council of Ireland, under the Dentists Act 1985, has no power to inspect or close illegal practice.  The limitations imposed on the Dental Council of Ireland by the present Act to deal with alleged illegal practice are widely recognised and were noted in the Competition Authority's report on dentistry in 2007.  The inability of the Dental Council of Ireland to directly intervene in illegal practice is known to the CDTAI, as clinical dental technicians have representation on the council's auxiliary dental workers committee.  Many hours have been given to the CDTAI representatives, within Dental Council of Ireland and in informal meetings, to explore their concerns.  They are fully aware of the limitations of the Dental Council of Ireland's power and the CDTAI has misrepresented the council's powers to the committee.</p><p> The issue of illegal denturist practice highlights a quintessential issue to any discussion on dental regulation.  Without registration, can regulation be effective, transparent or consistent?  How is accountability enforced?  It is the stated desire of all organisations representing those who work legally within dentistry that mandatory registration should be provided by the new dental Act for all dental health care professionals.</p><p> Key policy issue No. 7 is the board.  The proposal that a new dental Act would limit the council size to a maximum of 12 members will irrefutably change the successful operational traits of the Dental Council of Ireland.  While the council appreciates that one of the main aims of having a non-dental majority is to minimise the perception of professionals protecting professionals when considering fitness to practise cases, it is important to understand that most of the work the council undertakes relates to dental education and general practice.  To operate effectively, it is vitally important that the voice of dental educators and specialists, as well as members of the general practice dental team, are represented at council.  The Dental Council of Ireland advises that regulatory impact analysis specifically assesses the necessity and effectiveness of the proposed changes in light of the council's day-to-day workload and international best practice.</p><p> Key policy issue No. 9 is the regulation and inspection of dental practices.  The Dental Council of Ireland welcomes the provision made in the summary of policy issues that new legislation will provide for the regulation and inspection of dental practices and premises and that it will also provide that regulation and inspection powers will be held by the Dental Council of Ireland.  The Dental Council of Ireland believes it is best positioned to oversee the registration and inspection process because of the expertise it has developed over years of regulating dental practitioners.  Legally and administratively, it makes sense for one body to regulate both dental practitioners and dental practices and for that body to have an inspectorate.  Most important, it is probable that serious breaches of regulations concerning dental premises will also uncover matters which may form the grounds of a complaint against one or more dental health care professionals.  In order to deal with such matters expeditiously it is necessary to have both regulatory functions under the direction of one organisation.</p><p> The Dental Council of Ireland would wish to see the new dental Act contain provisions giving it the power to enter and inspect a place where it is reasonably suspected that dentistry is being practised.  That power is essential to the ability of an inspectorate to investigate reports of illegal practice and would address the issues highlighted to this committee of illegal work undertaken by some dental technicians.  The Dental Council of Ireland is of the view that registered dental premises need not be owned or controlled by dentists but must be regulated.  The council proposes that the entity registering a dental premises must be accountable to the Dental Council of Ireland for ensuring compliance with the new Dental Act.  The framework set out in the Pharmacy Act 2007 allows the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland to register and inspect pharmacies as well as to regulate retail pharmacy businesses and could be adopted for inclusion in the new dental Act.</p><p> Key policy issue No. 10 relates to the principal dentist and registered owner representatives in dental practices.  The Dental Council of Ireland welcomes the provision made in the summary of policy issues that new legislation will provide for the appointment of principal dentists and registered owner representatives in dental practices and that this provision will also apply to any independent allied dental health practice established.  The council recommends that the proposed new dental Act allow the council to take criminal prosecutions in a manner similar to the provisions under the Pharmacy Act 2007 and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act 1998.</p><p> Key policy issue No. 12 relates to staggered term of office board appointments.  It is the strong view of the Dental Council of Ireland that corporate memory primarily rests with the staff of the Dental Council of Ireland who have acquired an understanding of the day-to-day functions of any council and the relevant legislation.  The Dental Council of Ireland is unaware of any evidence to indicate that staggering the terms of council members will improve the effectiveness or consistency of the council's functions.  </p><p> Key policy issues Nos. 18 and 19 relate to continued professional development for dentists and allied dental health professionals.  The Dental Council of Ireland welcomes the provision in the summary of policy issues that will require dentists and allied dental health professionals to maintain their own professional competence and that the Dental Council of Ireland can require them to demonstrate competence to its satisfaction in accordance with a professional competence scheme.  However, it questions how it is possible to do this when the proposals will effectively deregulate most allied dental health professionals.  If one has no register, how can one enforce a mandatory code of continuing professional development?</p><p> It is the council's intention that all registered allied dental health professionals will be accountable to the council with regard to continuing competence.  The Act should allow the council to refer issues concerning non-compliance to the preliminary proceedings committee under the fitness to practise provisions of the new Act.</p><p> The council has made previous submissions to the Department at its request.</p><p>There are two outstanding matters related to standards in patients safety which the summary of policy issues has not addressed.</p><p> The Dental Council of Ireland is very disappointed that foundation training is absent from the summary of policy issues.  The council aspires to the introduction of a mandatory foundation training scheme as it considers it not only an elemental part of continuing professional development but also an essential part of the development of any young dental professional.  Foundation training is a period of training following initial qualification and registration that builds on the achievements in the undergraduate curriculum and aims to produce a competent, caring, reflective practitioner.  This is generally achieved through treating patients under supervision and in taking part in structured and unstructured clinical review and learning.  The Dental Council of Ireland acknowledges that the current economic climate might make the introduction of a scheme challenging in the short term.  The council seeks a provision in the proposed dental Bill that would allow for the introduction of such a scheme by way of statutory rule.</p><p> Finally, the Dental Council of Ireland is concerned that professional indemnity is not addressed in the summary of policy issues.  Professional indemnity is an indispensable element of patient protection.  The Dental Council of Ireland is of the view that any registered member of the allied dental health professionals team who can perform intra-oral procedures for his or her patients must have appropriate professional indemnity cover.  The proposed Bill should allow the council make regulations in relation to indemnity.</p><p> I thank the committee for taking the time to consider this oral submission.  My colleagues and I would welcome the discussion of these and any other matters that the committee may wish us to address under dental regulation.</p></speech>

I now call on Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.839" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/969" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015100800002#D00300"><p>I thought Deputy Kelleher would be getting the first slot.  I join the Chairman in welcoming the representatives from the Dental Council of Ireland and I thank Dr. Croke for his comprehensive address to the committee.  I am encouraged by much of what Dr. Croke stated in terms of the importance of registration across the entire dental or dental-related team.  That is vital.</p> <p>  I will not go down the cul-de-sac of previous engagements that this committee has had with other voices from within the dental profession.  There is no benefit to that.  Dr. Croke will have his view and others will have theirs and our role here as legislators is to inform the Minister and inform the elected representatives of the people of the importance of given measures in the public interest, and it is on the public interest that we are primarily focused.</p> <p>  I have a number of issues.  The proposed dental Bill is long awaited.  There is a frustration in this that no doubt is shared among us all.  I note the position heretofore, as Dr. Croke's stated in his opening remarks that the primary function of the Dental Council of Ireland is to protect the public and ensure ethical behaviour for all its registrants.  That is the critical point here, that the behaviour of those who are not registrants but who are presenting themselves as duly approved practitioners creates a situation where, apparently, the Dental Council of Ireland does not have a role in terms of enforcement.  How do we address the situation where persons are not entitled to advertise the services that they offer and are neither properly qualified nor legally entitled to direct their services to the public?  There are examples of this, some of which are high profile.  Some have names with which we have become familiar in terms of an individual practising dentistry who is not registered with the Dental Council of Ireland and thereby is not an approved practitioner in this jurisdiction and, I understand certainly in one or more cases, not entitled to practice in any jurisdiction.  It is a matter of how we bridge all of these issues in the intervening period.</p> <p>  Has the Dental Council of Ireland confidence that the proposed legislation will properly provide and does it see, as I read from what Dr. Croke stated here this morning, that the council should have enhanced powers of enforcement, oversight, etc., and that it would cover the critical areas, including dentists, orthodontists, hygienists, dental nurses, clinical dental technicians and dental technicians?  It is critically important that all of these are properly registered.  Registration is the key issue.  Initially, one is talking in terms of dental technicians, of voluntary registration which would lead on the enactment of the proposed legislation to mandatory registration.  That would be a pathway to overcome some of the existing dichotomies.</p> <p>  There have been instances of dental technicians dealing with the public.  How, in the absence of the legislation, do we deal with the fact that there is evidence even of advertising by dental technicians who have no entitlement to so advertise their work?  Their engagement and their direct line management is through properly qualified dental practitioners.  They have no entitlement to engage with or service directly the public.  How does the Dental Council of Ireland see that weakness being dealt with in the absence of legislation?  Has it confidence that the proposed legislation will see that matter put to bed once and for all?</p> <p>  As matters stand in terms of the Dental Council of Ireland's powers, apparently over those only who are registered with it, how does it see the matter of those not registered with the council opening their doors and offering their so-called "skills" to the public?  I refer to persons who, in other jurisdictions within the European Union and perhaps elsewhere, have been de-registered in their respective countries of origin where they have so-called "qualified".  In this regard, we have heard members of the Irish public on the national radio.  Although I am not a regular listener as it clashes with D&aacute;il business, I am sure Joe Duffy has attended to it at some point in time.  How do we collectively address the fact that there have been - I cannot say that there are but there have been - persons who were not properly entitled to present themselves as they did within the dental profession?</p> <p>  On the question of registration, I have concerns in regard to the proposed legislation that not all elements of the team of dental practitioners that I have mentioned earlier will be compelled to register.  Can Dr. Croke tell me what he knows or, if there any fears in regard to the areas of dental practitioners, dentists, orthodontists and hygienists?</p><p>It is my understanding that there is some fear that it might be delisted, for want of a better word; I am speaking as a layperson here.  That would be absolutely outrageous.</p><p> I have named some of the key areas and the witnesses could probably add to them.  Are we on the one page that all the areas I have mentioned already and any others should have their respective registration lists and should all come under the council's oversight and control, as I would want it to be?  I would appreciate any assurances or advices the witnesses could offer on how we might work together collectively to ensure the legislation is fit for purpose across the board.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.841" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/983" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015100800002#E00200"><p>I welcome the witnesses.  Based on their statement we have major challenges in ensuring we have integrity in a process to oversee all dental practice in the country.  There are varying views from other organisations and individuals.  The bottom line is that we must consider this from the point of view of the patient or client.  We need to ensure there is proper oversight and regulation in place along with disciplinary procedures, if necessary, when in breach of that.</p> <p>  By any stretch of the imagination, it is quite loose in the areas of dental hygiene, orthodontics, cosmetic surgery and the definition of a technician.  We are consistently inclined to regulate those who are already regulated and not regulate those who should be regulated when introducing legislation regulating entities and it seems to be our difficulty in this case.  We have met other individuals and groups.  We have also seen the difficulty and damage done to people by those who are not fit to practice and should not be practising.</p> <p>  We have a variety of legislation underpinning regulation, including the Medical Practitioners Act and the Nurses and Midwives Act.  I always thought the difficulty we had in regulating dentistry was in defining dental technicians, cosmetic surgery and cosmetic dental interventions.  Those grey areas will be very challenging in the years ahead.  As we have seen in other countries almost anybody can put a plaque on the wall and claim to do cosmetic surgery and cosmetic dentistry.  Much of it is very invasive and potentially damaging to people.</p> <p>  That highlights all the obvious stuff but within that, how can we ensure that the legislation governing enforcement of fitness to practice, medical misadventure, etc. can encompass all those who are practising?  We need to ensure they come into the system and are regulated.  If they are not regulated, they are no longer in the system at all.  The Dental Council of Ireland has almost no enforcement.  It has no ability to inspect.  What can it do to give me confidence that the plaque at the front door means a dentist at the top of the stairs?  That is what people want to know.  The legislation seems unclear in defining that and the Dental Council of Ireland is quite powerless in enforcing that.</p> <p>  Do the witnesses believe the new proposals will give Dental Council of Ireland more powers and - I am trying to avoid the term - more teeth.  The bottom line is more teeth in all its facets to ensure people have confidence.  I have come across cases of people who were given hope that their teeth could be resolved by special therapies, cleaning agents and all the rest of it, and it has worked out tragically.  They then need to head back to dental hospitals in Cork to try to rectify all these issues.</p> <p>  Most people believe when they see a doctor's surgery that there is a good chance there is a doctor behind it.  However, there are question marks when it comes to dentistry and that issue needs to be addressed once and for all.  We have one chance to do it now.  I ask the witnesses to highlight the key facets they have in their presentation and to give confidence to the public that we have integrity in the profession in all its aspects.  I do not doubt the Dental Council of Ireland but it needs to ensure it is enforced.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.842" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1029" speakername="Catherine Byrne" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015100800002#E00500"><p>I welcome the witnesses and acknowledge the broad statement they made earlier.  I have read the executive summary.  Dr. Barney Murphy and I spent some time together in the South Western Area Health Board.  He gave me an outline of what maxillofacial surgery was about.  I had to ask him on many occasions what we were talking about. I welcome him; it is nice to see him again.</p> <p>  As a citizen of this country, when there is a sign over a door that indicates a GP or dental clinic and one goes through the door, one leaves one's health in the hands of the people behind that door.  When I go in I want to see a welcoming place, a clean place.  I want the people behind the desk and those doing the surgery to be professional and to know what they are doing.  That starts from the time one walks into any surgery and how one is treated by the receptionist.</p> <p>  In my experience, in some of the places I have attended over many years that has not been the case.  When I had young children, they were sent to the local health centre for examination of their teeth through the school.  I always found them very welcoming people, if not welcoming places.  Certainly I had no difficulty with the professionalism of the people involved in polishing teeth, etc., but the state of the premises left a lot to be desired.  Thankfully, things are changing in that regard with new primary care centres locally, which have helped.</p> <p>  There is nothing in the summary with which I disagree.  However, I suppose the witnesses are here because they believe the legislation, as proposed, will not cover some of these things.  That is something for the committee to identify and address.</p> <p>  On a daily basis, we hear advertisements on radio and television promoting other forms of dentistry abroad.  People on these advertisements outline their great successes but I, and other public representatives, hear of the damage that can be done to people when they travel abroad not very far from our own shores.  I have a fear about people not being professional, whether in this country or elsewhere.</p> <p>  I do not have much to add.  I am not a dentist, thank God, or a medical professional.  However, I believe that someone going into a clinic should be able to put their confidence in the medical team.  Everything should be above board and professional.  Some people are being seriously damaged, not only through malpractice but through people claiming to be professionals when they are far from professional.  The Government and this committee need to seriously look at how to identify these people and take them out of the system, as Deputy Kelleher said earlier.</p><p>I thank the Dental Council of Ireland for its presentation and for taking time out to come here this morning.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.844" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Eamon Croke" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015100800002#F00200"><p>Before I answer individual questions, there is a common theme which is close to the heart of the Dental Council of Ireland.  The committee members have all talked about the protection of the public, which is absolutely what we are about.<br/><br/>To address Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s points about those entitled to advertise or perform the treatment they offer, in the policy issue statements from the professional regulation unit, which the Deputy has a summary of, there is a break down in thought - on the one hand, it has accepted that regulation, licensing and inspection of practices have to take place and, on the other, it will quite severely limit the number of people registered.  That brings us back to the problem we have at present and back further than that.  We will go back 30 years because people such as dental hygienists - whom the members highlighted - may or may not be on the register now but they would not have been on it then.  The problem will get bigger unless registration is combined with the licensing process for premises and the inspection of premises.  It requires that joined-up thinking.  In our view, there is no other way of doing it.<br/><br/>We are aware of the cases to which the Deputy alluded.  As the Deputy will appreciate, <i>prima facie </i>evidence must be established before a case can be taken against anybody.  Where the Dental Council of Ireland has uncovered evidence, however, it has informed the Garda which has the power to go into places where we believe illegal practices are being carried out.  The Garda brought a successful case against an individual who was practising illegally in the midlands some years ago.  Around last April there was a case of someone practising illegally.  Initially, this person was in charge of the practice.  We believe it is possible to have a non-dentist in charge, provided the practice is regulated and someone can inspect it to ensure that proper procedures are being carried out.  The person to whom I refer suddenly started to practice.  By the time that became obvious, the Garda was informed but the individual was gone.<br/><br/>We share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern and frustration.  For a lay person, the Deputy does himself down to an extent.  He is very well informed and I thank him because he has presented a very good reason for bringing the new legislation forward quickly.  The existing Act is 30 years old, is grossly out of date and does not protect the public.  In our written and oral submissions, and in the submissions to the Department, we have consistently looked for those powers.  We believe we are well positioned.  When an inspector goes into these places, he or she will find problems not only with regard to the regulation of premises but also in respect of the behaviour to which Deputy Catherine Byrne alluded.  It is important that those who carry out inspections possess the skillset to examine all aspects.<br/><br/>On advertising, the registrar has done work with <i>The Golden Pages</i>to try to ensure that it is very obvious that clinical dental technicians, CDTs, are qualified and registered to carry out their work.  One of the difficulties that has arisen is that we do not know how many there are.  I commend the work of the Dental Technicians Association of Ireland, DTAI, which has spent a great deal of its own money in preparation for going onto the voluntary register and in trying to identify both those who are operating in this area and the individuals who are in possession of qualifications in any form.  The association has been surprised by what it has discovered, even though its members are involved in the profession.  The Dental Council of Ireland would be very concerned if legislation gave <i>carte blanche</i>to everybody who had acted illegally to join the voluntary register without any assessment of their ability or skills to qualify for inclusion on it.<br/><br/>This relates to the points raised by Deputies Kelleher and Catherine Byrne that people need to be confident that when they walk into a premises, the person there is ethical, skilled and professional in approach.  In the voluntary understanding with the DTAI, the Dental Council of Ireland has agreed that a step would have to be taken to prove the practitioner had a level of skill and expertise and that an assessment would be carried out if the person did not have the required documentation from a dental hospital, City and Guilds or from F&Aacute;S or AnCO, the training council, which in years past ran courses.  We would look for that.  It is very important that committee members, as public representatives, are mindful that &quot;grandfathering&quot; individuals who have no training will not encourage the necessary confidence that Deputies Kelleher, Catherine Byrne and &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in have sought.<br/><br/>In response to Deputy Kelleher, the Dental Council of Ireland has developed a scope of practice to identify those who should be in the register.  We know the roles people can carry out.  That is very clearly laid out, for example, a dental technician can do the fabrication and the supply of dental appliances but not the fitting, whereas a CDT can do the fitting, provided there is no interference with living tissue.  The scope is relatively easy to work out if we know who are the individuals.  That goes back to a general concern that the Deputies share about identifying who can do this and whether the person is qualified to do it.<br/><br/>Deputy Kelleher made several references to cosmetic procedures.  The Dental Council of Ireland produced a code on non-surgical cosmetic procedures very early on and in the face of some opposition because wherever large interests are involved, as they are in the cosmetic industry, one faces considerable pressures.  We have defined where a practitioner can use certain materials, such as Botox, off-licence because they have a function in health care.  We have distinguished between the cosmetic and non-cosmetic sides.  That also went through the National Adult Literacy Agency, NALA.  We invite the public to look this up.  For example, Deputy Byrne can look up the Dental Council of Ireland website and see in plain language what she can expect from her dental health care professional when she comes for treatment.  We tried to bring in the public.  We did that with our ethics and display of fees documents to let the customer see what to expect.  We encourage the committee to do that.<br/><br/>In respect of to whom the committee and Department should listen, all voices carry some weight but on the basis that we are transparently in the business of protecting the public, a statement the lay members of the council would support - as they did to the Minister whom we met recently - perhaps, with respect, our voice should carry more weight.  We have the experience and we stand up to scrutiny.  We are, and are willing to be, accountable for the actions we take.  I hope our submissions to the Department and to the committee today will be given some extra weight in that regard.  We will only sort out where the grey areas are when we marry registration with inspection and licensing.  That is the only way around it.<br/><br/>I agree with Deputy Catherine Byrne.  Whenever I put trust in somebody else, I want to know that person has a standard and I want to be treated fairly and with respect.</p><p>The various codes of practice and ethics the Irish Dental Council has produced is very important to that.</p><p> The Irish Dental Council is a founder member of the International Society of Dental Regulators.  Our registrar is chairman of the society, which suggests we are held in high standing abroad.  It is very important to us that we show leadership in order that the public can have confidence in our remit under the current Dentists Act but also that they will understand we are trying to make matters better, and we hope to achieve that.  We have shown leadership also in terms of the profession.  It is to the credit of those in the profession that they have come with us without kicking and screaming because the proposals we have made in our codes are seen to be proportionate and effective, and they are welcome.  The display of fees, which is an early item we brought in, has been very well received not only by the public but also by the Office of Fair Trading in the United Kingdom, which has held it up as an example of how professionals should interact with the public.  I agree with the Deputy that it is about standards as well as skills.  It is about being treated as a human being.</p><p> Dental tourism is a fact of life.  Even with the National Health Service, which has an accessible, relatively cheap form of dentistry, dental tourism is still rife in the UK.  The previous Irish Dental Council produced a document called Choosing a Dentist at Home or Abroad which sets out for the public what they should look out for, not just when going abroad for treatment but also in terms of dentists and all dental health care professionals registered here in terms of standards and that they will work with them to ensure they get the service they want and that they are treated as they would want to be treated.  Those are the areas we will continue to develop with, I hope, the support of legislation, and I believe the skillset lies with the dental council.  The goodwill of the dental council is very much to continue the work we are doing, but to do it better.  We need a new dental Act to do that, and we need it quickly.</p></speech>

In terms of the perspective of members of the public, they want to have confidence in the profession but also value for money.  They want reasonably priced dental services.  When we regulate to the point where we are trying to protect the integrity of the profession, often it comes at a cost, but equally when we start to protect the profession or give it an advantage over anybody else who might want to compete, simply because they cannot register because they do not qualify means only one thing to many people, namely, dearer dentistry costs.  Dental services in Ireland are quite expensive when compared with most OECD countries, particularly in the area of orthodontics.  When we do regulate, if we cut out people currently providing services it will be argued that costs could become dearer for people.  Does Dr. Croke see a potential loss of capacity in the system to deliver in the area of orthodontics if we regulate according to the way the council is proposing?  Will there be a loss of capacity?  If that is the case, the result will be increased prices.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.847" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Eamon Croke" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015100800002#G00300"><p>The provision of services is not a matter for the dental council.  I accept that there is a cost to regulation but everybody in this room would accept that living in Ireland is expensive.  That is an important starting point when we talk about costs.</p> <p>  In terms of costs of regulation, regulation is demanded by the public.  The daily experience of the dental council is that the public demand we have highly skilled individuals to carry out the work and in whom members of the public can put their trust.</p> <p>  I do not believe that competitiveness will be served at all by bringing in unskilled people to carry out a job.  All that happens in that case is that costs increase because indemnity costs will increase, and Ireland has very high indemnity costs.  It goes back to issues such as the foundation training.  It is a question of getting the skills level increased from the outset.</p> <p>  In terms of illegal practice on the denturist side, it is important to note that the dental council has put in place a clinical dental technicians register.  The scope of practice and entry to it is well set out and it is reasonable.  It protects members of the public when they are exposed and attends people who provide the service to them.</p> <p>  It is important for the committee to understand also that there is a training course in the Dublin Dental University Hospital.  One can achieve the training levels one wants if one were intent on going from illegal practice to legal practice.  That is the history there, and we have been encouraged by those who have taken the decision to go from illegal to legal practice, but there is a moral dilemma in grandfathering somebody who ignores the fact they are acting illegally and then telling them they can get on with it now.  With regard to all the Deputy's concerns, that will serve the public very poorly if that were to happen in the future.  There is a means by which to go legal, and I would encourage those in illegal practice to do it.</p></speech>

The council is working very closely with dental technicians to establish a voluntary register.  How well progressed is the council with that, and does Dr. Croke have confidence that it will be established in the short term?  As I said, that is essential to get to the point of statutory registration in the event that the legislation will reflect the need.</p> <p>  My reading of what the drafters are thinking is in terms of independent practices as against those who are ancillary to them, that is, dentists, orthodontists - I presume - and clinical dental clinicians who are stand-alone in their respective roles and functions.  The situation regarding dental nurses, hygienists and dental technicians is that these are not of themselves independent practitioners but are a part of a team working under any of the aforementioned.  I do not know why that thinking has entered into this in regard to dentistry in the widest sense.  Registration is an essential part of a range of other areas across the health sector and no such is distinction being made.  Why does Dr. Croke believe such a distinction is being made between the referencing I have made to independent practices as against support staff?  I am very much of the view, and I welcome the clarity of Dr. Croke's contribution, that it is an objective shared by this committee and the dental council.</p><p>As a Deputy, I have a degree of privilege which the delegates do not enjoy.  I do not propose to name anybody, but there have been disturbing high profile cases in this area, including one which involved very objectionable behaviour on the part of a practitioner.  This is a serious matter that I have no doubt gravely worries, annoys and vexes practitioners holding to the highest standards.  How does the Dental Council of Ireland of Ireland react when such cases present, given that, as mentioned by Deputy Billy Kelleher, as things stand, it does not have the power to properly engage to uphold the highest standards across the profession?  I would welcome some commentary in that regard, as we cannot ignore this issue.  This is the first opportunity we have had to speak about it in this way.  I do not want to leave this room regretting that I did not ask the relevant questions.  I have put the question in the most appropriate way that will, I hope, allow for comfort in terms of our exchange.</p><p> On the issues of registration and regulation, particularly voluntary regulation of dental technicians, the general experience across the board is that standards improve as a consequence of regulation.  This is something that will unquestionably be shown in the case of dental technicians.  Those who are qualified and committed to the future of their chosen career path surely should not hold back in the interests of some who are not prepared or willing to move forward.  I would like to know why we do not as yet have voluntary registration.  Are there people who are applying a brake out of selfish interests as against the collective importance of enhancing their particular role?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.852" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Eamon Croke" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015100800002#H00200"><p>On the voluntary register, the point had been reached where we had agreed to an assessment.  The Dental Technicians Association of Ireland had identified hundreds of dental technicians who were willing to be involved in the scheme.  The Dental Council of Ireland had identified, by way of an assessment carried out by the Auxiliary Dental Workers Committee, chaired by Professor Nunn, that approximately one in eight dental technicians had no proof or evidence of their educational qualifications or skills.  We also worked with the Dental Technicians Association of Ireland on the issue.  The summary policy was then issued by the Department and everything stopped.  In fairness to the Department, that happened by accident rather than by design.  In the past two weeks everybody stood back weeks waiting to see what would happen next.  An early green light from the Department to progress the development of the register and encourage those without skills who want to become involved to register would be welcome.  There are multiple reasons for putting the register in place, including the identification of technicians, raising standards and preparation for the future.  It is important that people be given time to prepare to come on board to work to one set of codes in terms of standards.  That would be a fair way of doing things.  People expect inspections to be introduced.  It is the one thing everybody across the profession has done, but, again, time is required to do it.  </p> <p>  Another reason the Dental Council of Ireland was keen to do this was we knew that when mandatory registration was introduced, bringing all dental nurses and dental technicians together would involve a large body of work.  Having a large number on board in the context of voluntary registration would be helpful.  Also, they have representation at the Auxiliary Dental Workers Committee such that their voices are heard in the Dental Council of Ireland.  That is hugely important.  Unfortunately, the registration process has halted, despite the fact that we were close to agreeing a final set-up.  However, as I said, that was not by design and it is hoped the situation can be adjusted quickly. </p> <p>  On the reason independent-only practice is to be taken on board in registration, it is an issue of perceived risk.  In other words, the risk is perceived to be relatively low for other members of the dental team.  The evidence suggests that in dentistry - working in the mouth - if a person is unskilled or not obliged to attain standards, the risk of injury or life-threatening or life-altering diseases is very real.  Nobody here would agree that that risk was low or non-existent.  The capacity for it increases dramatically when we get into the grey area of who is doing what because, as I mentioned to Deputy Billy Kelleher, the scope of practice is out the window, the attitude being that because a person is not registered, he or she can do the work and nobody will know.  With registration comes the enforcability of standards.  As stated, all members of the dental team and registered dental premises should be subject to the same sanctions and fitness to practise standards.  That is important.</p> <p>  We are aware of the high profile cases.  We feel inept, angry, frustrated and annoyed with the Department about the delay in the introduction of the dental Bill which will allow us to get on with the business we want to carry out.  In cases in which evidence is available we provide it for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It would be a mistake to sit around and do nothing.  That would be the worst possible position for a dental council to find itself in.  We regularly notify the Garda about our concerns.  However, doing something about an issue is very difficult because the Garda needs to have a reason to take action.  It comes back, therefore, to the ability to go into a practice and knowing what one is looking for.  A garda in walking through the door of a dental practice, bar catching an individual red-handed doing what he or she should not be doing, would not because of patient confidentiality and data protection issues be able to even look up a record.  New laws are required to address these issues.  In terms of how we feel, we are distressed, annoyed and angry and get it in the neck from the profession.  We can also get it in the neck from members of the public who contact us to tell us what has happened to them and the distress it has caused.  Our inability to help is hugely frustrating.  It lets down what the Dental Council of Ireland is good at.  We are good at what we do; we just need the powers required to support us in what we want to do.  I appreciate the Deputy's comments in terms of the need for clarity.  I hope the position is clear.  To us, it is very clear.  We have lived with this day in and day out.  In terms of our functions, we know when something is not good enough and we also know what we should be doing.  In all honesty, we would like to be able to do tomorrow what we know we need to do.</p></speech>

The Bill has been sent to us for pre-legislative scrutiny and we will now meet the representative of the Department and Children and Youth Affairs.  I welcome Ms Noreen Leahy, principal officer in the adoption policy unit, and Ms Anne Marie Kilkenny, assistant principal officer.</p><p>This is the opening session of the committee's work on the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill.  It is an opportunity for us to hear from and invite those interested in the issue and for them to have their say on this important, sensitive and long overdue legislation.  We all welcome the publication of the heads of the Bill.  Over the next number of weeks the committee will hold further hearings to consider the draft legislation and will meet a variety of stakeholders with different views.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly, will come before the committee in the third session, on 22 October, and will respond in detail on the issues that have been raised during our hearings and discussion.  I hope our scrutiny will be of use and benefit to the Department and also to those interested in this important and complex legislation.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given, and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not comment, criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.859" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Noreen Leahy" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015100800002#L00300"><p>I thank the joint committee and its Chairman, Deputy Buttimer, for providing the Department of Children and Youth Affairs with the opportunity to brief the committee on the heads of the adoption (information and tracing) Bill 2015.  The Minister's overall policy objective for this legislation has been to provide access to as much information as possible to adopted persons within constitutional parameters.  A particular challenge was faced in the case of adoptions in the past in reconciling an adopted person's request for information about his or her identity with the constitutional right to privacy of his or her birth parent.</p><p> I will now turn to the main features of the Bill.  The heads of the Bill provide for the establishment of the adoption information register on a statutory basis.  The register will be a gateway for those seeking adoption information and tracing services.  It will allow an individual to indicate his or her preference regarding contact or the sharing of information or both.  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, will be responsible for the operation of the register and the provision of information and tracing services.  Tusla will facilitate and support contact between parties, if desired.  Support and guidance will be offered to all persons who request contact or the sharing of information or both.  The Adoption Authority of Ireland will be responsible for collecting, restoring, preserving and safekeeping adoption records for all domestic and intercountry adoptions, including information relating to informal adoptions and incorrect birth registrations.  The heads of the Bill set out the information that must be retained by the Adoption Authority of Ireland for future adoptions and, in so far as it is available, for past domestic and intercountry adoptions, informal adoptions and incorrect birth registrations.</p><p> On the information to be provided for future adoptions, for all adoptions effected after the commencement of this Bill, provision is made for Tusla to provide a copy of a birth certificate, an adoption order and other information to an adopted person following an application by the adopted person.  Birth parents will be notified of the proposed release of this information to applicants at least 12 weeks prior to the release of such information.  There is a presumption in favour of the disclosure of information unless there are compelling reasons, such as may endanger the life of a person, for the non-disclosure of adoption information.  Tusla will consider same and decide if the information is to be disclosed.  The birth parents and adoptive parents will be advised of these arrangements by Tusla and the Adoption Authority of Ireland, as appropriate, during the assessment and the adoption process.</p><p> Moving on to information to be provided for past adoptions, the right to privacy has been recognised by the courts as one of the unspecified personal rights protected by Article 40.3 of the Constitution of Ireland.  A particular challenge was faced in reconciling an adopted person's request for information about his or her identity with the right to privacy of his or her birth parents.  One key provision in the Bill is to give an adopted person aged 18 or over, who was adopted prior to its commencement, a statutory entitlement to the information required to apply for his or her birth certificate.  The adopted person will be asked to make a statutory declaration agreeing not to contact the birth parent.  The inclusion of provisions regarding a statutory declaration were developed to provide for a balancing of the rights of adopted persons to information about their identity and the birth parents' right to privacy.  There, of course, will be no requirement for an adopted person to sign a statutory declaration where birth parents have indicated a preference for contact or have consented to the release of the information or where it has been established the birth parents are deceased.  At all stages of the process, both the birth parent and the adopted person will be offered appropriate support and guidance by a social worker.</p><p> The heads of the Bill also provide that information that relates solely to an adopted person, such as information about time spent in a nursery or early personal medical history, will be provided to the adopted person as soon as possible.  In addition, information that focuses on the adopted person but which may incidentally include non-identifying information about his or her birth parents, such as personal history or family background, also can be provided.  In releasing such information, Tusla will ensure the birth parents' identity or contact details or both are not disclosed.  The heads of the Bill provide that additional identifying information will be disclosed to an adopted person with the consent of the birth parent concerned.  This includes specific information requested by the adopted person and other information that could identify birth parents.  The heads also provide for circumstances in which this information can be provided without consent such as where, following reasonable steps having taken by Tusla, the person cannot be located or where the person to whom the information relates is deceased.  The heads of Bill also provides for a court procedure to dispense with consent where the person concerned cannot give consent because of incapacity to so do.  In addition, provision will be made for an adopted person or a birth parent who is not satisfied with the outcome of the process to appeal to the court.</p><p> As for the awareness campaign, there will be a period of one year after commencement before an adopted person will have a statutory entitlement to the information required to apply for his or her birth certificate.  However, it should be noted that during this time, this information and any other information which might identify a birth parent will be provided to an adopted person where the birth parent consents or where the birth parent is deceased.  During this initial period, there will be an extensive high-level information campaign to publicise the provisions of the legislation and to encourage adopted persons and birth parents to enter their details on the adoption information register.  They also will be advised to engage with Tusla's information and tracing services if they are considering sharing information or having contact or both with a person from whom they were separated as a result of an adoption.  The campaign also will outline that an adopted person aged 18 years or more will be entitled to receive the information required to apply for his or her birth certificate subject to the adopted person signing a statutory declaration.  Birth parents also will be made aware they may indicate a preference of no contact at present on the adoption information register where they do not wish to have contact with the adopted person present.</p><p> The heads of the Bill provide that Tusla will provide a person whose name is entered on the register of intercountry adoptions with all information held on record where Tusla has been given approval by the authority to disclose the information to the applicant.  Where the adopted person seeks additional information, the authority may seek this from the central authority of the country of origin.  Birth parents of children who are subject to intercountry adoptions also may avail of information and tracing services from Tusla.  Provision is made in the heads of the Bill for persons who were the subject of informal adoptions and incorrect registrations to apply to have their details entered on the adoption information register to avail of information and tracing services.  Informal adoptions include persons in a long-term family care arrangement where a child was in the custody of a person other than his or her parent or guardian and where no adoption order was effected.  Incorrect registrations include persons who were the subject of an incorrect registration of a birth under the Civil Registration Acts for the purpose of registering as a parent a person who was not a parent of that child.  The heads of the Bill also provide that birth parents of people who were subject to such arrangements may apply for information in the same way.  The heads of the Bill provide that persons who are subject to these arrangements can be provided with information, where available, in a similar manner to the provision of information to adopted persons whose adoption was effected prior to commencement.  However, it should be noted that many of these arrangements operated in conditions of great secrecy and there rarely were any contemporary records of these events.  In such cases, there may be very little information available or very limited information, if at all.  The heads of the Bill also provide for the sharing of information about a child who was adopted between birth parents and adoptive parents, where both parties agree.  Once again, I thank members for the opportunity to brief the joint committee today.  I hope the information and briefing material provided has been of assistance to the joint committee and I am happy to address any questions members may have.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for all the work to get the legislation to this stage.  It is difficult when we are on the eve of whenever the election will be.  I had really hoped this measure could have gone through but at least the work members will do in these hearings should mean it will get an early start in the lifetime of the next Government.  I have a few issues on which I seek to ascertain the underlying thinking.  Obviously, this is an issue on which I have worked to a considerable extent, given that I worked with Senator Power on a Bill on this issue that has gone through all Stages in the Seanad.  I believe we have gone further on the issue of the right to identity and while I understand the Department's concerns regarding the Constitution, I do not agree.  I am sure this is a matter the joint committee will explore in its hearings but I do not agree with the consensus on the Constitution regarding the right to privacy.</p><p>It has not been fully tested in the courts.  We, as legislators, must ensure we put into legislation what is right.</p><p> One issue I have is what will constitute a "compelling reason".  I have found it difficult to understand what could be a compelling reason.  Do the witnesses have an example of a compelling reason?  I feel very strongly about it.  I would start from the position that everybody has a right to identity.  We have stigmatised adoption beyond belief, which is not the case in other jurisdictions such as the UK.  We need to unpack the issue of the right to identity.  While we are examining the historic situation, a child being adopted today still does not have the right to discover his or her identity when he or she turns 18.  It is very wrong and shows how far we still have to go.</p><p> Wearing my hobby hat of researching family history, I can find most birth records if somebody has a name that is not very common or usual.  If I have money, I can go to the General Register Office and get as many birth certificates as I want and turn up on as many doorsteps as I wish.  Nobody wants adopted people to be forced to turn up on doorsteps and ask people if there is a chance they might be their parents, based only on birth dates.  We want information and tracing in order to allow people to make contact.  Nobody I have talked to who has the hunger for their identity wants to turn up on somebody's doorstep and embarrass them.  They are looking to fill the empty gap they have, to be able to know who they are and where they came from.  It is an issue we still have to explore.</p><p> I also want to know about the records that are held, the processes there will be, and how many records have been handed over so far.  Do we know how many records have been handed over?  When former Senator Martin McAleese was writing the report on the Magdalen laundries, the different charities gave him records, but he handed them back.  How is the State collecting those records, especially records from outside the State?  Many children went to the US.  One of my greatest privileges during this term as a Senator was to meet Philomena Lee, whose child was sent to America for a "better life".  This brings me to the issue of consent.  We have over-interpreted what is meant by consent.  Anybody who has read Philomena Lee's book or any of the forms will know that what mothers signed to was not consent.  It was not consent when they gave up those children.  While we have the idea that we are basing everything on the right to privacy, they never agreed to it.  We must be very careful how we interpret consent.</p><p> I have a further issue, which I will explore in the Bill and which I tried to bring up under the Civil Registration Bill.  It relates to the birth certificates we produce now.  A parent of an adopted child can get a clean birth certificate which in no way identifies that the child is adopted.  While it is a side issue to the Bill, it is very relevant to the issue and I will raise it.  On the statutory declarations, Claire McGettrick from the Adoption Rights Alliance said, "&lsquo;It is important to separate the issues of information and tracing; adopted people are seeking a statutory right to information as opposed to a statutory right to a relationship with their natural mothers".  This statutory right to information and tracing is what we are all seeking and what we want to experience in the Bill.</p><p> I commend the Department officials on coming forward on the Bill and trying to push it as far as they can.  I hope, in the hearings, we will try to push it further.  I have met so many people who are seeking their identities, including children who were given up for adoption and parents - mainly mothers but some fathers - who gave, or were forced to give up, their children for adoption, or whose children were given up for adoption unbeknown to them.  The right to identity is very clearly with the young person and child and I will seek to ensure that we balance the rights.  However, in balancing rights, we need to ensure we do not overinflate the right to privacy.  While I am very respectful of people's privacy, a right to identity is central to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  This is what we will be working towards in the hearings.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.866" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1065" speakername="Robert Troy" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015100800002#N00200"><p>I thank the Department officials for coming here and giving an overview of this important Bill.  All parties have been seeking it during recent years, and it is welcome that it has reached this stage and that we have an opportunity to tease out some of the issues.  The kernel of the issue is that for future adoptions we are creating a template and there will be no issue regarding right to identity.  Once we set it down, anybody who enters the adoption process will know exactly what they are getting into.  The source of the uncertainty and the reason it has taken so long to come to this stage is the issue of retrospective adoptions and the need to bring forward a proposal that will not fly in the face of the Constitution.  One of a person's fundamental rights is the right to his or her identity, and nobody can argue with it.</p> <p>  Do the signed declarations apply to an adopted person?  Do the declarations state that, following the 12 month period, an adopted person will not contact his or her biological parent if the biological parent has explicitly said he or she will not make contact?  Where the parent and child want to meet and have contact, I presume there will be no objection or issue.  It is only trying to bring forward a proposal where there is an expressed wish by one party that he or she does not wish to be contacted by the other party.  Could the officials clarify this?  I have some concerns about the 12 month lead in.  For many people, this is a time sensitive issue, given that their cases may date back to the 1930s and even earlier.  Time is of the essence in terms of seeking their identities and having an opportunity for contact, if both parties wish it.  Did the officials consider a shorter lead-in time period, perhaps six months, with a more intensive and extensive media campaign?</p> <p>  Regarding the implementation of the legislation, Tusla's capacity to manage it will be crucial.  It will put considerable additional pressure on Tusla.  People who have a much greater knowledge of the area than I have told me that, even with the restricted information and tracing service available in Tusla, some people are waiting up to three years to have their cases heard.  If this is the case, while it is all very well bringing in the legislation, if we do not have the means to put it into effect, we will have problems.</p></speech>

Has the information campaign been planned already and what form will it take?  One of the major contacts in healthcare is the GP service.  Is there a format set out for how the information will be disseminated?  I was surprised, a number of years ago, to learn that maternity hospitals do not seek identification from their patients.  A person can check into a maternity hospital under an assumed name.</p><p>I have heard of instances when that has occurred.  My understanding is that, to date, maternity hospitals still do not have a strict and common code across all 19 maternity units nationally regarding proof of identity being furnished.  Going back over the years, it was an issue that some adoptions took place via informal arrangements.  I wonder if that issue has been examined.  I heard that as recently as the last six months that someone was in a hospital where a patient had two or three medical cards under different names.  Ensuring that proper identification is furnished in maternity units is also going to be an issue when we have people coming in from abroad.  Has that issue ever been looked at?  It was an issue I remember having to deal with quite a number of years ago and things do not seem to have changed in any way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.869" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1200" speakername="Averil Power" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015100800002#O00200"><p>Like Senator van Turnhout, I welcome the fact that we are at the point where heads of a Bill are before us.  It is an issue I have been working on for some time both as a Member of the Oireachtas and as an adopted person myself.  It is something that has been promised for a long time and finally we are at the start of a legislative process at least.  It is, of course, positive.  I also welcome the fact that the Department has indicated that there will be a somewhat proactive tracing service and advertising campaigns to back up the legislation and I would like more detail on those matters.  I also welcome the fact that heads of the Bill before us go further and are more positive than the Government had been indicating even up to quite recently.  When the Minister, Deputy Reilly, was in the Seanad to discuss the Bill Senator van Turnhout and I put forward earlier this year, the position he outlined from a Government perspective was much more conservative.  People who were adopted in the past would not have a right to information, whereas those adopted in the future would.  It would not address the 50,000 to 60,000 of us adopted in the past.  There would be no point to that really because there are very few domestic adoptions in Ireland now.  It really is about redress for adopted people who were separated from their parents and for women who were forced to separate from their children during a really dark part of our past.  We have an opportunity now to get it right for all of those people and to do the humane and generous thing.  We must be generous and ambitious in doing this because it means so much to people.  We must go as far as possible.</p> <p>  In that context, I have concerns along the lines of those raised by Senator van Turnhout with regard to what is meant by the term "compelling reasons".  I am nervous about that in particular because I do not accept that there are any reasons an adopted person should be denied his or her birth certificate.  I accept that a natural parent's current contact details should only be released with that person's consent, but we must separate the two issues of identity and contact.  While it is fair enough not to give out someone's current contact details, I do not accept that there are any situations in which the adopted person should be refused access to the basic information in his or her birth certificate.  In trying to balance the two, one right is rendering the other at nil.  That is not acceptable.  When the Government announced the Bill earlier in the summer, it was stated that the circumstances would be limited, but naturally there are concerns.  I have spoken to some legal people and I understand the committee will hear from Dr. Conor O'Mahony and Dr. Fergus Ryan about the matter.  There are concerns among the legal community that this could open the door to legal challenges in that we will really only know what constitutes a compelling reason following a court case.  That is not acceptable.  As such, I will be arguing that the clause should be removed.  I hope that in coming before the committee the officials and the Minister have an open mind in this area in terms of listening.  Obviously, they have one set of advice on which they are acting and of course the Attorney General has a role to play.  However, I hope the officials will keep an open mind in listening to alternative views on prospective legal balances being put forward by Dr. O'Mahony, Dr. Ryan and others.</p> <p>  The statutory declaration has been criticised by groups representing both natural parents and adopted people.  The First Mothers group, which is due to come before the committee, has criticised this just as strongly as those representing adopted persons.  It seems to reflect a negative assumption that adoptees are irrational and insensitive and that we want to enforce some kind of pain or inconvenience on our natural parents, which could not be further from the truth.  When I was looking for my mother and preparing for us to meet, I was more conscious of her needs and how it would affect her family and my birth siblings who did not know about me yet and how we would figure that out.  I was really concerned about the memories it would bring back for her of a difficult time in her life.  I know from talking to other adopted people that they feel the same.  It seems to me to be unnecessary and offensive.  When one approaches this as a legal and legislative issue, one needs to be conscious that for many it is a very sensitive human issue.  That is why people are so upset by the statutory declaration.  There is no doubt that there will be situations where an adopted person will wish to have contact while the natural parent will not.  There will also be situations where a natural parent is reaching out and the adoptee is not interested.  It is my strong personal view that in the vast majority of those cases people may be disappointed but they will accept the situation.  They might hope it will change at some point, which often happens.  Many natural mothers decide after a spouse or other person they have not told has passed away that they want to have contact at that later point.  Those options should always be open.</p> <p>  We need to start with the majority of cases and legislate for those.  In the majority of cases, there will not be a problem and we can let our other law look after the rest.  In relation to any form of human behaviour, whether it is adopted people or others, the potential arises for harassment or situations where people do not respect boundaries.  However, we have existing laws to deal with that and, as such, I do not know why special provisions are needed in this case.  As Senator van Turnhout already pointed out, the Bill will make unwanted contact less likely.  The unfortunate thing currently is that it is very difficult to find information oneself, but it is possible.  As a result of the fact that there is no intermediary, the only way people can know if contacted is welcome is to reach out and ask.  That is not ideal.  Given that the Bill will make that less likely, let us assume that for most this will be a positive experience, reduce the likelihood of unwanted contacted and that existing legislation can deal with any difficulties which arise.</p> <p>  Resources will be crucial.  It is extremely important to ensure that the necessary counselling and support services are there for people and that there is no backlog.  Deputy Robert Troy referred to the existing backlog in respect of social worker appointments.  We need to ensure that people who go through this process are not delayed because of a lack of resources but also that they have the supports they need.  It is up to the person whether to engage in counselling or other services, but the offer should be there.  It is very important that the contact letter that goes from Tusla to the adopted person or the parent is sensitively worded and is not - and I mean this in the nicest possible way - worded in Civil Service speak or legalese.  It should not be technical as Government documents often are having been written by lawyers to cover all the technicalities.  This is a personal issue and the letter asking people if they wish to have contact must be written in a sensitive, positive and supportive way and must make clear that no contact is not no contact for ever but rather just for the present.  It will be very important to get all that right.</p> <p>  I have a question on illegal birth registrations.  The witnesses stated that an effort will be made to bring records together to help establish what happened with illegal adoptions.  The Department said in the opening statement that those who were illegally adopted can apply for information.  What about those who do not know they are illegally adopted?  This is a huge issue because people's birth records were falsified.  Will the Department examine the records in a proactive manner?  If ledgers or registers - such as, for example, that belonging to Nurse Dooley which was uncovered some years ago - recording details of babies, their birth parents and, even though there were no real adoptions, their so-called adoptive parents are found, will the Department reach out, contact the people involved and make them aware of the situation in a sensitive way in order to help them to re-establish their links with their past?</p><p>Unfortunately, we do not know how many countless people there are across Ireland who do not even realise that they are adopted.  I thank the Chairman and appreciate that he has given me a bit of time.</p></speech>

I will read out head 11, as I want to ask a question on it.  It states, "The agency shall offer support and guidance to a person whose name is entered on the register."  What does that mean?  Can Ms Leahy give us an example of what that support and guidance will be?</p> <p>  Under head 12 it states, "Fees will be chargeable for services provided under the legislation."  How much will those fees be and how will they be calculated?  Why should we be charging fees for people who have gone through enough in their lives and who should not be charged for seeking or obtaining proper information?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.872" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Noreen Leahy" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015100800002#P00300"><p>I am delighted that there is such interest in the Bill.  Starting off with the constitutional right to privacy, our legal advice is that the birth mother's right to privacy stems from Article 40.3 of the Constitution, which states:</p><blockquote>1<sup>o</sup>The State guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen.<br /><br />2<sup>o  </sup>The State shall, in particular, by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name, and property rights of every citizen.</blockquote> <p>As I said earlier, this issue posed a particular challenge for us.  We sought to identify a way of reconciling an adopted person's request for information about his or her identity with the right to privacy of the birth parents.  We recognise that the birth certificate is an important piece of identifying information that is shared by the adopted person and his or her birth parents.  It can be distinguished from other identifying information which can be more readily characterised as belonging to one or the other.<br/><br/>However, for the Bill to be legally sound it must include safeguards to protect the constitutional right to privacy.  We consider that the safeguards proposed in the Bill, namely, the awareness campaign, the statutory declaration, the offer of support and guidance, and the possibility of an appeal to court, provide sufficient protection of the birth parents' constitutional right to privacy, and balance the right to identity information and to ensure that the birth parent has a right to be left alone.  As Senator van Turnhout mentioned, we accept that we are providing a right to information, not a right to contact.  That is very clear.<br/><br/>It is known that, in practice, adopted people do in fact respect the birth parents' right, but for the Bill to be legally sound we need to have measures in place.  We need to have important safeguards in place.  It is our view that the safeguards proposed in the Bill provide sufficient protection for the birth parents' constitutional right to privacy.<br/><br/>The Department did consider the Senator's Bill which was of great assistance in developing proposals.  Our advice is that it was not legally sound and for that reason additional measures were put in place.  Certainly, however, the work that was done was very valuable to us.  I think we all share the same objective in ensuring that adopted people have access to as much information as possible about their identity and to get that information in a timely fashion.<br/><br/>We feel that the current proposal provides a practical, workable and fair balance between the adopted person's right to information about his or her identity and the birth parents' right to be left alone and to protect their privacy.<br/><br/>Compelling reasons were mentioned.  As members of the committee know, the Bill operates on the basis of a presumption in favour of disclosing all available information required to apply for a birth certificate to people who were adopted before the Bill was commenced.  As part of the safeguards, if a birth parent provides a compelling reason not to disclose this information, Tusla's information tracing services can refuse to release it.  A working definition of &quot;compelling reason&quot; is that such as may endanger a person's life.  <br/><br/>The Department fully recognises that this aspect of the proposed legislation requires further consideration.  I am not surprised that it has been raised at the committee today.  This is an area where we feel that deliberations and the views of the joint committee during the pre-legislative scrutiny can make a valuable input.  The committee's views in this regard will really be welcomed and will be given close consideration.<br/><br/>Some 42,000 records on adoptions are held by the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  Every legal adoption has a file record in the authority.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has given the US records for US adoptions to the National Archives which now holds them.  Tusla has the vast majority of records which are held in its care.  A small number of adoption agencies still hold records.  We are working on moving all those records.  While the heads of the Bill provide that the Adoption Authority of Ireland will have ultimate control for managing and safeguarding the records in the long term, it is set out step by step how it would do so, and it will be a very organised and managed process.<br/><br/>The Department has established a joint adoption records working group with Tusla, the Adoption Authority of Ireland and ourselves.  Therefore, work is commencing to bring adoption records together and to ensure that they are secured.  The Department recognises how important these records are to individuals, but also for historical purposes.  They are very significant records, so that work has commenced in advance of the legislation. <br/><br/>The Department will continue to consider resource implications.</p></speech>

The reason for the one-year period is to ensure that everybody is made aware of the Bill's provisions.  During that time an adopted person can still apply for and get his or her birth certificate, and it can be provided once there is consent or the birth parent is deceased.  The awareness campaign is part of a package to secure the rights of all involved.</p> <p>  Senator Burke mentioned the registration of maternity hospitals, but that is not a matter for our Department and I would not be able to comment on that.</p></speech>

The adoption information register is a gateway to Tusla information and tracing services.  Everybody affected by adoption who wants to share information and have contact with somebody separated from him or her by adoption needs to apply to have the details entered on the register.  The Bill provides that Tusla will offer support and guidance to anyone whose details are entered on the register.  That is also in head 11.  The Bill also provides that Tusla will develop guidelines to be approved by the Minister on support and guidance that can be offered.  The aim is that anyone who enters the details on the adoption information register can be offered support and guidance when and as they need it.  Where it is considered appropriate and helpful, a social worker may refer a person to the HSE national counselling services.</p> <p>  There was another question regarding fees but that is a standard provision in the Bill.  We spoke to Senator Burke during the break with respect to incorrect registrations and informal adoptions.  The Bill provides that people were the subject of informal adoptions or a long-term family care arrangement where a child is in the custody of a person other than his or her parent or guardian, where no adoption order was effected.  Wrongful registration relates to the incorrect registration of a birth under the Civil Registration Acts for the purpose of registering as a parent a person who is not a parent of that child.  The people affected may apply to have the detail entered on the adoption information register to avail of information and tracing services.  It will also provide the birth parents or people subject to these arrangements with the facility to apply to Tusla's information in the same way.</p> <p>  People who are the subject of these arrangements can be provided with information, where available, in a similar manner to the provision of information to adopted people whose adoption was effected prior to commencement.  However, as I stated earlier, many of these arrangements operated in conditions of great secrecy and there were rarely any contemporary written records of these events.  In such cases, there may be very limited information, if any.  Members may appreciate that information such as a birth being incorrectly registered only arises when a person seeks information.  The information, unfortunately, is very limited but we are aware of some cases and we have been looking at some of them to see if anything could be done.</p> <p>  We are well aware that adopted people and people in general respect each other's right to privacy.  On the rare occasions when this is breached, it is often out of frustration about not having accessing to information.  We note that in practice, starting a search often begins a process of breaking down the fears and worries often associated with what was, for most, a deeply painful experience in the past.  The Bill aims to make it easier to get access to information and offer support, when needed, to address fears and hopefully make those first steps towards contact.  Nonetheless, to ensure the Bill is legally sound, it must include safeguards to protect privacy.  The publicity campaign that will accompany the establishment of the adoption information register will help everyone affected by adoption to understand the new legal framework and give them the opportunity to state their preferences in making contact.  Encouraging people to join the register will also help make it easier to share information.  If a birth parent has expressed a preference for contact, information can be released straight away.  Otherwise, the information required to apply for a birth certificate is released to the adopted person on signing the statutory declaration agreeing not to contact the birth parent.  It is not that this is forever; they are agreeing also to seek the assistance of Tusla's information and tracing services should there be a wish to make contact in the future.  This is to ensure the process is managed.  The birth parent and the adopted person will be offered appropriate support and guidance by a social worker.</p> <p>  The Department believes these elements provide sufficient privacy safeguards.  It is our view that the proposal reconciles in a practical way adopted people's right to information with the right to be left alone for birth parents.</p></speech>

The witness said the birth certificate will be given out but other information will only be released with the consent of the natural parent.  Is it only the birth certificate or the birth certificate and some other information that can be given without consent?  For example, if the natural parent cannot be contacted, what information will the adoptive person receive?  Will it be only the birth certificate or will it be other information on their early care records and their time in a mother and baby home?  Will an adopted person have a right to know that they have siblings?  Will they be told that when they are given their birth certificate or will they only be told if the natural parent consents to them having that information?  Every person is entitled to know that they have siblings so perhaps the witness will clarify that.</p><p>With regard to the drafting of the Bill, there is speculation as to when the current D&aacute;il will finish.  While I do not care when the election is held from a personal point of view, as a politician I care a great deal about this legislation.  It would be an awful shame if it was not completed.  It is important that a Bill is drafted as soon as possible.  I am not sure if we can get it through the Oireachtas but if we are still here until next February or March, we could.  The witnesses have the heads of the Bill.  Is the Bill being drafted now, or does that not happen until the committee's report is finished?  I hope the drafting of the Bill could be worked on now and some sections might be changed on foot of feedback from the committee.  To commence the drafting <i>ab initio</i>after getting the feedback would delay the process.  What is the current position on that?  Obviously, the legislation is quite complicated so how long will it take to draft it?</p></speech>

I am sorry to harp on about this.  I am reading the information, but perhaps I am reading it wrongly.  No decision has been made about fees and what the amount will be.  In many cases people who have gone through this dreadful process have been medical card holders.

I do not know exactly what they are, but we are informed it might be travel documents or passports for children who have been adopted to the United States.  These records are currently held by the National Archives and they will come under the remit of the Act.  In fact, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was keen to meet with us to ensure its records were included under the Bill.</p> <p>  The process of transferring the records from St. Patrick's Guild is under way.  There are ongoing discussions between ourselves, Tusla, St. Patrick's Guild and the authority.  That forms part of the working group that has been commenced.  It is working on that.  The consideration on that is happening at present and we are trying to progress it as soon as possible.</p> <p>  With regard to other identifying information, one can separate the information into a number of categories.  While they are not all mutually exclusive, I will explain each category.  It does not necessarily mean that an adopted person will come in on the first day and look for particular information, but I will explain how each category works.  The first piece of information is information about the adopted person.  This would be the time in the early nursery, medical information from the time of the birth and any information that is held on record.  The Bill provides that it can be provided immediately to the adopted person.</p> <p>  The next level of information, if one can call it that, will be non-identifying information about the adopted person but which incidentally has information about the parents.  One is talking about family background and perhaps some information about the circumstances of the adoption.  It is shared information, but it is information that is important to the adopted person.  In practice, many people when they seek information get what I would call an early life story, in which they would be told some non-identifying information about their parents.  We are providing in the Bill that this non-identifying information can be provided as soon as possible.  Of course, one also must ensure that it does not identify the birth parents, but that can be provided.</p> <p>  The next level of information would be where a birth parent has sent information to be provided to their child who was adopted.  For example, if there is some more recent medical history that a birth parent has provided to be given to their adopted child that can be provided, again in a non-identifying way.  There is provision for that in the Bill.</p> <p>  Then we move into the realm of identifying information.  The first level of this would be the information required to apply for a birth certificate, which obviously identifies the birth parents.  This is provided immediately with the consent of the birth parent or if it is established that the birth parent cannot be traced or is deceased.  Under the legislation there is the one year awareness campaign.  Once that has concluded the information required to apply for a person's birth certificate can be provided on signing the statutory declaration.</p> <p>  The next level of information would be other identifying information.  In this situation we are getting very close to somebody seeking contact with the birth parent.  At this stage the adopted person will most likely have a good level of information, so it would be information about current contact details or particular questions on which an adopted person might want information, for example, medical history or a particular question they might wish to pose.  Obviously the birth parent has to provide that information and they must consent.  This is information that would not be available on record so they must consent.  However, we would see that as getting very close to the stage of the adopted person seeking to initiate contact.</p> <p>  I hope I have explained that.</p></speech>

At present, one registers as an adopted person and says one is looking for siblings or for one's birth parent.  Unless there is a match on the register nothing happens until either a sibling or a birth parent registers.  Then the process commences.</p> <p>  The new register will be proactive.  When an adopted person registers, and they are not seeking the birth certificate as they have gone through all of that process, and say they are looking for siblings, the trace for siblings will commence.  Similarly, if a sibling enters the details on the register, a trace will commence for that adopted person.  The register will facilitate contact for siblings.</p> <p>  Drafting has not yet commenced on the Bill.  We are awaiting the report of the committee.  At the same time we are considering how best to proceed, so that may change.</p> <p>  There has been no decision yet regarding fees.  As I mentioned, it is a standard provision in the Bill.  If we had not included it, we could be in trouble down the road, but there is no decision at present.</p></speech>
