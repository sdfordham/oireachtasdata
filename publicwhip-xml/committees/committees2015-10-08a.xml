Agreed.  There are no matters arising.</p> <p>  We will now deal with correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers.  Correspondence has been received from the HSE on prompt payment compensation, to be noted and published.  This is an ongoing issue, particularly within the health sector, and chapter 19 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report deals specifically with this issue.  The HSE will be before the committee on 22 October and this chapter and particular issue can be dealt with at that stage.</p> <p>  Correspondence has been received from Dr. Maria Hinfelaar, president of Limerick Institute of Technology, LIT, regarding the issue of surplus staff in LIT, to be noted and published.  This letter clarifies the position of staff who were supernumerary following the amalgamation of Tipperary Institute to LIT.  I note the four surplus staff have been redeployed and the whole amalgamation, on the basis of the points being made by the president, is delivering a better utilisation of resources.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1058" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015100800002#E00400"><p>Very briefly, on the concept of supernumerary positions, this is the first time it has come up regarding the positions in LIT.  I received recently correspondence from the HSE stating it is unable to provide information on the number of supernumerary positions, if any.  Does the Comptroller and Auditor General examine this in the other organisations he audits?  It hit the headlines when it came out that three people did not have positions for a number of years.  How widespread is this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015100800002#E00500"><p>A distinction needs to be made.  A framework level of employment is set for each public body.  We can have a situation where further people work in the organisation, and a distinction needs to be made regarding people who have jobs even if they are in excess of the permitted level, and this does arise and we do look at it.  Most, or all, of the appropriation accounts should declare numbers.  Financial statements should also declare the number of staff employed in the organisation.  This provides information and feedback to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and supervising Departments in order that they can state they told an organisation it could only have 400 staff but it has 450.  This is the feedback mechanism.  I draw a distinction between additional nurses or teachers working in classrooms or wards and a situation where staff have no specific purpose delivering outputs or services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1058" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015100800002#E00600"><p>This is the question I wanted to get to, because the HSE told me it does not provide details of staff who may be in supernumerary positions.  Based on the LIT experience, do we have any indication as to how many more of these types of positions there are in the public sector whereby people turn up for work who do not have a job?</p></speech>

It can happen for frictional reasons, let us say, within a year, but when something is ongoing for a number of years, we certainly report it.</p></speech>

Correspondence has been received from an anonymous source regarding funding to Mannix College, County Cork, to be noted and forwarded to Cork Education and Training Board for a note on the matter.</p> <p>  We will now deal with documents relating to today&rsquo;s committee meeting.  Nos. 3C.1 to 3C.6 are the opening statements and presentations for today&rsquo;s session, to be noted and published.</p> <p>  No. 4 is reports, statements and accounts received since our meeting on 1 October.  I will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to comment on some of the audit outcomes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015100800002#E01200"><p>There is clear audit opinion in all cases.  With regard to the Irish Blood Transfusion Service and the matter reported last year, the same situation was continuing but obviously the aggregates had become greater and I have drawn attention in the audit certificate to two notes relevant to this.  Note 2 discloses that pension related deductions from staff salaries held by the Irish Blood Transfusion Service stood at &euro;10.3 million on 31 December 2014 and had still not been remitted as of that date to the Department of Health.  On the pension scheme side, the deficit shown by the Irish Blood Transfusion Service financial statements on 31 December 2014 had risen to &euro;92 million from &euro;42 million at the end of 2013.</p> <p>  The 2013 financial statements of the national paediatric hospital development board were listed for consideration today, but the financial statements for 2014 were signed on 1 October and have been submitted.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015100800002#E01300"><p>Is it agreed to note these accounts?  Agreed.</p> <p>  We have received further correspondence from HL Commodity Foods regarding previous comments and hearings of the Committee of Public Accounts and I will circulate it to members.  I want to have it noted and published in due course.  We should get a reply alongside it.  Members will not have seen it, so perhaps we should also ask for the reply from the Department in order that we have both before us when we are considering it.</p> <p>  With regard to the report on Cork Institute of Technology, CIT, and our meeting with the Secretary General of the relevant Department, the cost of doing the report was noted at &euro;65,000.</p><p>New figures indicate that the cost was &euro;100,000.  I am referring to the redacted report which we received.  We need to get back to this issue and deal with all the aspects of the report that have been raised with us.  I will ask the clerk to put the issue of the CIT on the agenda for next week.</p><p> The Committee of Public Accounts seems to be mentioned a great deal in the D&aacute;il these days.  Yesterday, the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy Damien English, responded to a Topical Issue matter on the University of Limerick that was dealt with by this committee.  The correspondence dates back to 27 April 2012 and March 2012.  There are serious issues to be addressed and yesterday it was revealed that it had been brought to the Minister's attention that there are now legal proceedings in this case.  We should receive an up-to-date report on the University of Limerick and the issues that were raised yesterday so that we can discuss them with the HEA when its representatives are next before the committee, which will be shortly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1058" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015100800002#F00200"><p>I agree with the Chairman.  There is a reputational issue for the University of Limerick and it is in everybody's interest that it be clarified as soon as possible.  These allegations are serious and have been around for a while, so the sooner either the Comptroller and Auditor General or the committee itself deals with this the better.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015100800002#F00300"><p>The allegations that were brought to the attention of the committee in March 2012 were sent to my office but they were also sent to the university, which responded to them by the end of April 2012.  We subsequently examined the issues.  We were finishing the audits at the time and the fieldwork had been completed on the periods in which these incidents had occurred but we also examined them when we went back in again.  Our focus was on whether control lapses, if there were any, were continuing in the organisation.  We have followed up on the nature of the problems that were identified and have drawn to the attention of the university matters in the management letters concerning control lapses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1058" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015100800002#F00400"><p>Is Mr. McCarthy satisfied that those control lapses are being dealt with?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015100800002#F00600"><p>I will ask the clerk to circulate the correspondence from Deputy Niall Collins and the attachment to it, which outlines everything - as well as the correspondence from the University of Limerick - so that members are kept informed.  I will also seek an up-to-date report on the position from the Department.</p> <p>  Our work programme is on the screen.  We have agreed with Inland Fisheries Ireland that its representatives will come before us next week.  The HSE and the Department of Justice and Equality will also be coming before us in the near future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015100800002#F00700"><p>As the Chairman will be aware, the Dublin Docklands Development Authority (Dissolution) Bill is before the D&aacute;il.  When it is passed it will have transferred the functions of the authority to Dublin City Council.  I do not know what are the implications of that for the relevance of a non-existing board coming before this committee.  How are we getting on with the report we are putting together?  At the last meeting, we referred to Longboat Quay and whether or not a couple of paragraphs could be included relating to that.  We also asked whether we could have the DDDA before the committee.  I do not know what the Comptroller and Auditor General would have to say about that but there is not much sense in a non-existent board coming before us after this legislation has passed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015100800002#F00800"><p>The report will be completed tomorrow and then circulated.  The request to have a comment in it, including the possibility of some recrimination, relating to Longboat Quay was agreed at our last meeting and it will be included.  If the legislation is passed and the board no longer exists then we cannot bring them in.  There will be recommendations in the report but if members want to make further strong recommendations on the current issue and any other issues that arise in the report they should contact the clerk.  That, then, will be our work done.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015100800002#F00900"><p>I suggest that in the context of the work programme we would agree a date for them to come in before the legislation is passed.  I do not know how long it will take but the legislation will be dependent on a ministerial order stipulating the date on which the functions will transfer, so I imagine it will be at least some weeks, at the very earliest, before the legislation can be passed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.26" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015100800002#F01000"><p>There will certainly need to be an audited wrap-up set of financial statements in any event, even if the dissolution was to happen immediately or before the end of the year.  I would expect there to be continuing accountability arrangements in place.  Members should note that it is the chief executive who is accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts, rather than the board, and it is unusual to have a board before the committee, though it has occurred occasionally and, indeed, the chairman of the board was before the committee relating to the Irish Glass Bottle site report.  I cannot recall if the 2014 financial statements have been examined.  The audit has been completed but they may be available and the committee could centre a hearing around these.  I can check the position and get back to the Deputy.</p></speech>

We can have a session based on the accounts and on our report.</p></speech>

Would it be possible to get a report from the CEOs of the four Dublin local authorities on why, in the context of what is on the news every day, they refused the houses offered to them by NAMA?  Would it be possible for us to examine this closely again?  The numbers aired here last week took people by surprise and I would like to have an understanding of why they refused them.</p></speech>

I will confine my remarks to Vote 38 and to the report on the IBTS pension issues.  I will comment on the children&rsquo;s hospital at the later session.</p> <p>  In 2014, Vote 38 for health received Exchequer funding to meet the cost of salaries and expenses incurred by the Office of the Minister for Health, to provide grant funding for a number of bodies under the aegis of the Department of Health, and to meet the cost of certain other services.  Members will be aware that for 2015, the Vote for health includes Exchequer funding for the Health Service Executive.  In 2014, this did not go through Vote 38, the HSE had its own Vote.  As a result, the structure of the Vote for health will be radically different in the future.</p> <p>  Gross expenditure of &euro;194.8 million was incurred on Vote 38 in 2014, against an estimate of &euro;205.9 million.  The  underspend of &euro;11.1 million, combined with higher than budgeted receipts of &euro;800,000, resulted in a surrender of &euro;11.9 million to the Exchequer.  By 2014, most Votes had moved to presenting information on a programme basis.  The objective of that format is to try to present financial information in a way that facilitates a focus on the objectives of spending, rather than on inputs or on spending types.  Vote 38 was an exception; grouping spending under headings related to administration, recurring grants, capital grants and a miscellaneous other services category, which accounted for 55% of the overall vote expenditure.</p> <p>  At an individual subhead level, the most significant Vote expenditure in 2014 was on: recurrent grants to development, consultative, supervisory, regulatory and advisory bodies for the health sector, totalling &euro;47.8 million; research grants totalling &euro;34.9 million; payments totalling &euro;27.2 million related to ongoing compensation for victims of hepatitis C contamination of the blood supply, and payments totalling over &euro;17 million in relation to inquiries, legal fees and settlements.  Administration costs incurred by the Department totalled &euro;26.9 million.</p> <p>  A primary aim of appropriation accounting is to report and explain variances between the sums voted by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and the outturn.  Explanations for significant variances in expenditure are given in note 3 and for variances in amounts receivable by the Vote in note 4.  The main areas where the expenditure outturn was significantly lower than the amounts provided were in respect of administration costs, which were some &euro;4 million less than the estimate.  Amounts of recurrent grants paid to health sector agencies was &euro;8.8 million lower than budgeted - this was largely due to unfilled posts in agencies, including the Health Information and Quality Authority HIQA and the Mental Health Commission.  The lower than budgeted expenditure in these areas was partly offset by higher than budgeted expenditure of &euro;6.9 million under subhead D, which is provided to cover the cost of inquiries, legal fees and settlements.  The Department noted that the excess on this subhead arose largely as a result of higher than expected payments made under the Lourdes Hospital and symphysiotomy payment schemes, and in relation to medical negligence claims.</p> <p>  The Irish Blood Transfusion Service is a statutory body established in 1965 and operating under the aegis of the Department of Health.  Its primary functions are the collection, processing and supply of blood and blood products.  The safe supply of such products is a critical element in the provision of health services in the State - the importance of this activity is underscored by the number of citizens who in the past suffered serious infection through the blood supply, and the ongoing cost to the taxpayer of compensation payments and of the provision of services to them.</p> <p>  The IBTS does not receive State funding by way of an annual grant.  All of its recurring income is derived from charges in respect of the supply and testing of blood and blood products.  The charge out rates are decided by the Minister for Health.  In 2009, IBTS earned income in the region of &euro;118 million.  By 2013, its income had fallen to approximately &euro;66 million, reflecting the transfer of responsibilities to St James's Hospital, changes in demand for certain products and price reductions.</p> <p>  The Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2013 includes a chapter in respect of a long-standing dispute between the Department and IBTS about amounts deducted from staff salaries in respect of pension-related deductions.</p><p>I should point out here that pension-related deductions are not the same as employee pension contributions.  In effect, the deductions are a salary reduction measure.  The 2009 FEMPI legislation provided for pension-related deductions from the remuneration of public servants from 1 March 2009.  Between 2009 and 2013, IBTS deducted &euro;8.7 million from staff remuneration in this regard, but at September 2014 had not paid over any of these amounts to the Department of Health as provided for in the legislation.  The 2014 financial statements indicate that the amount due to the Department at the end of that year had increased to &euro;10.3 million.  As a result, funding of that amount receivable by the Vote for health has not been received, and the provisions of the FEMPI Act are not being complied with in that regard.</p><p> The second issue in dispute relates to IBTS pension funding.  IBTS operates a funded defined benefit pension scheme for its employees, which is contributory.  In common with many other funded defined benefit schemes, the IBTS scheme is a balance of cost scheme.  This means that while the contribution rate for employees is fixed as a percentage of salary, the contribution IBTS, as the employer, is liable to pay into the fund goes up or down as required to ensure that the funding will be sufficient to meet the liabilities when they fall due.  Between 2011 and April 2014, IBTS made additional contributions of &euro;9.3 million to the pension scheme.  Notwithstanding the additional contributions, at the end of 2013 the pension fund deficit was estimated at &euro;42 million.  By end 2014, this had increased to &euro;92 million.  The movement year-on-year illustrates the volatility of pension liability estimation, which can be seen in the accounts of many State bodies.  At the time I reported, discussions were ongoing between IBTS, the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the resolution of both of these matters.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.57" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Breslin" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015100800002#H00200"><p>I am here today to deal with the annual report and appropriation accounts of the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of Vote 38, the Department of Health.  I am very happy to be here on my first occasion as Accounting Officer for the Department of Health's Vote.  The Department of Health is relatively small, with 350 staff directly on its payroll.  In 2013 it was responsible for a budget of some &euro;248 million and, as the Comptroller and Auditor General has said, that budget was &euro;206 million in 2014.  The budget covered the salaries and expenses of the office of the Minister and certain other services administered by that office, including grants to research, consultative and advisory bodies.</p> <p>  After more than a decade of change in the wider health sector, it is important that the Department of Health redefine its role to take account of these developments and to meet future challenges.  The Department's statement of strategy for the period 2015-2017 identifies the following four main elements to the Department&rsquo;s role: leadership and policy direction for the health sector to improve health outcomes; governance and performance oversight to ensure accountable and high-quality services; collaboration to achieve health priorities and contribute to wider social and economic goals; and the creation of an organisational environment where, on an ongoing basis, high performance is achieved and the knowledge and skills of staff are developed.  A programme of change is under way in the Department and our aim is to create an organisational environment that will position us to fulfil our role and achieve our priorities in the most effective way possible.  This programme of change also includes new assignment of management team responsibilities and the recruitment of new members to the management team, including a deputy secretary general for governance and performance and a deputy secretary general for policy and strategy, together with an assistant secretary for research and development and health analytics. </p> <p>  I will turn now to the IBTS pension fund.  When the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 was initially introduced, the IBTS questioned whether its staff should be liable for the pension-related deductions provided for under the FEMPI legislation, as employees of the IBTS are members of a long-standing private pension scheme.  The Department communicated to the IBTS from the outset that its staff were subject to the pension levy and stressed at every opportunity the necessity of remitting the pension-related deductions collected from employees.  The IBTS, which subsequently accepted that the legislation applies to its employees, linked the non-remittance of pension levy funds to the need to address a deficit in the IBTS pension fund.  Various efforts have been made to resolve the issue and considerable progress has been made in recent months.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Health are participating in conciliation talks with the IBTS and employee representatives under the auspices of the newly created Workplace Relations Commission with a view to reaching a sustainable conclusion.  In line with the IBTS pension fund's trust deed, any changes in pension arrangements have to be agreed by the employees.  At a Workplace Relations Commission conciliation conference attended by all parties on 2 October 2015, a proposal was put forward by the commission.  This proposal will be considered further by the IBTS and its employees.  However, the proposal is acceptable to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Health, and it is the hope of both Departments that it can bring resolution to the matters set out by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his report.</p> <p>  I will now set out the main points of the 2013 accounts as they pertain to Vote 38.  Funding is allocated to the Department of Health under Vote 38.  Through this Vote, funding is also allocated to bodies under the aegis of the Department, such as the Mental Health Commission, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and the Health Information and Quality Authority.  The 2013 provision, current and capital, for Vote 38 was almost &euro;248 million.  The 2013 outturn was almost &euro;220 million, leaving an overall saving of &euro;28 million.  The 2013 provision for current expenditure was &euro;233 million and the outturn was &euro;208 million, giving a saving of &euro;25 million.  In 2013, &euro;20 million of this saving was used to offset the Supplementary Estimate requirement for Vote 39, the Health Service Executive, thereby reducing the call on the Exchequer.  The 2013 provision for capital expenditure was almost &euro;14 million and the outturn was &euro;11 million, a saving of &euro;4 million.  The majority of this saving was due to timing issues on projects, particularly the construction of a clinical research facility at University Hospital Galway, which, I am delighted to say, was recently opened.  The contingency allocation was not required.  Further detail is provided in the opening statement on the breakdown of the appropriation account, and I might skip over that in the interest of time.</p> <p>  As members will be aware, under the provisions of the Health Service Executive (Financial Matters) Act 2014, the Vote of the Health Service Executive is disestablished and funding of the HSE is now provided from the Vote of the Minister for Health, Vote 38, with effect from 1 January 2015.  I look forward in future years to accounting to the committee for this expenditure as part of my Accounting Officer duties.  </p> <p>  In my capacity as Secretary General I am seeking to develop the Department&rsquo;s policy and performance oversight of the entire range of complex services falling within total public health expenditure.  I have mentioned the change programme under way in the Department, including the revised management team responsibilities which seek to equip us for this aspect of our role, amongst others.  I look forward to working with the committee, and with the Oireachtas generally, on this objective.  I am happy to take any questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.58" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrew Kelly" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015100800002#H00300"><p>My opening statement will deal with the issue of the IBTS pension scheme under four headings: the background to the scheme; pension-related deductions; the funding requirement; and discussions to resolve the issue.</p> <p>  The IBTS, formerly the Blood Transfusion Service Board, was established by a statutory instrument, SI 78/1965, to organise and administer a blood transfusion service.  The pension scheme was set up under indenture, or a trust deed, in 1963.  When the Blood Transfusion Service was established in 1965 to replace the National Blood Transfusion Association, one of the functions of the new body was "to take over the property (including choses-in-action), assets, rights and liabilities of the Company."  This would have included the pension scheme.  </p> <p>  The IBTS operates a defined benefit pension scheme, which is a balance of costs scheme.  Under the terms of the trust deed, any increase in contribution required to be paid following an actuarial valuation to ensure that the benefits under the scheme are funded falls to be paid by the employer.  Currently the employer pays 30% of payroll and the employees contribute, on average, 6.3%.  The benefits under the scheme are broadly in line with other public sector models and these have been actuarially evaluated and found to be comparable.  </p> <p>  I will now discuss the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 and the pension-related deduction.  The background to the application of the FEMPI Act 2009 is dealt with in detail in the briefing paper.  The FEMPI Act was introduced at a critical point in the consultation process with employees regarding funding of the scheme where the employer was seeking an increased contribution from employees to address the funding issue.</p><p>However, it is necessary to reiterate that initially the IBTS was informed that the Act did not apply.  This was subsequently changed to state that the staff in the IBTS were covered by the terms of the Act and should pay the PRD.  The board sought legal advice from senior counsel, which advised that the IBTS pension scheme did not fall within the definition of a public service scheme in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest  Act 2009 and, therefore, the terms of the Act did not apply.  The board decided to deduct the PRD from staff but the moneys were not remitted to the Department of Health.  Since April 2015, the IBTS has remitted the PRD collected from members of the single public service pension scheme and the amount in excess of &euro;10 million in respect of all other staff.  The total amount remitted to 30 June is &euro;1.268 million.  In addition, the IBTS pension scheme was deemed a private pension scheme for the purposes of the Government levy on private pension schemes.  This resulted in &euro;2.44 million being deducted from the value of the assets in the IBTS pension fund.</p><p> I refer to the funding requirement.  As with a large number of defined benefit schemes, there is a deficit in the IBTS fund.  The deficit from the most recent actuarial valuation on 1 May 2014 was &euro;27.921 million.  The funding requirement has increased substantially over the past decade.  The following shows the increase in the employer contribution required to fund the current level of benefits: 2005, 14% equation to a value of &euro;2.93 million; 2008, 19.5% or &euro;5.33 million; 2011, 20.7% or &euro;5.74 million; and 2014, 30% or &euro;7.22 million.  This is placing an unsustainable burden on the employer and it is clear that the current situation cannot continue.  The IBTS has recognised this for some time and has been in negotiations with staff on changing the terms of the scheme.  This level of increase is having a serious consequence on the funding of the IBTS.  In the current financial year, the core business is performing well except for the increased cost of the pension contribution which has put the organisation into deficit.  This is a very serious issue and needs to be addressed if the IBTS is to continue to provide a blood supply as safe as we can make it.  This means continuing to be current with technological developments.</p><p> The IBTS in the period 2009 to 2014 has, like all public sector bodies, undergone significant change and has reduced its cost base significantly.  This has occurred through a mixture of reductions in pay, controlling and reducing non-pay costs and reducing staff numbers.  In this context, the following reductions-savings have been achieved: pay , &euro;8.578 million or 20.85%; and non-pay, &euro;6.2 million or 18.96%, giving a total of  &euro;14.8 million or 20.1%.  At the same time, there has been a reduction in whole-time equivalents of 89.95 or 15.46%.  These have been achieved at a time the income of the IBTS has reduced by &euro;20.969 million, or 25.7%.  This is primarily as a result of the reduction in the use of blood and platelets.  These have reduced by 13.45% and 14.64%, respectively, in the period 2009 to 2014.  Consequently, the scope for further significant reductions in spending is minimal.  Therefore, the provision of pension arrangements for staff must be addressed In the context of the funding model of the IBTS.</p><p> With regard to discussions to resolve the issue, the IBTS has been engaged with staff and their representatives since 2002 on finding ways of resolving the increasing cost of funding the pension scheme.  To prevent the problem becoming worse, the IBTS changed the pension scheme for new entrants after 1 May 2009.  There is now broad recognition by all parties that the current situation cannot continue and that the measure taken in 2009 is not sufficient.  This means there needs to be a change to the benefits for existing members of the scheme.  The current series of negotiations is about finding a solution that will resolve the pension issue and secure the necessary funding for the IBTS into the future.  These negotiations are being held under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission.  The Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform are involved in this process.  Progress has been made and we will all continue to work together to resolve this outstanding issue.  We are hopeful of a successful conclusion to these negotiations and then the proposal will have to be put to a ballot of all members of the pension scheme.</p></speech>

I will put questions to the Department of Health first.  With regard to the financial statements, a contract was awarded relating to University Hospital Galway, UHG, to the value of &euro;62,000 but there was no public procurement process.  The reason cited by the Department was that specialist expertise was required.  What expertise was required?  To whom was the contract awarded?  Had the person who got the contract any connection with the Department or the HSE?</p></speech>

A report into patient safety was conducted by HIQA.  That report recommended that a national clinical guideline be developed to try to assist in similar situations in the future.  The urgency of that, and public concern attaching to it, meant that it was necessary to develop that guideline as a matter of some urgency.  Added to that was the very particular skills set required.  Although in the period since then, we have developed this capability within the Department, this is not an area in which the Department had expertise nor is it an area in which there is a range of providers in the country.  It involves of a mix of specialist clinical and economic skills that are not easily found.  The Department was able to source a person with the requisite skills to conduct that research.  They were not employed by UHG; this was an investigation into UHG.  We provided the rationale for this in the annual report.  I was not in the Department at the time it was done but when I did my 2014 return, because I had not signed off on this myself, I asked that the file be looked into very carefully and that the internal audit unit review it.  It conducted a report for me and I was fully satisfied that the rationale given for conducting that, through a non-competitive procurement process, fully stood up both in the context of the public concerns around the tragic incident in Galway and the requisite experience, which is not commonly found within the jurisdiction.</p></speech>

There is also an issue in respect of narcolepsy, which resulted from the vaccine given for swine 'flu.  The lives of some young people and families have been transformed and they are waiting for support from the Department.  This is a huge burden on families as they need extra support to physically manage the effects of the vaccine and support is also needed by schools in respect of these young people.  Will there be another long waiting period?  How will incidents such as this be managed where vaccinations have resulted in the health of individuals deteriorating?  Another case was brought to my attention last week.  It relates to a young girl who had the recent cervical vaccination and who has been in chronic pain since.  Her hip is affected.  She is on a crutch and is constantly on medication.</p><p>She is a teenager.  I appreciate that these things cannot be foreseen but do we have a process in place that can make it easier for people and families to adjust?  I would like to hear more about that, as opposed to spending the money on legal fees.</p></speech>

In 1996, the first awards from the hepatitis C compensation tribunal were made.  Sizeable awards have been made in the interim period and as the Deputy can see, they are set out in regard to both 2013 and 2014.  In total, &euro;689 million has been paid out in awards under the hepatitis C tribunal over that interim period.  There is a further reparation fund payment that totals &euro;152 million and, as the Deputy rightly points out, there are significant legal costs attaching to the operation of the hepatitis C compensation tribunal, which is a statutory tribunal, of &euro;165 million in legal fees over the period 1996 to 2014.  The number of awards made is 3,423 and in each of those awards there is representation of the tribunal itself in regard to counsel and also representation in regard to the claimants.  The Deputy can see that there are significant legal costs attaching to the tribunal based on it being a statutory tribunal where people are allowed to engage counsel to represent them in the tribunal.</p></speech>

They continue to make their way through for two reasons.  Cases will come before the tribunal for the first time but mostly at this stage they are cases of people not infected themselves but relatives of people who are infected.</p> <p>  There is also the ability to re-enter a case.  Over the years, the tribunal will have made a provisional award to somebody but if that person's illness associated with their having hepatitis C were to deteriorate, they might seek to re-enter the tribunal at that stage.</p> <p>  The State's involvement in this is a very sorry tale.  The Deputy can see the size of the compensation being made and the absolute imperative to try to ensure the safety of our blood supply and that we never have this issue arise again.</p> <p>  The only positive I can mention in regard to this entire area is that in the current year, 2015, Ireland has taken account of the developments that have taken place internationally and we are now funding therapies for people with hepatitis C, not just those contaminated through the blood supply but people in Ireland who have hepatitis C.  Those therapies now have a very good effectiveness in delivering not just improvement in the person's condition but, in some cases, curative.</p> <p>  We put in place a &euro;30 million programme in 2015, and that is being rolled out on a clinical basis where consultants identify those most urgent in clinical terms to be treated.  The Government has announced that as a multi-annual programme so I hope in future years to be talking about the money we spent on curing people with hepatitis C rather than compensating people for hepatitis C.  We cannot undo the damage of the past-----</p></speech>

Work was undertaken internationally and in Ireland to try to identify the association between people with narcolepsy, mostly young people, and those who had taken the vaccine.  An association was found.  There was a further requirement to prove causality, which is very hard to do because somebody may take a vaccine but something else may happen at the same time.  That being said, the Health Service Executive has worked with relatively small numbers of people in that category to try to put services in place around their needs.  We have increased the staffing around some of the specialist services that are needed for that and I know that is the case across Government, including in places like the Department of Education and Skills where people in the leaving certificate cycle, for example, have needed extra support with that and at university level.</p> <p>  There are likely to be some claims around that issue.  There has not been a settlement.  That has not reached a conclusion at this stage.</p></speech>

Obviously, the merits of the case are being looked into.</p> <p>  To move it into another associated area, also in the account is the symphysiotomy compensation scheme.  We would all prefer not to be in a very legalistic place.  Our learning over the years is to try to put in services early and address genuinely the life circumstances of people in these situations and, where issues arise, not to go to the Four Courts or even into very judicial processes.  The reason I reference the symphysiotomy situation is because that is operating under the Department's Vote in 2015 in a very speedy fashion where the same level of legal representation is not required, awards are being made and people are getting on with their lives.  All those processes have to be worked through as a general policy matter.</p> <p>  Regarding any specific vaccine, we have to look at the fine detail of that to determine the merits of the argument so I do not want to prejudge that.  In any event, what we try to do is tackle the underlying issues around services because in terms of people who have narcolepsy, other issues the Deputy flagged, a medical condition or who require other supports, the first thing we should do is try to address that as the most immediate need, and we are seeking to do that.</p></speech>

The general practitioner would then report on that adverse reaction.  The pharmaceutical companies are required to follow up on adverse reactions and the Health Products Regulatory Authority monitors all adverse reactions.  Adverse reactions could be something relatively minor such as swelling on the arm when one gets an injection to something more serious, and the regulatory authorities work across Europe to share information on adverse reactions.  One isolated event would not be a pattern.  One would look to see a pattern established that showed some causality between what happened to somebody and the actual vaccine.

The most vital thing, both for the health service and for the individual, is that we try to get to the underlying issue and get it resolved.  We are probably not in the first week of it but if we are in a situation where somebody has a chronic or long-standing condition, the health service has a range of services, including counselling and patient support services, to support people in that situation.  I do not wish to speak about the individual incident but my guess in something so proximate, if it happened last weekend and the issue is now present, is that the concentration of the effort, both by a GP and by specialists, would be on trying to get a handle on what the underlying issue is.</p></speech>

Is there a process in place whereby if something happens, somebody can say, "I believe I have had a reaction here.  I have been to the doctor and the family needs support", and a team can go in and help the family?  I get the impression that there is not.  It is a case of going back to the doctor to get the proof and going back to the hospital.  Mr. Breslin and I, as non-medical people, know that this can take a year or two.</p></speech>

If we were to put up a hurdle of proof, that would not be the response that should be given in this situation.  The response should be proportionate and in line with the underlying condition, regardless of where the origins of the condition lie.  It is a separate, subsequent and perhaps a parallel process to try to establish what its origins are.  I have no clinical evidence that the origins could be related to the vaccine.  It could be coincidental.  It really does not matter in terms of the underlying condition.

That refers to its own financial systems, operating systems and skills set.  There is a programme of reform being led by the chief financial officer in the HSE.  It has both skills and capability in staffing and also technology.  Over a period the HSE has had to come from a situation where it had multiple financial systems across former health board areas into a consolidated place where it has a single financial system.</p></speech>

We are at a peer review process for procurement of a national financial system.  However, the learning is that a great deal can happen before we implement a new national financial system.  There is a huge amount of process change that must be consolidated and made consistent across the country.  The way in which information is captured and recorded must be made consistent, and the processing of financial information can be streamlined through reducing the number of points in which it is being captured.  The overall reform is not simply about a piece of technology.  It must be about a changed way of managing the financial recording and management within the HSE.</p></speech>

They are commissioned by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to look at projects objectively, to bring their expertise to that across a range of areas, including ICT, and to question the project approach that is being taken.  We have just entered the peer review stage.  When we conclude that stage we would hope that we would finalise a procurement process that would lead to phased implementation.  It will be a multi-year implementation, probably starting with those areas of the country that have the most urgent need for new technology in this area.  We will phase in the implementation of that.  It will be a major multi-annual programme.  It will run to tens of millions of euro in terms of budget.  In the capital review announced last week by the Government additional provision has been made for a national financial system for the HSE.</p></speech>

Investments have been made to do that both in terms of technology and also the right calibre of skilled staff.  That is the HSE's piece of this.  It has been working on it and the committee will have heard about it in the past.  The piece for which the Department has assumed an added responsibility is that from 1 January I take Accounting Officer duties for that expenditure.

After the organisation was established, the pensions scheme was established in 1963.  There was a pension fund and every three years under the Pensions Act an actuary made a valuation to see what contributions were required to fund the benefits payable under the scheme at the time.  The trustees or the board of trustees, three of whom are appointed by the employer and three by the staff, operate the scheme on behalf of members and it was deemed that there would be a private pensions scheme.  The issue then arose, as there was a deficit in the scheme.  We were in discussions with staff at the time - in 2009 - to make increased contributions to secure their benefits under the scheme.  We were actually involved in conciliation on the day we found out that this scheme did apply.  The conciliation process broke down and they were not willing to pay any more if there was to be a pension-related deduction also.  They were not going to have a PRD of 6% or 7% and pay a further 6% or 7% to secure their benefits.</p></speech>

In the very early stages there was uncertainty, which went on for about two months maximum.  The board sought advice from senior counsel on whether the IBTS pensions scheme fitted the definition of a public service persons scheme within the terms of the FEMPI legislation.  The view of senior counsel was that it did not, that it was not a public service pensions scheme within the terms of the legislation.  Under our scheme, on retirement, the trustees calculate a person's pension based on the final salary given to them by the employer.  An individual member of staff retired and the employer told the trustees that the retirement pension was to be based on final salary which had been cut a number of months earlier.  The person concerned challenged this in the High Court saying, "If you cut my pay on the basis of FEMPI 2, then that Act should also apply in giving me the benefit of a grace period and retiring on a pension based on pre-cut salary."  The trustees said, "Not according to our trustee rules; therefore, it is to be based on final salary."  The person concerned did not accept this and took a case to the Ombudsman.  He supported her case and also determined that we had a public service pensions scheme.  The trustees then had no option but to appeal the decision to the High Court.  Even though he said at the beginning of his judgment that he was not going to deal with the substantive issue, the President of the High Court asked the hypothetical question whether the Oireachtas had intended to exclude the IBTS from the FEMPI legislation when it was brought forward and, using section 5 of the Interpretation Act 2005, decided that it had not been its intention to do so.  He, therefore, decided that it was a public service pensions scheme.  He went on to deal with the individual case later in the judgment.</p></speech>

The IBTS collected it for one purpose.  It is bad enough to see the Government raiding moneys that were collected for road tax and sending them off to Irish Water.  In this case, the IBTS collected a sum of money, which was intended to be given to the Government for a particular purpose under particular legislation, from its employees.  Therefore, the IBTS is legally obliged to hand over that money.  This has actually been tested in court.  The IBTS lost the case and now the money is due to the Department.  Does the IBTS have that money in a separate account?</p></speech>

The Act commenced on 1 March.  On 4 March, we corresponded with the Department of Finance, as it was at that stage, in response to a question that was raised about the application of FEMPI to the IBTS and the Department of Finance responded to us.  On 6 April, we gave our definitive position in writing to the IBTS, which was that it needed to deduct the levy and remit it to the Department.  That has been our position ever since.  Predecessors of mine and Ministers have written letters on this issue.  We have maintained that position.  The IBTS has linked the two issues of the FEMPI reductions and the financial position of the pension fund.  I do not underestimate the pension fund issue.  We have actively tried to work on that with the IBTS in the latest manifestation of this process.  In fairness to the IBTS, this is not simply an issue between two organs of the State as there are also employees involved.  The agreement of the employees will be needed if the issues in the pension fund are to be resolved.  The Workplace Relations Commission has been engaged on that part of this piece of work.  I think all of us, including the two Departments and the IBTS, are optimistic that the basis of a resolution is on the table.  That will require employees to sign up to revised pension arrangements.  If that is done, the two Departments have indicated that a contribution towards resolving that can be made in some or in part of the &euro;10 million that is outstanding.  We would like to bring this saga to a close.</p></speech>

They owe the Department the money and the Department has to get it back from them.  They are in a bit of financial bother and the Department has to resolve it.  That is the answer.  If the figures in what the Department is saying are correct, the cost so far in relation to hepatitis C, for example, is approximately &euro;1 billion.  I was just reading the different figures off the screen.  It is a little over &euro;1 billion.  That is the cost in terms of the compensation.  Then there is the &euro;132 million, the &euro;165 million for legal fees and so on.  Separate from and parallel to that, concern is also expressed in the report that this "could also seriously impact the organisation&rsquo;s capacity to deliver a safe and sustainable blood service, to the appropriate standards of quality and efficacy".  It is in everyone's interest that this matter be dealt with immediately.</p></speech>

The Department would take a view on that, working with the HSE, based on our own calculations and information sources.</p><p>That would form part of a negotiation process led by the Minister for Health with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform that would lead to an Estimates settlement that would be voted on in the Oireachtas.  Prior to 1 January, that Vote went directly to the HSE from the Oireachtas with the director general of the HSE as Accounting Officer.  Since 1 January this year that money passes through the Department of Health Vote and then we allocate it to the HSE as part of an allocation.  That would be a more normal funding arrangement between a Department and an agency.</p></speech>

One would have to factor in items such as medical inflation where technology is introducing extra cost.

One would come up with a set of estimations across the major budget headings.  That sounds like a very technical exercise and there is a lot of technicality to it, but I think it is only proper to reflect back since 2008 on the reality of where we have been, which is that we have faced the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform saying: "It really doesn't matter what the technical calculations are."  I am doing them a disservice; we are interested in the technical calculations, but in the final analysis, this is the only money that is available.</p></speech>

Let me talk in general and I will try to put figures on it, but it will be different in different years.  As the Chairman knows, in the current year one will often have an overspend, as has been the pattern in recent years.  So one will have an over-expenditure in 2015.  That would be one of the first things that one would try to address in the 2016 Estimate.  One would also seek to put in place something to provide for demography.  I have given the example of &euro;200 million.  One would then adjust it for movements in pay rates.  So, in relation to next year, there would be an increase in pay rates.  In some of the years over this period, that has been a reduction in pay rates and, therefore, one could reduce it down.  One will look at the cost of drugs and we have been successful in reducing the price of drugs, but the volume of drugs that are being prescribed continues to rise as it does in most jurisdictions.  So we would put in an estimate of that.  So they are the constituent elements that we would build up to an overall figure and it would depend on the given year as to what that would be.</p></speech>

That is my concern.  Over the years we have seen Estimates that have simply been way too low in the context of the eventual Vote and what was there.  It would be good for someone in your position to come out and simply say, "Look, we asked for &euro;15 billion and we got &euro;12 billion, which is totally inadequate."  Alongside that presentation we need Mr. Breslin to answer the question as to how many, if any, HSE employees within middle management or senior management are surplus to requirements.  Has he estimated that?</p></speech>

What we have at the moment is quite a lot of transactional processing going on.  The best-in-class approach to that would be to bring technology to bear on that.  I would like to see more people doing the job that the Deputy in her questioning asked which is really getting under the information and seeing what can be done to make a difference and make more value out of the money we are having.  So I do not think we are overstaffed and over-managed relative to other countries.</p><p>However, we are not asking the right questions, and are not using the intelligence that it is possible to generate through modern systems, to the benefit of patients, primarily, but also the taxpayer.</p></speech>

In these areas, changing the approach around process could free up staff.  However, if we simply took away the staff at the moment without changing the process, we would grind to a halt.  Improving financial processes and bringing technology to bear will release staff.  We are keen to see them deployed into higher value work involving analysis and trying to manage to a higher level.</p></speech>

It relates to the integrated national financial system - I understand that is how you describe it.  The last time I asked about this I was told that a proposal had been made to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and that it was generally being considered.  You have given us far greater detail and clarity in that you are looking at delivery in five years and a roll-out of eight years.  This means the Department is at a given stage now in terms of determining what it wants within that system and how it will operate.  Up to now we have had the most evasive answers from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the same from the HSE.  I am pleased to hear now that at least we have got this far with it.  However, I had thought it was far more advanced than it appears.  You have said the delivery of the system will be in five years.  When will we be at the point of delivering an agreed system with the ability to talk to the other systems in place?</p></speech>

The second answer is that we will not try to implement that in every part of the HSE all in one go.  We will undertake a phased implementation throughout the HSE.  The timeline I have referenced is to the end of the process.  In advance of that, proven technologies are available to us which can suck the information from existing systems and make it more accessible, including data warehousing and use of technology in that area.  We are doing it in two stages.  The first is to get to an endpoint with one financial system throughout the health service, that is, the same proprietary financial system everywhere.  That is the real endpoint.  However, in advance of that, as we develop our instances of implementation, we will draw that information into a central source and have better and more reliable information.</p></speech>

This is something you have brought up as well.  I imagine you know what I am going to bring up.  It relates to the foster home we have dealt with and the HSE's involvement.  I thank Mr. Breslin for coming in and he is welcome.</p> <p>  Mr. Conal Devine was commissioned to undertake a report on everything surrounding the foster home located in the south east of the country where some serious allegations have been made.  We are getting conflicting views with regard to the position of a Garda investigation in this regard.  The Chairman was formally notified that there would not be any prosecutions in this case.  That much has been repeated to several people.</p> <p>  As far as the Department is aware, what is the status of a Garda investigation?  I am asking because those responsible in the HSE are using the excuse of an ongoing Garda investigation.  They maintain it precludes them from releasing the report, even in redacted form.  What is Mr. Breslin's understanding of it?  Frankly, we are getting two stories.</p></speech>

The Chairman may have been informed differently.  Obviously, we do not try to intervene in the process, but we have sought to check where the process is at.  We have been told it has not concluded and this may relate to a number of lines of inquiry.  That rings true with the line the HSE has given us, which is that the executive is precluded from publishing until it gets word from the Garda on the matter.  That is the current situation, as we understand it.</p></speech>

People have contacted the Garda and have directly asked the Garda whether there is an issue with publishing this report and the Garda have said "No."  Some people are making the point to us that they do not believe there is an issue with the publication of this report.  Can Mr. Breslin shine any light on that?</p></speech>

I have written to the committee on the subject.  The Minister has requested that we organise a senior counsel, Mr. Conor Dignam, to look into the matter.  One particular aspect that the senior counsel has been asked to look into relates to the reasons the reports have not been published and whether these reasons are well grounded.  An interim report is due back shortly from Mr. Dignam.  We hope that will assist the Deputy in the question he is asking.</p></speech>

This report was commissioned using public money.  The Department of Health funds the HSE budget.  I have to ask a particular question but no one seems to know the answer.  What is the natural course when it comes to a report like this?  Public money has been used and spent to commission it.  It has been lying somewhere for years now.  What role does the Department have?  Do we need to ask counsel every time to examine why a report has not been published?  Does Mr. Breslin get to see this report once it is finished?  Does the Minister get to see this report?  Does the HSE keep it locked up?  I am beginning to suspect that HSE is not releasing some of these reports because they would damage the organisation and some individuals and because the HSE is potentially protecting some individuals by not publishing.</p></speech>

We get many reports in these scenarios.  Situations could arise which are more local and are less obviously matters of public concern, but the HSE may take the view that they are worth looking into in any event.  We would not necessarily get all of those.  However, in such instances where we do not have An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's involvement, we would request the report.  In this situation where we have done so, we have not been content to wait.  We have agreed with the HSE that a senior counsel will review the reports.  The Ministers have been at a disadvantage in the debate on the matter because they have not seen the reports - nor have I.  However, they will have the benefit of a senior counsel having reviewed the report as well as a clear position from the senior counsel.</p></speech>

Social workers and people who have been around this for the past ten years have seen fragments of this report.  They know that it is hard-hitting.  They know it is a good report, and that is how they have characterised it to me.  Mr. Breslin does not know; they do.  A lot of people who are working in this area know exactly what has been written in that report and are very keen that it be made public, and they are very clear about their opinions as to why it is being held back.</p> <p>  I take everything Mr. Breslin said at face value.  He stated that the Department of Justice and Equality and the Garda have made it clear that there are still issues that need to be dealt with.  I am beginning to get worried, though, that the HSE sits on such reports and then redacts them, and it is in the public interest for that to change.  A second set of eyes needs to be brought into this to make a decision on whether it is good public policy to continue that system.</p> <p>  As for some of the issues, I have never dealt with anything like it.  I have been in politics since 1999 and I have never dealt with anything as serious and as disturbing as these allegations.  I think Mr. Breslin gets my drift.  I note the Chairman has been involved in this and we are on the same page when it comes to this.</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, has written to the HSE suggesting that there are already processes in place in acute care to ensure that nominations of people to undertake reviews are not done by the HSE; they are done by an external party.</p></speech>

Deputy Lynch has written to the HSE to say that the selection process around that could benefit from it being more independent.  In particular, the HSE's attention has been drawn to a practice that has developed, and one that I am very aware of, in the child welfare area where an external party to the HSE, somebody of objective standing who stands apart from the HSE - a professor in a university, not an employee of the HSE - selects from a panel of people who might undertake the review.  There is the occasion where members of that panel have worked in the HSE because that is by far the biggest provider of health services but a studied eye is given to the composition of the panel, to ensure that it has clear independent status to it.  We think this is an area, and the HSE is working with us and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to try to develop a methodology that in the future would not lead to the kind of the concerns that members at the committee here have expressed, and we will have that.</p></speech>

We have been dealing with this for the past year.  We have been dealing with the methodology, the panels and the independence of these reports and reviews.</p> <p>  That is news.  That is something we have not heard previously.  We put a lot of work into this with regard to the independence of these reviews.  Mr. Breslin states that the Minister in question, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, has written to the HSE stressing that the reports should be more independent.  Is it a bit more concrete than that?  Does she have a proposal that she sent to the HSE or is it merely a request?</p></speech>

Indeed, she has met with people involved in the panel in the children area to try to get the methodologies right as we implement something similar in this space.</p></speech>

I would like it if the clerk to the committee, without saying anything, could correspond or communicate with Mr. Breslin's office so that we could get a copy of those proposals so that we can take a look at them.  We made some definite recommendations in this area but if Mr. Breslin can give us that information, we would like to take a look at that.</p></speech>

I am happy with that.</p> <p>  What I am deeply concerned about is the fact that the health boards, dating back to their time, and therefore the Department of Health, failed a high number of vulnerable young adults in this State, and probably continues to do that in this case.  Within the organisation of the health services, someone knows what happened in relation to this.  It did not go unnoticed.  A senior social worker and an independent organisation felt strongly enough about it to make a protected disclosure on a number of different occasions, and felt so strong about it that they raised it at a restricted public meeting of employees with the HSE.</p> <p>  It also was raised here.  Deputy Deasy and I raised it, and I made a disclosure to Pearse St. Garda station.  This is what annoys me about it.  Some employees of the health board at that time must have known about this and that was said by the whistleblower in greater detail.  I have not heard from the HSE or from the Department of Health to say they have identified the various persons who engaged with this issue at that time.</p> <p>  I want to put this on record because of what Mr. Breslin said.  I was asked to attend a meeting in the Garda station some months ago where I was told that the evidence had been presented to the DDP and that no action would be taken.  Mr. Breslin states that he is waiting on the Garda report or the Garda is dealing with it, and I have been told that the Garda has dealt with it.  They either have or they have not dealt with it.  In my opinion, someone is covering up or playing games, and we need to come clean on all of this issue, not only in the interest of accountability, transparency and all of those words that are used nowadays, but in the interest of the families concerned.</p><p>Some of those young adults may have continued through their lives being affected by what happened.  I have read some of the reports and, quite frankly, in my time in the public arena I have never read anything so horrifying.  Both the reports and the verbal explanations given to me by the social workers are horrifying.  That is what disturbed me most about this.  We had an exchange here with the HSE on this matter and I must say that its arrogance and stonewalling on the occasion in question was breathtaking.  A bit of truth and a bit of effort would really change things around here and would also the circumstances of the people affected.  In light of what I have been told and in view of the fact that the Department of Health, at some stage in its history, employed people who were directly responsible in this area, there is an onus on the Department to conduct some sort of investigation into both itself and the individuals concerned.  It should not be held back by the report or the information to the effect that there is a Garda report.  The witness can say that I told him there were no prosecutions to happen.  That is what I was told.  I will leave it at that but I could not leave it at the exchange with Deputy Deasy because so much has happened since. </p></speech>

I do not want this to be an ongoing issue.  The purpose of commissioning the senior counsel is to get us to a point where we can put whatever we can into the public domain.  One of the key issues the senior counsel is to examine is whether this concept of not publishing the report is well grounded.  That finding will answer at least part of the question that the Chairman has posed.  Officials at the Department and Ministers have met some of the people who have concern and local knowledge of this issue and everybody's concern is shared here.  This is not something where we lack concern on this issue.</p></speech>

I think he should seek the names of the individuals who were at the forefront of this at that time and determine whether they have all been questioned or made a contribution to the investigation.  Quite frankly, it does Mr. Breslin, the committee, and the Garda no good to say that such a serious issue has not been brought to a conclusion one way or the other.  I have two questions for Mr. Breslin.</p></speech>

I want to reiterate one thing.  Mr. Breslin has made it clear that the process involving the choosing of the individuals who do these reports will now change which will end potential conflicts of interest that have arisen in the past.  Very clearly, that is what we have seen and that is good and the people involved in this will be pleased with that.  I have to return to the reports that are commissioned using public money and the way they are treated once they are completed.  I think Mr. Breslin's office, on the basis of good public policy, needs to take a look at redaction and the circulation of those reports and, in my opinion, the continual suppression of these reports within the HSE.  I could make a good argument that, for the public good, that system can no longer continue.  I think Mr. Breslin needs to provide a second set of eyes or a different system or proposal to the HSE.  I think, as a matter of good public policy, that needs to be considered at this point.</p></speech>

I speak with some knowledge of the children's area because that was my former posting.  The approach that is taken there is that the reports are published.  The important thing in the terms of reference when something is set up is that the person who is doing the inquiry is told that the report will be published.  If they go off and do the report and then one decides whether to publish it or not, one gets into redaction terrain, so it is important that we set up a process that is for the publication of reports.</p></speech>

We have sought to work with the NMBI to get this issue resolved.  We have recruited additional staffing for the registration process and the NMBI is about to introduce a proper call centre for taking calls and working through inquiries from people who are in the registration process.  Although it will not be completely resolved, we hope to put a very big dent in it in the coming weeks and there is work under way on that.</p></speech>

As I recall it, it was &euro;1.4 billion, which I think is correct, but &euro;610 million was provided to the HSE following the negotiations on the Estimates process.  Alongside that would have been savings initiatives to try to find further resources.  One can see that the HSE tends to go for the desirable funding and then we have to go through a process with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to see what is achievable.</p></speech>

Between 2007 and December 2013, the board had incurred costs of just under &euro;42 million.  Funding for the project was provided by the Health Service Executive.  The cumulative expenditure by year is shown in figure 1 of the document circulated.  The breakdown of total expenditure at the end of 2013 is shown in figure 2.<br/><br/>By December 2013, the business services team had incurred expenditure of &euro;24.5 million in respect of business and health care planning and programme management.  Cumulative expenditure of the integrated design team, of &euro;6.4 million, related to engineering, architectural and quantity surveying activities.  The project management team had incurred expenditure of just over &euro;3.2 million, mainly relating to design costs and &euro;7.6 million had been incurred in respect of administration costs, including salaries.  All of the expenditure incurred had been capitalised and recognised as an asset in the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board's<b><i></i></b>balance sheet.  The carrying value of the asset was impacted upon by the Government decision on 6 November 2012 to change the location of the hospital.<br/><br/>In December 2012, the term of the existing board expired.  Following its appointment in August 2013, the new board undertook a review of asset values, which took account of the extent to which the outputs produced could be used on the project at St James&rsquo;s.  The audit of the 2013 financial statements included a review of the impairment calculation.  The financial statements for 2013 reflect the writing down of &euro;35.5 million of the accumulated expenditure.  The breakdown of total expenditure to December 2013, as between amounts written off and value retained by type of expenditure, is set out in figure 3.  At December 2013, taking account of the write-down of &euro;35.5 million, the asset was valued at &euro;6.2 million.<br/><br/>My office completed the audit, including examination of the impairment review and its impact on the 2013 financial statements, by 14 October 2014, which was just before the committee&rsquo;s previous examination of the board.  However, the Department of Health and Children wished to consider the impairment further in consultation with the HSE and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  My office received signed accounts for 2013 from the board on 17 February 2015 and these were certified by me on 20 February 2015.  The audit certificate noted a clear audit opinion but drew attention to the significant impairment charge in the year.<br/><br/>The 2014 financial statements were certified on 1 October 2015, again receiving a clear audit opinion.  Further impairment was not required.  As I mentioned earlier, they have been presented for the committee.</p></speech>

On 2 August 2013, the current board was appointed and a new executive recruited.  Total expenditure for 2013 was &euro;1.71 million.  This can be summarised under the following headings: payroll and related costs, &euro;460,000; site clearance cost &euro;260,000; design team fees, &euro;260,000; health planning, &euro;200,000; and administration and other costs, &euro;530,000.  The 2013 balance sheet includes assets valued at &euro;39.98 million at the beginning of 2013 in respect of the planning and development work for the children&rsquo;s hospital planned for the Mater Hospital campus.  This value relates to accumulated expenditure in the period 2007 to 2012.  These details were discussed at a previous Committee of Public Accounts meeting with the NPHDB on 23 October 2014.</p> <p>  The current board of the NPHDB was announced in August 2013 and commenced familiarising itself with the overall project details, including the 2012 and 2013 accounts.  On page 14 of the 2013 accounts, note 3 identifies that, arising from the Government decision to change the location of the new children's hospital to the St James&rsquo;s hospital site, the board spent considerable time ascertaining potential reusable value of the accumulated expenditure.  The development board initiated a process in 2014 to review and analyse the asset impairment.  The review was carried out based on guidelines in financial reporting standard, FRS, 11 ensuring any impairment or loss is measured and recognised.  The board has reviewed all expenditure for construction work in progress, identified the deliverables which were supported by that expenditure, set out the sections of the deliverables which can be utilised on the St. James's campus and carried out detailed analysis on the value of the sections of work which can be utilised or modified to provide future value.</p> <p>  The impairment analysis comprised detailed examination of all expenditure, divided into separate, distinct components being examined by the staff of the board who have project knowledge of the individual components involved.  The review involved detailed analysis of the costs up to November 2012  - the date of the decision to move to the St. James&rsquo;s campus - and the costs in 2013 that relate Mater site project.  The staff members then reviewed the data to assess what portion of each individual component could be reutilised on the St. James&rsquo;s site.  The review was completed in September 2014.  The proposed impairment was reviewed by the NPHDB audit committee, the board of the NPHDB, the HSE, the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform, the Comptroller and Auditor General as part of the audit process and PricewaterhouseCoopers has reviewed and confirmed that the process is in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles, GAAP.</p><p>The Comptroller and Auditor General, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the HSE, as funder, were in agreement with the approach taken by the development board and the Department confirmed to the development board that it had no objection to the write-down in the development board&rsquo;s 2013 accounts.  The review resulted in an impairment of &euro;35,501,586 which related to the provision of services as set out in page 15 of the of 2013 accounts, which were specific to the activities and services supporting the Mater site and cannot be utilised or transferred to the project on the St. James&rsquo;s site.</p><p> I will now turn to the current status of the project.  A strategic infrastructure development planning submission for the new children&rsquo;s hospital was submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la on 10  August 2015.  We expect an oral hearing to take place in November 2015.  A planning decision from An Bord Plean&aacute;la is expected on 15 February 2016.</p></speech>

There are two issues to which I wish to draw attention.  The first is the impairment charge and the second is where we stand regarding delivery of the new hospital.  The impairment charge is &euro;35.5 million and the total expenditure was just short of &euro;40 million.  To anyone looking at this, it would seem extraordinary that a figure of more than 90% of the expenditure relating to design, business services, administration and project management was written off and was not reusable or transferable.  When the witness was before this committee on a previous occasion, questions were raised about this matter.  It was indicated that a full review was taking place.  What is here before us today is the outcome of that review.  Perhaps the witness might give the committee some detail as to why so little of the funding that was made available, and the expenditure that took place, has been transferable to the new proposed premises in St. James&rsquo;s hospital?</p></speech>

In looking at the impairment charge, we broke it up into 15 separate work streams which we saw as deliverables.  By deliverable it is meant something that was a tangible asset for us.  Therefore, items such as the civil structural engineer&rsquo;s design for the Mater project was very specific to the Mater site as it was for a16-storey building on a totally different footprint.  So even though we have drawings and calculations, that particular deliverable would not be transferable.</p></speech>

Most of that related to the architects&rsquo; drawings: how the hospital was laid out and the adjacency of the rooms; the configurations of single-bed wards and operating theatres, offices and open-plan offices; and the configuration of the accident and emergency department.  It was possible to transfer those drawings to the new design team and they were handed over at the time that the team tendered so they could say &ldquo;Well that is the layout of a room that was configured and set out, therefore we can retain a value for that.&rdquo;</p></speech>

The reason previously given to this committee for the rejection, which, of course, was totally wrong, was that the footprint was too small and that there is a much bigger footprint at Saint James&rsquo;s Hospital.  That was not the reason An Bord Plean&aacute;la rejected the initial planning application.  It rejected it because it was totally loony.  It was for a 16-storey building which could not accommodate a helicopter landing on the roof.  It was in breach of the Dublin city development plan and the local area plan - two statutory plans.  How in God&rsquo;s name could a design team have gone in to An Bord Plean&aacute;la with these breaches of statutory compliance?  I do not see any of that in the analysis that has been presented to this committee.  There is a serious question to be answered.  How could a development board spent five years and all of this money &ndash; not just on the design but also on administration and business services, the cost of which was &euro;24 million &ndash; and yet come up with such a poor design that was totally rejected by An Bord Plean&aacute;la?  The business of this committee is to find out why taxpayers&rsquo; money was spent so badly, and I do not see an answer to that in the financial statement in the survey conducted by the new board.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, we cannot rewrite history, but we have to learn and make sure that in every step we make along the way, in respect of any of perceived weakness in the decision-making processes during the five years, we ensure this will not happen.  Mr. Pollock might set out the steps we have taken from the outset in ensuring there is robustness to what we are doing.</p></speech>

Previously, it had had a dual remit.  It had to concentrate on delivering the building and the medical-clinical integration of three children's hospitals.  The Government decided to have two boards - our board, that is, the development board, and the group board, which is chaired by Jim Browne from NUI Galway.  The skillsets in our board relate very much to building.  The chairman has 30 years experience in the construction sector.  We have two urban planners who worked with local authorities, one of whom was a member of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The Chief Government Procurement Officer is on our board because, given the amount of procurement work we have to do, we also have a lot of financial work to do.  We have an architect who is the chief architect in the Northern Ireland health service.</p> <p>  The next thing was to make sure the executive was put in place.  Again, my background is in engineering.  I have worked on health care and building projects for 30 years.  The other members of my team, from the commercial director to our design director, come with engineering and architectural backgrounds; therefore, we know what it takes to deliver a building.  </p> <p>  Having these two streams in place, we said the next thing to do was to get in place a world-class design team with experience in designing children's hospitals.  We said we would not accept a design team with no experience of designing a children's hospital.  BDP Architects is leading it.  It delivered Alder Hey Children's Hospital and the Royal Alexandra Children's Hospital in Brighton in the United Kingdom.  During the procurement phase the board was making sure we could minimise risk.  When St. James's Hospital was originally proposed as the site of the national children's hospital, a smaller site was offered.  I think we discussed this issue the last time we met.  The site comprises 12 acres of land in the middle of Dublin and three times the size of the site proposed at the Mater Hospital.</p></speech>

Why did the original board decide to build up to 16 storeys as it was just not going to happen and was not good practice in the case of a children's hospital when there was a footprint that could have been extended and which became available immediately after An Bord Plean&aacute;la had rejected the application?</p></speech>

As we are talking about the financial accounts for 2013 and the impairment charges, we want to know.  Mr. Pollock has said the board has learned lessons, but it cannot really have done so unless it knows what happened in the past.  How did it happen that a footprint far in excess of what was available originally became available immediately after An Bord Plean&aacute;la had rejected the planning application?  If it had been available, there would have been a different design.  We ended up with an explanation that it had something to do with the footprint of the Mater Hospital when, in fact, it had had nothing to do with it.  It was related to the flawed planning application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p></speech>

The square footage of the hospital we are now building is quite similar to what was available at the Mater Hospital; therefore, the scope of the project was always defined.  It was a defined site.  The lesson we have learned is, as Mr. Pollock said, that before we appoint a design team or engage in any expenditure on behalf of the State, we need to stress-test the decision making.  If we were to roll back six or seven years, the answer to the question of whether making sure all of the stress-testing was done before proceeding was the right thing to do is probably "Yes".  We are reinforcing it, but that was our first step.</p></speech>

There are a few things that are fundamentally different in the way we are structured compared to the Mater Hospital.  In the Mater Hospital there was a board which, as Mr. Pollock said, straddled the integration of the hospitals in delivering the project.  In essence, at executive level, much of the work was outsourced to a business services team.  Our structure involves a board the remit of which is to design, build and equip the hospital.  The board has appointed an executive who has ownership of the project to deliver it.  That is fundamentally very different from outsourcing the work to a business services team.  Certainly, we are happy with the robustness of the structure in terms of the executive, the sub-committees and the reporting to the board such that there is ownership all the way through.  When the Deputy asks why somebody did not ask, I can guarantee that on an ongoing basis there is a lot of questioning every day of the week in making sure we-----</p></speech>

Why was the decision made to fit the national paediatric hospital into that site when there was a broader footprint available?  There is a question mark over the initial decision of the then board to develop a national paediatric hospital on the Mater site, the length of time it spent on that process despite precedent in that regard and the availability of a site that could be expanded, and was expanded following the rejection by An Bord Plean&aacute;la of its application in that regard.  What occurred in relation to the planning is an unholy mess.  There is no adequate explanation for any of this in the submission, other than figures around expenditure in relation to this process and a statement that the board has taken on board the lessons learned.  We have to take the boards' word for all of this.  I accept that the new board comprises architects and that it is going about the process in a somewhat different fashion but the impression is given that the only reason we are where we are is because the Minister made a decision to transfer the children's hospital from the Mater site to the St. James's site.  That is not the reason we are where we are at this point in time.  The reason we are where we are is because the previous board made a cock-up of the plan to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  That plan was rejected because it was flawed and that should be reflected in the document.  It is not sufficient to state that arising out of the decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la the Minister made a decision to transfer location of the hospital to another site and, therefore, we have incurred this, that and the other.  The submission to An Bord Plean&aacute;la of a planning application that was flawed left the Minister with little choice other than to vacate the original site.</p></speech>

I think what we have done is correct in the sense that we were appointed on a Government decision to deliver a new children's hospital at the St. James's site.  In that regard, we were required to do two things - analyse the value we could get from the documentation and information inherited from the Mater site project and to learn from the lessons of the Mater site process.  I genuinely believe that that is our obligation and that is what we have done.</p></speech>

It is a bit anomalous here in that the original project was not completed but the write-off is very significant.  It is appropriate that the write-off is explained from an accounting perspective.  In line with the principle of the public spending code that a review be carried out of the project, it is appropriate for the Deputy to raise questions as to the reason it failed.</p> <p>  In undertaking a capital project of this kind a business case analysis is required.  Again, this is set out in the public spending code which was issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The purpose of pre-appraisal of a project is to identify the critical project risks, one of which in this situation would be where the obvious requirement for planning such that a project would not get into the detailed design phase until the major risks had been analysed.  I would imagine that there would have been a blocking analysis in terms of the height of the building in the context of the footprint available and how that would get through the planning process.  One would expect to see that kind of analysis being done.  I am the sure the board has done that since in relation to the St. James's site but if it was not done previously then that may be where the fault lies.</p></speech>

The point that then arises is who should be doing that review given that the previous board no longer exists and the current board has a project which is forward-facing and of a different character.  In order to sanction a project there is a sanctioning authority which I think in this case is the Department of Health.  By definition, the onus must revert to the Department of Health in that situation.</p><p>Would that be DPER's view as well perhaps?</p></speech>

We need to know more than the accountancy side of the matter.  It was the same with the Thornton Hall prison project.  Significant additional work is required in terms of the history of the project as distinct from where and how the money was spent.  I would like us to be a position to examine this matter further because we need details relating to the history of it in order to get to the bottom of why so much money was spent in such a way that none of it was transferable to any other project.  Is it possible to make a request to the Department of Health to look at this aspect of it?</p></speech>

That might be the general learning point that would form a recommendation on the part of the committee.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-08a.524" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015100800002#Y01100"><p>I will first go through the list of questions.  These relate to the question the Deputy has asked about the review.  Mr. Tom Costello said the main work on the original plans was carried out by a business services team.  Therefore, the board or whomever gave most of the work to this team, which, presumably, appointed the architects and worked up the plans in the context of making the original application for this 16-storey hospital building.  The decision of the board at that time was to refer essentially all of the elements of this work to a business services team.  I think we need to question that team in the context of what led it to believe that a planning application in respect of a 16-storey building could be successful; whether it examined the city or county development plan, as would be done for a normal site; whether it decided the footprint of the site was such that it would be allowed by the planners; and what analysis was conducted of services on the site and so on.  Is Mr. Costello aware of the analysis carried out by the team in the context of the lead-up to an application being made?  In other words, had it ticked all the boxes along the route to planning and then reached a point where it said, "We have ticked all the boxes; now we will make an application"?</p></speech>

That was not entirely clear.  Again, our lesson learned from that is no matter how brilliant the architecture is, stick to the rules.  If one does so, one is far more likely to be successful.</p></speech>

I am trying to get to the point before the board started to learn lessons from this saga.  To assist Deputy Joe Costello, I am simply asking if there is documentation that can inform the committee, the Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as to what happened in the course of the business services team's analysis of the potential in terms of planning permission.  Can we have documentation?</p></speech>

The strategic infrastructures legislation was not in place at the time and then they lodged the application for the Mater.  The proposal was to go to DCC and the council was supportive of the planning application, including the 16-storey development.  The team would have relied on the local area plan, which referred to buildings of 12 storeys and, as Mr. Costello said, possibly more for buildings of significant architecture.  DCC was supportive of the application but it never went to the council because the Government changed the legislation and brought in the strategic infrastructures legislation and, therefore, rather than going to a local authority with major health care projects and potentially an appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, it was decided to go straight to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p></speech>

I am looking for the evidence that would show us the process that convinced the business services team and 1.5 or two people who were involved at executive level that they should go with the possibility of a successful planning application and the support of DCC to An Bord Pleanal&aacute;.

I am seeking the documentation that helped that team to reach a conclusion that there was a possibility of securing planning permission.  If the two people gave the contract to a business services team, they must have had a set of instructions and the team took a set of actions.  They must have reported back to the two people and that is what I would like to see.</p></speech>

At the outset, Mr. Pollock stated, "The Comptroller and Auditor General, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the HSE, as funder, were in agreement with the approach taken by the development board and the Department confirmed to the development board that it had no objection to the write-down in the development board&rsquo;s 2013 accounts."  That could be read as, "All is okay".  However, it is not okay and that is the point made by Deputy Joe Costello.</p><p>It has been suggested to undertake a review of that expenditure.  Arising from this hearing and the wishes of the Committee of Public Accounts, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, either alone or in conjunction with the Department of Health, should undertake a speedy review of that expenditure.  I think that is what is required here.  That would lead us to the minutes of the meetings and the decisions being made with the service providers and so on.  Someone was responsible for the spend of &euro;35.5 million of taxpayers' money.  We are not talking about nickels and dimes here.  It is a significant amount of money.  While I understand the new board will take it on and learn lessons, I certainly would not be satisfied without a commitment from Mr. Costello's board, from the Department of Health and from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that a review will be undertaken and that it will be done efficiently and brought back to us within a reasonable timeframe.  Deputy Costello is that where you----- </p></speech>

The public spending code pushes the responsibility for the projects onto the sanctioning authority, which is effectively the Department of Health.  In terms of the wider implications for other Departments which the Comptroller and Auditor General has pointed out, we would certainly be amenable to looking after that and trying to deal with that issue.  However, the review is a matter for the Department of Health.</p></speech>

Almost a year to the day later, on 10 August 2015, we had completed the design to a stage where we could lodge the planning application.  So that went in to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, because it comes under strategic infrastructure.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la then basically writes out to prescribed organisations, of which I think it has identified 19.  We had to issue them with copies of the application and the planning documentation.  The time period was from 10 August to last Friday, 2 October, for any members of the public to lodge observations, either in support of the project or with concerns about the project.</p></speech>

However, we are aware that about 30 of those are positive observations from people like the Liberties Business Forum, and some of the local community groups who are in support of the project and want to see it happen on the campus.

An Bord Plean&aacute;la has not confirmed that yet, but we would be surprised if it did not have an oral hearing given that the project is more complex this time because we have the satellite centre in Connolly Hospital; the satellite centre at Tallaght; that construction compound at Davitt Road to mitigate impacts; and the St. James's site.  So we actually have four different sites that are impacted by the children's hospital.  Previously the oral hearing-----</p></speech>

So we think it will probably be about three weeks of an oral hearing; it might be two, but we think two to three weeks of an oral hearing and An Bord Plean&aacute;la has said it is working to try to have a decision made by 15 February next year.</p> <p>  Obviously there has been a huge amount of engagement with, I suppose, all the stakeholders, who are many, starting, obviously, with the staff in the hospitals - the consultants, nurses and clinicians who will operate this hospital as to what will make a world-class hospital.  In the community, we have done a mail drop to 4,000 residents and we organised, I think it was, four or five drop-in sessions at the local community hall, in the F2 in Fatima, where we had our architects and design teams and boards to present what the hospital would look like.  We took on board, where we could, comments and feedback from the locals.  For example, they were concerned about the height of the balconies.  We raised the height of the balconies.  We put screening on it.  We lowered the road to reduce potential overlooking.  We took on board comments about the family accommodation unit which is for mums and dads who could be staying there for months on end.  That is not a project that is going to be funded by the HSE.  Residents in Cameron Square were concerned about the impact of that and what it might look like.  So we agreed that we would include it in our planning application.  So it is a two to four-storey building that is residential in nature and it backs on to their property.</p></speech>

It would be up.  Maybe it might be 20%.  There is not a radically different shift because a lot of the work that is done is highly specific.  If one gets all the site investigations, the bore holes, the topographic surveyors extracting the water from the ground and do the business case, that is all specific to the St. James's campus.</p></speech>

For instance, in St. James's, we share a lot of services, whether it is around facilities management, FM, clinical sterilisation or corporate services, and that impacts on the area of the building.  The more one can share, the more one keeps the cost the down.  If one moves to another location, one might have to then put those back into the building which means it is a very different design.</p></speech>

That was one of the key requirements we set the design team, that not alone had they to design the site for the children's hospital, they had to provide a minimum of 20% expansion.  We have in excess of 20% expansion.  Also, within our design, we have future-proofed that we could share an energy centre with St. James's adult campus which would be a more efficient way to have one shared energy centre and that, in turn, would free-up further capacity so we will be able to expand well beyond the 20%.</p></speech>

I suppose that was one of the risks that the board would have identified, that traffic is an issue.  This is where our partner in the project, St. James's Hospital, which wanted this project on its campus so that we eventually deliver the Holy Grail of adult services, paediatric and maternity all on the one campus, is handing over the 12 acres of land and in doing that, it will be forfeiting car parking.  At its simplest analysis, traffic is at its worst first thing in the morning and last thing in the evening.  That is when we all are going to and from work.  However, when the children's hospital opens in 2019, there will actually be 240 less car parking spaces for staff than currently exist.  Between now and 2019, a whole change in culture and behaviour will take place within the children's hospitals and within the adults'.  Public transport is there.  It is the best served hospital in the country for public transport.  By forfeiting those 240 car parking spaces off, first thing in the morning and last thing in the evening, that frees up a bit of capacity.  That is when people are coming to the outpatient services and we use up that capacity.  What the analysis shows is that we are at 5% increase at peak, morning and evening.</p></speech>

I suppose it is quite early in the project to be at the philanthropy stage.  At this stage, the proposal is that we would appoint a committee member to the children's hospital group board with expertise in philanthropy and that there would be an executive that would work with that committee to ensure that the right approach is taken from the outset to secure the right type of philanthropy that can be secured for such a project.  It is really only the starting point of philanthropy for this project.</p></speech>

We have designed it as a stand-alone building and the construction phase for that would be approximately two years.  The construction phase for the main hospital is approximately four years, so there is a potential two-year lag.  The research building would not actually need to start being constructed until two years after the children's hospital.</p></speech>
