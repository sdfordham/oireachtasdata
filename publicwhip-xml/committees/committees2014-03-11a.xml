We would like initially to describe the context of this fisheries offences point system, then we propose describing the EU obligations and finally, how this will be implemented within Ireland.</p><p>  Beginning with the context, the point system for licence holders is just one tool in a tool box to deal with non-compliances which might be detected by the sea fisheries protection officers.</p> <p>The Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority's legal obligation and primary strategy is to promote compliance and deter non-compliance for the benefit of lawful fishermen and the support of sustainable commercial fisheries.  We want to spend our days and nights at work preventing non-compliance, rather than dealing with non-compliance.  To put it another way we want to stop the behaviours of fishermen who are infringing, not to spend our time catching infringement.  So while we will focus on this system today for dealing with non-compliances, we ask the committee members to see how these points fit within an overall compliance strategy within which we operate.</p><p> A further necessary context here is that of the system of sanctions within the implementation of regulations and the pursuit of compliance.  Sanctions for non-compliances are a normal part of implementing regulations in any walk of life.  Sanctions for infringements serve two main roles; they primarily exist to deter would-be infringers from infringing in the first instance and they exist as a form of punishment for the actual infringers.  The Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority is committed to being a fair regulator and that requires a graduated and proportionate system of sanctions, reflecting the extent of wrongdoing.  We are firmly of the view that there is a substantial difference between the proverbial sheep and lamb.  Sanctions can only serve their primary deterrent purpose if they are allocated in a measured way, sparingly with maximal effect.</p><p> By way of final context, points for serious infringements are not something that should concern the law-abiding fishermen, nor the fishermen who might have a once-off minor administrative problem.  This system is something which will impact profoundly on those whose fishing vessel licence is repeatedly used to disregard in a deliberate and premeditated manner the laws of our State set down by these Houses.  From our work with the fishing Industry we are aware of the difference between those who break the rules repeatedly and deliberately as part of their business strategy and those who break the rules through poor judgment in a moment of time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-11a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrew Kinneen" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014031100004#L00200"><p>I would like to continue our chairperson's statement by giving the European context for the points system.  As a member state of the European Union, Ireland implements the Common Fisheries Policy where there exist various obligations for fishers and also for member state authorities within that regulatory framework.  For the purpose of today's discussions there are four particularly relevant European Union regulations.  I refer the committee to European Council Regulation No. 1005 of 2008 and European Council Regulation No. 1224 of 2009.</p><p>These regulations contain general provisions requiring that sanctions for fishery non-compliances should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.  The control regulation requires member states to ensure that any enforcement sanction effectively deprives those responsible for any illegal fishing of any economic benefit derived from the infringement, and that sanction take into account the value of the fishery products and-or the assessment of the impact on the fishery resource and the marine environment concerned.  The control regulation additionally sets down that one component of the required sanctioning system in the case of certain serious infringements must include the imposition of points for licence holders.  Ireland is meeting this obligation through SI 3 of 2014.</p><p>  A key part to implementation of this system is to understand what is a serious infringement.  The EU Commission established the concept of a serious infringement and a points system for serious infringements with the aim of ensuring compliance with the rules of the CFP and a level playing field in all EU waters.  Everyone is agreed that there has been an absence of a level playing field when it comes to applying sanctions to serious infringements.  There is a great variety within the member states on what sanctions are applied and how they are applied.  The European regulations therefore created a defined list of infringement categories that might be considered as serious infringement, if they are sufficiently grave.  Therefore, in order for an infringement to be considered "serious" it must fall into one of the defined categories and be sufficiently serious.</p><p>  The competent authority in the member state is required to make a judgment of the gravity taking into account criteria such as the nature of the damage to the stock, the value of the fish taken, the extent of the infringement or repetitive misbehaviour.  There are 12 categories of serious infringements which attract points.  They are listed individually.  We also have an annex, with the paper supplied, which goes into detail.  To characterise them generally they try to capture infringements where a person operates on the public resource without an entitlement; that is, the person does not have a licence, takes under-size fish or does not respect limitations, quotas and so on.  While I will not go through them individually, I ask the committee to be aware that is the general theme.    </p><p>  Each of the 12 categories is ascribed a defined number of points in the implementing rules for the control regulation.  When an infringement falls into one of those categories, and is deemed to be sufficiently grave to be regarded as a serious infringement, the authorities are obliged to allocate that number of points to the licence holder.  The annex makes a reference to the serious infringement and the points that go with it.  The number of points to be allocated is set down for each category and there is no discretion for the authorities once an infringement has been deemed serious.  The annex will provide full details of what points are applied to each of the 12 serious infringements  </p><p>  The deterrent effect of points on non-law abiding licence holders is two-fold.  There is the potential cumulative effect of points assigned.  The European Union regulations set down that when 18 points have been accumulated the licence should be suspended for a period of two months.  This is not discretionary.  The vessel would then go back to fish with those 18 points still on the licence, and any further points would result in further and longer suspension periods.  Specifically at 36 points, where another threshold is reached, there should be a further four months suspension.  If the licence continues to be associated with serious infringements the accumulation of 54 points should result in eight months suspension, and 72 points should result in a one year suspension, if repeated serious infringements continue to be associated with that licence, despite four previous suspensions, then the requirement is that the licence be permanently withdrawn.  The EU regulations set out that points remain on the licence for a period of three years after the last serious infringement.  Thus even if the points from one serious infringement are almost three years old, a subsequent serious infringement would add new points and prolong the duration of the earlier points assigned for a further three years.  There is a specific provision in the EU scheme, for licences with more than two but less than 90 points, for two points to be deleted from a licence if the vessel were to undertake to fish in certain favourable manners.  The voluntary actions which might result in this deletion are as follows. </p><p>  For example, if a fishing vessel was not obliged to carry a VMS monitoring system - smaller vessels are not so obliged - but undertook to do so, as a show of good faith that they would change their behaviours, that would be recognised.  If the licence holder volunteers the vessel for a scientific campaign to improve gear selectivity, which would obviously help conservation efforts, that would be recognised.  If the licence holder adopts a reduction of 10% fishing opportunity for a year, in other words take a hit themselves by way of pay-back for the damage caused by their misbehaviours in not complying with the CFP, that would be recognised.  If the licence holder joins an eco-labelling scheme with the focus on well-managed sustainable fisheries, that would be recognised.  The committee may be familiar with these where the Marine Stewardship Council or others go into detail on the fishing methods and the efforts made to minimise discards or to use conservation-friendly gears.  One of these voluntary methods could be used to delete two points in a three year period.    </p><p>  In addition to potential suspension or withdrawal for repeat offenders there is a further deterrent effect for licence holders subject to points.  The EU regulations set out an explicit obligation for points to accompany the licence if the vessel is sold, and for potential licence sellers to inform would-be purchasers.  In an Irish context this is relevant to the sale of fishing capacity and the sale of any capacity associated with a licence will bring the number of points with every portion of that capacity to a new licence.</p> <p>Thus there is likely to be an immediate marked effect of devaluation of the potential market value of vessel capacity with points assigned to it.  Obviously such an effect would be realised only if any of the capacity associated with the licence were to be put up for sale.</p></speech>

Some terminology used within the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, is the concept of a flag state, the state in which the vessel is registered, and the coastal state, the state which has jurisdiction over the waters in which the vessel fishes or lands.  One basic principle of the CFP is that the flag state issues licences or authorisations while the coastal state has the primary obligation for control and enforcement within its waters.  The matter of points, therefore, straddles the obligations of the coastal state and the flag state.</p><p>  Arising directly from the extent of non-Irish fishing in the Irish exclusive economic zone, EEZ, Ireland's fishery control obligations as a coastal state are far in excess of its obligations as a flag state.  SI 3 of 2014 covers all vessels fishing in waters under Irish jurisdiction and Irish vessels wherever they fish.  Thus three scenarios arise: Irish vessels with serious infringements in Irish waters; non-Irish vessels with serious infringements in Irish waters; and Irish vessels with serious infringements in non-Irish waters.  The process begins with the detection of an infringement by a sea-fisheries protection officer, usually an officer of SFPA or the Naval Service.  This typically takes place during an inspection at sea or at landing, but might also arise in the context of administrative cross checks, for example fishing logbook data against vessel monitoring system, VMS, data or fish sales records.  SFPA is then required to assess if the infringement is serious.  This is determined by whether it is within one of the categories and is sufficiently grave.</p><p>  If an infringement is deemed serious, SFPA would then notify the licence holder of that decision and the resultant intention to assign the associated number of points.  At this stage, there exists a decision by SFPA, an associated proposal to apply points to that licence and a notification of that proposal.  No points have yet been assigned.  The licence holder can appeal this decision within 21 days of the notification by SFPA.  The statutory instrument provides for a specific appeals officer, the administration of which is a matter for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The appeal should normally be decided within 28 days.  If the appeal is upheld then the points will not be assigned.  If the appeals period expires, or the appeal is not upheld, then the proposal to assign points stands.  SFPA would then inform the licensing authority of the flag state of the occurrence of the serious infringement and the associated need for the assignment of points to that licence.</p><p>  Non-Irish vessels in Irish waters are subject to the same procedure, with notification by SFPA to the flag state authority of the intention to assign points, notification to the licence holder or skipper of the intention to assign points and, if exercised, the right of appeal by the non-Irish licence holder to the Irish appeals officer.  Following that process the SFPA would inform the licensing authority of that flag state of the points to be assigned to that licence.</p><p>  The third category mentioned at the outset, an Irish vessel in non-Irish waters, is also provided for in the statutory instrument, whereby SFPA, upon notification by the coastal state of a serious infringement by an Irish vessel outside of Irish waters, would inform the Irish licensing authority of the points to be assigned.  In that context, the natural justice and appeals considerations rest with the coastal state, and SFPA would act only following the expiration or exhaustion of those.</p><p>  A key consideration in all of this is the assessment of whether an infringement within one of the 12 categories is deemed by SFPA to be serious or not.  We are emphatically of the view that sanctions have maximal effect if they are used in a proportionate manner.  Would-be offenders should be aware that more serious infringements have more serious consequences.  Accordingly, SFPA has drafted procedures to inform this decision-making process.  Our priority is to have a system that minimises subjectivity and maximises consistency, fairness and probity, and ensures a proportionate outcome.</p><p>  We specifically envisage the assessment of seriousness to rest with an internal multi-person group, which might include representatives of the Naval Service and-or other expertise where appropriate.  We have taken legal advice on our draft procedures and we await final outcomes of those considerations.  The statutory instrument provides for publication of guidance around criteria under which the level seriousness is assessed and we intend doing so once we have finalised them.</p><p>  The decision to regard an infringement as serious, and thereby liable to the assignment of points to the licence, is a separate process to all other sanctions that may apply.  It may well be the case that, in addition to points for the licence holder, a prosecution of the skipper might also be considered appropriate in the case of serious infringements.  That decision would follow the presentation of a case file to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Such a prosecution would take its own due course through the Irish courts and might result in conviction or acquittal of the skipper, but the decision to apply points to the licence holder would stand regardless of such outcomes.</p></speech>

It is our aim that this tool be applied fairly and to the benefit of the Irish fishing industry.  This system will protect the valuable Irish marine resource by stopping repeat offenders.  We are conscious of the responsibility this extra tool brings with it and we aim to be transparent, fair and proportionate in our workings within the system.  In a time of limited staff resources the implementation of this system is a challenge for the SFPA but in the journey to compliance this is an extremely important tool.  We welcome the committee's feedback and comments.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-11a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1123" speakername="Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014031100005#M00500"><p>I welcome the members of SFPA.  Is it expected that this new system will run concurrently with or in addition to the current criminal sanctions in place?  The European Commission wants to move towards a more even system across the EU and this is probably a step in that direction with Ireland going down that road.  Ireland is probably one of the only European countries, particularly the maritime jurisdictions, which relies predominantly on criminal as opposed to administrative sanctions.  Spain and Portugal use predominantly administrative sanctions.  Spain is one of the biggest fishing communities in the EU.  The Minister acknowledged in the Seanad that there is a Bill which might be incorporated into new legislation.  Has there been any discussion between the authority and the Department officials on the drafting of that legislation?</p><p>  Has SFPA any view on whether it will be more advantageous given the new penalty points system in place across Europe and whether Ireland should follow quickly by bringing in legislation to have a layer of medium level, administrative sanctions rather than a sea-fisheries protection officer going out?  The sea fisheries protection officer can issue a warning but is precluded from issuing an on-the-spot fine.  The case must ultimately go to court, even for a relatively minor infraction.  Then there is the additional consequence of the gear and the catch being confiscated.  There are additional penalties and the court fine.  The District Court can deal with only certain cases because it depends on the catch and the gear, and it clogs up the court system.  There is a multitude of issues.</p><p>  There is a need to be very harsh and severe on serious fishing infractions because it is a natural resource and if there are vessels out there that are flouting the law they must be dealt with aggressively.  However, there are relatively minor offences such as having a few extra boxes of fish on board and markings not being right, and they are referred to in this statutory instrument.  What is SFPA's view on that?</p> <p>The witnesses may not have with them today figures on the number of confiscations and infractions dealt with by the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority in 2012 and 2013.  Perhaps they did not expect this question.  If the information is not available perhaps it can be passed on to the committee later.  Would the witnesses foresee more buy-in from fishermen if a medium layer existed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-11a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014031100006#N00200"><p>The witnesses stated they would welcome feedback and comments.  I see this as another nail in the coffin of Irish fishermen and women.  Every debate we have had since I came to the House in 2002 has been about regulation and the criminalisation of fishermen and women.  Now it is about penalty points, or whatever one wants to call this.  No Government has ever dealt with the problems facing fishing communities, which are a lack of quota, the fact the initial negotiations were disastrous and the continuous attempt to criminalise the industry and the decent and honourable people who brave the elements to feed their families.  This is a continuation of it.  It will make it more and more difficult for people to remain in the industry.</p><p>  At the start of our meeting we had a discussion on the situation facing the inshore fleet and fishermen.  People have not been to sea since the second week of December.  They have no income whatsoever.  They cannot obtain social welfare because they are categorised as self-employed.  Some crew members have had to go to community welfare officers with cap in hand to try to get a few bob to feed their families.  Today we have heard about more restrictions on people trying to put food on the table.</p><p>  I have known fishermen all my life.  I have been part of the industry.  I know very few who would be considered cowboys.  The overwhelming majority are honourable and decent people and they are being ground down by successive Governments which have failed in their responsibility to protect an industry which could be so beneficial.  I have been critical of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority in the past.  My judgment has not changed with regard to what has been presented today.</p><p>  The witnesses stated their priority is to have a system which minimises subjectivity.  The implementation of these rules is subjective and it is up to an SFPA officer to decide whether an offence is serious or not.  A person's livelihood is determined by the subjectivity of the officer in question.  In many areas there has not been a very good relationship between the SFPA and the fishing community.  I do not cast any aspersions on any individual member of the SFPA, which initially was charged with a responsibility without any terms of reference.  We spent three years trying to find out to whom the SFPA was accountable, and we had to drag the information out of the Minister and the Department.  For years we were told the SFPA was accountable to nobody but now we have found out it is accountable to this committee. </p><p>  It was stated this is one tool in the box.  What are the other tools the SFPA has in mind with regard to infringements?  As I stated, whether an infringement is serious is subjective.  Is it deemed serious by an individual SFPA member or does the matter go to a committee?  It was stated that points stay on licences for three years after the last infringement.  I do not believe anyone here does not have penalty points for driving.  Three years after the actual infringement the penalty points are removed.  What the witnesses have stated is these penalty points will remain on the licence for three years after the most recent infringement.  This makes no sense.  It makes the bloody thing worse.  If somebody decides to sell his or her boat and licence the penalty points will be transferred to the purchaser.  What guilt is associated with somebody who buys a licence that he or she must take penalty points for an infringement by a prior owner?  It is an absolute disgrace how this can be stood over and defended.</p><p>  One has 21 days to appeal a decision.  What access does one have to the courts?  Nothing in it states one has access to the courts.  Even if one had access to the courts what fisherman or woman could afford to go to the High Court to challenge a decision taken by the SFPA?  Where would they get the resources if such recourse is available to them?  How could they afford to pay a barrister and a solicitor when they cannot put bread on the table?  It is another effort to destroy what is left of a very small and shrinking industry.  It will do absolutely nothing to protect the rights and entitlements of our coastal and fishing communities.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-11a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1001" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014031100006#N00300"><p>I thank the members of the SFPA for their presentation.  Penalty points have become accepted throughout the country with regard to driving offences.  It is a concept which people can understand.  I agree with much of what Deputy Ferris stated on the difficulties faced by the fishing industry with regard to keeping itself going and people continuing to make a living.  I have some concerns about the regulations produced and I have a number of questions on them.</p><p>  In the presentation it was stated the reason the Commission will introduce the penalty points system is to ensure compliance and a level playing field in all EU waters.  This is a Commission regulation instructing the implementation of these penalty points.  Will they be introduced in all coastal states simultaneously?  Will they all come into effect in each coastal state at the same time?  Are we sure if a non-Irish vessel is allocated penalty points here that they will be allocated by the coastal state to which the vessel belongs?  How do the witnesses see this working and what systems are in place to ensure it will work on an EU-wide level?  In the past it has been notoriously difficult to obtain information from other coastal states on the quota situation for vessels fishing here and to properly implement the Common Fisheries Policy regulations on such vessels.  This has led to a situation where approximately 85% of boardings and inspections by the SFPA take place on Irish vessels.  In my opinion it is more likely to stop vessels on which it has quota information rather than inspecting a vessel on which it has absolutely no quota information.</p><p>  It was stated the system would minimise subjectivity and would maximise consistency, fairness and probity.  Concern has been expressed to me about the variation in how individual fisheries officers treat boat owners and boats during inspections.  The individual fisheries officer conducting the inspection will not have the right to assign the points.</p> <p>I wonder how the three-person committee from the SFPA will operate.  What information will be available to the assigning body in the SFPA?  Will the fact that there are points on the licence be a factor in determining the seriousness of the issue?  Will there be due process for a person to whom points are assigned?</p><p> The witnesses referred in the presentation to prosecutions that took place outside the penalty points system.  This is also covered in the regulations section under matters relating to points assigned.  If a person has been assigned penalty points for an offence that is under investigation and then is prosecuted for a criminal offence but the court finds that no offence has taken place, the points assigned remain on the licence.  I think that is totally contrary to natural justice.  That should not be in the regulations.  If one is of the opinion that this is set out to punish fishermen who have been targeted, this section would show that this is the case.  It is beyond any form of justice that somebody found innocent of an offence would retain on his or her licence the points assigned for the offence.  I would like the witnesses comment on that.</p><p> I have not seen the reference to the criminal offences in the Commission regulations, and I wonder where the authority comes from.  However, what is covered in the Commission regulations - and the SFPA probably has no leeway in this regard - is that a person to whom a licence with penalty points is transferred or who buys a licence with penalty points retains the penalty points on the licence.  It is not the vessel that has caused the offence, but the owner or skipper who has committed the offence.  It seems bizarre that the penalty points should be transferred with the vessel and the fishing effort.  Somebody with a clean record could buy a vessel or a fishing effort that has 34 points against it.  If the person gets two more points in the following six months, he or she faces suspension.  I do not think that is just.  Will the witnesses set out the rationale for that?</p><p> When I saw the list of offences set out in the Commission document it seemed clear-cut, and I find it strange that it could be subjective.  Subjectivity leaves it open for one person to have points assigned while somebody else does not.  It would not be transparent.  I would be interested to hear how the procedures protect the SFPA from alleged subjectivity.</p></speech>

Has the SFPA conducted a survey of fishermen to establish their views on the Commission document and whether it is a good idea?  If a survey has been conducted, does the SFPA have the results?  If not, will it undertake to survey fishermen on it?</p><p>  The regulations must work for ordinary fishermen.  I know that one of the most significant problems faced by those in agriculture is that penalties might have been applied harshly.  Fishermen, like farmers, should not go around in fear but need to be encouraged.  I believe a level of discretion is required.  Let me comment on some of the points raised in the presentation.  Mr. Kinneen stated: &quot;The control regulation requires member states to ensure that any enforcement sanction effectively deprives those responsible for any illegal fishing of any economic benefit derived from the infringement, and that sanction take into account the value of the fishery products...&quot;  Does that mean the value to the fisherman or the value of the product landed onshore?  There are 12 categories of serious infringement.  I do not know the definition of &quot;valid licence&quot;.  Is fishing without a valid licence a minor or serious infringement?  In the course of the presentation he referred to concealing, tampering with and disposing of evidence.  Would that be obvious, or is it possible that a fisherman might forget to hand up something?  I do not like the reference to a fisherman who has obstructed the work of officials.  I know what it means - that a fisherman has deliberately obstructed an official - but I have seen officials who would consider that they know the outcome before they investigate the situation.  It drives me nuts when I see somebody do this.  I am not casting aspersions on anybody, but that is the point I am trying to make.  Is there a code of conduct for inspectors?  Is it updated regularly, and has the SFPA surveyed fishermen to find out whether they are happy with the code of conduct and whether they feel it is working with them or against them?</p><p>  The points remain on a licence for three years, which is a very long time.  I feel the system could be reviewed if it is found not to be working.  Is it meant to be a slap on the hand to remind a person to move back into line?  I believe a three-year period is too much.  If a licence holder invests in monitoring systems or green provisions for his vessel, this will cost extra money.  They have been fined, and while a two-point reduction is slight, I think it could be a little higher.  However, I completely disagree with the retention of the points on the licence when the vessel is sold.  Do the sons bear the sins of the fathers?</p><p>  Is there equity between states, and does this fall within the remit of the ombudsman?  The fear is that the SFPA will be investigating itself.  That is a concept that has been under scrutiny.  I am uneasy about the regulations because I do not like to see regulations that could be burdensome.  I would not like to be associated with adding more hassle to the life of a person who is trying to make a living.  I agree with Senator<b></b>&Oacute; Domhnaill on the need for an intermediate layer so that an infringement could be dealt with immediately without having to go to court.</p><p>  Does the SFPA have a log of all the vessels it inspected in 2013?  I want to establish whether some vessels are targeted and face frequent investigations.  Are some vessels stopped every week or month while others are virtually not inspected at all?  I have examples of this in another area in which I have worked.  The frequency of calls tells an observer what is happening.  In the analysis of vessels that were stopped last year, how many of these incidents led to convictions?  Did a judge make a statement that it had gone too far?  Before the SFPA asks for more powers in this regard, we need to know that the application of the rules is fair.  I must qualify my comments by saying that I am not involved in the fishing industry, so if some of the points I have made seem totally off the wall, I ask that I be given some leeway.</p></speech>

This statutory instrument is applying EU law and any measure that applies EU law must be compatible with the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  Under the justice provisions of the charter, anyone whose rights and freedom are violated has a right to an effective remedy - that is, a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal previously established by law.</p> <p>The administration of the appeals mechanism is a matter for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Is the mechanism sufficiently independent to satisfy the charter, given that the appeals officer answers to the Minister and the enforcement body answers to the same Minister?  </p></speech>

I welcome Dr. Steele, Mr. Kinneen and Mr. O'Mahony to the meeting.</p><p>  I will commence by making a general point.  The sea fishing industry has dealt with the SFPA for some time.  It could be acknowledged that they got off to a rocky start but now they share a mutual respect.  The industry has respect for the work done by the SFPA and the authority has respect for what the industry must go through in terms of regulation and its work environment.  It is also important for the delegation to confirm - and I hope it is true - that the instrument does not confirm any new infringement or illegality.  The fishing industry is very familiar with the infringements that they must work with and avoid.</p><p>  I have read the instrument and have been left with quite a few questions and concerns.  It is necessary, in a European context, to level the playing field between Irish vessels and visiting fleets.  Nothing drives people more apoplectic than the overseeing of these regulations.  However, there is a perception - rightly or wrongly - that the Irish fleet has been dealt with more harshly than visiting fleets.  That may not be true.  I know that most of the arrests and detentions relate to visiting fleets or vessels.  All fishermen want a level playing field and an ability to compete with visiting fleets as equals, under the regulations.  </p><p>  I shall outline an issue that has been touched on already.  Options are available to the SFPA with respect to how it enforces infringements, if detected.  There may be a court procedure if points are applied.  Anybody is entitled to go through the courts to have his or her rights vindicated.  I am concerned, however, that the points still apply even if a master is found innocent by the courts.  Has the SFPA taken legal advice on natural justice regarding the matter? Has it taken advice from the Attorney General?  Does the authority expect the matter to be tested?</p><p>  Up to now, when an infringement occurred it was open to the SFPA to go to either the District Court or the Circuit Court.  There was no other choice; the master would have to make a court appearance.  I am unclear whether it is the master of the vessel or the capacity that will now be penalised.  Will capacity be measured by tonnage or kilowatts?  How will the penalty be administered?  Will it involve the sale of portions of the capacity or fractionalisation?  As mentioned in the presentation, the move would have a detrimental effect on the market value of the capacity.  In the past it was the master of the vessel who was penalised for an infringement.  There has been a sea change in who bears the penalty for an irresponsible fishing activity.  Is the SFPA concerned in this regard?</p><p>  How will competent authorities in other countries administer penalty points?  Clearly, we may not ever see a visiting vessel again if it is assigned points.  Will it accumulate points, while it is in European Union waters, if it has an irresponsible master?  Will the SFPA or the Department be notified when further infringements or points are assigned to the vessel?  It is important that the Irish fishing industry is clear that this is not just a matter for it to deal with.  The way the matter is dealt with is critically important.</p><p>  I want to touch on a sensitive issue that can be subjective.  For example, one could step on board a vessel and claim that one fish is undersized, and, as such, represents an offence.  Nobody will say it is a serious offence, but what if somebody does?  What if an SFPA official decides that it is an offence?  What if there is a pre-determined issue, as mentioned before?  The fishing industry is small.  The SFPA officers, the naval officers and those in the industry are familiar with each other and I do not have to explain the analogy.  Where are the safeguards?  What happens if an over-zealous official or somebody else steps beyond the subjectivity and natural justice that has been referred to in the presentation and the regulations?  That is a great concern of mine.</p><p>  I am very unclear about the possibility or probability of points being deleted over a period.  The matter was only touched on in the presentation.  We are all familiar with the provision in the Road Traffic Acts whereby points can be deleted after a period.  The matter is unclear in terms of these regulations.  Is it possible or likely?  It has been mentioned that good behaviour and proactive measures can be undertaken by a master, but the issue still seems very difficult.  </p><p>  With regard to court procedures, it is open to the SFPA to refer a matter to the District or Circuit Court.  Is there a possibility that these regulations will be tied in with the proposal?  The matter is in the programme for Government, and a Bill to amend the sea fisheries legislation on administrative sanctions is scheduled to be taken during this session of the D&aacute;il.  Will it determine how the SFPA works with the industry?  It all boils down to how the regulations can be notified to the industry and whether they will give it confidence that there will be justice and equality in how it is dealt with, not the opposite.</p></speech>

With regard to the last point made by the Deputy, the heads of the proposed legislation may come before the committee, which will form part of our work programme.  The members of the delegation have been asked a series of specific questions.  They have also been asked to comment on opinions, but I am not sure whether they want to do so.</p><p>  I seek clarification on the list of 12 offences that are subject to the penalty points system.  What power or jurisdiction, if any, has the SFPA currently got over non-Irish vessels found guilty of any of those infractions?  What additional information sharing is envisaged upon implementation of the statutory instrument?  The witnesses can answer the queries as they see fit.  Perhaps Dr. Steele could commence.</p></speech>

The message from the SFPA is that we understand the hardships in the fishing industry.  We understand the difficulties with the weather in recent months and we understand the problems in the industry.  In any shared resources it is important to have fair and effective seeking of compliance.  The role of the SFPA is key in this area.  We will go through the questions and take them in order.  I will pass to Mr. Andrew Kinneen and Mr. Miche&aacute;l O'Mahony.  I thank the Senator who asked how points can be assigned and yet there can be a different outcome in the courts.  I will hand over to Mr. Miche&aacute;l O'Mahony.  The key issue is that our job as a regulator is not the writing of the SI but the enforcement of the SI.</p></speech>

I do not want to generalise the questions but to pick recurring themes and that was certainly one.  These points apply in parallel to the current system of criminal sanctions.  They exist independently of those criminal sanctions.  That is what is set out explicitly in the SI.  That is a Government decision.  It is the decision of the Department which wrote the SI, taking direct advice from the Attorney General's office on that specific matter.  It is reasonable to question the validity of that approach.  It is what is on the Statute Book.  It has not been tested yet and is quite explicit.</p><p>  By way of direct answer to the question posed initially by Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill as to how these points relate to the current criminal code, they exist in parallel.  It may well be that the licence holder is at home in bed when the infringement occurs.  Before the SI was put in place, the system was for the skipper potentially to face a criminal sanction for the infringement that occurred with the vessel.  Now a further party, the licence holder, is brought into the sanctioning system.  The reason that is the case is that there is an explicit obligation in the EU regulation which provides that the member state shall establish a points system to sanction the licence holder.  They are brought into the loop explicitly by the EU regulations and this SI gives effect to that and the SFPA's statutory obligation is to implement the SI.  I hope that answers the direct question about the separateness of the two processes.</p></speech>

Currently there is no provision in Irish law to apply administrative sanctions to fisheries offences.  That is a general statement.  I understand that it is under consideration as the Chairman has said.  What comes to pass will obviously come to the SFPA in our role as a regulator and so on.  We have spoken to colleagues in our parent Department on this subject.  We have offered examples in other member states where we have seen this type of administrative sanction work successfully and we have also tried to point out some of the pitfalls where in other member states it is rubber-stamping misbehaviours on the part of certain fishermen and they continue with impunity and their misbehaviours.  We have tried to offer that information in discussions with our colleagues.  We await the outcome of the work of the Oireachtas and what might come out of it.  Obviously, we will be faithful to whatever comes out of the statute.  We are mindful for the full suite of tools that are appropriate when trying to get a fishing industry to work with very complex technical regulations and to manage a shared public resource.</p><p>  We were asked what other strategies or tools are in the box.  We try to speak to fishermen and we try to listen to them.  We have had a number of what I would characterise as "town hall" style meetings.  These have been very successful engagements with fishermen on the concerns they have, particularly with new regulations or aspects of the regulations or aspects of our behaviour as regulators.  We have a code of standards with regard to inspections and how we carry them out.  It has not been updated recently but I take the point made and it is an issue we will look at.  We have the benefit of a consultative committee which advises us on the burden of regulation.  That committee is made up of individuals from all sectors of the industry, fishing industry, aquaculture, primary fishing industry, inshore and so on, appointed by the Minister.  The committee advise us on the burden of regulation and feedback from the industry on how we are doing our work.  I am pleased to hear the acknowledgment from one Deputy that we have managed to develop a better relationship with many of the people we are trying to work for in that regard.</p><p>  With regard to administrative sanctions, we are aware of their benefit and aware of some of the pitfalls in it.  With regard to the points system, the idea behind it is that where some member states are operating administrative sanctions without having any dissuasive effect on illegal fishing, the points would apply and make repeated misbehaviour become a serious issue where the primary licence of the vessel comes into play.  That is the level playing field effect that the regulation seeks to satisfy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-11a.28" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Miche&aacute;l O'Mahony" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014031100009#Q00400"><p>One of the recurring themes has been that of subjectivity and analogies with the road traffic points with which we might have greater familiarity.  In our view, analogies with the road traffic points system are generally unhelpful in this context and are generally misleading.  The road traffic points are for minor infringements with decision making power at the roadside, frequently in lieu of prosecution and with concepts such as double or quit, or double or nothing, if one appeals.  None of those things apply here.</p><p>  These points are for serious infringements.  They have no impact whatsoever on the likelihood of a prosecution.  We do not envisage any pier-side decision making ability.  We have been given one number of points to apply for a serious infringement - we cannot double or quits that.  It is a fixed obligation in the EU regulation.  We are happy to answer questions but some of the questions appear to be drawing analogies from the road traffic points system which is possibly not the best way of looking at these points.  These points are for serious infringement, they are for a different spectrum of infringements.  We have talked about the administrative sanctions, concepts which should apply at that lower order infringement.  This is for the serious infringements.  As a member state, Ireland is specifically obliged to have a dissuasive system of sanctioning that should explicitly include a points system for licence holders.</p><p>  The subject of appeals and natural justice was raised frequently.  The decision in writing the SI, taking direct advice from the Attorney General's office, particularly around the wherewithal of an individual fisher to challenge the bureaucracy of the State, was to have an accessible appeals system.  The decision was to have a specific appeals officer provided for within with the SI.  That appeals officer is designed around accessibility as opposed to invoking the machinery of the courts and the expense of that machinery, to provide an accessible and natural justice recourse for the fishermen.  No points will be applied until the fisherman has had recourse to that natural justice.  There will be notification with intent to apply and then a right to appeal that intent.  That is what is envisaged.  There is a specific mention of the potential of going to the High Court.  However, we do not see that as being realistic for individual fishers but it is in place should they remain dissatisfied.</p> <p>The policy decision has been to put in place this accessible appeals officer.  The provision certainly gives recourse to natural justice.  This appears to be the case at the outset, at least, but it has not yet been tested.</p><p> The independence of the points procedures from the criminal court proceedings, if they arise, represents a policy decision made on the best advice from the Office of the Attorney General.  It is not something that comes from the SFPA.  It is a considered decision.  The points stand alone.  The skipper and licence holder are regarded as separate and there are obligations within EU regulations that are being implemented separately in regard to them.  They have not yet been tested or challenged.</p></speech>

We are conscious that we are accountable to this committee, and are very happy to be so.  As members know, we will always appear on request or by any other means.  We have made a formal statement to the committee on our wish to be proportionate and apply this measure correctly.  It will be a disaster if we make a mess of it.  If we increase the sense of injustice within the fishing industry, our chances of promoting compliance and getting people to stick to the regulations will be greatly diminished.</p><p>  Beyond the points appeals mechanism, there is a complaints officer handling the work of the SFPA in the application of its statutory functions.  I refer to the section 49 complaints officer.  The mechanism is open to any member of the industry who believes we have used the very real powers ascribed to us incorrectly or inappropriately.  This form of recourse is independent of the legal route.  The legal route is always available as it is the independent right of every citizen.  One can question or protest over the manner in which we do our work.  We are very mindful of that.</p><p>  As Mr. O&rsquo;Mahony says, this particular statutory instrument came into law in January, and it is now early in March.  As far as we are aware, no serious infringement has been detected since it was put in place.</p></speech>

Particularly in the context of the SFPA, all people who fish inside the Irish 200-mile limit, regardless of nationality, are covered.  Therefore, we have a duty of responsibility to ensure they are complaint with the CFP.</p><p>  The danger of subjectivity and bias was referred to.  Subjectivity comes into play because there is a prescribed schedule of offences.  Where the non-recording of fish is concerned, one might be talking about the non-recording of 20 tonnes of fish or a box of fish.  The offence is the same in Community law but it is the dual quality of being listed as both a serious infringement and a grave offence that comes into play.  This is where the element of subjectivity applies.  One offence relates to markings on a fishing vessel.  There is a huge difference between a 100-m vessel operating 50 miles off our coast without markings that can be identified by the Naval Service or Air Corps and an inshore fishing boat that has not got a bit of paint on the wheelhouse.  The offences are the same under Community law but the gravity is totally different in each case.  That is why there must be a system of evaluation.  That is the thinking on subjectivity.  There is a fairly well-defined framework in Community law and in the statutory instrument on how we should operate.  The points to which I refer are ones in respect of which people may appeal our decisions, and they may do so if we have not followed procedure.</p><p>  As we said in our opening statement, we are drafting our procedures and trying to get the right expertise around the table such that we will consistently make the correct and proportionate decisions.  We will be putting those on our website so there will be no cloak-and-dagger activity behind closed doors.  That is the intention.  We are not at the final stage of publishing those at present.</p><p>  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill asked for statistics.  We do not have the exact statistics on detentions.  There are between 20 and 30 per year.</p><p>  Deputy Barry asked a very interesting question on how often we inspect a particular vessel and the outcomes.  In the past, we had a repetitive system of inspection of vessels, not only in Ireland.  Irish vessels come into Irish ports, and Castletownbere vessels come into Castletownbere.  Therefore, there is repetition.  We are now entering a system of risk-based inspection.  This is a very important era for us as an inspection service.  We are not making this up; it is coming to us through the same control regulations that result in all such arrangements.  We will have to examine indicators under the remote monitoring mechanisms to determine whether a vessel is fishing in a closed area or whether its behaviour is not consistent with that of the rest of the fleet.  We are obliged to show we are targeting that type of vessel rather than making the easy choice of meeting somebody who comes to port.  These sorts of measures are entering the system at present.</p></speech>

Detail was sought on why there is a period of three years, why certain obstructions are included and why the three-year clock suddenly gets reset when there is a new serious infringement.  The answer to all of these questions is that this is what is laid out in the EU regulation; there is no discretion whatsoever given to us.  I can read out the relevant parts of the regulations.  On the three-year period, it is stated, &ldquo;If the holder of a fishing licence does not commit, within three years from the date of the last serious infringement, another serious infringement, all points on the fishing licence shall be deleted.&rdquo;  Therefore, the three-year clock results in a complete reset, regardless of the-----</p></speech>

In the case of fisheries, it is proposed that the period should begin from the date of commission of the last in a series of offences.</p></speech>

The sea fisheries and maritime jurisdiction (amendment) Bill, whose heads will probably be referred to this committee, is to provide for a points system for skippers of fishing vessels found to have infringed the CFP and to introduce fixed penalty notices for minor offences.  As I understand it, the statutory instrument concerns serious offences, but the discretion that might be included in the amending legislation might involve a system more akin to the penalty points system applicable to road traffic, whereby points are eliminated after two years.  If one accumulates 12 over a certain period, one is off the road.  Perhaps such a system for minor offences can be applied in the fishing industry.</p><p>  I asked what sanction exists for non-Irish fishing vessels in the context of the serious offences that are included in respect of the 12 awardable points.</p></speech>

Mr. Kinneen is happy to take that key question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-11a.42" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrew Kinneen" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014031100011#S00200"><p>I might sweep up a couple of other aspects and perhaps Mr. O'Mahony will support me on this one.</p><p>  As I stated earlier, we have an obligation for the behaviour of all those fishing inside the 200 mile limit of the State.  We have a responsibility to see that they are compliant with the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy.  That gives us jurisdiction in terms of exercising control or regulation of those fishing vessels and that is achieved through co-operation with the Naval Service, the Air Corps and work we do in the ports, and also through the evaluation of fisheries data streams that come to us.  We are now getting electronic logbook data streams, vessel position data streams and shared intelligence from other member states on aspects of fishing, etc.  There is also a Community-wide system in place for the reporting of infringements under IUU regulation, which is another area we should not go into.</p><p>  A member of the committee asked how will we be sure that other member states will apply the points that should be applied, and it is a good question.  First, when we detect an infringement by a fishing vessel under the flag of another member state and it satisfies the criteria for a serious infringement, we will formally inform that member state.  In other words, there will be a written record of that.  The Commission is anxious that there would be a level of transparency to see that the member states comply with the requirements of this and in this regard, the European Fisheries Control Agency has a central role.  One of its statutory mandates is to ensure a level playing field in fisheries in Europe.  We participate in the administrative work of that agency and it would be one of the questions on which we will ensure there is a high level of transparency because we are on a hiding to nothing if we do not have that as such.</p></speech>

Even if the infringement was in Irish waters and we were the assignor of the points, the non-Irish national register of infringements should indicate the presence of those points.  That is what is written in the regulation.</p><p>  One of the issues we have brought before this committee previously is this issue of inter-member state transparency.  In our submission on reform of the Common Fisheries Policy, one of the items we hit as hard as we could was this issue of transparency.  The DG MARE - European Commission - goes to every member state auditing their compliance with the CFP obligations and those reports are only made available to the member states.  That is completely different from what is done on the other side of our house, the food safety side of the house, where the European Commission comes to the member state, audits the compliance of the member state and then publishes that on the Internet in the public domain.  We believe there should be transparency in those reporting structures.  It is something for which we have been looking for some time.  We believe that would allow us to then answer more directly the committee's questions as to what is happening in the other member states.</p></speech>

Does the authority intend to or has it had any consultation with the industry, either through the producer organisations or the publications, or how does it propose to bring to the attention of the industry the effects of this statutory instrument?  How will the introduction of electronic logbooks impact with respect to the statutory instrument in terms of the international dimension to this?</p><p>  If the authority finds that a person has amassed so many penalty points that his or her licence is permanently withdrawn, does that mean that such capacity is taken from the fleet as well?  Is that clearly set out in the statutory instrument or is it intended to do that?  In such circumstances, would the fleet reduce by that capacity, or what would happen to such capacity?</p></speech>

I will start by addressing the question on the communications process.  In any type of change like this, a clear communications process is vital.  When our internal procedures are clarified and finalised we will use different methods of communicating with the industry.  It will be done through publication of those and through a good deal of information that will be given by the officers on the ground directly to the fishing industry.  That will occur and then there will be a series of articles and information sessions that will tie in with that.  It will go through a communication process, once it is finalised.  It is very important to us.</p><p>  I note Deputy Ferris has left and I was going to answer his question about what are the other tools in the toolbox.  Sanctions are at the very far end of enforcement.  We would work out ways through education, communication and working with the fishing industry.  Nobody wants to be in a position where we would have to impose sanctions and enforcement actions but, unfortunately, in some cases it is a vital method.  I was going to list those in terms of the toolbox but I would point out that communication about this measure will be one of the tools in the toolbox.</p><p> Mr. O'Mahony might respond to the question on the electronic reporting system, ERS, and  logbooks.</p></speech>

If one does not record one's catch on the ERS and it is deemed to be a serious non-recording, that would be subject to the assigning of points.  To answer the Deputy's question directly, I do not see the ERS as being a particular driver of points.</p></speech>

We have been very active in driving compliance by Irish and non-Irish vessels in the Irish exclusive economic zone.  I can emphatically state that it is the standard in the Irish EEZ.  We do not have any tolerance for any vessel not using the electronic log book system in the Irish EEZ, subject to logbook requirements.</p></speech>

If an appeal were not upheld or if the decision to assign points stands, we would notify the licensing authority, which is an independent authority within the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, of those points.  The licensing authority would assign those points and would then deal with the outcomes should they arise.  We cannot answer that particular question.  I would point out that the only way that this points system gets to that endgame is by repeated serious infringements, even if one has been put off the water once, twice or three times.  Withdrawal of a fishing licence is continually used in the case of serious infringements.  The outcome the Deputy mentioned is one that would follow repeated serious infringements and not one into which anyone could simply stumble.</p></speech>

You raised a concern that the list of offences and offenders would be publicly available in the same way across Europe, so that knowledge sharing would not be just subject to the information on a particular member state, and that is vitally important for this system to be applied in an even-handed way and to be seen to applied as such.  There is often a feeling that we can be good boys and be compliant, while others do something different and get away with it.  For example, a vessel that has been put off the water for two periods because it has accumulated 36 points is back in Irish waters and we might not know that, nor might the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority know that, which is very important.</p><p>  It is a fairly significant statutory instrument.  It has a lot of implications for the Irish fleet.  That what why we asked the witnesses to attend the committee.  I thank you for your full, frank and very knowledgeable insight into the statutory instrument, by way of your opening statements and subsequent answers to questions and queries that have been asked by members of the committee.  I should have stated at the start that this is Ms Steele's first time before an Oireachtas committee as chairperson, and I wish you well.  The privilege warning at the start is part and parcel of what we have to do in every meeting.  Members genuinely appreciate your contribution and assistance.</p><p>  We will be keeping a watching brief on this.  We would like to get publication of the procedures when they are finalised, as well as the methodology of the appeals process.   I know the name is already available.  When the heads of the Bill are being published, we may write to you or ask you to attend to engage with us on it.  Commitments were made that minor offences would be decriminalised and the penalty points system seems to be a reasonable way to address that.  Thank you once again.</p></speech>

At present, we can see the budget for Forf&aacute;s, given that it is a separate agency of the Department, and we can decipher how much of the budget is being spent on independent research.

Will we still see a research line in the Department, that is, what the Department has spent on its internal research?  The Department is acquiring a very qualified and talented bunch of people.  Will they still be able to do the type of research that Forf&aacute;s did and will they still be in a position to challenge the Department from within the Department?  Will we see what resources they have to do that?</p></speech>

We will continue to maintain the approach that has existed with Forf&aacute;s and, indeed, is adopted by other Departments such as the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform whereby certain studies can be published that do not reflect or do not necessarily reflect the views of the Minister.  We are retaining the scope to publish independent research.  That is one of the strengths we wish to retain.  That has been clearly signalled in the way this integration is occurring.  There will be an independent voice and independent reporting.  That is also being copperfastened by the continuing role of Forf&aacute;s in servicing the National Competitiveness Council, NCC, which will provide reports on competitiveness independently of the Government.  We have strengthened that this year by providing that each quarter the NCC will present a report on competitiveness to the Cabinet committee on economic recovery and jobs which will include more detailed policy areas where there is a belief that these need to be addressed.</p><p>  In terms of presentation of the accounts of the Department, the policy unit will have a certain allocation in terms of staff and so forth but we would not usually set out separate headings for individual units.  The non-pay budget of Forf&aacute;s is already in the Department's research and consultancy part of the overall budget, so we do not intend to separate them.  Obviously, however, we would have information available to Deputies on the strategic policy unit and its activities.  Clearly, the line sections of the Department overseeing Enterprise Ireland, EI, the Industrial Development Agency, IDA, or Science Foundation Ireland have an important policy dimension to their work in terms of monitoring, understanding and proposing potential changes in policy.</p><p>  I am determined that policy-making and policy-thinking do not become solely the occupation of a strategic policy unit divorced from the line sections.  Its strengths will be in promoting cross-departmental collaboration, looking at how well the various parts are interacting, examining the wider policy environment in which we operate and seeing to what extent we are competitively benchmarking ourselves against the best.  I am not instituting a rigid system whereby policy is in one area and everything else is in a separate area.  Policy imbues every line operation and that is its role.</p></speech>

The Office of Public Works and the Department of Finance were advised of the availability of the vacant space in the building for consideration in respect of any requests to OPW from the public sector for additional space.</p><p>  In 2011 and 2012, Forf&aacute;s stepped up direct marketing and during this period a total of 12 viewings of the building took place.  A letting was not secured.</p></speech>

I thank the Vice Chairman, members of the committee and the many people involved in making this integration a possibility.  I have always held the view, going back to the time of the Culliton report, which enunciated industrial strategy, when the strong view at that stage was that we needed effective agencies targeting indigenous enterprise and overseas investment, that we also needed a strong Department.  What emerged was an advisory body which was semi-detached from the Department.  I think that weakened the Department over the years and I feel that this integration will not only rationalise and reorganise institutions but will be a strong support for the Department as a policy making unit, capable of improving support for enterprise and employment and all the various responsibilities in creating the environment for doing good business.</p><p>  I thank the Deputies for their support.  I hope this improves policy making and the ability to influence wider Government thinking about enterprise strategy.</p></speech>

I remind people to turn off their mobile phones so that we do not cause interference with the recording equipment.  I can inform Deputy Crowe that we will try to finish the first session by 2.45 p.m. and the second session by 3.30 p.m.</p><p>  We have two substantive items on the agenda this afternoon.  Later we will have a discussion with the Lithuanian Ambassador to Ireland to discuss the introduction of the euro in 2015.  The ambassador is seated in the Gallery and I look forward to hearing from him later.  </p><p>  The first item on the agenda is the issue of voting rights of citizens within the European Union.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Ms Barbara Nolan, head of the European Commission Representation in Ireland, and Ms Eimear N&iacute; Bhroin, political affairs officer.  Members will be aware of the Commission's recently published communication and recommendation regarding the voting rights of EU citizens exercising their right to free movement within the Union.  The Commission criticised a number of member states for not giving voting rights to their citizens in national elections.  Ireland, along with Malta, Denmark and the United Kingdom, was also cited for disenfranchising voters who had exercised their right to move within the EU.  Today's meeting will provide the European Commission with the opportunity outline the rationale for that guidance that they gave us a month ago.  In the coming weeks we will hear from a cross-section of opinion on this so that we can carefully consider how to progress this important issue for the many Irish communities based in other EU member states.</p><p>  Before we begin, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way that he, she or it could be identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in respect of a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings today is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>  I now invite Ms Nolan from the European Commission to give her views.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-11a.152" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Barbara Nolan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014031100002#A00300"><p>I thank the committee for inviting me to speak on this important issue of the disenfranchisement of Union citizens who exercise their right to free movement.  As the committee will know, the European Commission issued a communication and a recommendation at the end of January this year which addressed the matter in detail.</p><p>  In the interest of clarity, I will set out the scope of the Commission's communications and recommendations and provide an brief outline of what led to the January recommendation and ultimately what we are trying to achieve with all of this.</p><p>  The bottom line is that in five EU member states &ndash; Cyprus, Denmark, Ireland, Malta and the UK &ndash; citizens who choose to live and work in another EU member state lose their right to vote in national elections.  In the case of three of these countries the right is suspended after a certain period of time spent abroad which differs according to each member state.  In the Irish case, the right is automatically suspended and is only reinstated if the citizen formally declares his or her intention to return to Ireland within 18 months.  Ireland is at the extreme end of the five member states that do not give their citizens a right to vote when they move outside the country.  The Commission&rsquo;s view is that this represents a gap in the rights of EU citizens.  We are particularly concerned that citizens exercising their right to free movement are losing out on their right to vote in national elections.  The communication and recommendation that we published at the end of 29 January are aimed at addressing the gap.</p><p>  I shall explain the legal context because I know that the subsidiarity issue will be foremost in people's minds.  A communication is a policy document with no mandatory authority.  The Commission publishes a communication when it wishes to set out its own thinking on a topical issue.  Therefore, a communication has no legal effect.</p><p>  Let me explain the accompanying recommendation.  In European Community law, a recommendation is a legal instrument but one which encourages those to whom it is addressed to act in a particular way and is not binding.  It essentially provides guidance to member states.  I wanted to make it clear from the outset that this is not heavy legislation.  The two documents are designed to give the Commission's thinking and to give guidance to member states on this issue.  </p><p>  The Commission underlined in its communication in January that, according to Article 4, paragraph 2 of the Treaty on European Union, it is a matter for each member state to solely decide on the composition of the electorate for its national elections.  We do not question that is a right of member states and we are not trying to take that right over.  We are asking member states to provide or look at providing for the possibility for citizens to renew their registration on the electoral roll if they demonstrate a genuine interest in national politics.</p> <p>The recommendation and communication did not come out of thin air.  We have arrived at this situation through a number of steps that I will briefly outline.  The Treaty of Lisbon, which became law in 2009, among other things that I am sure members are familiar with, strengthened EU citizenship by establishing a close link between citizens, the exercise of their political rights and the democratic life of the Union.   </p><p> In 2010, the European Commission published its first annual EU citizenship report.  One of the issues it highlighted was the practice of disenfranchisement.  Essentially, some EU citizens migrating from one EU member state to another and exercising their right to freedom of movement found that they were unable to participate in any national election either at home or in their new country of residence.  As EU citizenship was clearly supposed to add to the rights citizens had, and not result in any diminution of those rights, this so-called disenfranchisement was identified as an obstacle to EU citizenship.  We in the Commission received a number of petitions from citizens on the issue as well as questions from a number of Members of the European Parliament and correspondence from members of the public.  Thus, it seemed appropriate that the issue should at the very least be addressed.  Therefore, we announced that we would launch a discussion to identify the political options available.</p><p> In June 2011, Vice-President Reding wrote to certain member states explaining the context of the discussion and invited their contribution to a common reflection on the subject.  The Irish Government was one of the countries that responded to his invitation.  In February 2013, a joint European Parliament-European Commission hearing on EU citizenship, as part of the European Year of Citizens, heard that disenfranchisement was a key obstacle to EU citizenship.  It was agreed at the hearing that the existing policies of disenfranchisement needed to be addressed.</p><p> I shall also mention an important court case that took place in the European Court of Human Rights, which is not an EU court, but gives a lot of guidance in terms of fundamental rights.  The European Court of Human Rights issued its judgment on the Shindler case.  Harry Shindler was a British Second World War veteran who had lived in Italy for more than 15 years and had consequently been denied his right to vote in national elections in his home country after the 15-year period.  The judgment pointed to the fact that the emergence of new technologies and cheaper transport had enabled migrants to maintain a higher degree of contact with their state of nationality than would have been possible until recently.  The court went on to state that this had led to a number of states amending their legislation to allow non-residents to vote in national elections.  The court concluded that there was a clear trend in favour of allowing voting by non-resident citizens.  I cite that case as jurisprudence in the area.</p><p> The European Commission has also taken note of the discussions that have taken place at the Irish Constitutional Convention.  On 25 November, the convention formally submitted its report to the Oireachtas recommending the extension of voting rights in presidential elections for Irish citizens resident outside the State.  The convention underlined the huge response that it had received to its online questionnaire on the issue from Irish citizens based in 64 countries ranging from Afghanistan to Zambia.  The chairman of the convention stated that he was "astounded with the size of the response and the strength of opinion" on the issue.   The Commission looks forward with interest to the Government&rsquo;s response to the report, which I understand will happen in the very near future.</p><p> This leads me back to the Commission's communication and recommendation.  The Commission's fundamental aim is to suggest constructive ways to enhance the rights of EU citizens to participate in the democratic life of the Union while exercising their right to free movement.  Let me again underline that we do not question the sovereign right of member states to determine the composition of the electorate for national elections.</p><p> The Commission makes four recommendations.  The committee has received the documents, but I will briefly summarise them.  First, as opposition to the principle of non-resident voting is often based on the presumption that the connection with the political process in the home country is lost after a period, the Commission recommends that member states should enable nationals who make use of their right to free movement and residence in the European Union to retain their right to vote if they demonstrate a continuing interest in the political life of the member state of which they are nationals.  This should include the possibility of applying to remain registered on the electoral roll.  The Commission points to socioeconomic and technological realities such as cheaper air fares and the existence of online media in facilitating citizens who want to stay in touch with political developments in their own member states.  Second, the Commission recommends that member states that put such a system in place can implement proportionate additional arrangements, such as the possibility of reapplying at certain intervals.  Third, the Commission recommends that such applications be possible electronically.  Finally, the Commission recommends that for those member states whose citizens automatically lose their right to vote in national elections - such as Ireland - when they move to another member state, the member state should inform the citizen by appropriate means and in a timely manner about the conditions and the practical arrangements for retaining their right to vote in national elections.</p><p> I shall conclude by emphasising again that neither the communication nor the recommendation are legally binding on Ireland.  Also, both are intended to highlight what the Commission perceives as a gap in the political rights of EU citizens while providing guidance on how to fill the gap.  The Commission is asking five countries - Cyprus, Ireland, Denmark, Malta and the UK - to show greater flexibility so that their own nationals are not denied the right to vote in national elections.  Clearly the ball is in Ireland&rsquo;s court as to how it wishes to respond to the  recommendation.</p></speech>

Ireland has a long tradition of emigration in the European context and our nearest neighbour is the primary port of call.  Does the delegation know how many Irish citizens live in the EU but outside Ireland?  A number of Irish citizens travel to the UK, for example, to work for a period and return.  Those people are probably still registered at home and have the right to be registered at home.  Is it easier for other European countries because their electoral systems use electronic voting or national identity numbers?  Can the witnesses elaborate on the matter?  There has been a lot of talk in this country about using PPS numbers and that type of thing for the electoral register.  I ask the witnesses to comment on this.  Ms Nolan mentioned that the Commission has received a number of petitions from Irish residents.  How many?  </p><p>  With regard to other countries whose citizens have the right to vote after leaving, do they also have a right to vote in their existing countries of residence?  I think they included some of the main countries.  Ms Nolan said the Commission's recommendation was not binding, so presumably it can be considered and left.  Is there a chance that it will be made binding?  Has there been discussion of this?</p></speech>

We are 40 years in the EU but the attitude of successive governments to the Irish diaspora has been disgraceful.  I have recorded this view on many occasions.</p> <p>I base my view on my embarrassment on realising, as an OSCE election monitor, that a very diverse range of countries, including Ukraine, Romania and other former eastern European counties, had their embassy networks open their doors to their non-resident nationals.  A good reason to be in the European Union is that decisions on Irish domestic policy are pushed by embarrassment.  This committee and others of the Parliament have been addressing this for quite a while.  I am convinced and happy that there will be changes. However, I have a couple of questions.  Ms Nolan is obviously wearing the EU representative's hat, so she is talking about 28 countries conforming.  This committee must consider the wider diaspora because there are so many emigrants in America, let alone the 50,000 who are illegal.  Every other American claims to be Irish.  One must also consider New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, elsewhere in Africa, and many other areas.  There are many such countries with a huge diaspora.  How we handle this may be a separate issue but we must start by giving leadership and conforming rapidly with the EU norm.  I thank Ms Nolan for highlighting this yet again.  I hope that within the relatively near future we can come up with a formula to afford Irish EU citizens the right to vote in national elections.</p><p> Somewhere in the correspondence we have it is being argued that Irish students should now start engaging in the recruitment process for jobs in Europe.  Would it not be ironic if they took up jobs in Europe and, in doing so, possibly lost their votes?  Such phenomena are not consistent with a modern 21st-century country.</p></speech>

The position of the Commission is not binding, as stated; the competency is one of national parliaments.  The way in which the delegates are engaging is very respectful of that.  We should not be frightened or any way annoyed because  the Commission is pointing to what it believes to be a discrepancy in the rights of citizens of the five countries concerned, including our own.  I have a real belief that Irish citizens who reside in the Union should be entitled to participate in elections here.  This is long overdue.</p><p>  As the witnesses will know, there has been a wider debate on the extension of the franchise to the diaspora.  While those who remain within the European Union certainly have a legitimate expectation to have a vote, it might be different for citizens who travel farther afield.  However, even in this case we need to embrace their views and opinions, although perhaps not as directly as in the case of those who remain within the Union.  That creates issues for the Government and for all of us in the political arena.  We must ask why one might treat one citizen differently from another but, because of the nature of the European bloc, progress should follow relatively quickly.  It would be a first step in dealing with our diaspora.  I support strongly and welcome the Commission's consideration of that.</p><p>  A broader issue concerns whether citizens who seek to have a franchise in a particular state should pay tax in that state.  That is not relevant in the context of the European Union because of the free movement of goods, people, services and capital.  It is a broader issue, of course, in the case of those who move to Australia, the United States or jurisdictions farther afield.  Many of the standard concerns that arise regarding the extension of the franchise are negated in this instance because of the broad bloc that is the European Union.</p></speech>

We are out of sync with approximately 115 countries which grant voting rights to their citizens.  I acknowledge that many of these countries are outside the European Union.  A vast number of Irish people in Australia and America, including relations of mine, keep in touch constantly with what is happening in Ireland.  It is important to realise that the vast majority of those who emigrate for work go of necessity and not by choice.  Some feel very aggrieved because they are unable to have a say in the politics of their country as a consequence.  It is important that we all bear mind that this issue extends beyond the European Union.  I could be wrong but I believe the vast majority of Irish citizens abroad, who are in America, Australia, New Zealand and such places, are not even being considered at this stage.  Not bringing them all on board would be wrong.</p><p>  I have two questions for Ms Nolan.  She said the arrangement was not binding.  If we are not able to introduce legislation in the immediate future or medium term, is it likely that the European Union might make the provision binding on Ireland?  Ms Nolan said people needed to demonstrate that they had an interest in Irish politics.  How can they do that?  Must they do so through Facebook or otherwise?  Very many people who left Ireland for other locations in the European Union are already registered in Ireland and keep in touch with Irish relations.  I would not want to stipulate that people must prove they have an interest in Irish politics.  The mere fact that they are Irish citizens who have to work in Europe should be enough.  If they had been taken off the register here, it should be enough for them to have a say in how their country is run.</p></speech>

We are talking only about those Irish citizens who have moved to other EU member states, because is not our remit to go beyond that.  I acknowledge that there is another considerable issue, but it is not the subject of our recommendation of communication.</p><p>  Deputy Kyne mentioned particular figures.  I do not have figures with me but can try to determine whether I can find some.  Mobility in the European Union in generally quite low by comparison with the United States.  Roughly, only 3% of the entire population actually move to live and work in another member state.  As we all know, the majority of Irish people do not go to European Union member states to live and work but to countries farther afield.  There is an example of European Union member states allowing non-nationals to vote in national elections.  As members probably know, this agreement is between the United Kingdom and Ireland under arrangements that predate EU membership for both countries.  Based on the principle of reciprocity, Irish people can vote in British elections and vice versa.  That is a case apart.  We are talking about relatively small numbers.</p><p>  It is true that electronic voting is much more widespread in continental Europe than here.  It possibly makes voting easier, but I am not sure about that.  We are mentioning ways in which voting might be made easier, perhaps by using electronic means and various technological advances, if Irish citizens living and working abroad were to be given the vote.</p> <p> On petitions, I did not say Irish persons made those petitions.  In fact, I understand many of the petitions come from British persons living abroad who, after 15 years, lose their right to vote in national elections.  I mentioned Mr. Schindler, the veteran of the Second World War, who suddenly lost his vote.</p><p> As to whether it is binding, it is not binding and it is not the intention to make it binding.  As I stated, the idea is we are pointing out what we see as a lacuna in the current arrangements.  We are giving guidance to those member states concerned, in particular, on ways in which they could fix this, but it is not intended to go further, although we would like to see a reaction from Ireland and the other member states concerned as to how they see matters in the future.  As I mentioned, this may be linked also to the discussion that is going on in the Constitutional Convention.</p></speech>

It could be something as straightforward as that which does not require any major demonstration or sets of criteria to fulfil before they could remain on the electoral roll.

I have been regularly attending functions and events and they play an active role in the work of the Commission which is appreciated by Members of the Oireachtas.  I commend their important schools programme.</p><p>  In principle, my party is much in favour of this.  The first step is the presidential elections.  As a first step, that should be cornered.  Other than that, there should be voting rights for European citizens in Ireland.  European citizens who live and work in Ireland and pay taxes should be given full voting rights, both in constitutional referenda and in elections.</p><p>  We are doing a bad job in keeping the Register of Electors in Ireland for those who are entitled to vote here.  For example, my brother, Joe Leyden, is 54 years on the Register of Electors and his name was taken off it without his knowledge or permission.  If that is what is happening in County Roscommon, if that is the lax approach to the Register of Electors in Ireland, how in heaven's name will we arrange a situation where we can record and support Irish citizens abroad, whether in the United States, in New Zealand or in England?  It would be practically impossible to keep the register, or the addresses, up to date.  There are many practicalities involved.</p><p>  In principle, Fianna F&aacute;il is fully in favour of voting being granted to Irish citizens abroad.  The Constitutional Convention recommendation on the presidential election should be accepted without question because the presidential election is a broad picture.  In a tight situation in a general election, it would be difficult to manage votes abroad.  Will the candidates have to go to the United Kingdom, France or elsewhere to start campaigning with pockets of votes that are registered there.  There are many practicalities which, as the Commission representative stated, can be gone into.  It is worth researching.</p></speech>

I agree that voting rights should be extended for presidential elections, but Irish citizens here at home should be assured that they have a voting right, for example, after 54 years.

There is the question that posted workers throughout Europe, either in the public or private sector, who go there not of their own accord but because they are sent by their employers, should have the right to vote in embassies or wherever.  That is a given and I have no difficulty with that.</p><p>  The next question that arises is the old principle of whether there is representation without taxation which has been tossed around for years as well.  If they are permanently posted abroad by their employers, public or private, they probably should retain the right to vote throughout Europe.</p><p>  The big question relates to the diaspora worldwide and the degree to which one can prove a point, without impacting severely on the electoral decision of the people at home.  It is a serious issue.  It is something of which the European Commission is mindful.  Of course, we recognise that this is only a discussion on an observation, and it has no power of enforcement or anything like that.</p><p>  There is the question of the voters' register that has been referred to by Senator Leyden.  First, a means has to be found to update that.  If we cannot update the register at home, I can assure Ms Nolan without a shadow of a doubt that we cannot update the register abroad.  That is the first measure to be taken and it is a fundamental aspect of voting.</p><p>  If one does not do it right, one can completely corrupt the voting system.  One can simply and easily skew the voting in a particular direction, with the use of modern technology, much to the disenfranchisement of those who live in the homeland, and that must be observed at all times.  There are two issues.  One is the entitlement of citizens abroad to exercise their franchise under whatever the rules and guidelines, but the other is to be certain not to disenfranchise those who are living in the homeland, and that should apply to all other countries as well.  Otherwise, those living at home paying their taxes in the normal way to the Government through the agencies at home may find themselves outvoted at some stage in the future in cases of countries with a large diaspora.</p></speech>

Along with the need to deal with the register, a difficulty we identified was that we must recognise in the case of Ireland there is such a large number recently of this origin who are living abroad.  For example, if this were to apply in Australia or New Zealand, how would one organise that and to what extent do those emigrants have access?</p><p>  The voters' register should be held by the post office in this country for a start.  The post office staff are the only group who have access to every house, flat and apartment, including gated residences, in the country on a daily basis if they wish.  Nobody else has such access.</p><p>  On the flaws in the PPSN system, one can have an address anywhere under that system.  One could be anywhere.  It does not prove anything.  It does not prove one's entitlement to vote in one area or another, or in one constituency or another, or it does not disprove one's right to vote in two constituencies.</p> <p>The final point I want to make is that I do not believe this can be done without including some of the wider diaspora in the United States, Canada and New Zealand.  It would be unfair to exclude those who left this country in the past five years, for example, and went to Australia, Canada or elsewhere.</p><p> On electronic voting, it is out as an option.  I would not support that under any circumstances.</p></speech>

I wish to raise a number of issues. The first decision we need to make is on the importance of the issue.  The representatives said they would separate consideration of the issue and that their recommendation is that this would apply within the European Union, but even as EU citizens, how important is our access to a vote?  That is the key question in regard to the issue.  Is it important, very important or vital that people are allowed access to a vote?  If we accept that access to a vote is an individual's basic right, and in recent years we have come to the conclusion that even those in prison should be allowed access to a vote, why should we not allow people who, through no fault of their own, are not living on the island of Ireland or who cannot get to a polling station in their constituency on the day of the election?  I would argue that Ireland is unique because approximately 70 million people view themselves as coming from Ireland.  Our history of people having been forced to emigrate in itself makes us different in this regard.  That is the reason the State should be more flexible in this regard.  I believe also that the crisis we have been through in recent years and the fact that one person has left Ireland every six minutes is another reason those individuals who, through no fault of their own, have been forced to leave our shores, like previous generations, should be given that opportunity.  Why have we not come to the conclusion that we should allow these people to vote?  One reason is that many of them probably feel very annoyed about the Government they left behind or the conditions that forced them into that position.  There has always been a view that if we gave a vote to those living abroad they might vote one way or the other.  The body politic protects itself and does not want to introduce change in that regard.</p><p>  Sinn F&eacute;in launched its own document today, Moving Forward Together: A Vision for the Global Irish Diaspora, in which there is reference to the presidential election.  In the D&aacute;il today Sinn F&eacute;in will put forward a Bill proposing an amendment of the Constitution to allow people access to a vote in the presidential election.  It is putting it up to the Government and all the parties in this House, because if we are all saying we agree with this issue, what is the next step?  The Constitutional Convention has suggested that we take this step forward.  Therefore, the next logical move is for Government and Opposition parties to come together - they have come together regarding the Constitutional Convention but also with regard to this House - and take on this issue.</p><p>  The presidential election should be a first step.  We also must examine other elections, including D&aacute;il elections, and we are talking about reform of the Seanad.  I raise these issues because I believe Ireland is unique.  Other countries do not have the same number of emigrants compared to the number who have left our shores over the years.  There is a need for us to reach out to those people.  We are quick to seek their support in times of difficulty but in times of plenty we tend to forget them.  There is a need for us to examine that issue.</p><p>  I welcome the fact that the Commission is examining this issue, but the fact that it is non-binding does not mean we are off the hook, so to speak, in respect of it.  The representatives should be saying it is vital for our citizens, whether inside or outside the European Union, that they have access to the vote.</p></speech>

EU citizens already have the right to vote in local and European elections in the member state in which they reside and work.  That is already in place.  The principle has already been seeded on those two areas.  What we are addressing here is the national elections.  We are getting a little caught up with the diaspora.  Ireland is a member of the European Union and under that there is the concept of a citizen of the Union with certain rights that go with that, which is not the case for countries outside the Union, such as Australia or the United States, where there are large communities of Irish people.  We cannot compare the two, as it would be like comparing apples and pears.  Most member states give their national citizens the right to vote in their national elections when they are living and working abroad.  We have pointed to the five countries out of 28 member states that do not do that.  It is a particular problem related to national elections with regard to people who move from their member state to live and work in another member state.  I cannot get involved or speak about the wider implications of what this might mean for people outside the European Union.  That does not come under my remit, nor is it my business.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee I welcome to the meeting H.E. Mr. Vidmantas Purlys, the Lithuanian ambassador to Ireland.  On 1 January next year Lithuania is scheduled to become the 19th member of the eurozone, and while membership for Lithuania is not a foregone conclusion, its likely that joining the eurozone is an indication of the country's ongoing economic stability.  It is also testament to the resilience of the euro currency, which is emerging strongly from the economic crisis of recent years.</p> <p>The committee looks forward to discussing with the ambassador the challenges his country faces and how it is preparing for membership of the eurozone.  I understand he was in the Gallery when I read out the privilege notice earlier and will assume he has heard the notice so that we can proceed without delay to his presentation.  While we have invited him to discuss Lithuania's preparations for the euro, in the context of our earlier discussion perhaps he will also give us an overview of how his country addresses the issue of voting rights for its diaspora.</p></speech>

In regard to voting rights, all Lithuanian citizens living abroad are entitled to vote in presidential, parliamentary and European elections.  We will be holding presidential elections on 11 May and all Lithuanian citizens residing in Ireland will be able to cast their vote in the embassy, which is the single balloting point.  During the last parliamentary elections in 2012, more than 2,000 citizens cast their votes in Ireland.  That is, of course, a fraction of the estimated 70,000 who live here.  These 2,000 active citizens used their constitutional right to vote in elections.  There is no electronic voting; the ballots are on paper.  Ireland is the second largest constituency after the UK in terms of those turning up for elections.  The US is the third largest constituency for Lithuanian citizens.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-11a.200" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H.E. Mr. Vidmantas Purlys" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014031100007#F00400"><p>I will outline my country's preparations for the introduction of the euro on 1 January 2015.  Membership of the eurozone is a long-standing strategic priority for Lithuania and a major objective for the Lithuanian Government in 2014.  I will structure my presentation in three parts.  First, I will outline the key considerations behind our strategy.  Second, I will speak about Lithuania's compliance with the Maastricht membership criteria and summarise the practical steps taken by the Government in preparation for the introduction of the euro.  Third, I will present a broad economic perspective for Lithuania.  </p><p>  Lithuania aims at a sustainable fulfilment of the Maastricht criteria with a target date to adopt the euro on 1 January 2015.  Our commitment to join the euro area is enshrined in the EU Treaty; Lithuania has been participating and adhering to the Exchange Rate Mechanism, ERM, II commitments since 2004.  We believe that an enlargement of the eurozone will benefit not only Lithuania via investment, trade and access to credit but also the Economic and Monetary Union and its individual members of the eurozone, including Ireland, because it would send a positive signal to the markets about the vitality of the euro project.</p><p>  Lithuania is an open, trading nation.  The EU is Lithuania&rsquo;s main trading partner.  Two thirds of our total exports go to the EU, with 30% going to the eurozone, and 80% of our FDI comes from the EU, with 40% from the eurozone.  Our loan portfolio is 69% euro denominated.  In terms of income convergence Lithuania is making steady progress.  Real GDP <i>per capita </i>was 32% of the EU average in 1996 but in 2012 it stood at 64% in terms of purchasing power parity. </p><p>  The course of deepening Lithuania&rsquo;s integration with the EU was also informed by strategic and security considerations.  The current aggression towards Ukraine highlights this imperative even more strongly.  We are ready to assume all the commitments of euro membership, such as fully fledged participation in the European Stability Mechanism and adoption of the provisions of the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union.  We are ready to work with other EMU members to make the euro area stable and credible.</p><p>  Enlargement of the euro area and recent reforms in EMU, to which Lithuania contributed during its Presidency of the Council of the European Union, also prove the dynamism and credibility of the euro project.  Lithuania&rsquo;s prospective membership in the euro area serves as an anchor for prudent fiscal and economic policies that the country focuses on in building a balanced and competitive economy.  Lithuania has demonstrated its ability to deal with the impact of the global downturn without external assistance and has undergone a significant financial and economic adjustment in the recent years.</p><p>  Currently, Lithuania fulfils the Maastricht criteria.  Prudent fiscal policy underpinned by the law on fiscal discipline and the Stability and Growth Pact is at the core of Lithuania&rsquo;s policy framework to ensure macro-economic stability.  Over the past several years Lithuania has implemented substantial fiscal consolidation measures which brought the post-crisis general government deficit from 9.4% of GDP in 2009 to 3.2% of GDP in 2012.  The forecast for 2013 is 2.5%, compared to the Maastricht reference value of 3%.  The general government debt, which was estimated at 39.5% of GDP in 2013, is one of the lowest in the EU and is projected to decline in the medium term.  The Maastricht reference value is 60%.  Lithuania continues to strengthen its fiscal framework,<i> inter alia</i>, through transposing the fiscal compact into its national legal system.</p><p>  The annual average inflation rate fell sharply from the peak of 11.1% in 2008 to 1.2% in 2013.  It has further moderated and is projected to remain stable with domestic price pressures firmly contained.  The forecasted inflation for 2014 is 1%, compared to the Maastricht reference value of 1.6%.  Lithuania pegged its national currency, the litas, to the euro at a fixed exchange rate of 3.4528 litas per euro on 2 February 2002 under the currency board arrangement.  As I have already mentioned, Lithuania has been part of ERM II since June 2004.  Aiming at full harmonization of national legislation with the requirements of EU law, the amendments to the law on the Bank of Lithuania and the law on the National Audit Office have been adopted by the Seimas, the Parliament of Lithuania.  As a result, Lithuania&rsquo;s national legislation is in line with the legal convergence requirements under the Treaty of Functioning of the European Union, the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank.  Over the past several years long-term interest rates in Lithuania have decreased from 14% in 2009 to 3.83% in 2013, attesting to increased investor confidence in Lithuania&rsquo;s fiscal policy and the stability of the financial market.  The Maastricht reference value is currently 5.4%.</p><p>  The national euro changeover plan and the information and communication strategy were approved on 26 June 2013 and updated on 4 December 2013.  On the same day the Government of the Republic of Lithuania approved the action plan for the implementation of the national euro changeover plan.  </p> <p>The plan paved the way for the preparatory works by public and private institutions and includes provisions relevant to the dual display of prices, conversion of the litas - our national currency - to euro and the rounding and adaptation of information systems, as well as other measures.  The implementation of the plan and strategy is co-ordinated by the special commission chaired by the Prime Minister, which is supported by the set-up of designated working groups.  The information campaign is divided into stages and is focused both on informing the public about the practical aspects of euro introduction and on explaining the functioning of the euro area and implications of joining it in a broader context.</p><p> Let me now turn to the broader economic outlook.  Since 2011, Lithuania has remained one of the fastest-growing economies in the EU.  In 2012 Lithuania&rsquo;s GDP rose by 3.7% - the third highest rate in the EU - while in 2013 real GDP growth was 3.2%.  Growth is forecasted to be above the EU and euro area average in 2014-2016.  The growth profile is balanced among the macroeconomic categories, such as consumption, investments, and exports.  In particular, investment is rebounding and net exports continue to be one of the main drivers of growth. The growth pattern is much healthier than in the pre-crisis period, with wages rising in line with productivity, the current account staying close to balance, and credit in the economy more strictly monitored under the responsible lending guidelines issued by the Bank of Lithuania in 2011.  The improved economic situation manifests itself in the labour market.  In 2013, the unemployment rate was 11.8%, down 1.6 percentage points from the previous year, and it is projected that it will continue to decline in the medium term.  The financial stability framework is robust; the banking sector is liquid and well capitalised, and steps have been taken to strengthen further macro-prudential policy, including the adoption of responsible lending regulations.</p><p> The resilience and flexibility of the Lithuanian economy is underpinned by the structural reform agenda, focusing on restructuring of the energy sector, reforms in the labour market that increase competitiveness and reforms in company law that bring improvements to the business climate.  Energy sector reforms are particularly relevant and constitute one of the national priorities for Lithuania.  These include a programme of apartment block renovation, alternative supply of electric power through interconnectors with Poland and Sweden, a liquefied natural gas terminal on the Baltic Sea to become operational by 2015, and other measures.  These are relevant not only in terms of improving the competitiveness of our economy, but also in addressing our over-reliance on a single energy supply and diversifying the ways and means of bringing natural resources such as gas and electricity to our economy.</p><p> Improvement of the business environment has been recognised by international organisations.  The Doing Business 2014 report, as compared to the same report for 2013, states that Lithuania improved its global ranking by ten positions, and now ranks 17th in terms of ease of doing business.</p><p> In conclusion, I would like to mention that Lithuania values Ireland&rsquo;s support during the process of becoming the 19th member of the eurozone.  Ireland and Lithuania are like-minded countries, active and responsible members of the international community.  Co-operation on a bilateral level and in international forums is very close.  In this context, I would like to recall our joint work as troika members in the OSCE in 2011 and 2012, as trio members of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2013, and currently in the UN, where Lithuania sits on the UN Security Council and Ireland is a member of the UN Human Rights Council.</p><p> Contacts regarding the introduction of the euro are ongoing at intergovernmental level.  Of course, the purpose of engaging with our Irish counterparts and colleagues in other member states is to reassure them that Lithuania is on the right track in preparing for the euro.</p><p> Finally, 11 March is a very special day for Lithuania, as it was this day 24 years ago that the Lithuanian Parliament adopted a resolution that restored the independence of Lithuania, and this set the course for the nation to move towards European and Euro-Atlantic institutions, where we naturally belong.  We have made a great deal of progress.  We became members of the EU and NATO in 2004, and we are members of all major international organisations.  The introduction of the euro is yet another major step in integrating into the European Union.  I thank committee members for their attention and I look forward to their questions and comments.</p></speech>

One issue that was a priority for Lithuania was the Eastern Partnership and signing an agreement.  For reasons we are all aware of, that did not quite work out, but I wonder if the ambassador could give us an outline of where he thinks things are at the moment.</p><p>  Lithuania will be the last of the three Baltic states to join the eurozone.  Estonia was the first, Latvia joined this year, and Lithuania is joining next January.  Several members of the committee and I travelled to Riga last November and we had a meeting with the central bank there.  Its officials outlined the Latvian preparations for membership, and we were all very impressed with the detail that they went into to ensure the transition would be a success.  Everybody here would agree that the transition was very well managed and very successful.  One question that they were not sure about was in respect of how soon the population would increase its support for the euro.  Some surveys were done in Latvia prior to the introduction which showed that a certain element of the population favoured the old currency.  What is the situation in Lithuania?  Is there a groundswell of public sentiment in favour of the euro?  If you are not doing it already, you should make contact with the Latvians to see what they did, because they had a very successful transition and it would be useful to talk to them about it.</p></speech>

Hopefully, that will be the case next year by the time of the 25th anniversary of independence.</p><p>  The ambassador mentioned the liquidity of the banks.  Has that been independently scrutinised by the European Central Bank?  Lithuania's high levels of growth are to be commended.  What particular areas has that growth been based on?  We went through a period of unnatural or unsustainable growth in this country, so I am just wondering if this is sustainable.  The ambassador also mentioned plans on energy, which seem to be about moving away from a dependence on Russian gas.</p> <p>Does the country still depend on Russian imports?  The ambassador has mentioned links with Sweden and Poland.</p><p> In 2008 and 2009 Lithuania had very high inflation and interest rates, which have been successfully managed.  What initiatives were put in place to manage the economy?</p></speech>

I was very interested in his account of the Lithuanian economy, the debt ratio and his positive news on the economy.  I wish him well.</p><p>  I am old enough to remember when we moved to the euro.  Some people became unsettled as they did not understand it.  The ambassador said that Lithuania proposes to operate a dual system.  How long will the dual system be in place?  In some parts of Europe, people still have their old currency and still think in terms of it rather than the euro.  People of my generation still talk in terms of pounds, shillings and pence.  Many Irish people had a sense, not necessarily at the time but some three or four years afterwards, that the consumer rather than business had lost out on the transition to the euro.  Some still have that belief today.</p><p>  Is there public support for the transition to the euro?  Has it been determined how long the Lithuanian Litas will continue to be exchanged for euro?  Has there been an awareness campaign on the euro?  Are some sections of the population more reluctant than others to accept changes in the currency?  From our experience, I know that younger people found it easier to accept decimalisation.</p><p>  I presume the ambassador believes the euro will bring greater stability to the Lithuanian economy, but the country will lose some of its sovereignty to the European Union.  I wish Lithuania well.</p></speech>

When we in Ireland take major decisions, we have a great deal of debate.  If the Russians had not invaded Ukraine, which I am sure is a very sensitive issue in Lithuania, would the people have been equally supportive of the adoption of the euro?  Given the Russian involvement in Ukraine, I presume a greater number will opt for the euro, in that it will incorporate a greater degree of merger with other European countries?  Does the ambassador believe the Russian invasion has spurred on people to become more enthusiastic about the European experience and adopting the euro?  What is the current position?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-11a.209" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H.E. Mr. Vidmantas Purlys" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014031100009#H00400"><p>I will deal with the Eastern Partnership and Ukraine in my concluding remarks.</p><p>  First, let me respond to questions on the level of public support for the euro.  The Lithuanian Government has started an extensive, targeted information campaign.  I am aware that the experience of other countries that recently made the transition to the euro has been similar.  The support for the currency stands at just over 40% and those who have doubts are close to 50% of the population.  We have some way to go to convince some of our people.  The Government and the Prime Minister are very committed to explaining the process in detail.  He is doing a very important job in that regard.  This is a popular Government, which has prioritised the introduction of the euro in its legislative programme.  The euro is viewed positively by business circles and they have joined the campaign on the "Yes" side and I think the outlook will change quite rapidly.</p><p>  I know from the experience of our neighbouring country, Latvia, that its people also expressed doubts in advance of the currency transition, especially in respect of price increases and speculation on consumer goods, but their experience of the euro has been very positive from the beginning.  Members have pointed out that the introduction of the euro in Latvia has been very successful.  We are in close contact, not only with Latvia but also with our colleagues in Estonia and have the privilege of learning from their experience on how to make the transition to the euro in the most efficient and effective way.  I am confident that the support for the euro will increase and will substantially exceed the 50% threshold.</p><p>  The financial sector in Lithuania is sound and is dominated by conservative retail banking, which has limited international exposure.  Lending conditions have normalised after pronounced leveraging and the banks in Lithuania are predominantly from Scandinavia and the Nordic region.  They are subject to international scrutiny mechanisms and are solid and stable institutions.  There are no issues in that regard.</p><p>  Lithuania had its significant crisis in 2009, at the time I came to Ireland.  The then Government took serious measures across the board to effect savings.  When I appeared before the committee on a previous occasion, I explained that the capital programme was downsized and salaries and wages across the public sector were cut significantly.  This had an effect on our competitiveness and in 2010, we were back to growth.</p> <p>Although the shock to individual citizens was quite significant, the process itself was orderly and manageable.  Since we returned to growth in recent years it has been continuous and steady.  The general public can feel the effect of the increase in exports as the economy is driven by export and trade.  We have won a number of important investment projects and have had a range of success stories in recent years.  All in all, the economy is back on track and on a much more sustainable footing since the crisis.  The reasons for the 2009 crisis were largely the same as they were in Ireland, including an over-reliance on real estate development as the major contributory factor.</p><p> With regard to the national currency, the feeling is to keep it for a while.  The Lithuanian currency is pegged to the euro at a fixed rate, so <i>de facto</i>it is the same currency, but we are not yet part of the eurozone.  Given our connection with the EU, and the fact that the euro is used in Latvia and Estonia, the Lithuanian people are exposed to the euro.  Therefore, our introduction of the euro should be a positive experience.</p><p> We do not believe the Eastern Partnership project failed at the Vilnius Summit in November, as important steps were taken on Georgia and Moldova.  While Ukraine did not sign the association agreement, it was an important juncture in the events that unfolded there.  Ukrainians stood up for their European choice and we saw Russia was not at all happy.  This has been followed by cynical aggression in Crimea.  Discussions took place on this in the EU and in the international arena on how to respond to the violation by Russia of all possible international agreements and norms which civilised nations built up after the Second World War to prevent open aggression against other countries.  The EU leaders' summit that took place last week reached conclusions, and the process continues.  Ukraine will be able to sign the political part of the association agreement.  We must be very careful and monitor the situation closely as far as Moldova and Georgia are concerned.  We need to increase our efforts to sign the relevant agreements with them.  We must also examine how to make the Eastern Partnership policy more effective.  We may need to go back to the drawing board to redesign European Russian policy, learn lessons from recent experiences and see what we can do to preserve international stability in the region and beyond.</p></speech>

I represent the Maynooth office of the Irish Council for Prisoners Overseas, ICPO, and am accompanied by my colleague, Fr. Gerry McFlynn, from the ICPO's London office.  The Irish Council for Prisoners Overseas is a charitable organisation that provides information and support to Irish prisoners overseas and their families.  It was established in 1985 by the Irish Catholic Bishops Conference and at present, we work with more than 1,000 Irish prisoners worldwide.  The majority of our clients are in the United Kingdom but we also have a significant number of clients throughout Europe and the United States.  We also work with Irish prisoners in South and Central America, Africa, Asia and Australia.  In the time allotted to us today, I will discuss briefly the issues surrounding the repatriation of IPP prisoners, while Fr. McFlynn will highlight the impact this is having on Irish prisoners in the United Kingdom.</p><p>  The IPP sentence or indeterminate sentence for public protection was abolished by the United Kingdom's Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012.  However, there will be no sentence conversion for those prisoners are already serving an IPP sentence.  We have been informed by the United Kingdom's National Offender Management Service that there currently are 55 Irish nationals serving IPP sentences in the United Kingdom.  A number of these prisoners wish to apply for repatriation to Ireland but the Department of Justice and Equality does not at present accept repatriation applications from IPP-sentenced prisoners on the basis that there is no equivalent sentence under Irish law.  This is something about which the ICPO is extremely concerned and we submitted a formal letter of concern to the Department of Justice and Equality in June 2013.  The Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act makes reference to adapting a sentence where, by its legal nature or duration, it is not compatible with Irish law.  The transfer legislation does not make any reference to converting a sentence but this is provided for by the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons.  The ICPO is aware there may be some legal difficulty in respect of adapting an IPP sentence and ask that this be addressed as a matter of urgency in order that IPP-sentenced prisoners are eligible to apply for repatriation.  Repatriation allows a prisoner to maintain close links with his or her family, which is extremely important to ensure effective resettlement and rehabilitation.  Repatriation benefits the prisoner, his or her family, his or her community as a whole and Irish society in general.  I thank members for their time and will now hand over to my colleague, Fr. McFlynn.</p></speech>

Gerry McFlynn" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014031100003#C00500"><p>In common with Ms Joyce, I am thankful to the joint committee for the opportunity to address it today.  As Ms Joyce already has pointed out, repatriation is extremely important for Irish prisoners who wish to serve their sentence closer to their families.  It is universally accepted that maintaining family relationships during a period of imprisonment is vital for the well-being of offenders and their families.  The ICPO is aware of approximately 15 Irish prisoners who are serving IPP sentences at present and who are interested in applying for repatriation.  A number of these prisoners have close family ties in Ireland and in some cases, the only family ties they have are in Ireland.  In the knowledge that they cannot apply for repatriation and may be obliged to remain in the United Kingdom on licence after their release, some prisoners are finding this to be a situation with which it is extremely difficult to cope.</p><p>  A large part of my work in the London office entails visiting Irish prisoners throughout England and Wales.  In this context, I can think of three people in particular that I have met recently, including one only last month.  One prisoner, who has elderly parents back in County Mayo, is on a 17-year tariff, of which he has served three years and he has little or no chance of seeing his parents alive again.  Another prisoner has all his family contacts back in Ireland, including a partner and children.  A third has approximately five or six years of a sentence yet to serve but he already has lost his mother while in prison and his elderly father is seriously ill.  The person I met last month in a prison in the south of England told me he now is entertaining suicidal ideas, largely because he believes he is facing a long sentence, will never see his family members back in Ireland again and that there is not much point in going around from prison to prison, as he basically is going nowhere.  I was so concerned about the state in which I found him that I asked the chaplain afterwards to make sure that someone kept an eye on him.</p><p>  I am really worried that some day, I will receive a telephone call from a prison informing me that one of these prisoners on an IPP has taken his own life.  Then we all will be in trouble, having been made aware of the situation but having done nothing much to change it.  I also am aware of anecdotal evidence to the effect that prisoners from other European countries have been repatriated to countries that also do not have IPP sentences.  I have anecdotal evidence for this and it has been confirmed by people in the United Kingdom as well.  I thank the joint committee for providing me with this opportunity to make a few introductory remarks on this issue.  I hope this issue will be taken seriously and will be dealt with as urgently as possible.</p></speech>

We have received no formal notification of what it is.  We hope for the committee's assistance on this point.  We would like to be part of the conversation on how to resolve the issue.  We hope legislative change is not necessary and perhaps there is a practical solution to the problem.  Until we know exactly what the issue is, we cannot address that.  We hope for the committee's assistance in finding a workable solution.</p></speech>

Initially, people were under the impression that the Irish prison system would be swamped by scores of people but it amounts to a handful of people to whom it would make a massive difference.  I cannot stress strongly enough that while we are punishing prisoners by keeping them in this position we are also punishing family members.</p></speech>

I commend the organisation for its valuable work.  In a previous life, I worked closely with it.  I do not know if Nuala Kelly is still around.  At the beginning, I worked on cases concerning miscarriages of justice, including the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six in the 1980s.  I know the valuable work of the organisation.</p><p>  The witnesses referred to the immediate need for 15 Irish prisoners to be repatriated.</p></speech>

Of that number, a handful may meet the criteria and be eligible.  Very few people are repatriated to Ireland each year so it is unlikely that all 15 are eligible.</p></speech>

I was very surprised to hear about the number of prisoners, some 1,054, in prisons abroad.  It is a very high figure for a small country.

We assume there are other Irish prisoners out there who, for whatever reason, are not in contact with our service.  Perhaps they are not aware of our service or they choose not to contact us.  The figure is quite high but we also work with second-generation Irish so anyone entitled to Irish citizenship receives our support.  That explains why it is such a high number.</p></speech>

Our figures change on a frequent basis because people come in and out of prison.  At the moment we are working with four Irish prisoners in South America and Central America.  We are not in contact with all of their families as some families do not wish to have our support.  We are in direct contact with those clients.</p></speech>

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the embassies and consulates are good at informing people of our service.  We work closely with them on a daily basis with many of these cases.  In the UK, many prisoners become aware of us from other Irish prisoners and sometimes families will find information about our organisation on the Internet and may get in contact with us.  Through a wide variety of ways, we become involved in people's cases.</p></speech>

We always have our suspicions but that will be a bigger problem in the future for prisoners.  From 1 April, legal aid will be withdrawn in the UK so prisoners will find it difficult to get legal aid to take cases.  There are no outstanding cases such as the Birmingham Six or Guildford Four cases that we know about at the present time.  Having said that, there are cases we have suspicions about from time to time.</p><p>  With regard to the size of the population, Irish prisoners now constitute the second largest ethnic group in the prison system in England and Wales, marginally behind Polish prisoners.  The figure is higher than what Joanna made it out to be.  I visited a Birmingham prison two weeks ago and I found six prisoners who were not known to us.  They were not on our database and that is just from one prison.  The figure is probably a lot higher than we are saying.</p></speech>

McFlynn for coming in.  I met them last year on this issue.  I am delighted they could make the presentation today.  The imprisonment for public protection sentence was abolished by the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 for future offences but it does not apply to people already serving sentences.  What is the crime they have been convicted of?  How serious is the crime?</p><p>  I presume the Irish Council for Prisoners Overseas has tried to put pressure on the UK Government to change the law and include people currently serving imprisonment for public protection sentences before it was abolished.  I heard first-hand about the individual cases and it is heartbreaking for people so far away from home.  Father McFlynn referred to someone in Mayo, which is not the same as being in Dublin and flying over or getting the boat over.  It is a long distance and it is worrying that people are suffering from depression.  Things could be much better if they were allowed to transfer home.  There is no comparable legislation here, which is the point made by the Department of Justice and Equality.  Perhaps the committee can examine this matter.</p></speech>

I have met people who were given a two-year tariff and ten years later they were still in prison.  To take that example, after two years the parole board would meet and decide on the single criterion of risk, or whether the prisoner poses a risk to him- or herself or the public.  Beyond that there is no interest, and the board would not even be interested in what else the prisoner has done for a number of years, except if he or she has been doing courses.  Many of the prisoners are in prisons where the courses required by the parole board are unavailable.  They must move around prisons, which lengthens the process.</p><p>  I was asked whether we put any pressure on the British authorities, but there is no point in doing so because they have made it very clear to me, and the first secretary at the Irish Embassy in London, that when the imprisonment for public protection sentence was abolished in December 2012, the process would not be retrospective.  When I asked the obvious question about what would happen to people serving a sentence, I was told very clearly by the senior official in the British Home Office that they would be the responsibility of the parole board, which is what I feared would happen.  These prisoners will have to satisfy the parole board with a view to getting released, which can take a very long time.</p></speech>

Could there be some kind of transfer programme?  I am a very strong believer in sentencing, and a life sentence should mean life rather than just 12 or 15 years.  In Ireland the minimum sentence for certain crimes should be increased, but that is a different day's work.  It has been mentioned that there are 12 or 15 IPP prisoners stuck over there.  We should do much more work on this.</p></speech>

McFlynn for coming before us.  This is not really an area in which I had a great deal of knowledge so I thank them for the correspondence, which I read with interest.  I did some research this morning on IPP, as it is the main stumbling block for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Justice and Equality.  If individuals are determined to be too dangerous to be released following sentences in the UK, what kinds of crime are involved?  The witnesses mentioned a dozen or so individuals eligible for repatriation in what I presume is another arrangement with the UK or other countries.  We must be specific as we are talking about a tiny minority who in this instance are imprisoned in Britain.</p></speech>

The offences range from murder to manslaughter to armed robbery and rape.  There are also minor offences involved, as there is a sliding scale regarding the nature of offences.  Having said that, if somebody is given a two-year tariff for an IPP, one would wonder how serious is the offence.</p></speech>

People are given an IPP sentence for something deemed by the courts to be serious.  That being the case, the people in question are given a programme of courses to do in order to rehabilitate them and help them pass through the prison system in such a way that they can change their lifestyle when they emerge.  We have mentioned a couple of times that many prisons do not provide these courses.  With the cutbacks happening now, there will be fewer of these courses available.</p></speech>

The system in England and Wales is undergoing enormous change, and there are more changes to take place in the next 12 months in the prison system in England and Wales than have taken place in the past 15 years.  The first part relates to the configuration of prisons, as many smaller prisons are being closed, larger prisons are being built and there is also the business of privatising the prison sector.  That means there will be the equivalent to American "Titan" prisons, which are large enough to accommodate 1,500 or 2,000 prisoners.  The prisoners are being moved further from home and kept in prisons where they will be just a number rather than a person.  Many of the prisons will be run by the private sector.  It is no accident that the three largest prisons currently in England and Wales are in the private sector.  That is the way the sector is going.</p><p>  This is a British problem so perhaps we should not be discussing it here.  It is nonetheless having a serious impact on Irish prisoners, the same as everybody else.  With regard to the seriousness of the offences, there are 5,800 prisoners currently on IPP sentences in England and Wales.  It is a British problem and they are having to deal with it as best they can, although it seems they are not able to deal with it very well.  This is not helped by the fact that the privatisation of prisons is continuing apace and their configuration is changing as well.  The cutbacks in legal aid will also affect people, as will the outsourcing of the probation service to the private sector.  The prison system in England and Wales is now a business, with the emphasis on making money.</p></speech>

It is always preferable for an offender to serve a sentence in an area where they have family ties.  If people return to Ireland after being released from prison, it would be much better for them to serve a sentence here and released into a community where they have social supports.  As the Deputy is aware, it is Government policy that a prisoner should always be able to serve a sentence close to family where it is possible.  The crime issue, while important, does not affect a right to apply for repatriation or the need for same.</p></speech>

In terms of the human rights element of the incarceration, in order for somebody to face a parole board they are not able to meet the criteria set out because of the nature of the facilities in which they are being housed.  Is there a human rights infringement there, aside from a British or an Irish one, and is there an international human rights element that the council might be considering?  My next question is not necessarily in regard to IPP but about some of the more exotic locations where Irish citizens are currently imprisoned.  Are there any questions in regard to their human rights, specifically on the quality of the prisons and-or the living environment in which they are housed?  I would imagine that a Catholic organisation would be extremely interested and involved in that process in other countries.  Perhaps the delegates would like to like to respond. </p></speech>

I think it is that reverse burden that actually led to the IPP sentence being abolished, that prisoners had taken that case themselves, as Fr. McFlynn said, to the European Court which said that was not legitimate.  Obviously that is an issue about which we would be concerned.  As Fr. McFlynn said that legal aid is now being abolished.  Many of the prisoners who would have taken cases on the basis of these issues may not now be in a position to take cases.  That is something else we are working on and are concerned about.  I agree there is a human rights issue there, a much broader issue that we need to look at in more detail.</p><p>  In regard to the human rights of Irish prisoners in areas such as South and Central America and in Asia, specifically, we would be very concerned for prisoners in those locations.  Prison conditions can be extremely poor.  Many of our clients there might have limited access to food and water, basic necessities, medical and dental treatment.  We have clients who suffer serious health problems as a result of the prison conditions.  Safety is obviously a major cause of concern.  We have some clients in prisons where there are no guards within the prison; they are guarded from the outside.  I think everyone is familiar with those type of prisons in South and Central America.  We are very concerned about and it is an issue we are always working on for those clients.  As Deputy McGrath said earlier, the Department of Foreign Affairs is absolutely fantastic and does a wonderful job, in particular the embassies and consulars responsible for people in those locations, but it is always a struggle.  One of the things we do is provide financial support for prisoners in these locations.  They need that financial support to buy food and water.  In some prisons they might have to rent their cell or rent a mattress - all of those extreme things.  We are extremely involved in those cases in South and Central America and Asia.</p></speech>

We have seen scenes like that in the movies but I do not necessarily think the general public is aware how bad it is in certain places.  My last question which is on costs is possibly the reason a decision has not been made by the Irish Government to repatriate certain prisoners.  If there are certain individuals in the UK, in particular, for whom it has been determined unsafe for them to be released and we are potentially talking about repatriating them to a country that does not have similar laws - admittedly it has been rescinded in the UK , but as Fr. McFlynn said there are 5,500 still imprisoned for public protection tariffs - what is the position?  If, for argument sake, an individual who is currently serving an IPP sentence is repatriated to Ireland, how long would that person serve, or who decides; would it be the parole board?  What I am trying to ascertain is how the British authorities would determine how long to recommend to the Irish Prison Service or the Irish courts system if the individual is being repatriated and, dare I say it, who would bear the cost?  If a person commits a crime in a foreign jurisdiction obviously that jurisdiction would bear the cost of the imprisonment.  I have an anecdotal figure which I will not mention, as I am not sure if it is correct, but the cost of detaining a person in prison on an annual basis is not a small amount.  I understand we are talking about a small number of people and their human rights.  I fully understand and recognise the importance of repatriating a person to bring him or her closer to his or her family for the purposes of rehabilitation.  However, I would have a concern that we might be opening a door.  I accept fully what Fr. McFlynn said about the number being very small but I would still have a concern.</p></speech>

As to what would happen with prisoners coming back to Ireland, that would be a matter for the Irish Prison Service.  The British authorities would not be in a position, given that it no longer issues IPP sentences, to dictate to anybody here how long a person would have to serve.  It would really be a matter for the Irish Prison Service to decide whether to keep them for a limited period or to release them.</p></speech>

If it was a five year sentence here and the person was sent over after two years the person would serve the following three years in prison in their own country.  That is the international agreement that I understand exists.  The difference here is that when the tariff time is completed and the person is still in prison in Britain because it has been deemed unsafe to release them and they are sent to Ireland, we cannot lock them up because the tariff is completed.  If a person is sent here after the tariff time is completed they are virtually being freed, while at the same the British authorities would have deemed it unsafe to release them because of the public protection approach.  Is that where we are at?</p></speech>

As I mentioned, the Council of Europe convention provides for the conversion of a sentence.  As I do not know the particular legal issue I am not sure if that is something that could be amended to specifically allow for this situation but we would hope the sentence could be adapted to a sentence for an equivalent offence under Irish law.  Obviously we will have equivalent offences and, therefore, there should be some facility to adapt the sentence.  Perhaps I can get back to the question on costs.  Costs is an issue that needs to be taken into account.  Under the transfer legislation, cost is not an issue that is mentioned and I do not think that should be a bar to people having the right to apply for repatriation.  Irish citizens should be entitled to apply for transfer to an Irish prison if they meet the criteria.  I would not like costs to be a bar to that.</p></speech>
