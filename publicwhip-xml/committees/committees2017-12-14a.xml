Apologies have been received from Deputies Pat Deering, Mary Lou McDonald and Alan Kelly.</p><p>The first item on the agenda is the minutes of the meeting of 30 November 2017.  Are they agreed?  Agreed.  Are there any matters arising?  As there are no matters arising we will move on to correspondence.  There are three categories of correspondence.  Category A is the briefing documents and opening statements.  Is it agreed that we note those?  Agreed.</p><p>No. 984A,<b></b>from Department of Finance, is the opening statement for today's meeting.  Is it agreed that we note and publish it?  Agreed.</p><p>Next we have correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow-up to PAC meetings and other items for publishing.  No. 963B was carried over from last week's meeting.  It is<b></b>from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, and provides additional information that was sought at the committee meeting on 16 November 2017 in relation to education and training boards, ETBs.  We have received a considerable amount of information which has been circulated.  I suggest we hold this over again until the new year.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>No. 965B was carried over from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills and is dated 4 December 2017.  It provides further details as requested by the committee regarding the progress made in relation to the contributions being made by religious congregations <font color="#00201F">towards the costs incurred by the State in responding to residential institutional child abuse.</font>This is an ongoing process so we will request the Department to keep the committee updated on this.  Deputy Connolly may wish to comment on the information that has been provided.</p></speech>

A number of buildings are outstanding under both schemes, namely, the 2002 scheme and the 2009 scheme.</p></speech>

Agreed.</p><p>No. 969B is<b></b>from Mr. Paul Quinn, chief procurement officer, Office of Government Procurement, and is dated 5 December 2017.  It provides a note on the purchase-to-pay card system, as requested by the committee at the meeting on 16 November 2017 in response to a reference to the system by Sean Ashe, the CEO of the Kildare and Wicklow ETB.  The correspondence states the system is particularly useful where a public body has a high volume of low value purchases where otherwise there would be a considerable volume of purchase requisitions, purchase orders and invoices, among other documentation.  The system seeks to reduce costs for public bodies and suppliers and ensure prompt payment to suppliers.  Is it agreed that we note that and publish it?  Agreed.</p><p>No. 971B is from Graham Doyle, Secretary General, Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and is dated 6 December 2017.  It provides information as requested by the committee on the cost of St. Francis Bridge which is part of the Kilkenny central access scheme.  I propose to send this reply to the correspondent who raised the matter.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>No. 973B is from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills.  It is dated 6 December 2017 and relates to the legislative basis for the employment of teachers.  This information is in response to a request from the committee for information regarding the terms and conditions of employment of State employees and in particular teachers who are paid by the State but are not directly employed by the State.  I propose to forward the reply to the correspondent who made the inquiry and members may wish to study the document.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>

Nos. 974B and 980B are two items of correspondence from multinational companies which I propose we hold over for the moment and come back to when we have all of the correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>No. 975B<b></b>is from Ms Carol Hanney, chief executive of the City of Dublin ETB and is dated 7 December 2017.  It provides follow-up as requested by the committee at the meeting with the ETBs on 16 November 2017.  The information provided includes a breakdown of fees and travel expenses; a note on the key performance indicators in place and how they are managed and; a note on the training provided to staff at the level of higher executive officer and upwards and school principals on corporate governance.  Is it agreed that we note and publish this?  Agreed.</p><p>No. 976B is from Ms Angela Black, chief executive of the Citizens Information Board, and is dated 8 December 2017.  It is in relation to information requested by the committee regarding the restructuring of the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budget Service, MABS.  In summary, the decision to restructure MABS into eight regional companies was made on 15 February 2017, following a feasibility study in September 2014 and a decision by the board in November 2014 to restructure MABS and citizen information services to provide better governance arrangements for 51 MABS services and 42 citizen information service companies across the country.</p><p>According to the note, service users will not see any change in the services they receive and they will go to the same place, be looked after by the same people and get the same level of service as they currently receive.  Deputy Aylward raised the matter but he is not present.  Does anyone else wish to comment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-14a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017121400002#B01700"><p>His concerns are not just unique to one location.  There is a general concern about this but obviously a decision has already been taken.  The concern is about the loss of the local connection but as the decision has already been taken I do not think there is a lot we can do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-14a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017121400002#B01800"><p>We have two options.  We can hold over this matter.</p></speech>

In fairness to Deputy Aylward, it would be good if we could hold over this matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-14a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017121400002#B02000"><p>Is that agreed?  Agreed.  No. 977B is from Ms Fionuala McGeever, chief executive of Tipperary ETB.  It is dated 8 December 2017 and provides follow-up as requested by the committee at the meeting with ETBs on 16 November 2017.  Matters dealt with include Ferryhouse school, key performance indicators, use of a building in Thurles and details of corporate governance training for staff.  Is it agreed that we note this?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 981B is dated 12 December 2017.  It is from Mr. Des Carville, head of the shareholding and financial advisory division in the Department of Finance in relation to our meeting scheduled for today and difficulties caused by a High Court action on the IBRC liquidation.  I propose we just note the item for the moment and deal with the matter in that part of the meeting.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 982B is dated 12 December 2017 and is from Deputy Marc MacSharry on the correspondence just referred to from the Department of Finance.  Likewise, I propose we deal with this in that part of the meeting dealing with the IBRC liquidation.  Is Deputy MacSharry happy to do that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-14a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1346" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017121400002#B02100"><p>That is perfect.  We can do it altogether.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-14a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017121400002#B02200"><p>Correspondence 985B (i) and (ii) is dated 13 December 2017.  It is a copy of a letter from the Department of Finance to the IBRC special liquidators.  Again, I propose that we note it and discuss all of that correspondence when we get to that part of the meeting.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  We now move on to category C, correspondence from and related to private individuals and any other correspondence.</p><p>Item No. 964C of 4 December 2017 relates to an incident in the Irish Prison Service in 1988.  The individual was dismissed from the service in 1989, the committee requested the Minister for Justice to respond to previous correspondence from this individual and when the reply from the Minister, reference 923C, was considered on 24 November 2017 it was agreed to send a reply to the individual.  The Minister in his correspondence encouraged the individual to make information that he had in regard to the murder of a prison officer available to the Garda.  The individual has been in touch again with the secretariat and today&rsquo;s item is additional information in relation to his general situation.  While we are sympathetic to the individual&rsquo;s case, we have sought and got a clear response from the Minister which we have passed on to the individual.  It is not within our remit to take the matter of an individual&rsquo;s dismissal from his employment further.  I propose that we write to the individual accordingly.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> Correspondence item No. 968C is from Ms Orla O'Connor, National Women's Council of Ireland, dated 5 December 2017 in response to a request from the committee for information regarding its public funding.  Ms O&rsquo;Connor states that the audited accounts, which are audited by independent auditors, are approved by the membership every year at the AGM.  The matter which an individual had raised with the committee was whether it was permissible for the National Women&rsquo;s Council to use public funds to fund a pro-choice campaign.  The correspondence from Ms O'Connor does not directly address that issue and I suggest we write to her for clarification.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> Correspondence item No. 970C from Mr. Padraig Corkery, communications and public affairs manager, NAMA, dated 5 December 2017, regards further information requested by the committee in relation to a hotel in Kinsale, County Cork.  I propose to send this reply to the original correspondent and to advise the correspondent that the committee&rsquo;s consideration of the matter is closed.  Is that agreed? Agreed.</p><p> Correspondence item 978C(i) and (ii) is a copy of correspondence sent to Deputy Andrew Doyle, Minister of State, from an individual received on 8 December 2017 regarding public funding of the Irish Horse Welfare Trust.  The secretariat had previously written to the Department of Agriculture on this and will follow the matter up.  Can we note the correspondence?  Noted.</p><p> Correspondence item No. 979C is from councillors R&eacute;ada Cronin and Nicola Lawless, members of Kildare and Wicklow ETB, dated 24 November 2017 in relation to our meeting with Kildare and Wicklow ETB on 16 November 2017.  They raise concerns about evidence given to the committee at the meeting.  I propose to forward this correspondence to Dr. Richard Thorn and request him to address it in his briefing to the committee when we meet him in the new year and which we have put into our work programme.</p></speech>

It was agreed that we would put it in our work programme.  We intend to meet him after he has completed his report.  We can talk to him about his published report at that stage.  There are three items we are hoping to discuss with Dr. Thorn, namely, the report; issues in respect of the University of Limerick; and the advice he gave to the CEO and chair of Kildare and Wicklow ETB.</p></speech>

My understanding is that Dr. Thorn is continuing with his work.  Previous correspondence from councillors and members of the board has been forwarded to him and there is more information today, which will be sent on.  We are not going to meet him until after his report has been completed.  One of the areas of concern we have is over his interaction with members of the ETB.  Are we happy for him to continue with his work and to meet him afterwards, or could we write to the Department expressing a concern about the process?</p></speech>

On the screen now are five accounts and statements received since the last meeting, on 7 December 2017.  We can take them individually or simply note and agree them.  Regarding University College Dublin, the document is dated 30 September 2016 and the relevant sum is &euro;480 million.  There is a clear audit opinion but attention is drawn to the recognition of a deferred pension funding asset standing for universities and non-competitive procurement, of &euro;8.5 million, of goods and services.  I propose that we seek an explanation note on both of those items and write to those concerned directly.</p></speech>

It is the same issue that arises with all the universities.  We should deal with the second.</p></speech>

The second item is where the statement on internal financial control discloses non-competitive procurement above a certain threshold.  We draw attention to that in the audit report.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-14a.65" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017121400002#D00600"><p>This comes up time and again.  It is an issue we have addressed in general terms as a committee.  Every time it arises, we should certainly follow up with correspondence and ask for an explanation as why there is non-competitive procurement.  It is important to do so.  On both issues, particularly the second, we can stress the importance of an explanation and seek one.  Is that agreed?</p> <p>  The position on Ollscoil na h&Eacute;ireann, Gaillimh, is similar.  There was a clear audit opinion but, again, attention is drawn to the recognition of a deferred pension funding asset and non-competitive procurement, of &euro;600,000, of goods and services.  Again, I propose that we write to the college and seek an explanation.</p></speech>

Perhaps it is a small percentage overall.  We will not know until we examine the figures again.  It is about perception, however.  People on the ground supplying services must have confidence in the system.  It is important that we follow up on this regardless of the amount.</p></speech>

The remaining three accounts concern the Arts Council, Cavan and Monaghan Education and Training Board and Tipperary Education and Training Board.  In respect of all three, there is a clear audit opinion.  Can we note and agree these?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The draft work programme for 2018 is on the screen.  I propose that we have a further discussion later today as there are a couple of items related to our work programme that we will deal with in private session.  I am sure the Chairman would like to be in the Chair when we deal with the work programme.  Is it agreed to come back to that later?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Unless there is any other business before we move to the substantial part of the meeting, we will suspend for a few minutes to allow our witnesses from the Department of Finance to take their seats.</p></speech>

We are joined by the following officials from the Department of Finance: Mr. Des Carville, Assistant Secretary, head of the shareholding and advisory division; Mr. Gary Tobin, Assistant Secretary, banking division; Mr. Scott Rankin, deputy head of the shareholding and advisory division; Mr. Gary Hynds, principal officer, equivalent, shareholding and advisory division; Mr. Eoin Dorgan, principal officer, banking division; and Mr. David Tuohy, shareholding and advisory division.  They are all very welcome.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off.</p><p>I advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 186 that the committee shall also refrain from enquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.</p><p>There is an item we wish to bring to witnesses' attention before we proceed.  There were a number of items of correspondence this week on today's meeting that the committee noted earlier.  One was received on Tuesday from the Department in regard to our consideration of the liquidation of IBRC.  The Department advises us that the matter is now before the High Court.  As a result, the Department informed us it could not discuss the liquidation and that because of the case, the liquidators would not be in attendance.</p><p>However, we wrote to the liquidators again yesterday, insisting that it should attend, but it has written to say that it is adhering to its legal advice and cannot attend at present.  This will be an issue of concern for some members, so I propose that if members want to raise issues on those items of correspondence as part of their contributions they can be given extra time and latitude.  We will not count it as a separate item but will deal with it in the contributions they make.  Is that agreed?  </p></speech>

The economic impacts of the measures are both complex and long term.  Chapter 3 was compiled to provide an estimate, as at end-2016, of the net financial cost of the measures.  The chapter updates a previous report which gave the position as at the end of 2014.</p> <p>  The sums involved in recapitalising banks, including covering their losses, are relatively straightforward to identify.  Income accruing from the investments, and capital repayments or disposals of investments, are also generally clear.  Less easy to identify are the costs incurred by the State in funding the investments, which are substantial.  Estimation procedures are required to identify those funding costs, and in arriving at a valuation of the State's residual interest in banking assets. </p> <p>  The results of the examination analysis are summarised in figure 3.1 in the chapter.  The overall investment in the banks, including the value of shares accepted in lieu of dividends, totalled &euro;66.8 billion.  That resulted in additional State borrowing and the utilisation of State investment funds, at an estimated cost of &euro;14.8 billion up to the end of 2016.  Against that were receipts totalling just over &euro;25 billion from disposals of shares, income from the investments, fees for bank liability guarantees and related Central Bank surpluses. </p> <p>  By the end of 2016, the estimated net cost to the State of measures taken to stabilise the banking system was &euro;56.5 billion.  When the estimated value at that date of the State&rsquo;s remaining shareholdings in the banks and NAMA&rsquo;s projected surplus are taken into account, the estimated net outturn is a cost of around &euro;39.9 billion.</p> <p>  After taking account of the estimated residual value of the State&rsquo;s holdings in the financial institutions, the estimated net outturn, as at 31 December 2016, for each institution is as shown in figure 1.</p> <p>  We estimated that, up to 31 December 2016, support for the IBRC had cost the State a net &euro;35.8 billion, support for AIB had cost a net &euro;7.9 billion, support for Permanent TSB cost a net &euro;1 billion, and there was a net surplus of &euro;1.8 billion in respect of the State&rsquo;s support for Bank of Ireland.</p> <p>  The projected &euro;3 billion in receipts arising from the winding up of NAMA offsets a part of those net losses but cannot be attributed across the rescued institutions.  I emphasise that all those estimates are at a point in time, and that the final cost of the measures will not be identifiable for some time to come.  In particular, the cost of servicing residual banking-related State debt will be an ongoing economic cost.  It is estimated that this cost will be around &euro;1.7 billion for 2017.  In the longer term, this cost is estimated at between &euro;1 billion and &euro;1.4 billion annually, if the State&rsquo;s average cost of borrowing is in the range 2.5% to 3.5% a year.  To put that in context, the NTMA&rsquo;s average cost of borrowing was around 3% at end June 2017.</p> <p>  Of course, other factors will also be at play in determining the final overall cost of the stabilisation measures.  These will include the amount the State ultimately realises from the disposal of its remaining bank investments, and the period for which the Central Bank continues to hold Government bonds related to redemption of the IBRC promissory notes.</p></speech>

With me this morning are Mr. Gary Tobin, Assistant Secretary General in the banking division in the Department of Finance, Mr. Scott Rankin, deputy head of the shareholding and financial advisory division, Mr. Gary Hynds, senior banking specialist in the shareholding and financial advisory division, Mr Eoin Dorgan, principal officer in the banking division, and Mr. David Tuohy, banking specialist in the shareholding and financial advisory division.</p> <p>  I will focus on chapter 3 of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report on the accounts of the public service 2016.  Chapter 3 of this report deals with the cost of the banking stabilisation measures as at year end 2016.  From its invitation to the Department of Finance, I understand that the committee particularly wished to discuss the special liquidation of IBRC and specifically the costs incurred as part of the liquidation.  However, as per my letter to the committee dated 12 December 2017, having consulted with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, unfortunately we are not in a position to respond to queries concerning the costs associated with the special liquidation given that these matters are now the subject of dispute in the High Court awaiting determination.  This is as a result of the Department of Finance being served with a plenary summons on 8 December 2017 seeking declaratory reliefs against the Minister for Finance with regard to a number of matters pertaining to the terms and conditions of remuneration and expenses of the special liquidators and their oversight by the Department.  We have shared the plenary summons with the committee so it will appreciate its scope.  While the special liquidators were due to attend with us today, their legal advice is that it would not be appropriate for them to be present.  We have shared the correspondence between the Department and the special liquidators in this regard with the committee for full transparency.</p> <p>  We are very disappointed and frustrated that we are not able to discuss the costs of the liquidation as this is a topic in which we invest considerable efforts to ensure that the taxpayer is getting value for money.  We warmly welcome the committee&rsquo;s interest in this topic as we recognise that the absolute quantum of fees are, on the face of it, large.  It was for this reason that in 2014 the first of four detailed reports were published to provide transparency on the work streams associated with the special liquidation and the associated costs of each of these work streams.</p></speech>

The gross cost of recapitalising the banking system during the period 2009-2011 stands at &euro;66.8 billion, which was funded through a combination of funding from the Exchequer and National Pension Reserve Fund.  Taking into account the cost of servicing the debt to end of 2016 of &euro;14.8 billion and the income earned on investments to the end of 2016 of &euro;25.1 billion, the net cost estimated by the Comptroller and Auditor General was &euro;56.5 billion as at the end of 2016.  When the estimated value at that date of the State&rsquo;s remaining shareholdings in AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB - a combined &euro;13.6 billion - and NAMA&rsquo;s projected surplus of &euro;3 billion are taken into account, the estimated net outturn at the end of 2016 is a cost of around &euro;39.9 billion.  This shows a reduction of approximately &euro;3 billion since this analysis was last conducted at the end of 2014, which reflects additional receipts of &euro;5 billion and the recognition of the estimated &euro;3 billion surplus now expected when NAMA winds down in 2020.  This was offset by the increase in the cost of debt servicing associated with these investments by &euro;6.1 billion over the period. </p> <p>  At the end of 2016 the value in the State&rsquo;s shareholdings in the three quoted banks was &euro;13.6 billion.  Since then the State realised &euro;3.4 billion from the initial public offering, IPO, of AIB in June this year leaving it with a 71% remaining shareholding in that bank.  The IPO of AIB was managed by the Department and was the second largest IPO globally in 2017, the largest in Europe in 2017 and the largest on the London Stock Exchange since 2011 as measured by the level of funds raised.</p><p>As of the close of business on 12 December 2017, the market value of our remaining investments in these banks stood at &euro;12.4 billion, indicating a net increase in the value of our shareholdings since the end of 2016 of almost &euro;2.2 billion when the proceeds from the AIB IPO are taken into consideration.</p><p> In respect of banking stabilisation-related Central Bank income, for the years 2009 to 2016 the examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General has estimated that in the region of &euro;7.7 billion of the Central Bank's surplus income of &euro;12.5 billion was attributable to financial instruments held as a result of banking stabilisation measures taken by the State.  These financial instruments were in the form of exceptional liquidity assistance and Government bonds held by the Central Bank.  The report estimates that 97% of the &euro;7.7 billion portion of the Central Bank&rsquo;s surplus income for the years 2009 to 2016 is attributable to transactions between the Central Bank and IBRC. </p><p> Subsequent to the liquidation of IBRC in February 2013, the Central Bank acquired just over &euro;25 billion of floating rate notes, FRNs, and &euro;3.46 billion of fixed rate treasury bonds.  Between 2013 and 2016, the Central Bank earned net interest of &euro;2.7 billion from the bonds and realised gains of &euro;3.2 billion from the disposal of some of these bonds.  The Central Bank stated in its 2016 annual report that it intends to sell the remaining floating rate bonds as soon as possible, provided conditions of financial stability permit. </p><p> As at 13 December 2017, the bank has so far disposed of &euro;9.5 billion nominal of the floating rate notes, significantly exceeding its minimum targets outlined in 2013.  While the pace of these disposals is significantly ahead of the minimum schedule, it is positive that the NTMA is locking in current low market rates now rather than some time in the future, at which point rates could be higher.  Furthermore, the cancellation of these bonds will also increase the amount of Irish debt that the ECB can purchase in the sovereign debt markets, which should help in further reducing the cost of the State&rsquo;s borrowing.  Notwithstanding these positives, clearly this acceleration needs to balance the negative consequences of the purchase and cancellation which includes the potential creation of excess supply in the market and the forgoing to the State of ongoing Central Bank profits related to these bonds. </p><p> The debt-related cost to the State associated with the investments in the bank was in the region of &euro;14.8 billion over the period 2009 to 2016.  These costs are estimated by the Comptroller and Auditor General and reflect the additional annual debt servicing costs and other related costs incurred by the State as a result of the borrowings used to invest in the banks. </p><p> The Comptroller and Auditor General highlights that the Exchequer continues to incur the cost of servicing the debt associated with the net &euro;56.5 billion cost of the investments in the banks and the report estimates that this cost is likely to be in the region of &euro;1.7 billion for 2017 with over &euro;1 billion of this in respect of IBRC and a further &euro;0.6 billion in respect of AIB.  The ongoing annual cost of servicing the debt associated with Permanent TSB is estimated at around &euro;50 million per annum.  The State has recouped its investment in Bank of Ireland and therefore incurs no ongoing debt servicing costs in respect of Bank of Ireland.</p><p> The long-term cost of servicing the debt associated with the bank investments will depend on a number of factors, including the amount the State realises from its remaining investments; the period for which the Central Bank continues to hold government bonds; and the cost of funding for the State as it refinances existing debt when it matures.  The State guaranteed certain bank liabilities under three main schemes, namely, the deposit guarantee scheme, the credit institutions (financial support) scheme, and the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme.  By the end of 2016, the State had received net income in the region of &euro;3.7 billion under the schemes with the majority of this relating to the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme.  Included in this figure is &euro;280 million received as an interim dividend from the special liquidators of IBRC and it is expected a second interim dividend of &euro;280 million will be received in the next few weeks following the announcement last week of a further 25% payment to admitted unsecured creditors of IBRC. </p><p> In respect of NAMA, its board has approved a projected terminal surplus of up to &euro;3 billion over the course of its life, which is dependent on favourable market conditions being maintained when realising remaining assets.  This surplus will be paid to the Exchequer to reduce the overall cost of banking stabilising measures. </p><p> I thank the Chairman and committee for their attention.  I hope members will appreciate that the stance adopted by the Department today is in the interests of protecting the position of the State in the proceedings that have been brought against it.  I would welcome any follow-on questions.</p></speech>

There were two pieces of correspondence that came in after I had emailed my concerns on 13 December.  What times on the 13th did they come in?  There was one from the Department of Finance, I think, and one from IBRC, the joint special liquidators.  Which one came at 15:57?  Was that the one from the Department?</p></speech>

The other letter came in on the 12th, informing us of the plenary summons seeking declaration reliefs.  From my layman's point of view, and I stand to be corrected if I am wrong, a declaration relief is where the Minister is not being sued for money or such recourse.  If the person wins the case, the court will make declarations to do with how the liquidation is going.  Costs is what the State would lose in the event that the person wins the case.  It is unfortunate they took it last Thursday.</p> <p>  When I wrote to raise issues, I wanted to know if we had invited the special joint liquidators individually.  I think we did not do so, which is unfortunate.  That was what I intended when I raised this last September.  The Department of Finance replied on 12 December saying it that in light of developments, the special liquidators would not be coming either.  Then we have this email going in and the timing of it.  To me, it looks choreographed.  I raised the question of why the Department is telling the special liquidators what to do.  It is matter for them if they come in.  They are not party to these proceedings.  They are not named in the proceedings against the Minister.  They should be here.</p> <p>  It was implied that the Attorney General was advising them and I raised that point.  Then, lo and behold, we got a letter saying they had their own legal advice but they understood the Attorney General was advising the Department of the same.  It looks grubby.  It looks like there is collusion between the three.  Frankly, as is so often the case these days, it looks like this is being used as a device for bodies that are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General to opt not to answer questions.</p> <p>  While I appreciate on a personal level Mr. Carville's saying he is disappointed he cannot talk about this, I have steam coming out my ears when I hear him say so.  The practice we see here is one of avoidance, with bodies saying they cannot answer our questions.  Maybe Mr. Carville is being absolutely genuine and I will take him at his word.  However, we had education and training boards, ETBs, coming in here saying they would not say anything because of legal advice.  We had the Acting Garda Commissioner saying he would not talk about a liaison committee.  We had a previous Garda Commissioner referring something to GSOC late at night to avoid answering questions on an issue here.</p> <p>  The Government may as well abolish the Committee of Public Accounts for the disdain and contempt with which it is frequently treated.  Ultimately, our responsibility here is not votes.  There are not many votes going for being on the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is about putting in hours of reading and research to try to pursue things that have nothing to do with one's constituency.</p><p>It is about taxpayers' money and, in this instance, it is about &euro;222 million of taxpayers' money as of the end of 2016.  Mr. Carville is disappointed that the liquidators cannot come in.  I am bound to conclude that there was collusion between the Office of the Attorney General, the Department of Finance and the special liquidators to come in today and say how disappointed they are that something cannot be discussed.  There was no stopping whoever it was in the Department who yesterday rushed to tell the <i>Irish Independent</i>that everything was perfect - a Department official was quoted in an article by Shane Phelan - yet nothing can be said today.  I have a serious problem with this.  The new way of avoiding questions when appearing at the Committee of Public Accounts is simply to say that one has legal advice and cannot say anything.  It is a disgraceful abuse of that term in the Civil Service and in Departments.  It is so often the practice.  What would one say in here when explaining the expenditure of taxpayers' money that one would not say in the courts?  The Department has its legal advice from the Attorney General.  The joint special liquidators are saying they have their legal advice.  I have mine too.  <br/><br/>Notwithstanding what the Chair might tell me as we go, I will proceed to ask my questions.  In the event that I am ruled out of order, I will be ruled out of order.  However, I see no reason that any question I am about to ask the witness should not be answered.  There is no reason whatsoever.  I would like him to take that on board.  I would also like him to bring back to Merrion Street that I for one, as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts for however long I will be here, will not be putting up with the constant disdain and contempt being shown for this committee, the only constitutional committee of the State where witnesses are under the auspices of the Comptroller and Auditor General and where it is our job to ask questions of them.  I know the answer to this but, for the record, why is the Secretary General, the Accounting Officer, not here? </p></speech>

This is very important.  We negotiate contracts with service providers, for example, investment banks.  Let us use that as an example.  It is a good example because it is similar to hiring an accountancy firm such as KPMG.  If we agree certain terms and conditions for a specific contract, it could become a race to the bottom if that contract was publically available.  The next investment bank or service provider coming to us would look for those terms and try to chip on those terms again.  I am not convinced that is in the interests of taxpayers.</p></speech>

Do we have oversight in the Department?  Let me put it a different way.  Is there expertise in the Department that could challenge something like that?  Could someone in the Department decide that a team of three partners and two juniors on a case is too much and that one partner and one junior, or an accounts clerk or one basic chartered accountant would be enough?  Does the Department have expertise to challenge that?</p></speech>

I asked all of these questions in the parliamentary questions I tabled in September.  I got no answers in terms of scrutiny, and this was before any case.  That led me to believe there was no scrutiny, particularly without a committee of inspection.  I have no reason to think the situation has changed despite the fine expertise of KPMG, the same firm as the liquidator.  It is a great firm.  The Minister responded and stated should the officials have any queries related to the professional fees associated with the liquidator or other costs incurred the matter would be raised during these update meetings.  There are update meetings with the liquidators.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

We can issue directions to the special liquidators.  My understanding from memory is if we have a problem with a fee we can issue a direction.  We are effectively like the High Court or the Taxing Master.  That is my understanding.

We discuss things on a more formal basis at the regular scheduled meetings.  It would be natural to expect that to include fees.</p></speech>

When they were appointed, the liquidators had expectations or budgets on costs, and when I think back the work was actually much more complex than any of us envisaged.

It is not the rates per hour.  We know those.  It is about how many people are working at those rates and who is checking the amount of people per task.  How many people are involved and how many hours are they putting into particular tasks, and who is checking that and scrutinising it?  In the absence of a committee of inspection I am not sure anybody is.  The case being taken prevented me getting the answers I wanted last Friday.  I received waffle answers to the 20 parliamentary questions I asked on 9 and 11 September, about having regular updates and meetings and if the Department has issues it can raise them there, and about commercially sensitive stuff that the people are entitled to know, even though we only know the cost per hour.  Because of the amount of money involved in this the public is entitled to an awful lot more, and the complexion and choreography of correspondence this week does not give me any confidence that there is not something to see here.  What have we got to hide?</p></speech>

That is why we have produced four very detailed reports.  If there was a committee of inspection, one would not get the equivalent level of information and detail.  As a Department, we are very keen on transparency and openness, which is why we have published four reports.</p></speech>

That is a problem when so much public money is involved.  The complexion on this is that the liquidator is paying itself from recoveries and sales.  It is writing its own cheque which the Minister signs off after the fact.  I know an informal process may exist involving a degree of horse trading on fees but Mr. Carville is telling the committee no direction to reduce fees has been issued to the liquidators.  They really pushed the boat out in terms of the bounds of their charitable instincts and give us a rebate of 2.5% on &euro;222 million.  I have serious problem with this and I would like to make a further contribution on it.</p> <p>  I reiterate that nothing I have said is personal.  Mr. Carville is the conduit on behalf of the Department and I have a job to do on behalf of citizens.  He should not take anything personally. </p></speech>

Mr. Carville stated that &euro;280 million was received in 2016 as an interim dividend, a further 25% payment will be made to the admitted unsecured creditors of IBRC and a further interim dividend of &euro;280 million will be received in the next few weeks.  This is all set out in the opening statement.  The intention to pay an interim dividend is in the public domain and the witnesses are able to discuss that issue.  However, they cannot discuss other matters.  Mr. Carville will accept that members of the public may have difficulty understanding the Jesuitical approach being taken.  I would like to tease this matter out with him.  I note from a letter received from the special liquidator yesterday that representatives of IBRC have been advised not to attend the committee.  The Department's letter essentially states that it is advised that officials from the Department will be available to discuss any other matter today.  Mr. Carville has been advised not to discuss the issue that is before the courts.</p></speech>

Has he been advised that it would better not to discuss it or has he been precluded from discussing it?  There is a big difference between being advised not to do something and being told one may not do something.  The Department has used the word "advised".  My interpretation is that the Attorney General has not told the Department it is precluded from discussing the matter.  I take the same reading from the letter from the special liquidator which refers to advice being given not to attend the meeting.  There is no indication that he is precluded from attending.  Some weeks ago, the chief executive of Wicklow and Kildare Education and Training Board indicated to the committee that he had received advice not to answer questions.  The legal adviser to the committee stated that while the chief executive may have received advice to that effect, he was certainly not precluded from answering questions.  Is Mr. Carville in the same category of having received advice but not being precluded from discussing the matter or has he been precluded from doing so?  Does he understand the difference I am making between being advised and being precluded?</p></speech>

The Chairman used the word "Jesuitical" and I would almost think, in response, that the distinction the Chairman is making is somewhat Jesuitical, with respect.

There is a difference between the two.  The education and training board also informed the committee last week that it had been advised not to answer questions, even though there was nothing to preclude it from doing so.

If I was in a car accident, my insurance company would take charge of the case and tell me not to discuss it.  That is the insurance company taking charge.  We understand the position.</p> <p>   I referred to the second sum of &euro;280 million.  Why is Mr. Carville free to discuss these commercial aspects of the liquidation when he is not free to discuss other aspects of it?  Where has the Department drawn the line between what it can discuss commercially and what information it can and cannot place in the public arena.  </p></speech>

The &euro;280 million which we received last year is a receipt from the special liquidators to the State as an unsecured creditor.  We are an unsecured creditor to about &euro;1.1 billion or &euro;1.2 billion.  The special liquidators have stated they intend or that their expectation is that unsecured creditor claims which are validly accepted by the special liquidators should expect to receive between 75% and 100% of that claim in due course.  This is subject to a whole raft of assumptions behind that.</p></speech>

I think it prejudices our position if we were to make that available because the next person doing something broadly similar would just look for the best possible terms and then try to chip us on other terms.  That becomes a downward spiral for us.</p></speech>

He gave the example of investment banks.  His principal rationale for claiming this is commercially sensitive is that there may be another liquidation or something major of this scale in future and he does not want to disclose this information in case it prejudices the State's negotiations the next time around.  This is a once-off case for which special legislation was introduced in the Oireachtas and on which the Minister has powers to supersede the normal creditors' committee.  Let us hope for everyone's sake that we do not have another one of these cases in our lifetimes.  I expect the Department will ensure this does not recur.</p> <p>  The rationale is that this commercially sensitive but there is nothing commercial sensitive.  It is commercial and there is no sensitivity involved because the fees are publicly available and the amounts to be paid should also be publicly available.  It does not have a knock-on effect because I cannot envisage a similar case arising again, whereas Mr. Carville can envisage another such case where this case could be used as the benchmark.  Is the reason this is commercially sensitive that another project of a similar scale could arise and releasing information now could jeopardise negotiations at a future date?  It is hardly the case that Mr. Carville is aware of such a case and we are not aware of it. </p></speech>

The other side has very sophisticated legal advisers behind it.  It is always trying to drive the best deal that it can get.  That is fine, because that is what it is entitled to do.

The Department only has two WTE staff and maybe a solicitor working on it.  Even if Mr. Carville tells me that one and a half solicitors are working on it, that does not change the complexion from where we sit.  He is telling us that everything the Department is doing is to protect the interests of the State in this liquidation, but the staffing complement gives us zero confidence that those interests as they relate to cost are being adequately protected.</p></speech>

I am satisfied that we have enough staff to deal with what we must do.</p> <p>  The 175 cases are managed by the special liquidators and legal advisers.  That was the number at the end of last year.  I will cite two figures.  One hundred and forty-three cases were pursued against the bank rather than the other way around.  As of yesterday, the 175 cases have decreased to 119.  The special liquidators are doing their job, that is, managing the way through to litigation.  From memory, the figure prior to 175 might have been as high as 500.  I have in mind a figure of 350.  The number has decreased rapidly.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-14a.372" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017121400002#M00200"><p>I also want to register serious concern about the committee not being able to discuss this issue today.  This has been on our work plan for some months.  When one looks at the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, not that one would need to, the one organisation that jumps off the page is IBRC in terms of the totality of what we are dealing with here.  We all know and accept that.  It is pretty exceptional and if it is ever repeated, I think I will be long gone.  One thing that was said around the time of the beef tribunal was that there would have been no need for that tribunal had questions been replied to.  I am looking at what has been sought in the courts - monetary remuneration, a transparent process, monitoring the remuneration and expenses sought for and paid, protecting the interests of the taxpayer, properly and effectively assessing and-or monitoring remuneration of the joint special liquidators' expenses sought and paid etc.  That is what we are looking for.  I do not know how the State can be protected by elongating that process, which is essentially what is happening.  If those issues were addressed, the case before the courts would be moot.  There would be nothing to answer.  I do not understand how the State is protected.  The length of time this will take in the courts is indeterminate but judging by the length of time it takes for cases to go through the courts, particularly a case like this one, we are likely to be looking at least 12 months during which time we will not have oversight.  The period could be even longer.  If this was addressed now, is the State not protected by virtue of the fact that we have transparency and we understand how remuneration is monitored?  I really do not understand the logic of that legal advice.  In the question posed by the Chairman regarding taking advice and whether the Department was restricted in terms of answering, there is real merit in coming back and actually answering those questions because it may short-circuit the process through the courts and engender far more confidence that the Department is dealing with this matter.  That is a comment as opposed to a question but will the Department at least undertake to go back and consider that point with legal advisers because it is not obvious what is being served by delaying this except that the Department answers the questions in the court that it will not answer before the Committee of Public Accounts?  Will the Department at least go back and have that discussion with its legal advisers and perhaps with the Minister?</p></speech>

I am trying to be helpful because we must defend this in due course.  I agree with things like the declaration that the each and all of the defendants have a duty to ensure there is a transparent process for accounting for the remuneration.  There are other ones where the State is accused of failing to do various things.  I disagree absolutely with those.  The Department is hugely frustrated because we really want to answer the committee's questions.  We have a really good story to tell here and we are hugely frustrated that we cannot communicate this today.</p> <p>  In respect of the second point, as this case evolves, we will continually reassess what the legal position is.  Let me try this hypothetical scenario.  Supposing the plaintiff was thinking of filing this claim today and had an opportunity to hear what we had to say before this committee today, I would like to think that the plaintiff might not file the case tomorrow because they would be satisfied today.  Unfortunately, the cart and horse just got transposed in a rather unfortunate way.  </p></speech>

There is an issue with transparency.  Will the Department will go back and talk to its legal advisers and perhaps the Minister about reconsidering the approach it is taking with the committee?

Mr. Carville said that it involved the equivalent of two people at the moment.  It was then stated that prior to that, at the height of it, it involved ten people.  I received documents from the Department under the freedom of information process.  They were heavily redacted but from what I could make out of the pieces I could read - this goes back to 2014 and 2015 - some of the terminology was that a number of very large transactions were poorly executed.  That was after the fact so there was history here relating to how things were handled.  The Department sought to put its own person on the board at that stage.  Then, of course, the liquidation happened.  There was some forewarning of the kind of supervisory role that should have been in place.  When the liquidation happened, and some of us were here until whatever hour of the morning it was dealing with the legislation which was very rushed, did the Department consider an oversight provision, for example, the same way as the Comptroller and Auditor General is embedded in NAMA?  Was that kind of thing considered or was the special liquidator the only thing that was considered?</p></speech>

The role of the special liquidator does not differ from that of a normal liquidator.  His responsibility is to deliver the best value for all creditors in a liquidation.  That is a tried and trusted structure that is in place.  The liquidator stepped into the role of running the bank and effecting transactions from that point on with that in mind, as well as that he has responsibilities to creditors.  We cannot get into the detail of the oversight or what the Department does on a day-to-day basis for the reasons set out in the statement of claim.</p></speech>

Documents I received relating to that period indicate that several very large transactions were poorly executed.  The Department did not cover itself in glory in respect of its supervision in that regard.  Mr. Hynds can understand why consideration might have been given to ensuring some added protection, even for the Department.  Was that considered?</p></speech>

That completely changed on the date of liquidation, when a liquidation phase began, a liquidator was appointed and our oversight changed in that respect.  It is difficult to compare the two periods in that manner.  The relationship framework no longer existed and the special liquidators, whose role was akin that of a normal liquidator governed by the High Court, were appointed.  Our role was to oversee that rather than the courts for reasons we will get into in due course but currently cannot because of the ongoing case.</p></speech>

According to Mr. Carville's opening statement, "it is expected a second interim dividend of &euro;280 million will be received in the next few weeks following the announcement last week of a further 25% payment to admitted unsecured creditors of IBRC".  Is that all unsecured creditors?  How many or which creditors were admitted and what was the basis for that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-14a.396" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Des Carville" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017121400002#N01300"><p>That is a good question.  There is a very involved process when a creditor puts in a claim.  Special liquidators must ensure that every claim is valid and that all of the paperwork stacks up and so on, which protects the interests of taxpayers.  I have the figures to hand in that regard.  The liquidators accepted 1,200 claims, rejected 1,000 and 800 are in progress.  Those figures are slightly rounded.  The most recent update report, issued at the end of February, indicated that 3,000 claims were received and I am just updating those numbers.  For the 1,200 accepted claims, if that is the accepted level as at the record date when the special liquidators decide to make the second payment, the creditor will receive 25% of its accepted claim.  Some creditors were not accepted when the first payment was made and will receive a catch-up payment to bring them to the 50% level.  As soon as a case of the 800 that are in progress is accepted, it will receive a catch-up payment to the 50% level.</p></speech>

The special liquidators have to assist the State in various ongoing criminal prosecutions and there are huge discovery exercises.  They have to assist the commission of investigation and there is an ongoing interest remediation exercise.  They also have to deal with the litigation to which I referred.  They have to sell the remaining &euro;3.5 billion worth of loans for whatever they happen to be worth.  The biggest swing factor is probably the litigation to which I referred.  We focus on the material bits of it because they will move the deal from the State's point of view.  We cannot predict beyond the fact that the figure is expected to be between 75% and 100%, but that is subject to change.</p></speech>

They have been accelerating the sale of the floating rate bonds and are ahead of schedule because of interest rates and the NTMA.  We never had the game changer which was related to the promissory notes.  Have we fully accepted this and has there been any challenge to it?  Is there any follow-up to the commitments that were made but never delivered on?  Is it now over for the Department or is it a political issue?</p></speech>

When it was mooted as a concept, the world was a different place.  We now have a different scenario in which, with the exclusion of IBRC, the shareholdings we have in the banks show on a paper basis a profit of &euro;1.6 billion.  A sum of &euro;64 billion was put into the banks.  We distinguish between the living and the dead, or liquidated banks, in that regard, of which the latter cost &euro;35 billion as per the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  A total of &euro;29.4 billion was put into the three living banks which are quoted.  We expect to get back more than &euro;29 billion; therefore, it offers a better outcome than retrospective recapitalisation would have.</p></speech>

Most of us understood the promissory notes represented money that was being extinguished.  That was the word used when some of us met the Governor of the Central Bank.  I am reminded that Ashoka Mody, one of the people involved on the IMF side in the negotiations for the troika, was quite critical of the way Ireland had been treated.  By turning the floating rate or promissory notes into sovereign debt, as we did in the D&aacute;il, although I did not vote in favour of it, is the Department giving up on any prospect of relief on that front?</p></speech>

The then Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, said in 2016 that the process had been brought to an end.  As Mr. Carville said, the returns achieved on the living banks would not justify the investment.  As the then Minister said, the process for dealing with the promissory notes reflected the best outcome for the State at the time.  A sales schedule has been set out, but it is a matter for the Central Bank to decide independently.  It has stated it is committed to disposing of the floating rate notes as soon as possible, provided financial stability conditions permit.</p></speech>

It is not a reflection on the witnesses but it is certainly a reflection of the Department.  I will come back to the general endorsement of claim that is being served and will pick up on a point made by Deputy Murphy on setting out the plaintiff's claim.  Mr. Carville agreed with two and he could not disagree with them.  There were only eight declarations sought and declarations Nos. 2 and 3 simply set out that the Department has a duty to properly and effectively analyse, assess and so on.  There is no problem with that, I presume.  There is also a declaration of a transparent process.  That leaves six to look at, and we can leave the further or other relief from costs.  From the eight declarations, two are conceded, which relate to duty.  That leaves us with the other few.  As my colleague has stated and I have said repeatedly in the D&aacute;il Chamber, if questions were answered we would not have tribunals of inquiry.  The Department has a duty, as it accepts in the declarations.  There is a duty to outline to members of this committee that there is value for money.  That is not happening at present.  The witnesses have taken a vow of <i>omerta</i>or silence on the basis of advice.  There is a duty to account to us value for money in everything the Department does.</p></speech>

I am not asking the witness to go through the document but I am referring to it because it is on my desk and the witnesses' desk.  It clearly put the cat among the pigeons.  That somebody would have to take a case to ensure accountability is a serious indictment of the failure of the Department of Finance to show it is open and accountable.  These are simple declarations.  The witnesses have acknowledged two of them and the Department must account for that.  Surely that should be part of the process.  The Chairman has already picked up the point about commercial sensitivity.</p> <p>  Let us spell out what we are talking about.  It is what I hope will be a once-off liquidation of this nature.  It refers to Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  Is that correct?  I like clear language.  We are talking about Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society in this new entity in liquidation.  Is that right?</p></speech>

We come back to value for money, which is the whole purpose of the Comptroller and Auditor General's chapter.  It deals with the cost of the banking stabilisation measures and value for money.

It seems to be set out there are serious costs in that regard and we are still paying them.  These are very simple questions and I tend to be kind of straight and simple, for want of a better word.  Figures and monetary terms can be used to overwhelm us.  A bank that existed for property speculation is still causing a huge financial cost in 2017.  Is that right?  Was it worth it and was there value for money?</p></speech>

It was a policy matter at the end of the day.  I will see if I can explain it to the Deputy as I can understand from where she is coming with the question.  It is a good way of looking at it.  We had a choice in that period of either bailing out the banks or not doing so.  The policy was to bail out all the banks and put the bank guarantee in place.  Ultimately, shareholdings would be taken in the banks and there would be investment in contingent convertible capital notes and preference shares etc.  The cost of that-----</p></speech>

I do not accept Mr. Carville's answer.  I do not expect him to go through this with me, but he accepts Nos. 2 and 3 concerning the duty and responsibility on the Department.  Arising from that duty and responsibility, he has to be able to set out to the committee, at any stage and well before a statement of claim, whether he is complying with that duty.

We have a problem with banks, in particular Anglo Irish Bank.  At some stage the Government nationalised the bank, something it could never do before, which is interesting.  It could nationalise a bank to take on debt but not for us to get a benefit from it.  That is a story for another day.  It might be a cause for reflection in the Department of Finance.  We will move on from that.  That bank was taken over and a promissory note - which I understand is an IOU - was given.  The bank was in serious trouble and was involved in business for the purposes of property speculation.  A Government, in its wisdom, decided to write it IOUs.  Is that right?  Am I wrong?</p></speech>

We will all agree on the graphics and that the bank was a bank of speculators.  We agree that the Government wrote an IOU and Anglo Irish Bank took that and went to the Central Bank.  It said it would give the bank money to keep it going.  In addition, under the IOU the Government had to pay periodic payments to the bank.  One can imagine how long it has taken me to get my head around this.  A bank was not worth saving but the Government saved it with IOUs.  The Government needed to borrow a great deal of money to finance those IOUs.  It also raided the pension fund.</p></speech>

We need to come back to this in more general terms because there is a pattern here.  References to commercial sensitivity and legal advice and the outsourcing of some work are creating a barrier between this committee and witnesses and accounting officers.  While such officials are not legally compelled to come here and answer questions, there would be an expectation that they would answer basic questions.  I would say they are certainly obliged to do so.  In recent months, representatives of Nursing Homes Ireland, the HSE, the education and training boards, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department of Education and Skills, HIQA, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Department of Finance - in terms of PPPs - have offered references to commercial sensitivity or legal advice as a cover or cloak to avoid answering what I would see as basic questions.  I think we need to come back to it.  Deputy MacSharry is right when he asks how we can do our work in such circumstances.  I am not putting this as a question to Mr. Carville.  I am making an observation and recommending that we should come back to his issue as part of our discussion on our work programme at a later stage.  On that subject, will Mr. Carville outline to the committee the nature of the court case that is being taken?</p></speech>

The rate for a trainee accountant is not applicable.  We can do something else that is helpful.  There are quarter-proved rates.  This is one of the things we wanted to get into today.

There is plenty of litigation against the State through the Department of Finance or the Minister for Finance.  The approach we are adopting here is entirely consistent with the approach we have adopted in the cases I have mentioned.  I am quite happy to talk about this again as long as we can defend our position successfully, which is our objective.  As I mentioned to Deputies Catherine Murphy and Connolly earlier, we will revisit this as we go through the process.  I am not saying we are going to wait until the very end of this process.  If we can get refreshed legal advice that tells me I can talk about this in greater detail, we will act on that.  We will let the Chairman and the secretariat know straightaway.</p></speech>

The Department has committed to go back to seek further legal advice.  Part of the problem here is that what we get in general terms is a synopsis of the legal advice, which is that these legal issues cannot be dealt with.  The parameters of what can and cannot be discussed are never set out for us.  We would then have a view that there might be some logic in not answering one set of questions, but no logic in answering another set of questions.</p><p>What we get is a blanket or a wall put between us, which is that the Department cannot answer any of the questions and, obviously, we are not privy to the legal advice the Department received.</p><p> I think there is a serious problem for the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Department said it would come back to the committee once it got legal advice.  There is a clear lack of accountability and this goes back in the Department for a long period of time.  The Department of Justice and Equality has been under scrutiny for a culture of secrecy.  If there is a culture of lack of transparency in any Department, that would worry me.  Given what I have seen so far today, I think there is still such a culture in the Department of Finance and I am not happy with it.  I am putting that on the record.  Mr. Carville has defended his Department and said that is not the case.  I am accepting what he said but I am giving him my opinion, which is my personal opinion and not that of the committee.  I want to come back to the broader issue later.  If Mr. Carville wants to comment, he can do so.</p></speech>

This is a voluntary document.  There is no legal requirement for us to publish this document but we published four of them.  This was the Department's idea in consultation with the Minister, Deputy Noonan, at the time in 2014.  We felt it was a good idea to provide transparency.  There is a huge amount of detail in these documents.  The latest one is probably lighter than the other ones because there is less work going on now.  When we were going through the various loan sale processes, there was a huge wealth of detail in these documents.  While I respect what the Deputy is saying, these are voluntary documents.  We did not have to produce them and had no obligation whatsoever to do so, and we did.</p></speech>

The bodies of the chapters are quite substantial and we have not had, in my view, a fair opportunity to even probe them because we have spent so much time going over and back in respect of this issue.  That is problematic.  I am going to park that now because I have made my point and the assistant secretary general, if that is Mr. Carville's position-----</p></speech>

I will turn to the substantive issue.  The gross cost of capitalising the banks, according to the Comptroller and Auditor General's office, is &euro;66.8 billion, the net cost to the State is &euro;39.9 billion and there is an average cost of between &euro;1 billion and &euro;1.4 billion a year to service the associated debt.  These are the headline figures in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  All of this is a consequence of the fact the State essentially recapitalised the banks and, as a consequence of that, nationalised some of these banks as well.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

There were 14 banks operating in the country before the crash - I am thinking of retail mortgage banks.  Some were owned by foreign subsidiaries, some left the market for various reasons, some closed down, some were sold and two were merged into IBRC, as the Deputy knows.

However, after the crash there was a decision to nationalise them, which came on the back of the bank guarantee.  As a consequence of having to recapitalise the banks by investing so much in the banks, the <i>quid pro quo</i>was that the State would become a shareholder and, essentially, would own the banks <i>de facto</i>.  That was a consequence of the policy decision that was taken.  Is that what Mr. Carville is saying?</p></speech>

When we had debt-like instruments, contingent convertible capital notes, or CoCos, and preference shares, we received interest on those instruments.  In the case of AIB, the Deputy might have seen earlier this year it declared its first dividend for nine or ten years, and we received 99% of that, so we receive dividend income as well.  We also receive income when we sell the investments.</p><p>We have sold the preference shares and CoCos in Bank of Ireland.  We have redeemed preference shares in AIB.

A sovereign bond is very similar in a sense but it is a sovereign debt instrument that has been given out.  It is essentially that the State will repay a debt in due course.</p></speech>

This goes back to what I was saying earlier.  As members of the Committee of Public Accounts, we are working from a report of the Comptroller and Auditor General that gives headline figures.  Our job is to probe those figures and conduct a deep dive in terms of where the money went.  There is a headline figure of &euro;31.8 billion paid from NAMA to banks, essentially, to take bad loans off the banks' books.  I am looking for a breakdown, in the first instance, of how much went to what banks, and the information is not to hand.  I am also looking for a range of the value of those loans, and that information is not to hand.  Why was that work not done in advance of today's meeting?

I thank the witnesses for continuing to be here.  I am sorry if at times it is adversarial.  As many of us have said, it is not personal; we have a job to do.  I have just carried out a Google search in respect of some of these matters and I note that the plaintiff in this case is referred to as the director of the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation.  That individual took a case on the promissory notes in 2013.  The case was dismissed because he was deemed not to have standing.  Mr. Carville mentioned earlier that he accepted that this case was being brought or whatever.  Is it the Department's position that this person, as an advocate for mortgage holders, has standing in respect of this matter?</p></speech>

It is not that I was not listening attentively, but I was researching some matters.  The individual in question took a case in respect of the promissory notes which was dismissed on the basis of the State's defence to the effect that he did not have standing.  The court ruled that he would have had to be a Deputy.  Subsequently, a Deputy took a case and it went that route.  In this instance, is it the Department's position that he would have standing?</p></speech>

That is against the backdrop of the parliamentary questions.  I said I would refer back to those.  One of my parliamentary questions in September related to the frequency of meetings of the committee - these are the update committees.  The answer stated that in 2016 there were eight such update meetings.  At that stage in 2017 - up to 20 September - there had only been three, but another was planned.  To the layperson, that does not inspire confidence.  We had eight and now we only have three.  If-----</p></speech>

I think this is a really important point the Deputy is getting to.  These are formal update meetings.  In total, we have had 74.  This reflects the work of the special liquidation.  We must remember the liquidation started in 2013.  This will not be an annualised figure, but I can probably annualise it in my head quickly.  As one would expect, in 2013 there were 36 meetings because that was when all the activity was taking place.  That was when most of the fees were being incurred.  There were 18 meetings in 2014.  The difference between 2013 and 2014 and then between 2015, 2016 and 2017 is that &euro;21 billion par-value loans were sold over that period.  This was the bulk of work.  This was where all the activity was taking place in terms of liquidation.  I believe it is entirely appropriate that we step back.</p></speech>

I am trying to understand the whole process and procedure around liquidation.  We move resources when they are required.  We have one liquidation specialist, two whole-time equivalents and a solicitor.  It is less important to have those formal update meetings in 2017 because the Department is not as busy with that issue as was the case in 2016.  It sounds very haphazard to me.  That is why we should have the committee of inspection or whatever.  Is there a defined process?  Is what is supposed to happen written down anywhere in the Department or is it haphazard and generic?  For example, what is the process if the Department has a problem with the number of partner hours being associated with a particular task?  Does Mr. Carville ring Kieran Wallace or someone else in KPMG to say that he has a problem with something?  Are there informal arrangements?  Is it that simple?  Is it informal or is a process defined?</p></speech>

Around other matters, absolutely, if something emerges, we get information or we have to deal with parliamentary questions or whatever the issues is, the special liquidators are incredibly responsive to us.  They are our main point of contact.  It is not as if they subcontract the work way down the chain to somebody very junior, we deal with-----</p></speech>

I do not want to delay on this matter, but I want to go further down the list of parliamentary questions.  Mr. Carville called out for Deputy David Cullinane the hourly rate for partners.  I want a breakdown of how many partners are being used and for how many hours to perform certain tasks.  The Minister, or perhaps the witnesses on his behalf, wrote back to say he had been advised by the special liquidators that these matters were commercially sensitive.  Who is driving the bus?  If I ask a parliamentary questin on behalf of the people, do we have to check with the special liquidators to find out if it is okay for me to tell the public, our employer, for how many hours the liquidators are being paid to do a certain job?  Why would that even appear in a parliamentary question: "I am advised by the special liquidators"?  The special liquidators are not advisers.  If I get my hair cut, it will cost me &euro;X.  I do not need the hairdresser's permission to share the fact that it took a half an hour and cost me &euro;20.  That is my business to decide if I want to share the information.</p></speech>

That is the way it should be, but Mr. Carville and I are not getting &euro;222 million.  The liquidators are and I think the public are entitled to know.  The Comptroller and Auditor General and the Department of Finance have no role in the procurement of the joint special liquidators.  If we have all of these powers that trump those of a committee of inspection, why are we not using them?  Is it not legitimate for us to say to someone to whom we are paying &euro;222 million that, while we want them to achieve the best value for money on all of the services they are procuring, we want to have an input?  However, we have no role in that regard.  </p> <p>  The contract is commercially sensitive.  We had a lengthy engagement on the basis that we knew the price being paid per hour, but we could not see the contract because it was commercially sensitive.  I disagree with this.  We are told we cannot have a copy of the indemnity document because it is commercially sensitive too.  They were the answers from the Minister last September.  He would not tell us whether there had been a fee increase or what staff were assigned to perform each task as the information was commercially sensitive.  Minutes of meetings are also described as being commercially sensitive and this was at a time when there was no legal case.  I am bound to say that - I am sure the witnesses as individuals are doing extremely difficult and time consuming work - if a case had not been taken last Friday, they would have been sent here today with riding instructions and that we would be listening to the line, "That is commercially sensitive". </p></speech>

The auditing expression we would have used when training in KPMG once upon a time was "professional scepticism".  We apply it to everything we do.  Just because somebody says something is commercially sensitive we do not say that is fine.  We probe and push to satisfy ourselves that there is a case to be made, but my point about the previous opening statement is that the committee will get a sense of its tone and what we were trying to do in it.  In due course we will share that information with the committee when we come back and deliver a different opening statement.</p></speech>

I will tell you as soon as it suits me to tell you."  Mr. Carville is professionally sceptical; that is his training as an accountant.  He studied for many years and was the top of the class.  We are trying to be professionally sceptical, but what we are seeing is that there is no defined process and that there are no procedures.  We took out the bit that existed in law, in the Companies Acts, in respect of the committee of inspection and are taking refuge in commercial sensitivity.  Mr. Carville as much as admitted to me that the concept of commercial sensitivity will still apply.</p></speech>

We cannot allow the public to know how much it is getting for its euro.  That is laughable and unacceptable.  The committee has a job to do.  The Department of Finance is not alone.  Time and again departmental officials have queued to tell us that information is commercially sensitive and what is the legal advice, etc.  It actually does not matter that Mr. Hall took the case last week because the reality is that Mr. Carville will tell us nothing.  He has spoken about the report the Department produces periodically, which is great.  I said to another Secretary General last week that we were not here to celebrate all of what the witnesses were doing well.  What is contained in the report is great, but we are only interested in finding what can be improved to get better value for money.  That is what is missing from the report.  Regardless of the case, Mr. Carville has confirmed for me that I need not waste any more time on this issue at the Committee of Public Accounts because witnesses will not tell us because of the commercial sensitivity of information.  I have taken up enough time and I am bound to conclude.  There is a culture across departmental agencies and organisations audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General which uses evasion and any device within their reach to avoid an appearance or candour at the Committee of Public Accounts and that subverts the people's right to know that they are getting value for money.  On the basis of the parliamentary that were not answered in September, the fact that the case was taken last week and what we have just heard, it can be proved that we have no chance of having the level of public scrutiny required of this matter.</p><p>We need former staff of IBRC before the committee.  I proposed this earlier and the Chairman will come back to it.  We need the Secretary General before the committee as soon as he is well.  I also believe, while it is not common practice, that the Minister needs to come before the committee to discuss this issue.  It is heading for &euro;300 million, it could be &euro;1 billion by the time it is all over and I it is far too much public money for us simply to be told, "We are doing a great job here.  You have nothing to worry about."  That is simply not good enough.  I thank the gentlemen for their attendance.  I am not happy.</p></speech>

Mr. Carville talked about the net amount in respect of the cost of the bank, stabilisation measures and capitalisation.  I assume that the Department did not include the tax forgone that can be set aside for up to 20 years and which was recently in the news.  Has the Department calculated what that might have otherwise been?</p></speech>

Deputy Murphy is talking about the tax losses, the deferred tax assets, that the banks hold.  There are probably several important points in this regard, which are often overlooked, unfortunately.

Second, the banks have a bank levy, which is &euro;150 million per annum.  That was put in place in 2014.  In last year's Finance Act it was extended to 2021, which amounts to &euro;750 million.  Therefore, the banks do pay tax and that has been approved by the Oireachtas.  There are a few really important things to note about the tax losses.  First of all, tax losses are normal.  I think all OECD countries have the concept of tax losses, so there is nothing unusual about the banks having tax losses <i>per se</i>if one imagines other Irish corporates that are tax-resident in this country.  Second, we do get value for the deferred tax assets, DTAs, or tax losses.  When we value the shareholdings in the banks, the market gives us value for those today.  Hypothetically, if we were to eliminate tax losses today, the share prices would fall correspondingly tomorrow.</p></speech>

Therefore, there is a very big difference and it does not appear that there is a Statute of Limitations, even uniquely on the banks, in respect of losses, which seems extraordinary given the investment that was made in the main by citizens, including those who have not even been born yet.</p></speech>

It is a very good question.  When we make an IPO for the bank, what is important is one must assess our performance when the last share is sold, so the assessment ranges over a period.  We own 99.9% of the bank, so one has to assess when the final share is sold, not as we sell, because in capital market terms what we want to do is sell into a rising market.  Therefore, every time we sell shares, in an ideal world - it will not work out like this in practice because it will take many years - we will continually sell at a higher price.  There are plenty of examples of this not working and examples of it working really well.  I am glad to say AIB is one example of it having worked really well.  The morning the shares opened on the London and Irish stock markets the share price went up 4.6%.  When the markets closed that day the share price was up 5.8% or 5.6%.  I think it was 5.8%.  A day later it was up 8%, I think, and it stayed at that level for quite some time.  Markets since then-----</p></speech>

I wish to refer to another sale of shares, namely, the Bank of Ireland shares.  A European Parliament report on this has come out just in the last few days.  I refer to the hedge fund with which Wilbur Ross was associated in 2011.  It bought something like 34% or 35% of the shares after a large amount of money had been injected into Bank of Ireland and it took many people by surprise that they were sold at such a low rate.  I think it was about 10 cent.  There is an accusation now that when a large amount of the shares were sold in 2014, there was possible insider information and, obviously, insider trading because there was some knowledge of the market moving.  Is the Department looking at this again?  Is it a concern for the Department?  Has there been any discussion about it?</p></speech>

I am familiar with the report and the allegation.  I am also familiar with Wilbur Ross's very detailed rebuttal of the allegation.  I think that should be looked at because it explains the situation very well.  At that point in time I was not working in the Department of Finance; I was an adviser to Bank of Ireland.  I was Bank of Ireland's sponsor to its listing on the Irish Stock Exchange and co-sponsor, with UBS, to its listing on the London Stock Exchange.  I was therefore responsible for the prospectus that was written to support that rights issue in 2010.  I was also responsible for a prospectus written in 2011.  With that hat on, I am absolutely satisfied, as were the directors of the bank because that is what they state on the first page of the document, that all the information investors needed to make a properly informed decision was in that document.

I am sure Mr. Ross will not mind me noting this but he has made other investments in the banking space in other parts of Europe that have not been as successful.  The point I am making is that investments in equities are inherently risky.  I remember in 2011 when the Fairfax consortium, including Wilbur Ross, invested in the country.  That was a seminal moment.  When we look back and the history of that decade is written, the moment when he and his co-investors took a risk will be regarded as a seminal moment for Ireland.  That is when the tide started turning.  That was the moment.</p></speech>

Obviously Mr. Mario Draghi is the current President of the European Central Bank, ECB, but he was formerly the Governor of Banca d'Italia.  My question relates to the allegations that were made by the then risk manager at UniCredit, Mr. Jonathan Sugarman, who has appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  Mr. Sugarman went to the Central Bank and disclosed some information in his role as risk manager.  We have been told that the central banks share a lot of information.   They are subsidiaries of the ECB.  Mr. Draghi has flatly denied having any knowledge that there was any risk or that he was aware of anything that was disclosed to the Central Bank of Ireland.  Yet, in 2010, the then Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan, claimed that the Central Bank maintained a close relationship with the ECB.  How do we square that circle whereby that information was not shared when it was received?  Was it just dismissed?  How do we treat whistleblowers?  If somebody went to the Central Bank today and disclosed that there was a risk, how would the information be treated?  Would it be treated any differently to the way this was treated?  Was it disclosed to the Central Bank or would Mr. Carville know that?  Is that something that should be pursued with the Central Bank?</p></speech>

In disclosures of this type, under section 33AK of the Central Bank Act, there are specified gateways for information to flow to various State agencies.  There is no gateway for that sort of information to flow to us.</p></speech>

I suppose we are all being very careful about making sure it does not happen again and whistleblowers are particularly important from that point of view.  I am just looking for the route information takes.</p></speech>

The Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 had a provision for whistleblowers which predated that 2014 Act.  The Central Bank views these disclosures as a very important tool for it in regulation and supervision, allowing access to information to which it may not get access.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked about the culture around whistleblowers.  It is really important to say that within the Department of Finance, we receive training around whistleblowers and what to do if there is a protected disclosure to us.  We are very familiar with that at assistant secretary level, and even at principal officer level as well.</p></speech>

The Central Bank produces an annual report on the number of protected disclosures that are made to it.  It is subject to European rules about banking confidentiality.  One of the capital requirements directives, CRD, specifies there must be very established gateways for regulatory and supervisory information to flow to other State bodies.  That is considered to be a matter for a regulator and then potentially for the Garda or other authorities, depending on what the disclosure is about.</p></speech>

There are at least ten material checkpoints, which must be passed.  Everything leads to one word; "valuation".  That is the only thing that matters.  We start with the programme for partnership Government, which gave us permission to sell up to 25% plus the over-allotment option, which was the extra circa 4% we sold.  That gives us 29%.  That is a standard feature of a deal like this on the capital markets .  About ten different items were involved.  I will give the Deputy the list very quickly, because it really-----</p></speech>

I was just thinking about it, so I am delighted you asked the question.</p> <p>  These items are not in any order.  We had to select the selling syndicate, that is, the investment banks that acted on our behalf.  We had a huge procurements exercise to make sure we got the best possible advisers.  We worked on the listing venue to ensure that the bank was listed.  It moved from the junior market in Dublin to the main market in Dublin, as well as to the main market in London.  That is a similar arrangement to UK banks, for example.  It is really important to buyers on the other side, because they like buying premium-listed companies rather than junior-listed or standard-listed companies.</p> <p>  The bank itself had declared its first dividend and in valuation terms this was an absolute game-changer.  We would not have advised the Minister to execute an initial public offering, IPO, if the bank was not paying a dividend.  It has that much of a material impact on the valuation of the bank.  The bank had also done some work around pension volatility at the end of last year, which is very important from an investor perspective.</p> <p>  We also did our own roadshow.  I referred to professional scepticism earlier.  Investment banks tell us various things, which sound nice.  They want to do a deal because they only get paid if there is a deal.  Along with other colleagues including Mr. Rankin and Ms Ann Nolan, the former Second Secretary General to the Department, I travelled to meet a selection of the best investors in the world in London and New York.  We satisfied ourselves that they understood the story of AIB, understood the Irish economic situation and were prepared to pay a decent price for the bank.</p> <p>  The bank itself played a huge part in this, in fairness to the chief executive officer, Mr. Bernard Byrne, the chief financial officer, Mr. Mark Bourke, and the rest of the management team.  We also attended capital markets day in London.  The results came out and we had to assess how the results were received; a week later was capital markets day in London.  We all went over to that event and we were in the room for the whole day, talking with the analysts and making sure the offer was resonating. </p></speech>

Regarding the 25% - the programme for Government figure was up to 25% - a huge amount went into considering why it would be that level.  To expand on that, say we picked 5%, then we would still own 95%.  We are dealing with very sophisticated buyers on the other side who are paid multiples of what we are paid.  They are multiples better than we are whose job is to get the State to pay at the lowest possible price and ours it to ensure that we sell the shares at the highest possible price, bearing in mind that we have other transactions to make and shares to sell.  It was very important to us that if we sold 5%, the other side would have felt that was not much to trade and they might look for a liquidity discount.  They would think that we have 95% left and they would look for an overhang discount.  I could anticipate the valuation falling.  The converse would have been true had the programme for Government allowed us to sell 50% or 51%.  Then we would look as though we were a distressed seller, and they would want to apply a discount on that or we could have been selling so many shares that the market could not absorb it.  As I said in my opening statement, it was the second largest IPO in the world this year.  A sum of &euro;3.4 billion is a huge transaction.  We had lots of advice, including independent advice from Rothschild, that 25% was the right figure to sell.  That is borne out by the share price only rose 4.6% in the first day.  It is what we call the Goldilocks zone.  It does not get better than that.</p></speech>

That is what we call it.  To give the example of another privatisation in the UK, the share price popped 38% in the first day and was followed by several parliamentary investigations.   If the share price goes below what we call break issue - that would be below the &euro;4.40 price - that would also be a disaster because we would have sold too high and we would still have 71%.</p></speech>

We examined this with Goldman Sachs in 2015.  This advice was free of charge, incidentally, as we had Goldman Sachs on retainer for a year free of charge.  We examined it again in 2016 when, following a public procurement exercise we appointed Rothschild as our independent financial adviser.  This examination considered precisely the question the Deputy raised, along with other questions.  Using our own expertise we did our own internal analysis.  All three led to the inescapable conclusion that if we were to hold the bank in perpetuity and run it for dividends it would take decades - I think it was 30 years - to recover the money.</p></speech>

Government policy is to sell the bank investments, get the money back and use it to do other, more important things.  The State would rather it did not hold large investments in the banking sector.  The next time there is a recession, and inevitably there will be one, it might be unlikely to happen in the next 12 months but whether it is in three, five, ten years or whenever, bank shares are risky.  That is the primary reason why Government policy is to ultimately sell these investments.  Stock markets internationally, particularly in the US, appear to be making new highs daily.  This stock market rally, or bull market, is very mature, in a few months it will be the longest ever, and we are very conscious of that.</p></speech>

The wisdom of putting State funds into speculative banks is one very serious lesson, and there are many others, but obviously the witnesses are not policy makers.</p> <p>  My second point related to value for money.  I finished before I left the room on my last round of questioning.  Eight people have died since August.  I knew the figure and I did not wish to say it.  I was not trying to catch the officials out over one or two people.  I was using it as an indicator of the magnitude of the problem.  It has a direct bearing in regard to policy decisions.  I was away while Deputy Cullinane was asking his questions.  Did we have to save Anglo Irish Bank given that we could not?   Looking back, was this a bad decision?  Were alternatives considered?  Have alternatives been considered since in terms of value for money?  What value for money exercise has been done in regard to learning lessons?</p></speech>

One now sees the use of macroprudential tools and analysis so that banks now must hold higher levels of buffers.  The key lesson is the roll-out of bank recovery and resolution plans across all systemic banks so that in future there should be greater protection for taxpayers and bank customers.</p></speech>

It is not a silly question.  I want the witnesses to explain precisely what &euro;29 billion, a huge amount of taxpayers' money that was put into a private organisation, was used for.  I do not want to hear the general term that it was used to recapitalise the bank.  The money that was given was used for something.  What was it used for?</p></speech>

This is a bad bank.  It is a developer's bank, essentially, and it is extraordinary that we can make a statement that if that investment was not made, the entirety of the banking system could have collapsed.  That might hold some logic if one was talking about Allied Irish Banks, AIB, and Bank of Ireland but one cannot assume that for Anglo Irish Bank.</p></speech>

With respect, the Deputy has the luxury of being able to look at it in hindsight and see how things played out subsequently.  At that point, the policy decision was taken to rescue the Irish banking system through the injection of &euro;64 billion, or &euro;66 billion if it is grossed up, into the system.</p></speech>

It would be useful if we could get a breakdown of exactly how that money was spent.  For example, which banks got what from the first &euro;66 billion?  What was the money used for when the banks were recapitalised?  What did they do with the money?  Are there reports that we could get a breakdown?  The Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis may have gone through all of this.  It is an extraordinary amount of taxpayers' money to put into private institutions, which we really had no legal requirement to do but did anyway on the premise that, at the time, a decision was taken that this would have been a massive shock to the economy had we not done it.  We can argue or disagree about the degree of shock that would have happened with regard to the different banks involved.  I think that the information we have is far too vague and that we need a further breakdown.</p></speech>

At the end of the process, all we got was a broken bank which was liquidated at a cost to the taxpayer and we are being told that this was being done in the national interest and if we had not done it, it would have amounted to the potential collapse of the entire banking system.

I wish all the witnesses a happy Christmas, and I hope Mr. Carville, who said that he has a chest infection, recovers.  I thank him for coming here today despite that.</p> <p>  From the figure at 2.1 which breaks down NAMA's loans we can see the total borrower debt, the NAMA payment for loans, which is the amount that NAMA got.  The discount, or loss, is given as a percentage.  Can we get a breakdown of each of those?  Taxpayers' money was used.  If we look at AIB for example, can we get a breakdown of how many loans there were, as well as the range in value?  Was the range from &euro;1 million to &euro;500 million?  We do not want the client's names, only the range.  We would like the same for Anglo Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland.  We want this because, if it is the case in Anglo Irish Bank that the volume of loans is, say 100, but 10 of those were very high amounts that add up to 50% of the overall amount, it shows us that we essentially bailed out a very small number of developers.  It would be interesting and worthwhile to have that breakdown.  The figures to be provided are for each of the banks involved and will show the volume and the range.  </p></speech>

The promissory note was for ten years, and we are transferring it into a sovereign bond at a lower rate.  We are saving a certain amount for the next ten years.  The sovereign bond has a life of 35 years, so the interest can only be compared over that 35 year period against what was paid under the promissory note.  What is the cost of the promissory note over its full life?  Had I asked this question 18 months ago a different interest rate would apply.  How would the witnesses answer it as things stand now?</p> <p>  Have the various minutes between the Department of Finance and the special liquidator been examined by the Comptroller and Auditor General?</p></speech>

Perhaps there should be an independent audit.  The financial statements should be produced, rather than relying on a process which has court approval at the end, or in the case of the witnesses the Minister approving it.  I understand the PMPA liquidation could have went on for over 30 years because people could claim up to the age of 18 and so the liquidation had to be kept open in case claims emerged over the lifetime of minors.  Some liquidations can run for decades before they finish.  I suspect we might be in that territory in this case.</p></speech>

My point is that the special liquidator is contracted to the State to do work and it submits a report to the Comptroller and Auditor General when the job is done and that is the end of it.  From the point of view of the Committee on Public Accounts we have no method of verifying that what is happening is in line with Government procurement and everything else that goes on.  I know that it is not a public sector body.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is telling us that he does not have access to the minutes.</p></speech>

That still applies.  There is nothing in the IBRC Act that takes away that responsibility.</p></speech>

This one has the same procedure but is carried out in a publically owned body.  I am trying to separate the two.  There is no method for intermittent independent reports on the liquidation process.  It might be said that is not provided for, but there would be a benefit if there was an equivalent independent audit produced at the end of each year, especially when a liquidation is likely to span several years.  When the special liquidator gives his report to the Comptroller and Auditor General it is published, and nobody has any way of knowing if it is true or not.  That is probably why this case is going on at the moment.  There is a missing link in terms of public accountability when a public, State owned organisation is being liquidated, compared to the private sector.  That is my observation.</p></speech>

We have the ability to impose legislation, provided the Oireachtas approves it.  If I or my colleagues felt that we were missing something or that the IBRC Act was somehow deficient with the benefit of hindsight because it was done at a particular point in time it would be incumbent on us to put our hands up and say that we think that additional powers are required.  We are not in that place, and we do not believe additional powers are required.</p></speech>

That is a little like the Higher Education Authority saying, "We are happy with how the universities are running their business and there is no need for formal reports to the committee.  If we were not happy we would flag that".  That is fine and we accept your bona fides, but that does not give us any comfort.  We are relying on believing what you are saying.

I hope you get our frustration regarding how we cannot communicate better today.  Hopefully, your concerns will be substantially mitigated when we can talk freely about what we are doing.  The special liquidators were due to appear with us today.  We did not have to ask or compel them.  They were quite happy to come here because they believe they have a good story to tell.  They will be here with us in due course, but I do not know when that will be.  We look forward to that day.</p></speech>

You should consider the point that some Deputies made today regarding some of the information being sought.  If some of that was going to made available here today, there is a case for putting part of that out in the public domain.  You do not have to hold it all just to get to the court.  Some of it is available and could be dealt with.  I am not advising you on your strategy but you have heard the view of some members.  If some of this can be put out in public, and there is nothing preventing that, you should not wait until you are on the steps of the court to provide it, if it can be done without compromising the case.</p></speech>

The committee knows what has been happening for the last while and we wanted to inform people who have been viewing the proceedings all along that we have agreed our report.  I want to take the opportunity to thank each member of the committee.  It has been a very constructive committee.  I have never ceased to be impressed, surprised and amazed at the work that has gone into this committee.  For the most part, we worked extremely well together, and I want to pay tribute to every member with whom I have really enjoyed working.  On a personal level, I have made some friends and I am really grateful to have had that opportunity.</p> <p>  The amendments we have made reflect the votes we took yesterday and the evidence we heard overall.  I think we all agree it has been a very challenging experience.  I have personally found it challenging.  I have learned things about myself that I did not know, and I have learned things in general.  Overall, members have been on a journey.  I am very impressed with the Members of the Oireachtas on this committee.  I suppose I am biased in saying this but we have really shown how effective an Oireachtas committee can be, and on this most difficult and divisive issue.  I do not think anyone on this committee would ever seek to underestimate the challenge put in front of us.  It is part of an overall process.  We are now handing this over to ourselves, as Members of the Oireachtas, and to our colleagues to facilitate a vote of the Irish people, who will ultimately be the decision-makers on this, and it is very important to clarify that.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses who attended the committee.  We are indebted to them.  They did the State some service in attending.  We had excellent witnesses for the most part.  I wish to express our gratitude.  I very much thank the secretariat.  I hope Ms Suzanne Gunn and Ms Claudia Zelli will not mind me singling out the clerk, Mr. Ted McEnery, who we will all agree has been absolutely excellent.  His nature is such that he is an absolute pleasure to work with and, besides that, he is extremely strong and supportive.  We have all benefitted from his very considerable experience in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Everybody has said how lucky I am to have had the clerk that I have, and there is a reason he was put into the position. That is very really important.</p> <p>  I also want to thank Mr. Tom Malone, who is not here at the moment and who has been supportive also.  I am very grateful for the legal advice I have received.  I also thank Ms Zelli for all her support.  The amount of work she has done is underestimated.  I thank our legal adviser, Ms Nuala Butler, an excellent senior counsel, who also did us some service.</p> <p>  We will leave it at that.  The committee will launch its report next Wednesday.  I know the Vice Chairman is indicating a wish to speak.  On another committee, she might have had more opportunity to take the chair but the way the situation evolved, it became important that we had consistency in the chairing.  However, the Vice Chairman was very supportive, and I appreciated that support.  We have agreed that it suits everybody to launch our report at 12 noon next Wednesday.  Thank you, everyone.</p></speech>

At one stage she spoke about me not being appointed as Chairman of this committee.  It is probably good that I was not appointed because I would not have been able to show the patience, calmness, strength and bravery shown by her in the face of considerable criticism and many attacks in difficult discussions and conversations.  I know where my skills lie and they are definitely not on the Chairman's side of the table.  I am glad, therefore, that she was able to maintain consistency.  On behalf of members and the people of Ireland, I thank her for taking the brave step to chair the committee.  It is very much appreciated.  This is only the beginning.</p></speech>

This committee has had ongoing discussions with both the public and private sector on plans for trade following Britain's exit from the European Union.  Today's meeting gives us the opportunity to hear about potential for trade with Asia, an area with a population of more than 2 billion people.</p><p>We will hear the opening statement from Mr. Murray before going into a question and answer session with the committee members.  Before beginning, I remind members, witnesses and those in the Gallery to ensure their mobile phones are switched off completely for the duration of the meeting as they cause interference, even on silent mode, with the recording equipment in this committee room.  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p></speech>

It is our third time briefing the committee and we look forward to an engaged discussion.  We have sent the committee some detailed documentation concerning data and statistics, and I propose to focus very briefly on the beginning of the document, dealing with why Asia matters for Ireland.  I will also explain why Asia Matters and what we do also matters, providing a very brief overview of the key statistics.  I will focus primarily on policy recommendations to grow trade with Asia significantly before answering any questions from the members and hearing their comments and insights.</p> <p>  I will focus on why Asia is a key solution to the Brexit challenge for Ireland.  Unlike many people looking at Brexit - we understand those challenges - we see this as an opportunity for Ireland.  Asia is the future for global business.  This is the Asian century and the Irish economy must make a paradigm shift to capture a share of this boom.  This will require Irish policymakers and firms to pivot away from a reliance on post-Brexit Britain and post-Trump America and to focus their efforts more directly on this economic powerhouse of the future.  The enormous scale of the combined Chinese, Japanese and ASEAN markets represents an opportunity that is unprecedented with in excess of 2 billion, roughly 500 times the population of Ireland and four times that of the European Union.</p> <p>  Amidst the challenge of Brexit, with Ireland in the worst case potentially losing 30% of exports to the UK, representing an annual loss of &euro;4.5 billion in cash terms, and rising US protectionism which may damage foreign direct investment into Ireland, Asia Matters believes that accelerated trade growth with Asia is a key solution to protect Ireland against major economic disruption and increased unemployment.  We need urgently and significantly to accelerate trade with Asia.  Approximately 40% of global gross domestic product, GDP, and 60% of global consumers are now based in Asia, with rapidly expanding middle classes that need quality Irish products and services.</p><p>To understand the scale of the opportunity we can look at Asia's population sizes, as indicated in our submission.  We can also look at the megacities of the world, that is, cities that have a population of ten million or more.  Asia has 90% of these at the moment.  Within another 15 or 20 years it is looking as if 99% will be in Asia.  That is how important Asia is.<br/><br/>Asia Matters was formed more than five years ago.  We were created to fill the need for Ireland to have a dedicated space focused on business with Asia.  We operate on a not-for-profit and non-political basis.  In essence, we are Ireland's only Asia think tank.  We engage with a very high-level Asian peer community in business, government and academic sectors.  We work closely with team Ireland to create an informed understanding of and opportunity to partner with Asia.<br/><br/>To date, more than 11,500 people from 47 countries have participated in Asia Matters events.  We have hosted seven EU-Asia top economist round tables in Asia and Ireland.  Recently, we launched the global Asia Matters business summit in Dublin, in partnership with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  The Asia Matters team has spent more than 20 months in Asia engaging and connecting with key policymakers and business leaders in the region.  More than 125,000 people have viewed Asia Matters publications, including the annual <i>Asia Matters Business Yearbook</i>.  We believe that the organisation is the go-to place for public policymakers, corporates and the media in Ireland on all matters relating to Asia.<br/><br/>I will now briefly summarise our accompanying presentation.  Brexit reaction from Asia is primarily one of deep concern, with Japan in particular openly describing Brexit as a breach of trust.  The UK will, of course, remain important.  London will remain a top investment and business location for Asian companies.  However, within the concerns raised by Brexit, primarily the need for continued access to EU markets, there now exist unique niche opportunities for Ireland in areas such as financial services.  A key recommendation from Asia Matters today is that Ireland should become a safe harbour post Brexit for Asian investment.<br/><br/>Looking at the scale of the opportunities for Ireland and Irish companies in Asia, we have outlined some of the really big companies with which engagement can deliver product and service opportunities for Irish companies in their global supply chains either from or in Ireland.  If we pick, for example, Huawei in China, it did not exist 20 years ago.  Last year it turned over $76 billion, sold 179 million smartphones, employs 170,000 staff and now serves one out of every three people on the planet.  Of even greater interest is that with the wonderful news of direct flights from Hong Kong starting on 2 June 2018, Hong Kong is within an hour of Shenzhen, the headquarters of Huawei.  Shenzhen is the Silicon Valley of China.  We are now connecting to that.<br/><br/>When we look at China, we bring in many experts to Ireland.  The common view is that China is misreported in the Western media.  There are many Chinas, as there are many Irelands.  Each of the provinces in China alone has an average population of 30 to 70 million people each.  There are 33 provinces.  However, some are in recession and others are growing at 10% to 12% annually.  If we look at the trade between China and Ireland, and China is particularly important evidentially when it comes to Asia, this is likely to reach $10 billion by the end of 2017.  We include figures in our submission given to us by the Chinese embassy.  The current five-year plan to 2020 has a target of $750 billion of Chinese outbound foreign direct investment, FDI.  Ireland would be very happy to receive some of that.  A recent speech by President Xi Jinping at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party in China, outlined China's strategic reforms.  These play very strongly to Ireland's strengths.  We outline these in our submission.<br/><br/>It is important for the committee to understand that there is a whole different IT and ecommerce ecosystem developing in China.  It is much bigger than the existing ecommerce systems that exist in America and Europe.  For example, Alibaba's recent single day sales amassed almost $26 billion.  That is over twice the combined sales of the big days in the US.  In our submission we give some figures from the August 2017 McKinsey Global Institute report.  It shows that not only is China significantly larger than the US and the rest of the world when it comes to ecommerce, but also mobile payments in China in 2016 accounted for $790 billion.  That is more than ten times the size of similar payments in the US.  Over a third of unicorns, which are start-up companies valued at $1 billion plus, are already in China.<br/><br/>We have included some graphs to show the scale of Chinese venture capital investment in key technologies from financial technology to artificial intelligence.  Looking at the FDI overview, the concerned reaction to Brexit from Asia, allied to the unpredictable Trump Presidency in the US, has created a global business climate that has become very unstable.  Many top executives in Asia are very worried about risk management in global expansion, especially in the West.  A key finding of the recent Asia Matters global business summit in Dublin was that this creates a unique opportunity for Ireland to present itself as a safe harbour location, given our pro-business environment and global talent pool within an English-speaking common law EU country.<br/><br/>The key question for us is how can we position Ireland as a strategic location hub for Asian businesses that operate globally between Asia, the EU and the US.  Last year, Chinese investment in the US tripled.  It doubled in Europe as the committee can see from the figures that we present here.  The IDA is doing a good job.  Ireland is in the top five of European country investments.  On average, 14% of IDA new project investment is from Asia and that is moving rapidly to 20%.  Equally, Ireland has an immigrant investor scheme.  Last year that increased by 500%, mainly driven by Chinese investments working with companies such as Sino-Ireland Capital Holdings Limited.  Enterprise Ireland, immediately after Brexit, launched a very successful global ambition programme showing the need for Irish companies to diversify.  Exports to Asia are up 16% year on year.<br/><br/>What is great about this is that these are companies all over Ireland in key sectors, including companies such as Kingspan in Cavan and Fexco in Kerry.  There are many more of these, including Datalex, Fenergo, and Fineos.  At the recent global Asia Matters summit as well, Minister of State at the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with special responsibility for financial services and insurance, Deputy Michael D'Arcy, focused strongly on the difference that China and Japan can make to Ireland's financial services sector.  The recent granting of a Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor, RQFII, quota of 50 billion yuan, which is &euro;6.9 billion, is a game-changer in our ability to invest in China and our ability to sell investment in China throughout the EU market.<br/><br/>Brexit also presents a unique opportunity for our financial services given the need for EU passporting and access to EU regulators.  Food is exceptionally well positioned given Ireland's best-in-class capability, particularly given we have the unique selling point of Origin Green combined with Teagasc.  In a ten-year period from 2006 to 2016, Irish food exports to China grew tenfold.  We have supplied the detailed figures.  It is very interesting to see large Irish companies such as Musgrave in Cork move into the market.  It recently successfully launched an ecommerce channel for Irish food products in China, partnering with Alibaba through the Tmall platform.  That is a very welcome development.<br/><br/>In education, we have detailed some of the statistics and markets in our submission.  Indonesia is becoming hugely significant.  It is the only country in the world that is constitutionally required to spend 20% of the annual budget on upskilling the nation.  Indonesia has 260 million people, so there are huge opportunities for Ireland going forward.  In tourism, China is again the world's largest outbound tourism market, with 135 million people travelling overseas each year, spending $261 billion.  Tourism Ireland, supporting Dublin Airport, played a key role in delivering the Hong Kong flight.  We have a pending flight as well from mainland China with Hainan Airlines.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is doing significant work now, preparing the industry to receive Chinese tourists.<br/><br/>Lack of awareness of Ireland in Asia is one of the major challenges.  Many people still do not know who we are or where we are.  It is quite common at the end of presentations for Irish professionals in many sectors to be asked if Ireland is part of the UK.</p><p>This is a common question.</p><p> I will now deal with the lack of Irish resources in Asia.  We are doing well.  We have engaged with Asia in the last generation and trade is growing very fast but we still do not have sufficient resources on the ground compared with competitor destinations.  There is a lack of access as there are no direct flights and no visa facilitation services.  Clearly Air France, KLM, Turkish Airlines, Finnair, Etihad Airways and Emirates play a vital role in connectivity for Ireland.  In addition, however, we need direct flights.  We need them for investors and to sell into Asia.  There is also a perception by those who know Ireland that there is a lack of office space and housing in Dublin city centre.  We believe the way we present Dublin must be changed.  Let us look at the scale of Asian cities.  Dublin is not just Dublin city centre but is a metropolitan area.  Of course the city centre is critical but people can locate in Fingal, south Dublin or in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  I was talking to a Japanese person recently who came to Ireland and they were thinking of locating part of their company, which is headquartered in Yokohama, in County Meath.  Our concept of what is encompassed by Dublin needs a broader play.  Moreover, Dublin is not Ireland.  As I come from Cork, members would expect me to say that.  There are many other hubs, including Cork, Galway and the Shannon-Limerick hubs.  It is important how we define things.  Our policy recommendations are essentially that Ireland immediately creates an online campaign to actively promote why Ireland matters to Asia, followed by very specific sectoral approaches in key markets and we outline this.  We can have very early wins on this.  For example, Ireland can copy the UK best practice example of a campaign to name all regions, towns and tourism landmarks in Ireland in the Chinese language.  This will very quickly go viral on Chinese social media, pick up millions of hits and will be a great opportunity to promote and create highly valuable branding for Ireland.</p><p> The Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, has spoken of his belief that Ireland should position itself as the global island and we believe that in the significant upgrade to our global footprint on the ground in key markets, Asia should be key.  We also believe that it is critical that we position Ireland as a strategic location hub for existing businesses that operate globally between Asia and the European Union and the United States, not forgetting the existing US multinationals here, which potentially will come under threat from US protectionism.  Many of these multinational companies have responsibility for EMEA, that is, Europe, the Middle East and Africa but we are already seeing a natural evolution whereby they are taking on responsibilities for Asia from an Irish base.  We would encourage that very strongly.</p><p> In summary, the Irish State agencies, namely, EI, IDA, Bord Bia and Tourism Ireland, are doing a great job but we need to allocate significant additional resources immediately on the ground to help them to deliver their very ambitious yet achievable targets for Ireland.</p><p> In our presentation, food, tourism and education are top priorities because they bring economic benefits to all of Ireland, regardless of urban or rural locations.  Financial services are also a critical sector as the engine of an economy but they also can be used to leverage Ireland's membership of international financial institutions, such as the Asian Development Bank in Manila or the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, AIIB, in Beijing, where Team Ireland can be led in the process by the Department of Finance to open up infrastructure projects and property fund vehicles for companies such as Northern Trust that are based here in Ireland.  We very specifically state that Ireland should open a new embassy in Manila with a trade attach&eacute;.  We should put ten additional marketing staff on the ground in China, primarily to work in food, tourism, higher education and to work with the AIIB.  We also believe that Ireland in the past made a core mistake in Japan when we foolishly closed down the F&Aacute;S graduate programme in Japan when we closed down F&Aacute;S.  Under that F&Aacute;S programme, which was the envy of all other countries, we placed top graduates - mainly in engineering - for two years with global Japanese companies and during their stay they learned the Japanese culture, language and their way of doing business.  As a result of this programme, companies such as Takeda, opened up in Ireland.  There are now two Takeda plants in Ireland and the second plant is to service the Japanese market from Ireland instead of domestic Japan, such is the belief in the quality of the Irish workforce.  That programme should be restored, but it needs proper funding and staffing and we make some recommendations on this.  </p><p> We also believe that Ireland should put a minimum of two marketing staff on the ground, one for food and one for higher education in Indonesia, Thailand, India, Vietnam, Korea and Malaysia.</p><p> I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>

We will have a discussion now but I think the extent of this issue and its subject matter will warrant a further meeting between us.  We can raise the issues and recommendations suggested by Mr. Murray with the relevant Departments and State agencies.  Perhaps we could review the different issues early in 2018 because Mr. Murray has outlined the extent of the potential in this market.</p> <p>  Mr. Murray dealt with the need for a greater State presence in embassies with personnel from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, as well as representatives from the relevant State agencies, such as IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Bord Bia and so on.  I presume an essential requirement for private companies seeking to gain access to decision makers in Asia, be it in the major corporations or the State agencies in those countries, is the support of the ambassador and his or her staff and the representatives of other agencies.  Does Mr. Murray experience the impact of the lack of personnel and does he see it as a key issue the need to resource more adequately the Irish representation in those areas?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-14a.1026" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Murray" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017121400002#C00300"><p>I think it is a critical issue because while our ambassadors and diplomatic teams on the ground do a very good job, as do the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, in reality many other European destinations have ten times the number of personnel on the ground compared with us, particularly in countries such as China.  I will give an example from the key sector of food, whereby Ireland has one Bord Bia person in Shanghai and recently has appointed a second Bord Bia person in Singapore.  It is not credible to have two people covering the food sector in all of Asia.  We have competitor destinations that have 50 times and more people selling in the same markets.  With the best will in the world and with some local staff supporting them, these people are not getting the resources they need.  Bord Bia has set highly ambitious targets to double the exports to Asia by 2020.  To deliver on this target, it needs more people on the ground, knocking on doors selling.  I had the privilege of accompanying the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, on the recent trade visit to Japan and Korea and it was very obvious how effective this was.  There were approximately 40 agricompanies there but the common thread was that many people were learning about Ireland for the first time.  It takes times to build a relationship and trust.</p> <p>  The same applies equally in education.  I can talk to members about Indonesia.  Indonesians know very little about Ireland.  We recently brought in an education expert from the ministry and that person had no idea whatsoever about Ireland.  The only things that expert knew about Ireland was that I am the honorary counsel.  We see this happening in tourism.  They just do not know who we are or where we are.  We need people on the ground constantly selling and telling.</p></speech>

As Mr. Murray outlined clearly, Ireland often is perceived as being part of a neighbouring member state of the European Union.</p> <p>  Mr. Murray compared the two direct flights from Ireland to Asia from 2018, with the number originating in Helsinki, which has a metropolitan population of less than 2 million from a total of 5.5 million in Finland.  Are they connecting flights from other parts of Europe?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-14a.1028" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Murray" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017121400002#C00500"><p>These are direct flights from Helsinki and people from Ireland fly to Helsinki to connect with flights going to Asia.  What the Chairman said is very true because of a fallacy in Ireland, which arises from human nature.  We deal primarily in a world that is English speaking and we deal primarily with UK, Europe and the US.  While we think everybody knows about us, there are very few Murrays, Murphys and Sullivans in China, Indonesia or Japan.  As for Helsinki, the airport is still owned by the State.  We had a very good discussion with the State airport personnel who, albeit from a different geographical basis, from the outset believed that Asia was critical.</p><p>From the time of the setting up the whole structure and the flight patterns, it wanted to focus on Asia and on being a hub for Asians coming into Europe, and <i>vice versa</i>.  It is a hub for connecting flights but from the very beginning it was very much driven by the view that Asia was a priority to be focused on.  Ireland has not had that history.  Understandably, we have focused on Europe and the United States.</p></speech>

His comments were very interesting.  On the last point, is it purely a matter of resources?  What resources is he talking about if we are to increase awareness of Ireland?  Why did the programme close in Japan?  When committee members travel - I mainly travel to Africa - they note countries want to do business with Ireland because our reputation precedes us.  The countries believe Ireland will be ethical and present a good business opportunity.</p> <p>  Mr. Murray mentioned the need for embassies and consulates.  In this regard, he mentioned Manila.  Are there other places where representation would be vital?  We are opening an embassy in New Zealand and there will be a new consulate general in Mumbai.  The big countries with the major populations are being considered.  Since I have a particular interest in Nepal, I wonder whether Asia Matters has space for such smaller countries.  They could have potential.</p> <p>  Recently the Department produced the report on human rights in business.  We know there are appalling abuses of workers in some of the countries in Asia, and we hear about them.  The abuses may relate to conditions, pay, hours worked or otherwise.  The report should be made known, especially to Irish businesses going to Asia.</p> <p>  Irish universities offer a number of degree courses in business and languages, such as Japanese and Chinese.  Does Mr. Murray regard the graduates as part of the work he is doing?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-14a.1031" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Murray" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017121400002#D00300"><p>There are two aspects to the Deputy's question on resources.  It is critical to maximise the impact on the ground and accelerate growth.  This is the immediate need within, let us say, a three-year phase.  Equally, there is a longer-term play, which obviously requires planning and consultation within team Ireland.</p> <p>  Asia is becoming increasingly important.  In Asia Matters, the view is that Ireland has a unique and very successful economic model but that it is not sustainable in the long term without a balanced focus on Asia.  Of course, we want to keep and expand what we have in the United Kingdom, the rest of Europe and the United States but very shortly Asia will have over half of the world's wealth and over three quarters of the world's customers.  Therefore, we now need to be expanding our presence strongly in Asia.</p> <p>  On why the Japan programme closed, it was a question of throwing out the baby with the bathwater.  It should not have happened.  When the organisation was closed down, the offshoot, which in itself was unique and very important to Ireland, was closed down also.  It has not been resurrected.  It was a wrong decision and many Japanese people were very upset because senior Japanese people in top companies had, for years, committed to supporting the programme internally within their companies.  They saw it as a major loss of face, an embarrassment and a betrayal by Ireland.  It takes time to restore that trust.  We need to do this, however.  We will only do so if we plan and resource the programme correctly.</p> <p>  With regard to other embassies, the Deputy is absolutely right.  Asia Matters focuses only on business; we are non-political.  We are primarily examining where the quick wins and the medium-term and long-term key wins need to be.  We are very open to the idea of other embassies.  Vietnam is a great example.  Our embassy there was opened under Irish Aid.  The relationship has now moved from aid to trade.  It is great to see a developing relationship with Vietnam.  Potentially, we could open a consulate in Ho Chi Minh City, which by 2030 will be one of the megacities of the world.</p> <p>  With regard to Nepal, I hear what the Deputy saying.  I have not examined Nepal but we are very open to the idea.  I would not claim any expertise on it.  I have had the privilege of meeting people from the country but I do not have core expertise.  There are other small countries that are important in their own right but, again, we focus on specific countries.  Like every other organisation, we have limited resources and time.</p> <p>  With regard to human rights, of course we would always respect human rights.  Policy is outside our remit.  We do not set policy; our job is to act as an advisory body.  Policy matters come under the remit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I understand, however, that in the forthcoming Asia strategy report from the Department, the matter will be addressed.  I imagine the report will be out next year, hopefully in the first quarter but definitely in the second.</p></speech>

I agree there are great opportunities in Asia.  I have been to China on a number of occasions in a private capacity.  Last year, I visited with a group of Galway businesses as part of a delegation to Huzhou.  We met the secretary of the Communist Party there.  He organised a banquet for us on the night.  I was sitting beside him and the biggest discussion was on Brexit, its impact on Ireland and what would occur if the Chinese invested in Ireland.  When the Chinese invest, they want something back.  There must always be something in it for them.</p> <p>  With regard to food, I met our ambassador at a reception in Huzhou.  He came down from Hong Kong.  I believe he has moved to the United Arab Emirates now.  What was his name?</p></speech>

The provinces in China are bigger than Ireland, as members know.  The main objective of the ambassador was to twin with the city of Galway.  It was interesting that the big Chinese provinces and towns are not twinned with very many European cities.  Perhaps Mr. Murray could elaborate on this.  Particularly in respect of education, I was told the child is very special in China.  If a family wishes to send their child abroad for education, they go to the local Communist Party office and ask what towns or cities around Europe their town is twinned with.  Even as late as Monday this week, I met a representative from Huzhou in Galway.  There is still a push to twin with Galway.  Galway is twinned with Qingdao.  I spoke to the city manager and Mr. Paul Kavanagh.  I was told there are considerable advantages but we are letting ourselves down big-time because the cities twinned with Chinese cities or provinces are not putting in the work.  There are considerable opportunities.  Galway is twinned with Qingdao.  The world food market conference is to be held there next year.  Mr. Kavanagh was telling us we should get out there and work on our twinning.  If one is twinned with a Chinese city, one will receive pride of place.  Perhaps this is an opportunity on which we should start working.  I might talk to somebody about that.</p> <p>  On tourism, a few of us were in Egypt earlier this year.  We visited the pyramids one afternoon and were amazed that not one European person was to be seen.  They were all from Asia.  There were many of them there.  There were no Europeans bar ourselves.  There is a considerable opportunity in this regard.</p> <p>  GMIT and NUIG in my region have brilliant programmes through which foreign students come here.  The big problem is always getting the visa for the student to come in.  As a politician, I used to be damned asking to get the visas sorted when Senator Michael McDowell was Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  There was a case in which the son of a very prominent member of the Communist Party was in college in Waterford.  The Department refused his visa, which was a huge insult.  I got the telephone call about it.  In all fairness, the Minister sorted it.  I do not know what the system is like now but at the time in question many students came here, spent one day in college, left and were not found again.  Many of them were using the visas just to come to Ireland.</p><p>That needs to be tightened up.  I agree with Mr. Murray that there are major opportunities in China.  It is a vast country.  Many people say it is a communist country but that is not true.  If one was hit by a car in Beijing, it would most likely be an S class Mercedes, a Lexus or an Audi.  I recently met a delegation from China in Galway city that is interested in investing in major infrastructural projects due to commence in Galway in the next year or two.  They not only want to invest, but they want full control of the project and they want to bring in their own workers, as they do in relation to projects in the Middle East.</p><p> Perhaps, as stated by the Chairman, we could discuss the opportunities in this area again the new year.  I have been to China a few times and I know it would be worthwhile for members of the committee to visit it to see the opportunities that exist there.  We should do all we can to access this market in terms of food and tourism, although I understand access to visas for the education and tourism sectors is a big issue, and I know that people in the Middle East do not like hassle.</p></speech>

In regard to twinning, there are currently 14 twinning relationships between Ireland and China, one of which is particularly good.  The remainder are dependent on individuals and relationships.  The best twinning relationship is the one between Cork and China because people have invested the time and effort in building trust over many years and they have joint exchange of teachers in the education system.  They are currently doing a huge project on health care and building future healthy societies.  Cork is the most advanced in the twinning relationship.  Twinning relationships are very often put together with goodwill, but there is no focused structure behind them.  We are planning an event with key people in local government and Government around how to move twinning relationships away from generic relationships which produce nice photographs but in reality have little substance to more focused economic partnership relationships.  We need to find areas of co-operation.  We hold an Asia matters summit in Cork annually during which we focus on specific sectors and developing relationships therein.  Deputy Grealish will be glad to hear we are planning a similar event for Galway and in time for Shannon, Limerick and so on.</p> <p>  The Deputy's comments regarding the tourism area are also true.  Ireland is a small country.  The greening of landmarks has a very good effect.  It is also quite effective when key landmark buildings here turn red to mark the Chinese new year.  This could be maximised.  Tourism Ireland does a very good job in this area with limited resources.  As we have previously stated to the committee, people in tourism often forget that one does not necessarily have to go to Asia to get Asian customers because they are already in Europe.  For example, there are 55,000 Japanese people within a 40 km radius of London.  There are similar numbers in Paris, and divided between Frankfurt and Dusseldorf.  There are similar numbers of Chinese people in London but fewer Koreans.  There is no reason they could not come for long weekends, particularly off-season.  One of the biggest trends in China and Japan is for ladies in the 20 to 35 age group to visit cities where they stay in five star hotels and spend a lot of money having fun.  There is no reason that Dublin, Cork and so on could become destinations in that regard, particularly from European hubs.  There is similar business to be captured in relation to Valentine's Day, particularly in Dublin given that the remains of St. Valentine are here.  There are opportunities to meet specific needs.  In China, there is a huge obsession with authentic experiences, which feeds into the work of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in terms of providing people with opportunities to engage with local life in rural communities.  This is what people want.  </p> <p>  In regard to visas, this is an ongoing issue.  We have been told by experts from the World Travel and Tourism Council that countries such as the US and South Korea have changed their visa strategy for China and, in carefully selected scenarios and protecting national sovereignty and risk assessment, are providing visas for up to ten years and this has no detrimental economic effect or criminal effect on the US or South Korea.  We need to be bold.  We have previously told the committee that because it takes three weeks for a CEO of global Chinese companies based here to get approval to come into Ireland------</p></speech>

Mr. Murray mentioned that people in Ireland have the impression that everybody knows about Ireland, which I suspect is the result of the greening of buildings worldwide on St. Patrick's Day and so on.  However, once that day is over Ireland fades into the background.</p> <p>  I would like to concentrate on the barriers in the tourism area and so on.  I have dealt with cases on behalf of people whose family members were waiting six months for visas for a two or three week visit to Ireland.  I presume Mr. Murray has engaged with the Department of Justice and Equality on the visa issue.  What can this committee do in that regard?  Mr. Murray told us of the US experience in relation to visas.  Are there practical actions that the committee can recommend to the Department, which I know is reluctant to change policy in this area?  Some television stars from China came to Ireland last year.  Was there an increase in uptake following that event?  When it comes to European tours Ireland is not often not included.  In regard to New Grange and other similar sites, are these marketed enough when selling Ireland abroad?</p> <p>  Mr. Murray spoke about the need to promote Irish financial services.  Why would someone from Asia choose Irish financial services over similar services in Macau or London?  I found Mr. Murray's comments in relation to Brexit very interesting, particularly that while many Brexiteers are speaking about China, Japan and so on as potential markets for investment the Japanese feel let down in relation to their investment in Britain and are pulling out it.  Mr. Murray mentioned that businesses are reluctant to locate to Ireland because of the perception that there is a lack of office space and housing in Dublin city centre and so on.  Is that a perception or a reality?  </p> <p>  In regard to Mr. Murray's comments about embassy footprint and so on, the Department will say that there is a financial cost to embassy provision and that resources are limited.  Has Mr. Murray made a business case to the Department in regard to the ten additional people for China and the opening of an office in Manila?  Mr. Murray made some very strong remarks about F&Aacute;S pulling out of the graduate programme.</p><p>I would be interested to hear from F&Aacute;S why it did so.  Mr. Murray spoke of the potential in education and said there had been a 40% increase in the number of Chinese people studying in Ireland.  What is the Department's ambition in this area?  It seems a huge increase.  Is accommodation a problem when it comes to encouraging this?  At the education committee we discussed how some universities seemed to target a city in China by sending a pathfinder.</p><p> As Ireland's only Asia think tank providing business learning, does Asia Matters provide advice to companies and prospective investors on human rights?  I ask because some of the countries in the region have deplorable human rights records, with some violations carried out by private business.  Last month, the Government launched the Irish national action plan on business and human rights, following years of anticipation, although it is not as detailed or robust as many of us would like to see.  Has Asia Matters made its members aware of it and does it provide advice to companies who want to ensure they do not get involved in investments that violate human rights?</p><p> The map shows how people invest in these countries but one would not even encourage people to travel to some of them, never mind invest in them.  Is that a difficulty?  North Korea hops out from the page in this regard.  Do such matters worry investors in the wider region?</p></speech>

Other countries have succeeded by moving the visa process away from the Department of Justice and empowering embassies on the ground to process visas.  Many countries have moved to systems of online approval for visas, which speeds up the process while ensuring its integrity.  Resistance to change is human nature but without change there is no progress.  The committee might engage with the Department of Justice and Equality to examine, with relevant stakeholders, what other countries are doing, what best practice is and what has been proved to work in a safe and positive way.  We would be happy to assist in this regard.</p> <p>  The perception of Ireland is still a huge problem.  When I lived in Japan, the Japanese companies only saw England, as they called the UK, France and Germany.  I asked a CEO of a company about Ireland and he said Ireland was irrelevant.  That was fine because it meant we knew what we were dealing with and could react accordingly.  Recently, I spoke to the CEO of a global Japanese company and he thanked me because he had forgotten about Ireland until we met.  There is no reason an Asian company will think about Ireland unless we give them reasons to do so.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked me about Ireland's role in financial services.  People in financial services are obsessed with risk management and Ireland can be a safe harbour for Asian investment.  They are also obsessed with a country's talent pool and we have a very advanced talent pool in regulatory compliance, the fund sector and aviation finance, of which we are the home.  Asia Matters is partnering with the Department of Finance and PWC to research Ireland's successful branding as regards financial services in the US and to see how we can amend it to resonate better with Asian financial institutions.  Many do not understand the Irish financial services ecosystem and what assets are within it in terms of talent and skill set.</p> <p>  I was asked was space in Dublin a real problem and the answer is "Yes".  However, a lot of new office space will come on stream in the coming years.  If people feel that opening in location X will create a challenge in respect of visas and family members being able to join, as well as in the areas of office space and housing, while location Y has none of those things then they will choose Y, all things being equal.</p> <p>  Television stars create a buzz on social media but it is temporary.  This is the case with greening, too, which is wonderful but needs to be sustained.  The flights to Hong Kong are going to be a real game changer and it is estimated that 70,000 will make the journey in a year.  We have to ask where they are going to go and we are working on the ground in this regard with the consulate of Ireland and KPMG, with an event in March to discuss how we can build a structure around that flight to create benefits for Ireland.</p> <p>  We are always respectful of human rights and when we get queries from members we redirect them to the right quarters in Ireland to address them.  North Korea is not an area of focus within our work and is only considered within the view that, God forbid, if the US went to war with North Korea in any capacity US tourists would stop travelling, which would have a huge impact on Ireland.  This reinforces the need not to put all our eggs in one or two baskets but to diversify, and particularly into Asia.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether we had done costings and we have started the process of doing that.  We have also started to look at the costs of not putting the right resources on the ground, in the shape of lost business.</p></speech>

I add my voice to those who made the points about visas, particularly in the higher education sector.  This is an ongoing issue for universities and third level colleges as they try to attract students and staff from Asian countries.  Mr. Martin's point about decentralising the process to embassies on the ground seems eminently sensible and we should try to make progress on it.  The delays are often bureaucratic, rather than caused by opposition to the granting of visas, but it creates a perception that it is difficult to come to Ireland and we want to move away from that.</p> <p>  On the human rights issue, I have travelled in Asian countries and I did some work with the British Council on a women's human rights programme in Wuhan in central China some years ago.  I was struck by how the engagement of the British Council, as an arm of the British Government, promoted human rights in China and other countries.  Is there any way we can do something like that?  I am aware that we do not have the same level of resources and the British Council is very well established, but is there a model, perhaps on a smaller scale, that Ireland could adopt to assist us in the promotion of human rights in parallel with our engagement on trade and tourism?</p></speech>

We are working very closely with our Asian peers to deepen the partnership to involve joint research and staff exchanges in both directions.  The ideal scenario, which would get around the visa issue, would be for Irish universities to start opening a joint campus presence on the ground in Asia.</p><p>Deputy Grealish also made the point that sometimes there is a problem of people going to the same location selling similar courses or whatever and, therefore, there needs to be improved diversity.</p><p> Regarding the British Council, while I understand the resource issue, I recall a recommendation from some years back with pleasure that Ireland would have the equivalent of the British Council even as a scaled-down version.  That could make a huge difference on the ground promoting our culture, literature, education and, as the Senator rightly said, within that our belief in human dignity and integrity and human rights.  That would be a wonderful development.  Very often when we have an Ireland House building, we are missing that aspect to it and that perhaps could link into the resourcing on the ground.  Equally, we have said in the past that Ireland works best when the agencies and the embassy are all in one building.  It is a much better team effort.  Our work is very much a Team Ireland collective so I fully respect and endorse the Senator's comments.</p></speech>

Some years ago, I was involved in launching a course in food safety run by UCD specifically aimed at Chinese students on the basis of bringing them into the Irish system and building connections.  It is invaluable what can be achieved later when students return to their home countries and get involved in the food industry, probably at a senior level, be it in research or in the marketplace.  Apart from trying to increase revenue and numbers by attracting foreign students, is the higher education sector adopting a strategic approach or is every university or institute of technology doing its own thing?  Is a strategy overseen by the HEA or the Department?  I am bugged by duplication among agencies where they do the same job.  This has happened with cross-Border projects and cross-Border bodies where there is not enough synergy or too much silo thinking with individuals going off to do their own thing.  There could be a better return for the taxpayer and the proposed recipients of services if there was an overarching strategy and less duplication.</p></speech>

My understanding is that individual higher education institutions can be focused and strategic, particularly in areas such as teacher training.  Indonesia is critical in this regard because only 28% of university lecturers there have a PhD qualification and there are significant, fully funded government scholarships for the remaining academic staff to gain such a qualification whereby they go abroad to do a PhD and then return.  What makes them particularly important is that when they go back, they are in a position of influence because they are lecturing students in higher education institutions.  Such targeted higher education students are important for Ireland and there is a multiplier effect when they go back.</p> <p>  The approach varies among individual universities.  Many seem to being doing their own thing.  I stand to be corrected but I recall prior to the financial crisis that a fund was put together amounting to &euro;4 million to create an overarching body such as that mentioned by the Chairman, which would provide oversight in order that universities would not duplicate courses or the selling of the courses abroad to the same people but that was scrapped when the crisis hit.  We had a meeting where the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade brought back all the Irish ambassadors from Asia.  We were in the room and one ambassador said quite directly in a frustrating manner that he had just been informed by the rector of the most prestigious university in his capital city in Asia that it would refuse to accept any more higher education delegations from Ireland because within the previous six months, four delegations had been there to sell the same courses.  The rector had freed up senior management time and he said he could not afford to do that because his staff were too busy.  He said to the Irish ambassador that if universities had niche, best-in-class courses, he would be happy to meet their delegations but they would not meet similar universities selling the same courses because it was a waste of time.</p></speech>

As I said following Mr. Murray's initial contribution, we will revisit this issue.  The clerk to the committee, the committee's legal adviser and I were discussing the work programme for 2018 recently and one of the issues we discussed was doing a short report on the potential in Asia post Brexit from a trade point of view in the early part of 2018.  We are currently doing a major report on overseas development aid.  I thank Mr. Murray for his presentation and the material he has forwarded, which will be beneficial to us.

I welcome Mr. Drummond to our meeting.

As can be seen from my Mayo GAA wrist band, which I wear every day, not just for the purposes of this moment, I am a member of the best diaspora in the world, which is Ireland's.  We have a stubborn streak in us.  This band says never give up and I am sure Mayo will make it next summer.  Whether Ireland gets to 0.7% in contribution is more in the committee's gift, although I cannot rely on it for the right result for Mayo on that occasion.</p> <p>  This submission will explore some strategic arguments for Ireland's leadership in global aid and development and outline some specific areas and sectors where Irish aid, expertise and political capital would contribute in a significant way to breakthroughs in global co-operation.</p><p>I want to make three broad points.  First, despite many pressures on the budget this commitment is affordable.  Second, Irish Aid gets massive results.  Members should be confident of that, and it can leverage far more.  Third, this investment is profoundly consistent with Irish values and is in the interests of Irish citizens.  I will address each of those in turn.</p><p> First, it will not cost as much as many fear.  Today, Ireland gives 46 cent a day per citizen in smart government aid.  At 0.7% of GNI, it would be &euro;1.10 per person a day.  I will compare that with other countries.  The UK gave &euro;318 per person in 2016 in aid.  Germany gives &euro;295 per person annually.  That is compared to the average in Ireland of &euro;170 per person.  To catch up with the leadership in Europe we would be looking at roughly doubling the current amount, which is also approximately what it would take to get to 0.7% of GNI.  Let us also remember the point about the 0.7% target is that as it is linked to the performance of the economy, it is not okay to say we cannot afford it in bad times because the economy is doing badly, and then say we also cannot afford it in good times because the economy is growing too fast.  I have heard that argument quite a few times.</p><p> To date, Irish Aid has helped save 13 million lives through the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, a mechanism for whose creation we campaigned.  It has helped to save 22 million lives through the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and has helped 64 million children get into primary education through the Global Partnership for Education.  If the increase from 0.3% to 0.7% was split evenly between those mechanisms, we think that could leverage more than 300 million more children being immunised by 2020, 19 million additional children completing primary school and 14 million lives being saved.  I refer heavily here to the leverage Irish Aid can get also through multilateral mechanisms, many of which I have been working on for several years and can speak more about later.</p><p> I have been campaigning on these issues for a very long time.  I have worked in many capital cities and with people and citizens all around the world trying to argue both for increased aid but also for other policies such as transparency, trade, investment and other forms of co-operation.  I know that when a nation like Ireland steps back up in terms of quantity and quality of aid, it forces others back up and to up their game.  It will stiffen the resolve of France and Germany to go back up to and stay at 0.7% and it will also help us nudge other countries such as Canada, Belgium and Italy to increase their quantity and quality of aid.  It would also help us fight cuts in other countries such as, for example, in the United States where we had to fight a significant proposed cut by the President.  The Senate and the House in the United States stopped those cuts.  When we can point to other countries reversing a downward trajectory and going back up again it helps us with that global leverage.  Ireland plays a somewhat disproportionate role in that narrative about global co-operation for development so when it goes back up, we know it helps us leverage even more with other countries.  It really helps us put a spring back in the step of the global movement for co-operation and development.  It may also bolster the case for a UN Security Council seat.</p><p> In terms of quality of aid, Ireland has a good reputation for quality and a great reputation for focusing on the poorest people in the poorest counties, and that is something to be treasured as it is not often the case.  Those locations continue to represent the primary sources of instability and main contributors to human displacement worldwide, and are where, on current trends, the world will find the last pockets of extreme poverty in the lead up to 2030.  Nations like Germany do not focus as much on the poorest in the poorest countries and while the UK often does, it is withdrawing somewhat from some of those mechanisms right now, so Ireland increasing also allows it to make the case for that increased focus through some of those mechanisms.  That is a role we really wish Ireland would play more.</p><p> Investing in smart aid is in Irish interests and consistent with the best of Irish values.  The world faces extraordinary threats from inequality and populism.  There is food insecurity, climate change and global pandemics.  There are also some fascinating 21st-century challenges such as the education emergency.  I will speak a little more about that on the basis that we are more familiar with some of the other issues.  There is a shortage in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, subjects in the industrialised West as we confront the fourth industrial revolution, but this shortage becomes more acute in emerging markets where learning often tends to be more by rote.  That is further compounded in the poorest countries, not just by the wrong skills being taught but by children not even going to school.  Moreover, because the quality of education is so poor they are essentially learning little of value when they are in school.  That is particularly true for girls, especially in Africa.  As leaders like Justin Trudeau, Malala Yousafzai and Melinda Gates have declared, poverty is sexist.  A total of 130 million girls globally are out of school who should be in, and 500 million women cannot read or write.  That is clearly a crime against them, but those women are also raising a generation who are missing out, and that is a part of what is breeding anger, resentment and inequality around the world.  A decent, quality education is not only the first step on the ladder to equality; it is also part of the vaccine against instability and extremism.</p><p> Initially, leadership to solve the global education emergency requires investing in the Global Partnership for Education.  The partnership has a summit on 3 February in Dakar, Senegal.  We hope Ireland will be well represented and leading on that occasion.  The partnership is looking for &euro;30 million to &euro;40 million from Ireland, but in addition we think Ireland can play a leadership role in demanding better quality education and the management of quality education outcomes by partnering with bodies like the OECD, EU and AU and by partnering with the global technology community which has found itself some element of a home here.  Members will see where this is going.  Given how Ireland is a home to so many of the major technology companies a deeper partnership with them on improving the quality of data and metrics in education is sought.  The big problem in delivering quality education is the lack of good data and metrics to measure outcomes.  That could grow into a real area of comparative advantage for Ireland and Irish Aid.  Ireland could resume its place as a centre of global excellence in education.  Currently, one might associate Ireland with education through the missionaries.  There is a legacy in many parts of Africa from that time that is often fondly remembered but that legacy can be modernised and built upon, not just returning to what Ireland once was, the land of saints and scholars of old but of silicon, software and future-proofed skills, a beacon of open ideas, open minds, open economies and open societies when others want to get more inward, closed and opaque.  We really think this is an historic opportunity for Ireland.</p><p> As someone who has worked for global social justice through movements for debt cancellation, fighting AIDS, hunger and corruption for many years all over the world &ndash; and with my roots here &ndash; I can say without qualification that Ireland is a small but mighty nation that speaks with a strong moral voice on the global stage.  Many partners in the global south are aware of, and identify with, Ireland's history of fighting famine and colonial oppression.  This places Ireland in an ideal position as a leader not just in fighting poverty but in increasing trade investment, improving security and fighting corruption.  As such, Ireland's voice is heard in the tone of partnership not patronage.</p><p> Irish Aid has long had a special focus on partnering with Africa, which is particularly important.  Africa's population is set to double by 2050 to 2.5 billion and by then, the region will have given birth to 40% of the world's youth.  By then, Africa's youthful population will be ten times the size of Europe's.  Ireland must invest in this demographic boom and must force others to follow for if we fail, there will be deep demographic division and instability across that region, which is at risk of extreme poverty, extreme climate and extreme ideology.  That is what we call the three extremes.  There will be a downside for Ireland's partners across Africa, Europe and for the global economy and security, but if we get the investments and partnerships right the region's youth can be the engine to drive inclusive growth for generations to come.  This is not just the morally right thing to do, it is the economic and strategically smart thing to do.  That makes it the Irish thing to do.</p><p> The international community is relying on Ireland to reach its 0.7% commitment by 2025.  On top of increased resources to the poorest, Ireland can promote a forensic focus on gender, on citizen-led accountability, on improved data and innovation in areas such as measurement of nutrition and education outcomes and digital financial inclusion.</p><p>I emphasise that not only would this impact positively on Irish Aid programmes, it would also catalyse improvements in the global aid programme.  The latter is currently worth approximately &euro;143 billion a year.</p><p> Across the world, there are leaders who are capitalising on fears of an unfair form of globalisation running rampant and who threaten and close down the space for civil society, who oppress minorities and who reduce citizens' rights.  Through increased quantities and a more strategic quality of aid, Ireland will not just be part of, but lead the global drive for openness, progress and a fairer, more just form of globalisation.  The globalisation of human rights, democracy, peace and stability is not guaranteed.  Ireland's leadership in this fight is needed now more than ever.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Drummond for his excellent presentation and commend him on all the great work.  Like other members of the committee, I am very familiar with the work the ONE Foundation has been doing for such a long time.  It is terrific.  I also thank him for giving us such a succinct presentation on the need to ensure we move to 0.7%.  As Mr. Drummond knows, we are carrying out an overview of Irish Aid and our overseas development aid programme generally.  We have heard, as Mr. Drummond suggested, the point from Government that we cannot afford 0.7% in good times because the economy is growing too fast and it represents too much.  That is putting it bluntly, albeit the Government stated it somewhat more diplomatically.  I am glad Mr. Drummond made the point that it is not really a logical response.   I am also glad he emphasised Ireland's leverage through multilateral mechanisms, which is something on which we have been focusing.  We are looking at our overseas development aid programme in terms of both our bilateral links and what we contribute through multilateral programmes.  Clearly, there is an importance attached to both.  I am grateful for the presentation and I apologies for the fact that I cannot stay to hear the full responses.</p></speech>

We know ourselves the effect Irish Aid has because we have seen the evidence at first hand on visits the committee has made to some of our partner countries in Africa.  A recent visit was to Malawi and northern Mozambique.  Aid is getting results and part of that is because our aid has been and continues to be untied.  As Mr. Drummond says, it is focused on the poorest and on poverty reduction.  We are seeing another agenda outside Ireland which is placing untied aid under threat.  Aid is being used on in-country refugee situations, which badly need funding, and also on security.  As such, there is a real danger the aid can be diverted in some countries.  It will still go under the term "aid" but it will not be used in the way it has traditionally been used.  We have to be very aware of that.  Mr. Drummond mentioned USAID and there are still questions over UK aid and where it will go after Brexit.  It may go to other areas such as former colonies rather than to the places it has been going.</p> <p>  Population control is crucial, including access to reproductive health measures for women.  I know it is very difficult in some communities in some countries but it is one thing we do not talk about enough.  I know it is competing with climate change and all the other issues, but it is also vital.  I was delighted to hear what Mr. Drummond said about education because my disappointment with the millennium development goals was that while we successfully got more children into school, there was a question about what they were getting into.  It was not quality education.  Teacher training is vital there.  They might not have the infrastructure, but if they have the quality teacher training, it could be excellent.</p> <p>  Does Mr. Drummond agree that there is sometimes a need for an independent review of aid, not just Ireland's but that of other countries too?  Aid must also be about building resilience.  People must get to the point where they move away from aid when the aid they have received has helped them to be resilient and independent.  We planned a meeting - which we postponed - on how we would spend the 0.7% if we got to that level and on what would be the priorities.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-14a.1067" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jamie Drummond" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017121400002#O00700"><p>Aid reviews are absolutely essential.  The OECD development assistant committee peer review process is very helpful and Ireland often does quite well out of that.  Specific programmes are evaluated and Ireland is among the best in class at doing that.  There is a body of work to which we should all pay more attention.  It is about specific aid programmes of countries but also about African countries' own programmes.  That is empowering young people to track and monitor results and to collect data to fill in missing data feedback loops.  One of the great problems in development spending is that, unlike a market mechanism which tells one whether people are buying a product, we do not get great feedback from the clients, who are the poorest people.  That is because they are marginalised and disempowered, but also because we have very bad data on them.  Through modern technology, we are more able than in the past to get their direct feedback on what they need and what they think about what we are doing.  We can even provide them with the opportunity to collect data on the quality of the services provided to them.  There are some pilot programmes doing this which have demonstrated very good results and improved the quality of aid spending in those cases.</p> <p>  We argue strongly that this is a process which needs to be scaled up not only by Irish Aid but also by all global aid programmes.  For example, we are trying to encourage the World Bank in this regard through its concessional lending arm, the International Development Association, IDA, which will be spending an amazing $45 billion in Africa in the next three years.  That figure is on foot of an unusually large replenishment.  However, at this moment in time, the bank lacks particularly innovative ideas on how to track and monitor the outcome of that enormous spend.  They are just doing the same stuff they did a few years ago.  The are opportunities to scale up far more innovative ways to track that money.  I put it to the committee that if Ireland is going back to 0.7% and leans on some of the committee's Dublin neighbours, who include some of the most advanced data, technology and financial inclusion companies in the world, it might be possible to step into a breach, innovate and lead, not just through going from 0.3% to 0.7%, but by leading the expenditure of that $45 billion.  While that sounds like I might be overstating the case, I can see an opportunity for Ireland.  I strongly encourage stepping into the breach to leverage that $45 billion.  People would know that Ireland did it.</p></speech>

They seem to be a missing feature when it comes to aid and development issues.  We are very involved in our Parliament but when we visit African countries, we sometimes do not see the same engagement from their parliamentarians.  They should have a role and should engage.</p></speech>

I draw the attention of the committee to a particular example.  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan mentioned the committee's visit to Mozambique.  I have been paying a lot of attention to the situation there.  It recently borrowed $2 billion, which then disappeared.  If members do not know about the details of the case, I encourage them to look into it given that Ireland has, quite rightly, put a great deal of money into Mozambique over the years and achieved amazing results.  Poverty and hunger have been halved.  In the past couple of years, however, and in anticipation of natural resource revenues, things got a bit out of control.  Contracts were made and a crazy PowerPoint project was put together, with some wild assumptions about the future revenues of a tuna fishing fleet.  As a result, $2 billion was lent to the country without parliamentary oversight, scrutiny or knowledge.</p><p>Someone associated with the attorney general in that country allegedly signed off on something and now it has to pay back $2 billion that it did not know it had borrowed.  Plainly, that is corrupt and, in our view, a crime on behalf of those who lent the money and on behalf of those who signed off on that money within the country.  Both sides need to be held accountable along with those who aided and abetted that crime.  The anatomy of this crime is something to which we need to pay attention.</p><p> As somebody who campaigned for debt cancellation and increased aid for Mozambique, I feel very passionately about this.  I hope all the committee members will get irritated and angry about what they are hearing today, particularly if they have not heard about the matter previously.  We have to stop that kind of thing happening because it undermines our aid programmes if it is allowed to go on.  The missing piece was that the public accounts committee was not informed and so was not able to do its job.  Across the continent, they are often not well capacitated and need more support.  If the committee is thinking about technical assistant programmes or capacity building for those, that is a very good use of people's time and money.</p></speech>

It is not just about reaching that target, but also about the quality of that assistance.  Is Mr. Drummond concerned that we do not seem to have a structured plan to reach that target?  Is that a weakness in Ireland's approach?</p> <p>  Mr. Drummond talked about the importance of the Irish voice and about Ireland as a mighty nation that speaks out with a strong moral voice on the global stage.  Is he concerned that because of our engagement with the EU, we may be losing that voice to some extent?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-14a.1072" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jamie Drummond" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017121400002#P00300"><p>I would say that every nation's voice is quavering at the moment as a result of the threat of populism and fears about a form of globalisation that is running rampant and is patently unfair to many.  We need to work together to reform many of the institutions of the global financial architecture and taxation systems; they must be reformed.  That is the job of political leadership, civil society, the private sector and a good informed media debate over the next generation.</p> <p>  Within that, Ireland's voice has been quavering in the past decade.  It is being heard more strongly now than it has been for a while.  That is partly because of the economy doing a bit better and partly because of people paying attention to political developments within this country and being fascinated by them.  There is evidence that the best of the old Ireland is being added to by something new and interesting, which is a global island that is very open in terms of ideas, its economy and its mind.  Ireland can be an extraordinary voice for what I would call a radical variety of centrism that takes voices from the left and the right, but figures out what is pragmatically correct and then gets those that are its neighbours and that, perhaps, in some ways have broader shoulders - on both sides of the Atlantic - to do better things.</p> <p>  The Irish might know the director of the OMB because he is from Ireland's diaspora.  Ireland might have particular sway over European processes as it does right now for various different reasons.  This position of Ireland as a global island speaking boldly on the international stage will keep attracting attention and investment to this place.  I encourage Ireland to use that voice more.</p></speech>

Unfortunately many countries, including some in Europe, are going in the opposite direction.</p> <p>  Does ONE have a campaign on trade justice issues?  We are increasingly seeing in this Parliament and committee that the EU is signing deep and comprehensive agreements with countries in the developing world.  People talk about a complete lack of fairness and accountability in them.  There is poor democratic oversight and debate regarding these important trade agreements, certainly within EU countries but also in the countries that are actually signed up to the.  I say that particularly in the context of the involvement of parliamentarians.  We would argue that they have far-reaching consequences.</p> <p>  Mr. Drummond mentioned tax justice, debt relief and debt justice.  Does ONE campaign on justice issues?  Tax justice is very important in the context of development.  According to Oxfam, corporations and the super-rich are cheating poor countries out of $170 billion in tax revenues every year.  This fuels inequality; eight men now have the same wealth as half of the world's population.  Corporations and the super-rich dodge taxes.  It is the poorest who pay the price.  Mr. Drummond gave the example of that deal that was there.  The poor in those countries will be saddled with that debt when those politicians move on.</p> <p>  Has ONE commented on the latest Panama Papers?  What is Mr. Drummond's view on that area?  Does that form part of ONE's work?</p></speech>

We are working on those issues.  We have been working on transparency since the organisation's establishment.  The original name of ONE was DATA, which was a slightly funky acronym that I was very proud of at the time.  It stood for debt, aid, trade in return for democracy, accountability, transparency.  Simplistic flows of cash do not get results, empower people, build capacity or enable countries in the long run to stand on their own feet and not require aid because they have achieved the goals.</p> <p>  Ireland once received a lot of aid, as did Germany - after the Second World War - South Korea, etc.  There is a long track record of development partnership and getting countries to a point where they are then contributors through aid, trade and investment to global prosperity and security.  Transparency and accountability are core to that.  ONE has been part of a fantastic movement for greater transparency and accountability that has manifested itself in the brilliant work of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.  That march of justice and transparency is fairly awe-inspiring and is revealing things left, right and centre.  Warren Buffet once said that as the tide goes out we find out who is wearing their pants.  As it reveals things, citizens can have better and more-informed debate about wrong and right.</p> <p>  It is important for legislators to do their job by identifying things that are wrong and making them illegal.  Right now, there is considerable vagueness about the position and we need to make it clear and articulate.  Through the OECD base erosion and profit shifting process much of that work is being done and it is very important.  I am sure Ireland is engaging very actively in that.  There may well be a role for Ireland in the future.</p> <p>  I recently spoke with a board member, Mo Ibrahim, who is a leading light for good governance.  He is a Sudanese entrepreneur who basically brought the mobile phone to Africa, which significantly contributed to African GDP growth and poverty reduction in the past decade.  Many people thought the mobile phone was a luxury item until he introduced an innovative frugal bottom-of-the-pyramid business model that could deliver these mobile phones.  He did that through a global business, using global investment partners.  It requires organising his business through financial centres that could be called offshore.  It is important to have a well-informed debate about how global business investment actually works and then create and lock down best-in-class financial centres that are transparent, clear about what they are doing and do not participate in the rapacious, piratical creation of havens and loopholes the pure purpose of which is to steal profits from other countries' economies and then tax them at a very low rate tax when they arrive in one's country.</p><p>That is wrong.  A low corporate tax rate on activities within a country is absolutely the right of the citizens and State to debate and agree upon but that kind of other behaviour is being identified as wrong in public debate by increasing numbers of policymakers.  Through the OECD's BEPS process, those loopholes and havens are being identified and outlawed.  It is important to get on the right side of history and get ahead of that process and we strongly welcome that.</p></speech>

I have spent a lot of time working on it and have less to show for those efforts than I would like.  The area of domestic politics is often very difficult.  I am familiar with the power of the farming lobby in the west of Ireland, for example and that makes some of the arguments difficult.  In the long run, we have had some victories, including the campaign to end the export subsidies that encouraged dumping in developing markets.  That is not happening anymore or if it is happening, it is happening too creatively to be found.  We also created the African growth and opportunity act which has created hundreds of thousands of jobs on the continent.  The biggest impediment to economic growth on the continent currently is the lack of regional trade within the region.  The degree to which the post-Cotonou process, the economic partnership agreements, EPAs, etc., can open our markets in an appropriate way while also opening their markets to each other in a carefully managed way is extremely important.  As Mo Ibrahim would put it, too many African economies and countries are sub-scale.  They are too small.  It is a security imperative that they regionally, and, possibly, even politically, integrate in the end.  If one looks at places such as the Sahel, it needs far greater regional integration.  If one looks at the East African Community, EAC, it too needs far greater regional integration if those economies are to work.  Countries such as Rwanda and Burundi desperately need more trade and cross-border investment with their neighbours in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda and then onward to the borders and global trade.</p> <p>  Ultimately, those trade deals are extremely important and the infrastructure to facilitate trade is extremely important too.  People win and lose when trade deals happen.  The losers in that process have not been looked after and invested in, particularly through education, appropriately.  That has been a serial failure of global trade agreements.  Promises are made that the poorest will be looked after when the restructuring happens but those promises are not kept.  Then there is a backlash and the xenophobes do better in elections, but that is avoidable.</p></speech>

I wish to congratulate him and his 9 million members around the world who are doing such wonderful work in helping the underprivileged and the poor.  Irish people are extremely generous.  When I was a young boy, there was a box in the classroom where one put money for the black babies.  We were brought up with a concern for Africa and the poor.  In terms of education, it actually embedded in people's minds that it is good to give.  The generosity of Irish people is excellent.  Things have moved on now and we do not have boxes in the classrooms any more.  Ireland has become more educated but it has also become more critical.  We have this influx of people from other parts of the world into our society.  While fully supporting the work that Mr. Drummond's organisation does, people are, generally speaking, becoming more questioning as to what is being done with the money that is being spent because they see a lot of abuse.  I am making this point because we have to be able to answer these questions.  We must be able to answer them in the context of the requests being made by organisations like the ONE campaign and others for an increase the size of the aid budget.  There is not enough feedback in terms of where the money is going and whether it is being targeted.  When one looks at some countries, particularly in Africa, one sits back in despair.  Some of the first troops we ever sent on a peacekeeping mission were sent to Congo but when I looked at the television last night, I thought to myself that it has gone backwards.  This is what people see and they are wondering if we have made any progress at all.  Then they begin to ask where the money is going.</p> <p>  The point I am making is that there is not an unwillingness to increase our percentage in terms of contributions but we must be able to answer the people that we represent.  I would like to think that any money I would give would be invested in areas like education and health because we will never get rid of poverty until we educate people.  That is a fact.  The more ignorant one keeps people, the less capable they are of making hard decisions for themselves and so on.  </p> <p>  I would like to hear Mr. Drummond's views on this issue.  In the context of the vast sums of money spent on aid, is there any move towards placing more emphasis on education and health services as distinct from just allocating money for various projects?  We do not know if those projects succeed or disappear.  I hope Mr. Drummond appreciates the point I am trying to make.  I am not in any way being critical.  I just think it is worthwhile, when we have people like Mr. Drummond before us, to give him the opportunity to answer the questions that are put to us when we go looking for increases in aid and so on.  I ask Mr. Drummond to give us a broad outline in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-14a.1080" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jamie Drummond" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017121400002#Q00600"><p>First, we should thank you for thanking us but then thank you back.  Ireland has given generously for generations and there is a reason for that.  I was in Dugort in County Mayo recently where things happened 150 years ago that no-one here wants to see repeated anywhere.  However, those type of things are still happening.  The Deputy is right that one would like to think that after 50 years of global aid programmes, those problems would have been ended but humanity is a restless thing.  We keep moving on and creating new opportunities and challenges for ourselves and our brothers and sisters.  Basically that is a good thing but rapid population growth, innovation, shifts in geopolitics and the form of globalisation that we are living with at the moment have created a new supply chain for certain products.</p><p>For example, the key ingredient in the material used to manufacture the mobile phone that has just interfered with the sound equipment - coltan - comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo which was mentioned by Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett.  However, we seem to be unable to do anything about it because we are so dependent on the resource.</p><p> The funding for Ireland's aid programme must be increased again.  I ask the committee to keep fighting for quality in the programme.  I will come to some of the results it has delivered.  I would be completely wrong if I were to say seeking an increase in funding is all the committee has to do.  Ireland needs to increase its aid funding in order that it can speak about some of the other issues such as trade, investment and fighting corruption to ensure sensible international co-operation.  Reaching 0.7% of GDP is the price the country will pay not only for saving lives with the money but also for being able to speak about some of the broader issues that will make the money go much further.</p><p> I have outlined some of the specific results in going from 0.3% to 0.7% of GDP and will happily supply the committee with them in written form.  They run to the tens of millions once funding is leveraged through multilateral mechanisms such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations and the Global Partnership for Education.  Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett asked for details in the areas of health and education.  These are three such mechanisms and deliver great returns.  Therefore, the committee can be incredibly confident that the money spent on these programmes will produce great returns and that they are also highly efficient because they have good inspector generals, budgeting processes, transparency and accountability levels throughout the system.  When they identify corruption, it is revealed and made transparent.  By the way, that often gets more headlines than when there is opacity in the system.  It might be the case, therefore, that there is an appearance of more corruption precisely because we have campaigned for transparency to reveal what is in fact happening.  An ironic by-product of the campaign for transparency is that sometimes it reveals the truth, which might be more corruption in some places than we would all like, but that is better than not knowing and allows us to identify the problem, go after it, solve it and reclaim the money and then reprogramme it when we have more confidence.  The return on investment in such items as antimalarial bed nets, vaccines, antiretroviral drugs, TB dosages through direct observation therapy and the scaling up of nutrition programmes about very basic nutritional interventions, especially for infants for the first 1,000 days in the womb and early life, is spectacular and nowhere near maxed out.  A lot more money could be spent in these areas to achieve far greater returns.  We should, therefore, furnish members with the best possible responses to people who ask that question across the country in order that they could point to the results already achieved and what more could be done with the money and explain why it was not only the right thing to do morally but also in Ireland's strategic and economic long-term interests.</p></speech>

I lived in the days when my parents had to pay for me to attend second level school, never mind third level.  In my lifetime education has been a huge answer to Ireland's many problems.  I firmly believe that if one asks people for money for a given thing such as education programmes in Africa, it would be easier to get them to agree to an increase in the aid budget to 0.7% of GDP rather than simply asking them to agree to move from a figure of 0.3% to 0.7%.  Does Mr. Drummond get my point?</p></speech>

Some of the stakeholders we have met have expressed concern about the rising allocations of ODA to the multilateral organisations and, similarly, the climbing amounts being spent bilaterally and the resourcing of NGOs.  Does Mr. Drummond have a view on this issue?  Does he have concerns about the effectiveness of the oversight mechanisms in place within multilateral organisations?  Furthermore, I do not know how familiar he is with the fact that Ireland has a number of partner countries with which we have a particular focus.  Does he think we should have a broader range of partner countries with which to have particular programmes?</p></speech>

I will not deny I am a believer in the multilateral system and think we all should be.  I worry about an overemphasis on bilateral programmes.  One needs some such programmes in order that one has proper skin in the game on a few issues, but multilateral mechanisms are extremely important and here is the reason.  </p> <p>  I ask the committee to think of us not from our point of view but from the perspective of the people with whom we are trying to partner and help.  A good finance Minister in a given African nation does not want to have 1,354 aid missions, with several from each country and also several from many multilateral mechanisms.  One desperately needs the greatest level of co-ordination the international system can offer and multilateral mechanisms are one of the key ways this co-ordination occurs.  It allows for an economy of scale and a reduction of overheads when they are well managed, which is not always the case.  Therefore, I encourage Ireland to put enough money into the multilateral system to demand that it be as good as it can be.  Reluctant participants do not get chances to leverage the big money and, I am afraid, might then become smaller fish in a smaller pond, something they do not really want.  This does not mean that all bilateral programmes should be stopped; rather, it means that one should think strategically about multilateral mechanisms.  One may want to invest in NGOs in so far as they help with the strategy of leveraging multilateral mechanism money.  </p> <p>  I alluded earlier to the breakthroughs in technology and how they were allowing us to empower young people, the girls in the secondary school whom we were trying to target with aid or the young mothers whom we were trying to reach with services.  If they can provide feedback on whether the services are right, proper and good and being delivered through a technological, entrepreneurial NGO that is often a local, grassroots African organisation and highly innovative, that is a very good use of money because it helps with the strategy of leveraging multilateral mechanism money and the money the donor country has given to the government.  I am less excited about allocating large amounts of money to international NGOs as a general long-term practice.  That may put me at odds with others, but in the long run it should not be our objective as much.  Increasingly, within such countries they do not look favourably on the big international NGO scene as its representatives arrive in the alleged 4x4s and kick up the dust.  It is the local NGOs that often do the best work, are significantly under-resourced and do amazingly innovative things, especially with technology.  It is the young people and the generation I mentioned in Africa who are rising up and in whom we must invest.  With the centre of excellence in Dublin with the technology companies, Ireland can do something very interesting to reach out to that generation, in particular, across the continent.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, there is now only a small number of Irish missionaries there, but the work of Irish Aid in funding particular programmes and the work of individual members of Irish NGOs was very impressive.  We met people from different countries.  I always recall the phrase used by the EU ambassador to Malawi when he spoke to us.  He said the footprint of Irish ODA was very impressive.</p><p>He was speaking about projects in Malawi that Irish Aid is funding.</p><p> The statistics in Mr. Drummond's presentation are startling.  As Senator Bacik noted, it is very concise and comprehensive.  This is the type of message that we need to get out to people living here.  I never hear people cribbing about the Exchequer money that goes to Irish Aid, regardless of the challenges and the many competing demands for public expenditure.  There is a great appreciation of the needs of people in those countries who live in awful circumstances.  In communities where someone is working as a missionary or as a lay person, there are often fundraisers when they are home, and when there are crises, Irish people rise to the challenge and contribute handsomely to different disaster aid fundraisers.  Nevertheless, as members of this committee have discussed informally among ourselves, we need to get a clearer message across to Irish taxpayers about the effectiveness of such funds and the good use to which they are put.  I do not know how this can be done.  Does Mr. Drummond have any particular suggestions on how the message of the scale of need in these developing countries can be conveyed, as well as our particular role in addressing the horrific challenges that exist?</p></speech>

As a campaigner, one usually looks to see if there are upcoming moments in the calendar where there are action-forcing moments to get a message across.  There might be moments in 2018 that might be used for that.  There will certainly be further crises and challenges when the media tend to cover these issues.  One challenge is that the media only cover things when there is a crisis.  It would be good to find a proactive way to communicate good news.  It is a shame that the good news of the Jubilee 2000 campaign and the millennium development goals was not fully heard.  The statistics for lives saved are extraordinary.  They are amazing and they might not have happened but they happened because we got together as an international community and created the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, the Global Partnership for Education, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and made the World Bank more effective.  Those things are to be treasured.  They could be lost, but they can also be built on.  They delivered on saving millions of lives and improved millions more for people who would otherwise be in worse condition for the rest of their lives.</p> <p>  The problem is that social media are in our face all the time and tell us more and more dramatic, shorter, attention-grabbing messages.  There is also the fact of a demographic explosion in Africa.  People of Irish origin will be familiar with where there is a period when a large number of children are born, there is lower infant mortality but family planning is unchanged and there is very large population growth.  That has been occurring for an extended time on the continent of Africa.  There are many people in Africa who are competing over relatively scarce natural resources in some parts of the continent.  We need to double down on investments in that region, and Irish Aid has led in investing in that region.  It is important for the country to continue with this.</p> <p>  I have often thought that we ought to have some sort of envelope similar to that for babies which was referred to by the Deputy.  There is probably a more 21st century way of delivering that message that does not rely on the pews in the churches as much but which does work through secondary schools.  Perhaps there is a development education programme in this that Ireland can look at that would engage younger people in a more systematic way.  In the UK we have something called Red Nose Day which takes place every other year which has been incredibly effective.  It is a partnership between the BBC and Comic Relief in which we all participate and support.  Richard Curtis did an amazing thing in creating it.  Inspired by Bob Geldof's work with Live Aid, he created Sport Relief and Comic Relief.  It has been incredibly effective for nearly 30 years in educating every younger person on the importance of these issues, just as the envelope which Deputy Barrett mentioned would have done.  Something like that would be a very good idea, not merely to justify the aid programme but to get people to think differently about the other because, as Africa's population doubles, no matter what the circumstances, many of them will come to Europe either as economic migrants or refugees.  It would be a good thing if they were to come to a place that has an open mind and with economies that are doing well.  We will be senile.  Demographically we will be senescent and we will need their youthful energy to do stuff.  That is merely what the economic statistics tell us and the demographic data demand.  Demography is destiny.  Europe and Africa will have a very close 21st century.  The question is what kind of closeness will it be.  These kinds of investments, through the aid programme but also into people's minds and ideas about who we are, gives less succour to the xenophobes and populists who will do very well in the political climate in the next couple of decades if we do not get this right.  I think we should all be quite worried if we do not make these investments, not only in aid but also in other policies such as transparency.  People need to see that the system is fair and that it is delivering in countries and regionally.</p></speech>

Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members should be aware that under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode as mobile phones interfere with the sound system and make it difficult for parliamentary reporters to report the meeting.

I am here in a private capacity, as the Chairman noted.  The members are all aware that A Vision for Change was published in 2006 and it has since provided the framework for mental health policy.  It is unusual in that the policy has been accepted across parties and everybody sees that A Vision for Change is the policy framework.  As we all know, the big problem has been in implementation.<br/><br/>Today I will consider the framework for the delivery of mental health supports and services, and in doing so I will deal with three matters for discussion.  The first is the wider view of mental health supports and services.  The second is the establishment of an interdepartmental group at national level that would deliver locally; it would be a cross-governmental working group.  All of us are in the community health care organisation areas and we can influence what is happening in these areas because we live there.  Although the issue is national, it is also local and it affects everybody.  The third area on which I will speak is the Mental Health Act 2001, particularly the amendment of the Act to include the idea of an approved clinician.  I will speak to that later.<br/><br/>When speaking about mental health services, we must take a wider look as it involves both supports and services.  In the documentation there is a diagram from A Vision for Change and the members are familiar with it.  It highlights the matter.  Community support, primary care and mental health services are outlined but the vast majority of people, or 90%, are seen within that big area.  It is where GPs and primary care comes in and people with mental health difficulties use them for help.  We need to create a public awareness and shared understanding of what is mental health.  This is about mental health supports and early intervention at an early stage.  It is about delivery for mental health services.  Mental health is a continuum, as we all know, and we can all get into difficulties.  We do not necessarily need mental health services but we need early intervention.  If we are lucky we get it from family, friends or community but we can also get it from GPs, who are the gatekeepers of services and support.  In creating a shared understanding of mental health, we will have the key to the delivery of effective services.  It will help young people and adults to assess services.  If we have a prevention model, we will be able to do our work much more effectively.  We know from international research that 75% of all mental disorders have already begun under the age of 25.  The early intervention is important.<br/><br/>Within the GP service and community there is an array of elements.  I will leave my colleagues to speak for GPs and primary care, and I am sure they will do it more effectively than I can.  There are other people in the community, including nurses, psychologists and counsellors.  There is an array of people in that community.  One of the problems - with due respect to colleagues - is that not all GPs know about these services.  They do not have the time but they are still the gatekeepers.  We need to consider how we resource GPs and that community service.  In the wider group of mental health elements, there are a number of issues to be considered.  We are beginning the process.<br/><br/>As political leaders in this area, the members can make this happen.  We need consultation and advocacy at an early stage.  We need awareness and training for GPs, teachers, youth leaders and communities.  This includes members of the GAA, rugby and soccer, as well as all kinds of organisations that meet young people.  We need to examine how to be more effective with online mental health supports, which are really important.  I do not know if the committee is familiar with <i>reachout.com</i>, which is geared towards those aged between 18 and 25.  It is for young people having difficulties rather than young people with severe and disabling disorders.</p><p>We need to promote families and support them to promote mental health among their young members.  We must also support schools and third level institutions. </p><p> If we have that within the lower section to which I referred, and I believe many of these services are in place, we need to ask ourselves how we align supports and mental health services and provide access to them.  What do we need?  We have the building blocks in the community but we need to change the system.  I will cite the example of the child and adolescent mental heath services, CAMHS.  We all know given the prominence of the issue in the public domain that there are waiting lists for CAMHS.  These waiting lists are symptomatic of a system that is fragmented, with referrals for support often inappropriately going to CAMHS.  If we spent all our time and effort eliminating waiting lists, we could do so but they would return after a month.  We must ask, therefore, what is wrong and the answer is the system.  We know, for example, that five of the nine community health organisations, CHOs, do not have waiting lists of more than a certain time.  What is needed, therefore, is effective leadership, co-ordination and teamwork, close to full staffing and no recruitment problems.</p><p> While members may be aware of this, I was surprised to learn that almost 100,000 staff support young people in different way.  They are funded by the Government for mental health supports and services and almost &euro;300 million is spent on youth mental health.  This is all documented very well in the Pathfinder report.  There is also no single policy for youth mental health or a single Department responsible for it.  The focus has not been on local circumstances or areas.  What do we need?  The joint committee can make a major difference in this regard.  We need a system change because while the blocks are in place, the system is not working effectively.  We need an interdepartmental working group consisting of representatives of all the Departments and agencies, as well as non-governmental organisations working in the community.  This national body could deliver mental health services effectively by providing national co-ordination.  Locally, a liaison person would be in place who would help signpost in each CHO area all the services and supports available in the area in question.  He or she would also work with general practitioners and identify gaps in services locally.</p><p> Some members may remember the severe jobs crisis the country experienced in the early 1990s when unemployment in certain areas stood at between 30% and 40%.  At that time, the Department of the Taoiseach brought together representatives of the relevant Departments, agencies and communities to address the issue of jobs.  This was a highly effective approach and I suggest we adopt a similar strategy in the area of mental health, taking an overarching, a cross-departmental and an across-Government approach.   While there is another approach, it would take longer implement.  We should start, therefore, with the area based approach.  There are legal requirements in the Public Service Management Act 1997 but the changes required could be made over time.</p><p> I suggest that we have a liaison person in each CHO area to co-ordinate the provision of supports and services and identify gaps.  These individuals would work to standard operating procedures and there would be appropriate communications protocols, standard assessment processes and co-ordination of the services.  This approach would cut waiting times immediately and standardise referral processes.  People who badly need mental health services would have access to them, while all others would be directed to general practitioners and community services.  There would be an appropriate intervention at a time, place and pace that is appropriate for the person and it would be much more effective.  While these changes are under way, systematic change is needed to make a real difference.  The importance of interagency co-ordination cannot be overstated.  I ask the joint committee to consider this proposal.</p><p> My third point relates to the Mental Health Act.  I refer specifically to the emphasis placed on the consultant psychiatrist in the Act and the consultants' contract.  This is viewed as an impediment to multidisciplinary working.  However, a review of the Mental Health Act in 2015 did not recommend introducing the role of "approved clinician" but proposed instead that the matter be considered again.  I ask members to consider the introduction of the role of approved clinician, which has been introduced in other countries very effectively.  It has been in place in the United Kingdom since 2007, for example, and could be introduced here through a statutory instrument.</p><p> There is good evidence that multidisciplinary working can be achieved and lead to approved outcomes.  It is not possible to become an approved clinician overnight and a person must complete extensive training and do considerable work to achieve this designation.  However, there is also a supporting training programme which has been developed in the United Kingdom.  It is known as the choice and partnership approach or CAPA and has been used in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom, Malta, Belgium.  I understand its use here has commenced.  The value of the programme is that it enables people from different backgrounds to work together more effectively.  While I do not have time to discuss it in detail, at the end of the process an administrator makes appointments for all team members without consulting them.  This means the diaries of all team members are put together.  This approach has been highly effective in other countries.</p><p>  I ask the Chairman and members to help make the changes I have set out.  The first step would be to make a statement about the wider view of mental health supports and services to help people to understand the complexity of this issue.  It is also a simple issue, however.  Most of us are at the lower level to which I described and any of us could need help at an appropriate time.  However, we will never get it if we have to try to access it at the high level.  Members should help people to understand this.  This does not require money but belief and commitment. </p><p> I ask the joint committee to propose the establishment of an interdepartmental working group to create policy at national level which would be delivered locally.  As such, members would know what was happening in their respective areas.  They would know what services were available and what could be delivered.  This would be very powerful as it would mean everybody could effect change. </p><p> The final change would be to amend the Mental Health Act to introduce the role of an approved clinician.  I thank members for their attention. </p></speech>

I invite representatives of the Irish College of General Practitioners to make its presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-14a.1104" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brian Osborne" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2017121400002#C00300"><p>With the permission of the Chair, Dr. O'Brien and I will share responsibility for delivering the presentation.  The Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, thanks the Chair and members of the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care for the invitation to reflect on the development of general practitioner led primary care as it relates to mental health.  The ICGP is a professional body for general practice, with more than 4,000 members and associates and 690 general practitioner trainees.</p> <p>  General practitioners are at the heart of the health system.  Every day, thousands of people all over the country see their family doctor without any waiting time and receive quality attention and care.  Between one quarter and one third of such consultations include a mental health component.</p><p>Over 90% of mental health care takes place in a general practice setting.  To ensure we can continue to provide that cradle-to-grave service for a growing population with more challenging conditions, and address our retention and manpower crisis, we urgently need to commit to greater resources and a new contract to further develop GP-led primary care.</p><p> A large proportion of these daily interactions are driven by the mental health needs of people attending.  Maintaining quick and easy access for people to generalist health care professionals in the community must be an overarching objective in the future expansion of primary care, enabling people who are well known to each other in a personal sense to engage collaboratively to address the needs of people attending, in their own communities, and to assist in building their resilience.  As general practice services are not associated with any particular health condition, stigma is reduced when seeking mental health care from a general practice team, making this level of care far more acceptable and accessible for people and their families.</p><p> The work of general practice is prevention and earlier intervention.  Our values relate to lifelong personal medical care, wherein people choose and are enabled to attend a doctor or nurse who they know well, and who knows them and their circumstances well, and where mutual confidence is to the fore down the years and across the generations.</p><p> In this submission, we demonstrate what the expansion of GP-led primary care means with respect to mental health, what the challenges are, and what our legislators need to do to ensure general practitioners can continue to be at the heart of a reformed health service.  It is the view of the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, that unless adequate capacity is built in GP-led primary care, the remainder of primary care, the secondary care sector, and the broader health system will never function safely, efficiently or effectively.  Collectively, we need to undertake a realignment from a hospital-focused system to a more balanced system, where much more care is delivered in communities.</p><p> In addition to grave difficulties in secondary care as a result of chronic underfunding of GP-led primary care, there are separate intractable difficulties regarding the way secondary care is delivered in the Irish health system, and it is not the task of primary care to fix these.  These difficulties in secondary care relate to an over-reliance on non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, working exclusively with public patients, and a continued failure of secondary care to embrace electronic medical records and administration.  Poor communication and a lack of integration between general practice teams, primary care health professionals and secondary care lead to reduced efficiency and effectiveness of the whole health system.</p><p> Protracted and grave difficulties are evident in critical bottlenecks in emergency departments, waiting times for most public hospital services, sub-optimal health care outcomes, perceived and actual gross inequalities access, and in well-identified system risks arising from poor continuity of care, which will all continue as the inevitable consequences of a hospital-centric health system, where decades of systematic under-resourcing of GP-led primary care are also clearly evident.</p><p> Specialist services in a hospital-centric model will continue to be unable to safely or effectively address present volumes of clinical workload.  Much of this workload is best addressed in the community setting, delivered by teams of GPs and practice nurses working in a generalist service, based in practices adequately supported by administrative staff and allied health professionals, with access to focused educational supports, so that more of the mental health care needs of most people can be addressed in the community, closest to where people live and at the most</p><p>appropriate levels of cost and complexity.  Timely and equitable access to essential and valued specialist care, where necessary, is an integral part of developing an effective overall system.</p><p> There is strong international consensus around developing a health system based on strong GP-led primary care.  Development of universal access to strong primary care delivers substantial benefits to all citizens, and must now be considered relatively inexpensive, in terms of whole-system health care costs.  With respect to mental health, increasing the numbers of GPs and practice nurses, and training and retaining them, is important so that there is adequate capacity to meet the rapidly evolving demand from a growing population.  The importance of easy access for people to GPs as point of first contact and early intervention is broadly agreed internationally.</p><p> In recent years the ICGP recognised that over-medicalisation has become more apparent in the health system, characterised by a continued and almost exclusive focus on technical, hospital-based medical care.  We also question the extent to which the Irish health system supports talking therapy.  We accept that we spend over &euro;1 billion on drugs, a large proportion of which relates to psychotropic drugs, when we spend less than &euro;10 million per annum on services such as counselling in primary care.  We rely on a GP-led primary care sector which is seriously understaffed.</p><p> Initial steps towards achieving a health system based on GP-led primary care must be the immediate reversal of resource cuts introduced under the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation, and the replacement of the present general medical services, GMS, contract with one which addresses the needs of people who attend GPs and their practice teams for ongoing medical care.</p><p> These two issues, FEMPI and the GMS contract, are constantly to the fore in communications between our college and the GPs who are college members, GP trainees and practice nurse colleagues.  GP-led primary care is at present delivered by approximately 3,700 GPs and 1,700 practice nurses.  In health systems which are considered more effective than ours, such as those of Scotland, Canada, the Netherlands, Australia and Denmark, there are more GPs and practice nurses who work uniquely with a truly generalist and holistic approach.</p><p> In Ireland, at present we have approximately 64 GPs per 100,000 population.  They are unevenly distributed, with fewer than 40 per 100,000 in three counties.  In Scotland and Canada, the number is between 90 and 100 GPs, with an effective ratio of 0.8:1 between GPs and practice nurses.  The view of the ICGP is that we need to plan for a population of 5 million, with corresponding increases in GP and practice nurse numbers.  The acute and outstanding needs of rural practice, and practice in deprived areas, must be supported appropriately and urgently, with serious thought given to geographical and deprivation weightings in funding.  GP-led primary care is a key support throughout the lives of Irish citizens, supporting them from before birth to end-of-life care and grieving.  Every day, people who are troubled by mental health problems attend GP-led teams, with large volumes of care provided by GPs, through mild and moderately severe spectrum mental health conditions, including unipolar and bipolar affective disorders, suicidality, obsessive-compulsive disorders, acute anxiety, phobias, post-traumatic stress disorder, personality disorders, the full spectrum of addiction disorders, methadone maintenance and the psychoses and for ongoing support over years in body image disorders, dementia and post-partum depression.  In caring for people suffering from these conditions, general  practice has done so without the levels of inequality regrettably associated with most secondary care services.  However, during the decade from 2007 to 2017, GP-led primary care has been allowed to weaken to an alarming extent.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-14a.1106" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brendan O'Shea" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2017121400002#D00200"><p>We are making a case for stronger primary care.  Why is generalist care important?  Generalist care is important because people are complex and they rarely present with single issues in real life.  Generalists deal with the totality of problems people experience and present with, addressing them with regard to their physical, psychological, social and existential context.<br/><br/>If people are funnelled into specialised services for common problems they will quickly become frustrated with dead ends at every step, and such a system grinds to a halt around these dead ends.  It is the view of the ICGP that this phenomenon is substantially at the heart of the phenomenon of over 650,000 people on public waiting lists at present.<br/><br/>Failure to grasp this reality results in serious problems in responding comprehensively to the range of problems people with their health.  We strongly recommend that legislators recognise the difference between generalist and specialised care, and take effective steps to increase capacity in generalist primary care in communities, as opposed to our historic focus on specialised secondary care.<br/><br/>I will now outline the connection between generalist care and mental health.  The ICGP is at present committed to collaborating with the HSE, and all other relevant stakeholders, in assisting in the development of better care for people with long-term illnesses.  In the long term, the ICGP supports free primary care at point of access, fully resourced in communities, as critical for success in this objective.  We recognise this as an essential, socially redistributive undertaking in our unequal health system.<br/><br/>The ICGP recognises the importance of mental health as a key prognosticator across the range of all common long-term illnesses, and this, together with more effective end-of-life planning, are areas which we have identified as key points in reorientating our historic focus on specialist-orientated hospital care.  The people we care for with diabetes and heart failure have better outcomes if underlying depression and anxiety are detected and treated earlier and more systematically.  This takes more time on the part of GPs and practice nurses to deliver.  However, GP teams are currently critically short of time.<br/><br/>I will now quote a patient representative at an ICGP faculty consultation on regional diabetic care.</p><blockquote>In all the care I&rsquo;ve ever gotten for my diabetes, nobody ever asks me how I am!  How am I feeling?  It&rsquo;s all about my HbA1C, the weight, the blood pressure, and the tablets.</blockquote> <p>The question of how someone is feeling is very important.  We want time to address that with people.</p><p>Having sufficient numbers of GPs and practice nurses to switch on fully the practice of brief interventions in respect of mood, alcohol, better eating habits and stress handling is essential.  General practitioners are highly and consistently accessible to families, parents, carers, children and adolescents.  Turnover within general practice teams is exceedingly low, good continuity is evident in the provision of service over years and decades, and there is a high level of contextual knowledge in general practice teams which is simply absent in most instances in mental health teams and elsewhere within the health system.<br/><br/><b></b>What more can GP-led teams do?  The ICGP is at present committed to delivering actively key national strategies, including Healthy Ireland, Making Every Contact Count, Sl&aacute;intecare and Forwards Together.  We believe we have good policies.  We are collaborating actively with the National Office of Suicide Prevention, NOSP.  In our elaboration of chronic disease management, we will be advising that mental health and end of life planning be reflected across all the main disease centres.  It is not good enough to talk about diabetes and heart failure without looking at the attendant mental health issues that arise in these populations.  In 2018, we will be rolling out another national programme of education for GPs and practice nurses on suicide prevention and deliberate self-harm, in collaboration with NOSP.  However, we urgently need more GPs and practice nurses so that there is time for more, and earlier, talk therapy.<br/><br/>It is a most pressing concern that increasing numbers of rural practices and practices in deprived communities are closing.  Elsewhere, the composition of practice teams is changing.  They are very slowly getting bigger, accommodating the personal needs of younger GPs, who are more likely to work part time, and who will not work 60 or 70 hours per week as the current generation of older colleagues have done.  In the context of these larger practice teams, the ICGP supports the idea of basing sessional allied health professionals, particularly in psychology, counselling and life skills coaching, in practices.  We advise that the most appropriate skills mix be determined at the level of the practice with reference to the specific needs of the community.  The ICGP is supportive of the role of more involvement by allied health professionals, but is impatient at delays in this roll-out and remains acutely concerned at the overall shortage of GPs and practice nurses.<br/><br/><b></b>In respect of GP-led teams and primary care teams, the ICGP is concerned about the experience of GPs with primary care teams, PCTs.  We fundamentally agree with the advice that there needs to be greater networking in the middle and bottom parts of the pyramid.  However, we have a lot of difficulty carrying out that networking.  The people in the primary care teams do not have working email addresses.  They do not have electronic medical records.  They are not adequately connectable.  We understand that there is a lot of activity in communities but it is not evenly distributed.  Some of our colleagues are carrying out research on social prescribing and they are ensuring that their practices are more tightly networked to the services that are in communities.  This all requires time on the part of general practitioners and practice nurses who have heaving waiting rooms.<br/><br/>We must look at primary care teams because so much has been put into them by the HSE during the past decade.  Research conducted by the ICGP indicates that while over 70% of GPs are well disposed towards this type of networking and towards primary care teams, fewer than 13% of GPs surveyed reported positively on their experiences for the reasons I have given.  While all individuals working in GP-led teams engage in full electronic communication, as I have said, most members of HSE primary care teams do not have functioning email addresses and utilise paper-based records.<br/><br/>GP-led teams have, as far as funding constraints have allowed, developed services relevant to people who attend them, but this occurs on an unsystematic and uneven basis, especially due to manpower shortages.  The reality regarding mental health care is that most psychiatric illness is cared for in the general practice setting.  Further investment here will enable better and earlier prevention in the middle and bottom parts of the pyramid, with less expensive intervention.  However, it needs to be recognised that in Ireland, GP-led primary care is relatively and dangerously under-resourced.  We are not short of policy.  We have implementation deficit disorder.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-14a.1108" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. John O'Brien" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2017121400002#E00200"><p>Increasing the numbers of GPs and practice nurses and providing additional sessional inputs from relevant health care professionals will enable better prevention, earlier detection, more immediate care in communities and a shift in mental health care from psychiatric outpatient departments, OPDs, if adequately resourced.  Focused transitional funding is essential for this to happen, to increase training and improve retention for GPs and practice nurses.  Legislators, administrators and patients can all be confident that given the highly computerised nature of general practice-led primary care, any additional resourcing can be supported by agreed full system de-identified data analysis.  Stakeholders can thus be assured that funding is tied to agreed activities.  This process is already well established in general practice in terms of the PCRS and Heartwatch data returns, and in the primary care research network activities.</p> <p>  It is the view of the ICGP that the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation has destabilised general practice, especially in rural and deprived communities.  Within the NHS and many Commonwealth health systems as well as the Scandinavian and Dutch systems, the proportion of health spending in primary care is in the order of 8% to 11% of the total health spend, whereas in Ireland the proportion is in the order of 3.7% to 4%, less than half of the spend in the systems I have just mentioned.  This striking historic under-resourcing of GP-led primary care in Ireland is an important rate limiting factor in improving mental health care for individuals and families at this point.</p> <p>  The ICGP is confident that given adequate resourcing for GP-led primary care, substantial improvements can be achieved in the experiences and outcomes for many people with mental health needs who use our health service.  The college is closely aligned with best international evidence and with our own national policy framework.  First must come the stabilisation of GP-led primary care through relevant and essential investment in building capacity, following which we can confidently implement key policies and continue to make real and positive differences to people who rely on the Irish health system to deliver their essential health care, particularly mental health care.</p> <p>  We have identified a number of action points for the committee to consider.  The first is addressing the instability in general practice arising from cuts in funding under the FEMPI legislation.  This is sometimes construed as GPs looking for money for their own sectoral interest.  This is money for the people who come in to see us.  It is so that we can provide the service we need to provide to these people.  It is not for us.  Second is replacing the present GP contract with an evolving contract to support the primary care needs of all citizens.  Third, we call for the use of deprivation and geographical weightings to address the greater health care needs of deprived and rural areas.  Fourth is extending the use of electronic medical records and administration beyond general practice to the whole health system.  That is a very important component of the integration that is badly needed to avoid waste within the system.  Fifth is the provision of adequate sessional allied health professionals in GP-led primary care, especially counsellors and psychotherapists.  Sixth is to review and appraise the functioning of primary care teams, increasing input from mental health practitioners.  Seventh is ensuring that mental health is effectively reflected across all evolving chronic disease programmes.  Mental health does not exist in isolation but is co-morbid with a whole load of other conditions.  Eighth is to increase the numbers of GPs and practice nurses towards 5,000 whole time equivalents of each.  This is important to provide the time people need to articulate and have heard the problems with which they are presenting in primary care.  Ninth is to stabilise staff turnover in all psychiatry services, reducing dependence on non-consultant hospital doctors for service delivery.</p><p>What we are trying to address here is the frustration that patients feel at seeing different staff on subsequent iterations of their care within secondary care.  It is a common and big problem.  Tenth, we should critically appraise care pathways in all psychiatry services, which at times appear profoundly disjointed, often because of resource problems or staffing problems, but which have the net effect of deflecting those who need a service from getting it.</p></speech>

I will take it chronologically.  I will field the questions first and give the witnesses a right to reply then.</p> <p>  Professor O'Connor mentioned nine community health organisations, CHOs.  She stated that five CHOs do not have waiting lists over a period.  What was that specific period and where were the five CHOs?  Professor O'Connor spoke about the choice and partnership approach, CAPA.  Will she elaborate on that for me?  I was trying to listen and take notes.  I would like greater elaboration on how that model is more advantageous than what is currently in place.  Professor O'Connor spoke of the need for interdepartmental working groups.  Does she see that overlapping with any working groups that may be present already at a higher level within the system, because the last thing we want is overlap?  We are seeing some overlap in places.</p> <p>  I thank Dr. Osborne for his presentation.  He mentioned there is a reduction in stigma when patients are assessed by a GP team or by a GP.  Will he elaborate on the factors behind that?  Are there studies behind that assertion and specific evidence on that?</p> <p>  Dr. O'Shea stated that 13% of GPs do not have working email addresses.</p></speech>

They do not use electronic medical records.  They are contactable, for brief windows of time, by phone.  Otherwise, it is paper communication.  It is incredible that, throughout most of the secondary care system in all of the expensive acute hospitals, they are still working with paper-based electronic medical records.</p></speech>

Last week or the week before, we asked the service provider, the HSE, about the IT system and electronic communication.  We were told a certain portion of the new funding of &euro;35 million would be for what was referred to as service improvement - I use the term "to plug holes" -  and we still have no figures around that.  Now I hear even something as simple as email addresses, a technology that is roughly 20 years old, is not set up for members of staff.  What is coming back at us repeatedly is IT systems and IT.  We have a huge hangover from PPARS here.  There seems to be a fear of tackling the IT issue within the health service, perhaps because of what happened in PPARS long before my time here.  We need to get the figures from the HSE on the areas of IT that it is concentrating on with the new funding that it cannot spend in that period.  We are told that the HSE uses a priority rota every year but we cannot see what that priority is.  Now we hear that we have no email addresses for staff in areas of primary care.</p> <p>  My final question relates to FEMPI.  Dr. O'Brien mentioned that FEMPI has destabilised general practice, particularly rural practices.  Is FEMPI the only reason the sector is experiencing shortages?  If the FEMPI measures were reversed in the morning, would there be a significant increase in the number of people trying to take up the profession?  If not, what are the other factors that may be affecting this as well?</p></speech>

I will answer directly on the real problem with waiting lists.  The figures that I have are for July 2017.  At that stage, urgent cases were seen within 72 hours, 73% of referrals were seen within three months and the total number waiting more than 12 months was 366.  There were five CHO areas that did not have any waiting lists in excess of 12 months.</p></speech>

The reason I am hesitating is that those numbers can change.  The real problem with these waiting lists is these could have been the waiting lists in July, whereas the waiting lists in September have changed and the numbers have changed.  Therefore, these are not reliable.  They are all to do with effective leadership in the CHO area, effective teams working together, a full complement of staff and recruitment.  The point I was making was that addressing the waiting list is not the issue.  It is addressing the system.</p> <p>  That brings me to the Deputy's third question, if I could take it, about the interdepartmental working group.  As far as I know, that idea of a cross-departmental agency-NGO working group does not exist.  It would be something new that would help focus and address the issues to which my colleagues have referred in a local area.  Such a working group would operate on a national level with a mandate, and there would be a liaison person within each CHO area who would document all the services, look at the gaps, see what is needed, create a referral pathway for those who need mental health supports, and then, if necessary, patients could be referred on to mental health services.  For example, if we were walking down Kildare Street today and I tripped, I would be sent to St. Vincent's or St. James's where I would see a triage nurse and maybe get an X-ray.  I would not see a consultant orthopaedic surgeon unless I had broken my ankle.  The problem is that the system is geared towards the specialist services rather than towards GPs.  I am suggesting that each CHO area would have that liaison person.</p></speech>

He asked about CAPA.  CAPA is a training programme for staff from multidisciplinary areas to work together.  It is based on staff understanding their roles, having respect for one another and learning to work together in an appropriate fashion.  It is an extensive programme and it is very effective.  It is evidence-based.  It shows that if staff are trained effectively to work together in multidisciplinary teams - my colleagues here referred to different models of care and in this model of care, everybody has a position - no one person is above another.  They work together and they work on their particular expertise and resources at an appropriate time and place.</p></speech>

There is a large body of international evidence that mental health care is best delivered in primary care.  One of the reasons for this is stigma.  It is stigmatising if patients, especially younger people, are seen attending psychiatry services.  In addition, general practice and primary care offer what is known as the primary care advantage.  The general practitioners and practice nurses develop longitudinal relationships over time and build relationships and trust, so patients are happier to come back rather than seeing a different doctor or different health care professional at each visit.</p></speech>

It will not.  FEMPI has taken out more than 38% of funding under the medical card system, which has had a profoundly destabilising effect.  It must be reversed so practices can begin to recruit more doctors and practice nurses.  There is also a need for a contract.  The current contract is 39 years old.  It is frightening to read it.  As our finances have become more squeezed over the past decade, all practices have had to examine everything they are doing in an increasingly tight way and have had to make difficult decisions about what they cannot care for.  I do not have time to spend 30 minutes with an adolescent or 45 minutes with somebody who has just had a diagnosis of colonic cancer to explain it.  That is causing our younger colleagues, in particular, to feel very bitter and twisted about it.  I do not wish to work in a system that is operating so tightly.  We are not looking for more money for general practitioners, GPs, and practice nurses.  We are looking for more money for more GPs and more practice nurses.  There is a difference.<br/><br/>We have some reservations regarding the flat team approach.  The primary teams have been set up as a recent example of the flat team approach.  They have rotating chairs.  It does not work.  There is a place for clinical leadership.  General practitioners are specialists.  We are senior clinicians and the only senior clinicians <i>en masse</i>who are on duty after 6 p.m. any evening.  We are community stakeholders.  We live in towns and neighbourhoods where we are visible and accountable.  We have that continuity aspect.  It is not just FEMPI cuts but a better contract.</p></speech>

GPs do a great job and it is not easy.  I compliment them on that.</p> <p>  I read the report and it referred to the Irish College of General Practitioners having a ten-year plan that contains 14 recommendations.  The ninth recommendation refers to building access to primary care mental health services.  Representatives of the Department appeared before the committee a few weeks ago and they told us that funding is not an issue.  How is the Department and Minister working with the plan in the 14 areas that must be addressed?  This is crucial from the general practitioners' point of view.</p> <p>  Second, since becoming a member of this committee I have tried to meet various groups.  Do the witnesses believe that people who suffer with depression and who do not have a medical card will not visit GPs because they cannot afford it?  That was the main issue I encountered when I met the various groups.  Can something be put in place and what would the witnesses recommend?  Money is the biggest issue there.</p> <p>  I also met some youth groups during the week particularly with regard to child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and I was shocked to hear about a particular school that had applied for DEIS status.  This week there was an announcement and more than 257 schools did not qualify for DEIS.  If one is attending a non-DEIS status school, one does not qualify for some of the counselling services because one is not attending a DEIS school.  That is unacceptable.  The schools I dealt with are non-DEIS schools and they have been fighting for counsellors for the last few years.  I could not believe it.</p> <p>  I understand that the south east is the only area conducting a self-harm intervention programme, SHIP.  It is for young people who self-harm.  I met several groups on this issue.  The biggest issue is that one can only access that programme if one is over 16 years of age.  Many of the people who tried to attend the programme were under 16 years of age and they were told they could not go into the programme.  I cannot believe it.  Can a system be put in place for younger people under 16 years of age?  Many of the young people who went to this group were much younger than 16 years of age and they were just turned away.  I was shocked when I met them.</p> <p>  I met many groups because I knew I was due to contribute this week and I wanted to get information on my area of Carlow and Kilkenny.  I was shocked to discover from the list that Kilkenny has the lowest number of doctors at 37.</p></speech>

I am aware of people in Carlow trying to access doctors.  It is not the doctors' fault and I do not blame them.  It is just that there are not enough doctors.  A group from Carlow met a group from Holland recently.  The main issue was that 18 years of age is the cut-off for services when one is young.  Then one is an adult.  However, in most countries they are provided up to 25 years of age.  That is a massive issue for young people.  One cannot access services from 18 to 25 years of age.  We now have what is called transit, where one is caught if one is over 18 years of age.  One must go to adult services, whereas one can get into the system if one is under 18 years of age.  Who is deciding the age groups?  Can this not be revamped?  This is crucial.  I was trying to look up information today and I saw that yesterday 73 requests for crisis information were received by Youth Suicide Prevention Ireland.  That is unreal.  People are crying out for help.  There must be a better system in place.</p> <p>  I agree with the witnesses that it is all local.  It is about one's own area, knowing one's patients and trying to access these services.  It means everybody working together.  Perhaps the witnesses could respond to the issues I raised.  I was speaking to Senator Kelleher this morning about a family friend I was trying to help a few weeks ago.  Her daughter was trying to commit suicide and she was put into hospital for two nights because she was on suicide watch.  She came home but what services are there for her and her family?  These are the areas that I believe are crying out for help.  I hope the witnesses can give me some answers on the different areas I raised because I will be referring back to the different groups I have consulted.  I am shocked at the number of groups that do not qualify for different services, yet we are told there is funding available.</p></speech>

Can Dr. O'Brien respond to that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-14a.1134" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. John O'Brien" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2017121400002#G00800"><p>There was a great deal in that contribution.  To start with the funding for mental health services in primary care, we do not see a great deal of evidence of it.  We see a great deal of under-provision and extraordinarily long waiting lists.  Primary care counselling has a waiting list of four to six months and the waiting list for primary care psychology in my area would be 18 months.  It varies around the country depending, much of the time, on social deprivation.</p> <p>  On the affordability of general practice, I take the point that being faced with having to pay for the service is a deterrent.  There is no question about that.  This is a historical matter and not of our choosing.  We would prefer it to be different.  However, patients who have a medical card will consult twice as frequently as people without a medical card.  If one has a system that is groaning in terms of its capacity to deliver by virtue of the numbers of GPs for 60% of the population, which is the amount without a medical card, and if one increases the consultation rate there by two there will be serious capacity problems.  While we are in favour of this type of thing, it must be phased in.  One cannot just magic it out of the air.</p> <p>  The Senator also raised the issue of suicide.  Suicide is a major concern.  Some 500 people commit suicide per annum and it is just awful.  In fact, I was speaking to a GP during the week who works in a very deprived area.  She told me about the case of a 20 year old whom she had attended.  She had been looking for services for this person since the person was in third class.</p><p>The person never met the criteria for CAMHS or Tusla and when the family was ready to engage with family therapy, there was a waiting list for that so it never happened.  All these deficiencies are within the system.  We are failing people, most particularly vulnerable and poor people.  The FEMPI legislation measures took their greatest toll among the section of the community that is paid for by the State, that is, the urban deprived and rural communities.  It is not an accident that it is where the choke points are now.  I was asked if GPs will come walking into practice if we fix FEMPI.  The answer is they will not.  It is much harder to fix something than to prevent it from breaking.  The fixing will take some time.  We would want to get on with it fairly sharpish because we are looking at a situation that is destabilising.  </p></speech>

It is very frustrating because people do not know.  That is why having a liaison person in each area who actually does that is really important.  I agree with my colleagues here but there are other people in the community who can be used and who people do not know about.  We have to address that.</p> <p>  The other thing, which the committee can follow up, is that the national youth mental health task force report was published on Tuesday.  In each of those areas, it has given a timeline and outlined the people who are responsible.  Believe it or not, some of the timelines start next quarter.  I think everybody would agree we have tonnes of reports but the problem is following up and seeing what has been done.  This report has a timeline and people who are responsible.  It is absolutely crazy that education is not in that mix and that there are not counsellors in this area.  The report addressed that.  We need to see that it is implemented.  A Vision for Change was set up in 2006 and we are still talking about it.  This complements it.  We should look at this report and ensure it is contained in it. </p> <p>  A national phone line has been set up for people with severe mental health issues.  Has anybody tried to use it?  The number is 8255.  It creates a referral pathway.  If the person mentioned was at home he or she would ring 8255 and would be given the name of somebody in the local area.  There is no question that there are funding issues.  Our colleagues can go through that in detail.  The emphasis should be put on the local.  Members should look at their local areas and see what is there and ask if it is being communicated.  There are a lot of NGOs getting money from the State and they are focused on different things.  The Minister can tell them what they are getting their money for and what they have to do but they are under-utilised.  They could work with GPs.  It is not just GPs; there are other community resources that would also help.  </p> <p>  We all know the problems but we also know what the solutions are so we have to ask why it is not happening.  Everybody wants it to happen.  </p></speech>

I thank them for coming in this morning.  Since we are dealing with the primary care module this morning, I will concentrate on that.  To give the witnesses an opportunity to answer my questions I will limit them to a minute if I can.  Professor O'Connor referred to an approved clinician at the beginning.  Will she expand on that role?  Will she address the issue of general practice, early intervention and the GP as a gatekeeper?  The appropriate initial referral, or no referral as the case may be in many cases, is the first act which will direct people to the proper person and will substantially reduce waiting lists if people are referred appropriately.  I am in the happy position of being on first-name terms with all the mental health personnel in my area and I can pick the phone up and make a priority referral at the drop of a hat.  Depending on electronic referrals is fine but a personal phone call is the best referral system I can think of.  Will the witnesses address the issue of social determinants of health and mental health and how it ties in with the inverse care law where the people who need care most get it least?  Will the witnesses talk about talk therapy because there is serious over-medication in mental health care, which is probably a reflection of the lack of talk therapy services that are available?  The most recent report on health care reform is the Sl&aacute;intecare report, which covered the entire health service.  Sl&aacute;intecare has the nuts and bolts of how we should attract people into our service and how we should populate our primary care teams, particularly our community psychiatric teams.  Will the witnesses address those issues?  We know the answers and the solutions but the problem is the implementation.  How do the witnesses believe we can implement change?</p></speech>

We need to put a system into primary care.  We need to get all the resources working together and put in one or two liaison officers in that area who will work with GPs and utilise all the areas of health care.  I agree that GPs are the gateway.  People go to GPs for help so that is a very practical way of doing it.  We should insist that all the actions in this report that are starting on 1 January 2018 are implemented.  We should follow this through.  They are specifying they will do certain things and they have to be done.</p> <p>  The HSE has no information system.  We do not know who gets care, what happens and what the outcomes are.  It is a priority for it to set up an information system.  In the commercial world, they say data are money.  Data are knowledge.  We do not know what is happening.  That is absolutely critical.  The approved clinician is somebody who goes through a process of training and development.  Using their expertise they are made the responsible clinician in certain situations.  The approved clinician would work in this area.  For people who are in CAMHS, the consultant psychiatrist would probably be that person because they are dealing with severe mental health disorders.  It gives other people in the team the capacity to make decisions and to move things on.  At the moment, the consultant psychiatrist has to sign off as the responsible clinician for all cases.  Having an approved clinician is working very effectively in the UK where they have the process and training.  In tandem with the choice and partnership approach, CAPA, a multidisciplinary approach would make an enormous difference because the appropriate people would be seeing people at a different level of intervention and they would be able to sign off rather than always waiting for a psychiatrist.  The issue is it clogs up the system.  Psychiatrists, who are very well qualified, could then spend their time dealing with really serious cases, which is why they are in psychiatry.  Other people, such psychologists, nurse practitioners and counsellors could become approved clinicians.  Is that clear?</p></speech>

In key respects, the ICGP is very supportive of the approach taken by Sl&aacute;intecare.</p><p>We would welcome a shift of care and treatment into communities and community-based services.</p><p> On the issues raised by Senator Murnane O'Connor relating to the system of referrals and gating people into age categories, that is, in its totality, care rationing.  We feel the greatest and most obvious way to address that is to increase capacity in general medical care so that more can be done at a lower level of cost and complexity so that the right care is provided by the right person at the right time.  If enough practice nurses and general practitioners, GPs, are evident, that is the space in which much of that care can be delivered.</p><p> We have to be strategic because we cannot do everything and cannot act on all the suggestions.  It is the view of the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, that a really important suggestion to act on is this issue of capacity in GP-led primary care.  It will solve a greater proportion of most of the problems.  If one has the manpower on the ground, one will be able to co-ordinate and signpost issues.</p><p> There was a question on gatekeeping.  Gatekeeping is critically important for the health system but it is not a politically attractive word.  Signposting and care co-ordination are also issues.  Care co-ordination is a key skill set of general practitioners and practice nurses.  If one has more general practitioners and practice nurses, it is more likely that one will have the co-ordination one is looking for.</p></speech>

It is important to acknowledge that a huge proportion of mental illness can be managed purely with talk therapy.  It is much more effective if it is delivered at an earlier stage.  As Dr. O'Brien referred to, there are long waiting lists for counselling, primary care and psychology.  There are restrictive practices in talk therapy, especially with regard to child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  As general practitioners, we can refer patients appropriately, when needed, to psychology and primary care.  They are referred back to us and we are advised to refer to CAMHS, which then tells us to refer to primary care.  The patient and his or her family is caught in the middle.  It is frustrating for patients, families and GPs.</p></speech>

We are spending a lot on health care.  It is a question of how we are spending it and where we are putting the funding.  We have unashamedly made a case for more general practice and nurse practitioner-delivered care.  I hope we have made a convincing case.  We believe that a strategic investment in a subsystem that is already electronically enabled will give the best outcome after the spend.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-14a.1149" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. John O'Brien" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2017121400002#J00700"><p>The inverse care law works on the principle that poor people have greater problems with their health.  The GP that I was talking to during the week told me that, last year, there were 20 people in the practice who had died.  Of that group, four were over the age of 60.  That gives an idea of what happens when people are poor.  They get more ill, more illnesses and they get them earlier in their lives.  They usually have a multiplicity of illnesses.  This feeds into the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, matter because those patients are covered by the general medical services, GMS, contract.  The funding going into GMS following the financial emergency measures has resulted in them being unable to get the same amount of time and attention from their GPs because the funds are not there to employ the extra staff necessary to deliver that.  If we take that a little further, the service in west Dublin for psychiatry only has two psychiatrists.  It has lost one psychiatrist.  It operates with locum staff.  Several key staff members are missing for a variety of reasons, including maternity leave and not being replaced.  The waiting lists have expanded there and now run out to five months for routine matters.  It is not routine because 90% of routine matters are dealt with in general practice.  If people get beyond a general practitioner, it is far from routine.  If we bring it into the mental health domain, the poorest section of the community with the greatest degree of problems gets its resources delivered at the same rate as the rest of the community when it needs more than the rest.  If there are twice the mental health problems in a deprived community, then twice the amount of mental health services are needed in that community.  That is not what happens and as a result people get much less the poorer they are and the more they need.</p></speech>

I am a politician.  I have 30,000 emails and the phone is on 24 hours a day.  I do not have the same engagement but every practice and every professional has to upskill.  I am shocked at such a simple issue.  Anybody can phone me, 24 hours a day.  I do not mind.  I feel that if GPs are not prepared to upskill with modern technology, it is a huge reflection on general practice.  The witnesses can answer me in a minute, but we are talking about the deprived.  To me, the new deprived people are middle Ireland.  I was at a doctor last week and the waiting room was full.  It cost me &euro;45, which  I do not mind although I wish I had a medical card.  It cost me &euro;45 but it is the same for mothers, although thankfully there is no cost for children under six.  I feel that middle Ireland is the new deprived.</p> <p>  To me, primary care has been an issue.  I take consolation in the fact that the witnesses mentioned Commonwealth countries.  I believe we should embrace more Commonwealth countries.  I find that twice as much is spent in Commonwealth countries.  In the last ten years, we have embraced primary care centres.  I see in my own town of Boyle that one is opening in January, as well as in Ballymote and Claremorris.  It is the way forward and care has to be GP-led.  There are not many areas around the country now in which we do not have a primary care GP-led centre.  Do the witnesses have a view that we should do more?</p> <p>  We are talking about mental health, which has become a political issue.  If we were in Opposition, we would probably use it as well.  We need more GPs to come out and say what is right with the system.  Sometimes, we are happy when we are miserable.  My involvement with the health care sector has been absolutely wonderful, including at my local GP.  We sometimes need to stand back and have people such as the witnesses, as honest, independent, professional health care providers, to articulate what is good.  Unfortunately, that does not sell newspapers.  If something is wrong, we absolutely have to deal with it but the witnesses are in a position to speak.  People sometimes do not believe politicians but doctors have the trust of the general public.  What is happening here today is wonderful.</p><p>Sometimes, we need to articulate what is positive.</p></speech>

I shall breathe deeply.  It is really important to be clear that the only part of the Irish health system that is uniformly electronically enabled is general practice.  In all of the acute hospitals, they are scribbling on paper records, bar the maternity hospital in Cork.  Notwithstanding the billions which have been spent in the acute hospitals system, they are not computerised.  The other parts of the primary care team which are not GP led are not electronically enabled.  We engage with our colleagues in the Office of the Chief Information Officer and understand that they will all have email in the early part of the new year, but it will then be 2018.  It is really important to be clear about that.  The only part of the health system from which the members as legislators can get reliable big data is from my colleagues and I and our practice nurses.  That is the first point.</p> <p>  The second point, which I am delighted to make, is that Senator Feighan is right that we need to be positive about the things that are working.  The members are getting good health care because we are the affluent.  Julian Tudor Hart is a Welsh general practitioner who stated that the people most in need of a service were least likely to get it.  In a corollary to his law, he said this impact is most likely to occur in societies where there are untrammelled commercial interests at work.  That is Ireland.  That is the image of private, for-profit health care and private clinics.  The people we feel most agitated and anxious about are the deprived people attending our surgeries.  With respect to the wish to have a medical card, the position of the Irish College of General Practitioners is that we regard easy access to primary care and general practice as a really important social benefit.  We are in favour of extending free-at-point-of-delivery primary care in principle, but it must happen on a phased basis and in a way that does not break our services.  Our services are at breaking point.</p> <p>  What are the good things we have done?  In the Irish College of General Practitioners, we are collaborating as closely as we can with everybody, including the HSE, the Department of Health and the Minister and it is difficult.  Senator Murnane O'Connor asked about the contract and our engagement with the Minister.  There have been a lot of promises and there is an absolute wagon-load of policy but getting the deals done is incredibly slow and people are dying because of it.  To go back to the positives, we understand within the college that large numbers of our very young and bright medical undergraduates are interested in going into general practice.  We have had an increase of 58% in the number of young doctors applying for our national GP training scheme and have increased the number of places to over 200 this year.  In Ulster, however, they have 110 places for a population of 1.1 million, which they think is not enough.  I hope I have touched on some of the questions.</p></speech>

Where the activity takes place is a secondary concern.  Building all these new primary care centres does not mean one extra patient will be seen.  With the financial constraints the country appears to have, it is be more important to invest in human resources than buildings.  General practitioners may own their surgeries or be in long-term leases.  There are financial constraints that will limit them from jumping from one building to another.  In some areas such as Country Roscommon, the HSE is trying to charge Dublin rents.  There are huge issues around centres, but the teams are more important.  Everyone does not have to be in the same building but they need to be in contact, ideally by electronic communication.</p></speech>

I sat on the Committee on the Future of Healthcare and it is an honour to sit on this one.  The witnesses are a breath of fresh air.  One of our biggest issues has been honesty, accountability, responsibility and leadership.  Professor O'Connor mentioned it all in her opening speech.  What struck me was something that is a huge issue in any part of the health system.  She said the need was not for money because we have the services.  She said changes can be made through statutory instrument, that we do not need money and that the issue is how the system is actually run.  GPs are the first point of contact and we have all used their services.  The biggest point to get across while people are actually listening is that we need the Minister for Health and the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people to listen to people like the witnesses who are straight, honest and at the forefront of what is happening.  Prevention is better than cure and it can be done at a very low cost.  I listened intently to the witnesses and their documents, which I have read, and submissions have probably been the best we have received in the past 12 months.  This comes from all parties and none.  I can feel the witnesses' hunger, belief in what they do and drive.  These thing are achievable but someone has to grow up here.  I liked the witnesses' honesty in that regard.  I appeal to everyone here; let us grow up, go back to whoever we are dealing with and say this has to happen.</p> <p>  I have been a mental health advocate for 14 or 15 years but today is the first day I heard of the 8255 number.  I am disgusted and angry that it is not in the public domain.  I am blown away on that one.</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, mentioned that number a couple of weeks ago when he was here.  I had not heard it myself.  It is a great facility.</p> <p>  It has been said by everyone that mental health services are best delivered in a primary care setting.  I accept that.  I have the height of respect for GPs.  Some of my best friends are GPs.  In their submissions, the witnesses mentioned funding several times, for example, "Further investment here will enable better and early prevention" and "Adequate resourcing for GP-led primary care is necessary.  Improvements can be achieved and experiences and outcomes for many people with mental health can be improved".  It is all about resources.  I feel very strongly that there should be a clinical psychologist in every primary care centre.  Some of the witnesses said they did not have the manpower on the ground or the time to listen to people for more than a few minutes.  I feel very strongly that I would not go to a GP in these circumstances.  I would not go to a psychologist with a throat infection.  I would prefer not to be seen in a primary care centre by a GP but rather by a clinical psychologist.  There should be a clinical psychologist available in every primary care centre just as there is a GP.  That is a way forward.  One would walk into a primary care centre and make an appointment through the receptionist with one's psychologist rather than with one's GP.  That would free up the GP to look after people with throat infections and allow psychologists to do what they are trained to do.  Some of them will have studied for nine and ten years to get a doctorate in clinical psychology.  That is a very important thing and it would alleviate waiting lists and a lot of the pressure GPs face.</p> <p>  I agree with Professor O'Connor about the liaison person.  There are many services on the ground and many NGOs, and nobody knows what is going on.  Some services are running in parallel and some areas have no service.</p><p>It would be of a significant benefit if there was a liaison person in every county.</p><p> We talk about money all the time.  I cannot believe the email situation.  I know somebody in a primary care centre who spent several hours one afternoon trying to put their name and address on the bottom of their email in Irish because they were instructed to do so by the HSE.  To me, that is a huge and utter waste of finances.  Over &euro;1 billion is going into mental health every year but nobody knows how it is spent.  The reason nobody can get this breakdown is because the figures are not electronically linked which is outrageous.  Will the witnesses give their opinions on the provision of psychologists in primary care?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-14a.1162" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1430" speakername="Colette Kelleher" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2017121400002#L00200"><p>I thank Professor Joyce O'Connor, Dr. Brendan O'Shea, Dr. John O'Brien and Dr. Brian Osborne, who have various titles and accomplishments.  It seems to me that the pyramid that Professor Joyce O'Connor presented needs to be turned on its head, which we can do in our report.  We often start either here or there when what we need to do is turn it on its head.  That is where most people are and where the prevention and early intervention can take place.  Even graphically that is an important message for the committee.</p> <p>  Professor Joyce O'Connor made clear recommendations on what the committee can do.  My colleague, Deputy Harty, spoke about approved clinicians.  Will Professor Joyce O'Connor give more details about this proposal?  The committee can explore it in greater detail because it seems to be a practical proposal.  It would also be good to hear more about CAPA, the choice and partnership approach, because it seems to be practical.</p> <p>  Will the GP witnesses give more detail about the weighting for deprivation and rural communities?  Are there models we can examine on how that weighting might be done?  The poorer one is, the more stressed one is and the more likely one is to suffer poor health and poor mental ill-health.  Have the witnesses any suggestions for further exploration of this area?</p> <p>  Senator McFadden spoke about clinical psychologist provision.  I am struck by how we spend &euro;1 billion on drugs but &euro;10 million on counselling and primary care.  That would seem to be a proportion which we need to invert.  Will the witnesses point us in the direction of those who might help us to understand such an inversion?  It would be better to see &euro;10 million spent on drugs and &euro;1 billion spent on prevention.  That money is in the system but it might be spent inappropriately.</p></speech>

At its core, it will have IT.  Another submission from the hospital would be important.  That will be the benchmark for the future and will not involve retrofitting.</p> <p>  I cannot believe there is not a WhatsApp group, for example, or other simple method to keep people in contact with each other.</p> <p>  The queues for outpatient departments in mental health services are heart-breaking.  We need to shift that fundamentally back to where people belong to and their local areas.  Most people, particularly younger people, when faced with an enormous queue will walk out and not avail of the services.  The &euro;1 billion spent on medication and medicating policies are issues which we need to talk about at this committee.  I find them dubious at times but certainly up-ended.</p> <p>  The common problems being drawn into specialised services which are adding to the waiting lists were brought up.  We are dealing with well-being and the majority of people.  It is not mental ill-health such as psychosis or an enduring mental health issue.  We need to turn primary care centres and GP practices into well-being hubs which will involve early intervention.  We are trying to do away with stigma but well-being is a much more acceptable word for everybody from the four-year old child to the elderly person.  We need to take this on board because the majority services are required for people in crisis.  We all go through crisis but do not have to be labelled mentally ill as a result.  We just need to strengthen our resolve and get supports to allow ourselves come to solutions to get back on track.</p></speech>

They are trained and equipped to intervene at an early stage and can refer an individual.  That is the point I was getting at when referring to the availability of clinical psychiatrists and counsellors, as well as other types of therapists and interventions, in local areas.  Whether these would be in a GP clinic is another matter, but it is important they are in a local area where they can be accessed.  An approved clinician, which is what a clinical psychologist would be, will be able to sign off or refer an individual.  We need to look at what is available in the community, use the expertise of a range of professionals in the mental health area and not underutilise them.</p> <p>  CAPA means people have to work well in teams.  The primary care team could well do with an intervention from CAPA where they are trained to work with one another effectively, recognise their expertise and what they can contribute.  Dr. Ann York is involved in CAPA and it is available in three centres in Ireland.  We can certainly send on information about that to the committee after the session.  It gets people to work well together.</p> <p>  The lack of communication is the one issue about which every member spoke.  There is a real issue about electronic communication but there is also an issue about recognition of others' expertise and being able to communicate effectively.  The area of IT is absolutely critical.  Data is important in every other area of life.  People are making businesses out of it.  The fact we have not got a connected information system is bad.  The good news is that it does not take long to remedy it if there is a willingness to do so because one can leap over old technologies quickly.  However, it needs that investment to ensure the system is in place.</p><p>If someone was meeting in two or three years, he or she would have all of the data to hand.  He or she would know who they were seeing, where they would be seeing them, the outcomes, what the effective therapies were and who in the system was working, including GPs, counsellors and nurses.</p><p> On the comments made by Senators Colette Kelleher and M&aacute;ire Devine, this is about well-being.  We all go through difficult periods and need to talk to a GP and a psychologist to work through the issues.  I ask the committee to start creating an understanding about mental well-being, mental fitness and mental health services because the public needs to know that services are available at that level.</p></speech>

There must be an awful lot of throat infections because it is all people seem to think I do.  I wish it was the case, but it is a little more complicated than that.  </p> <p>  We teach our registrars and trainees that general practice is holistic, encompassing the biological, psychological, social and existential problems people bring with them and they are multiple.  They include loneliness, grief and financial problems, among many others that will not be found in a medical textbook.  We have a continuous relationship with patients over many years.  It is an iterative engagement that builds relationships and forms emotional capital which can be drawn down at the times people are in trouble.  Psychology, counselling and psychotherapy are extremely important resources for us to have at our disposal, but it is not always the case that people are ready to attend those services at a given time.  Very often there will be a "Will I?  Won't I?" dilemma because it is painful for them as they are exposing themselves in attending a professional.  We should not fragment general practice.  One of its great strengths is as a central, holistic place into which everything feeds.  Any problem can be heard or dealt with, although perhaps not concluded.  Other agencies can also feed into it.  If services are to be added to general practice in the form of psychologists and counsellors, they will be important.</p> <p>  A meta-analysis was conducted in the United Kingdom which demonstrated that psychological intervention soon after a self-harm episode reduced the risk of reharming by between 30% and 40%.  We deal with and contain problems while the waiting lists are being worked through.  That is not good as it leads to a deterioration in problems and a greater requirement for more expensive services that might be available in the secondary care system.  If the problem can be tackled in the place of least complexity and the guns are brought to the front line, one is likely to have a greater impact.  As a country, we spend the same as the OECD average, but we do not spend or divide it up well.  Earlier people were harping on about the FEMPI legislation.  If the State persists in investing 3.5% to 4% of national income in general practice, I am afraid we will end up with the same results.  If someone has pyrite in his or her house, the basement should be fixed, not the attic.  We are in the basement.</p></speech>

As a member of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, I am stickler for profiling people and conducting research.  Page 15 of the document mentioned the need for multidisciplinary teams, to adopt a recovery perspective, to formalise links between specialised mental health services and for service users to be viewed as active participants.  There is nothing new in this.  In her opening comments Professor O'Connor said we should again consider an expert group or putting people into different positions, but the groundwork has been done.  A Vision for Change was an excellent document, but how the HSE approached it might not have been best practice in the long run and it is coming home to roost.</p> <p>  I am my party's spokesperson on children.  Professor O'Connor mentioned the numbers on waiting lists up to the end of July, but I have figures to the end of September when there were 2,333 children waiting for a referral for their first appointment, of whom 861 had been waiting for longer than three months.  The list goes on, with 521 waiting for more than six months.  What direct access do GPs have to make a referral?  They need to know the baseline because nobody is in a better position than a GP to make that assessment and an early intervention.  We all know what "acute" means and GPs are in the best position to identify it.  It is when children need to be transferred immediately to CAMHS.  Why are there roadblocks to prevent early intervention?  That issue falls at the door of the HSE.  How is it being addressed?</p></speech>

I apologise as my voice is failing.  I read their submission with interest.  We previously discussed at the Committee on the Future of Healthcare the critical role played by GPs and the primary care service at all levels to try to get the health service back on an even keel.  The ratio of GPs is 64 per 100,000 people.  It needs to be 90:100,000.  How can it be achieved?  Are there sufficient students in the universities to move to the IGCP for training to increase the ratio?  How can Scotland achieve it but not Ireland?</p> <p>  The submission refers to primary care teams.  Only 13% of the GPs surveyed reported positively on their experience of such teams.  Why is that?  I would have expected the figure to be much higher.  What can be done to improve it?  Everything goes back to trying to deal with as much as possible at primary care level.  That would go a long way to solving many problems across all areas.</p> <p>  A significant number of section 39 organisations deal with mental health issues.</p><p>While many of these organisations are doing excellent work, what is the experience of the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, in this regard?  Do the organisations integrate well with primary care teams and general practitioners?  Does each organisation know what the next organisation is doing?  Do they refer back to the ICGP?  Can we do anything to improve that scenario?  I received a query this week from a person who works in this area.  Her suggestion was that where possible, these organisations should all be located in one building with shared receptionists and shared costs to try to get the HSE better bang for its buck.  I am interested in the view of the ICGP on that suggestion.</p></speech>

From everything they have said, I can hear how committed they all are to public health and I wish to acknowledge that.</p><p>Earlier, Deputy Rabbitte referred to how Professor O'Connor was involved with A Vision for Change, which was published in 2006.  My focus to a major extent is on mental health well-being and the health promotion side of things.  Has Professor O'Connor seen any change in young people who present suffering from anxiety and so on because of the various things that can go wrong as a result of exposure to social media?  It is only in the past six or seven years that social media has taken off and become a major part of the lives of young people.  I am concerned about the amount of young people, including primary schoolchildren, who are now experiencing mental health issues.  It is incredible to me as a mother.  I often ask myself how I would manage the social media business if I had young children now.  I am keen to hear the views of Professor O'Connor.</p><p>I am interested in the impact that alcohol has on mental health.  I do not think we do enough taking about the negative impact it can have.  It is a lovely social lubricant - no one is being prohibitionist - but we need to inform our people about it as well.  I know front-line general practitioners do this but I am keen to hear from the witnesses as to whether we are doing it enough.  The HSE's <i>askaboutalcohol.ie</i>website is fantastic but are we doing enough to get the messages out?</p><p>We now have new communities coming in.  They include people who have come from countries where certain practices are the norm such as, for example, female genital mutilation, child marriage and so on.  Attendant problems can result.  How do general practitioners manage that?  Is the college training GPs to recognise if someone has been subject to these practices?  Such people would have all the trauma associated with them and this can have an impact on their mental health.  Is there an associated training programme now?  It is only in recent years that we have begun to deal with people coming from countries such as Sudan or wherever.  Is there a programme for GPs or practice nurses to enable them to know what to look for if people come in?</p></speech>

I have two brief questions.  We see a high number of referrals to the emergency room for people who have suicidal ideation.  Do they go on their own bat to the emergency room or do GPs refer them?  If GPs or those in the emergency room are the only people who really operate outside the nine-to-five system, how can they support the person who has suicidal ideation?</p> <p>  The ICGP representatives referred to the negotiations with the HSE and the possibility of a change of contract.  Can the GP representatives inform us of their position with the negotiation with the HSE?  How is it developing?  Is there any timeline for it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-14a.1176" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brendan O'Shea" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2017121400002#N00400"><p>I will go in reverse order and take your questions first, Chairman.</p> <p>  The Chair asked about referrals to the emergency department.  People who are being referred to the emergency department under these circumstances absolutely do not want to be there.  Often, the general practitioners who have to send them in do not want to send them in there either.  Under the current system, they go from an experienced general practitioner into an emergency department, which is often exceptionally busy &ndash; that is the polite term for chaotic.  The person in questions waits and is then seen by a junior hospital doctor.  Frequently, there is no specialist on-site.  There is specialist backup by telephone.  That is the system we are stuck with and with which we operate.</p> <p>  As for the contract negotiations, we are not good at this.  The last contract was negotiated 39 years ago and there is no memory or process of any of that.  As for where the process is at, we met the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, shortly after his appointment in August 2016.  We had assurances that there would be progress on the contract.  Regrettably, we have made the contract negotiations very complicated for ourselves because there requires to be a detailed alignment between the Department of Finance, the Department of Health, the HSE, the college, which is the standards-driven body, and the GP representative organisations.  Other important people are involved, including the Irish Practice Nurses Association.  We have made this very complex.  The job the negotiators have to do is exceptionally difficult.  To answer the question, as far as we can understand it the negotiations are progressing very slowly in a relatively opaque manner and in a manner that is of concern to those of us who are particularly focused on patient care.  This touches on some of Deputy Brassil's points on building up the system.  As each year goes by, a further percentage of our young trainees emigrate.  They will not work in a work system that is operating the way it does.</p> <p>  Deputy Brassil asked how we build capacity and what can we do.  How do we get to 90 GPs per 100,000 of population?  The college has increased the number of places on the national training scheme from 154 five years ago to up to 200.  The college is ready and able to expand training, subject to funding and building in training capacity.  We believe that, subject to funding, it will be possible to increase capacity.  This year there has been a marked increase in junior hospital doctors applying for places on the national training scheme.  We are positive in that regard.</p> <p>  If there is a new contract, it will make a difference.  At present, 17% of each class of graduating GPs leave straight away.  They leave to work in Australia, Canada and the UK.  GPs in these countries have equality, electronic health care and appropriate processes of referral.  GPs in these countries do not have to send their patients into chaotic emergency departments and they are paid reasonably well.</p> <p>  If we have a better contract, there is a prospect that the groups who have emigrated in recent years may come home and that we would be able to retain more of our well trained and well qualified general practitioners.</p> <p>  There is another element to fixing the problems that relates to the capacity for practice nurses.  I am keen to highlight the situation of practice nurses in the health system at the moment.  They do not have uniform access to maternity leave or educational leave.  They have no career progression pathway.  In general terms, their terms and conditions are significantly limited relative to their colleagues in the hospital setting.  We have 1,700 practice nurses who work incredibly effectively.  They are all electronically enabled.  It is known exactly what they do, but it is very difficult to recruit younger nurses to expand capacity at present.  However, if we can equal the playing pitch between practice nurses in hospitals and in general practice, then we are confident that we will be able to increase the numbers of general practice nurses.  That would have all manner of attendant benefits that we have referred to already.</p></speech>

Some 15% of GPs are over the age of 65 and 25% are over the age of 60 years.  We have a demographic cliff looming ahead.  Much of what we are talking about today is urgent.  We cannot simply continue talking like this.  It is urgent.</p></speech>

We have older GP working groups within college.  We are looking to extend.  Dr. O'Shea is correct in saying that there is a demographic cliff towards which we are proceeding.  Certainly, the college is open to the idea.</p><p>We understand that many college members who are older are interested in working, provided that they can be supported in that, so that they will not be dealing with heaving waiting rooms but will be able to assist and help out.  We are open to all of those suggestions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-14a.1184" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. John O'Brien" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2017121400002#O00200"><p>We are open to all solutions but we need to see there is a problem.  There is also the case that when people have worked very hard in the system for very many years, at 65 years of age they want to go.  That needs to be taken on board.  Even though they can stay until the age of 72 years, a proportion of them are unlikely to want to stay until they are 72 years.</p> <p>  On the issues of suicide and an emergency room, the UK had a national confidential suicide inquiry and the upshot was that the intervention of a 24 hour crisis team was the single intervention to have the most impact on suicide rates.  We need to be focusing on how we do things as much as anything else.  If we are to have such crisis intervention teams, they need to be specialist delivered or closely led.  They cannot be, as Dr. O'Shea said, a junior hospital doctor being called an expert.  That is not true.  That is one side.</p> <p>  The other issue is the impact of social media.  I agree that it is a significant problem.  I do not know how any society is getting to grips with it at present but I think it is a major problem and it boils down to bullying and a range of other things that are very bad.  We will see a greater increase in the level of childhood mental health problems coming forward.  It will come to us in the first instance.</p> <p>  We have an ambivalent attitude to the abuse of alcohol.  We are amused and horrified by it in equal measure.  There are two aspects, one of which is that GPs and all health care professionals need to be banging that drum on an ongoing basis, but I also think we need a wider discourse as a community as to how we might address it as this is peer driven.  When a person's friends are drinking heavily, so is that person.  That is the way of it.  Young people in particular engage in binge drinking.  It has an impact on mental health, liver disease and I could go on and on.  Very valid points were raised.</p> <p>  On the issue of ethnicities and how GP practices are coping with different social norms, I think GPs are dealing with it.  I do not know that we have an overarching overall policy.  There are different aspects, and some will fall into women's health education which is quite extensive in the college.  As I said earlier, a GP takes all comers and takes all problems and addresses them accordingly.  GPs have a continuing medical education programme and would have an awareness of the various and variety of problems that people in the community are experiencing.</p></speech>

Second, I addressed a question to Professor O'Connor on her earlier contribution, which has already been identified, and why we have not delivered on it.  The roadmap, A Vision for Change, was set out in 2004, but looking at what has been put in place in terms of the CAMHS teams, not one of the teams at this time is above 58.7% of the fully resourced team envisaged in that brilliant document, A Vision for Change, and this happens to be in the CHO 3 area.  The HSE has approached the implementation of the policy in the wrong way.  The HSE did not put the teams in place before it decided to withdraw services.  The HSE withdrew services, such as St Brigid's psychiatric hospital in Ballinasloe, and funnelled them into Galway or Roscommon hospitals, which were not prepared, and then it fell back on the GP services to deal with mental health.  I want to understand what the expert group on mental health policy is taking from its document to address mental health?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-14a.1187" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Joyce O'Connor" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2017121400002#O00500"><p>I accept that a lot of what we said and what we are saying now is still relevant.  The key to it is the delivery of services.  I will talk about the HSE.  We identified in our document the key area and where the attention needs to be focused.  What has happened is that in each area, there is the possibility now of intervening appropriately in each CHO area to free up this group in the mental health services to deal with people who need their care.  There are people on the list who should be more appropriately linked there.</p> <p>  To address the issue of early intervention, there is a need to have an overall multidisciplinary body set up at national level with all the Departments, not just the HSE, but I would like to see the Departments of Education and Skills and Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla to take responsibility for this area so that the interventions therefore will be more effective.</p> <p>  To revert to Deputy Neville's question, the areas that have worked more effectively are those that have effective leadership, work well in a multidisciplinary team, have the full complement of staff and do not have recruitment problems.  That is clear.</p> <p>  I think part of the way of addressing it in terms of implementation is to work on this area in terms of early intervention.</p></speech>

There is also a data protection issue because they are not currently sharing information with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or with the GP service.</p></speech>

What I am saying, and Deputy Rabbitte is absolutely correct, is that is it not crazy that we are in this committee room in 2017 discussing a document on which there is an agreement on the policy but we are falling down in its implementation?  We know where the blocks are.  As a committee, members could write what will make a difference because they can intervene.  There is no joined-up thinking.  One of the fundamentals of A Vision for Change was integrated services and integrated supports and services and that is only beginning to happen.  If that is done, it will make an enormous difference.  There is a way of doing it, starting next week.</p></speech>

One of the problems when a child presents at a GP practice is that the only recourse for the doctor is to refer the child to the child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, which must refer the child on.  Why can the GP service not make a direct referral to the youth advocate programme, YAP, or whoever is identified as a provider?</p></speech>

That was what was suggested, namely, that in each of these areas, the NGOs that are being paid for by the State through the taxpayer could work with the primary care teams and the GPs.  The GPs do not have the capacity to deal with all interventions.  They could not possibly do so, and Deputy Rabbitte is honest enough to say that.  Therefore, patients can be referred to these other bodies.  Section 39 organisations, to which Deputy Brassil referred, are in place but they are not aligned with the policy.  What the Minister can do is say to them is that if they are being funded by the State, this is how they must work.  They should not work off their own bat.</p></speech>

I do not know why that is happening but I accept it.  However, it is not what should be happening and it is not the right way.  If we had a liaison officer in the CHO area the GP would liaise with him or her and they could refer the patient on.  That is where the approved clinician comes in, with clinical psychotherapists able to deal with people at an appropriate level and the right time and place to work effectively with the person who needs the help rather than channelling up through a system in a way that was not envisaged and should not happen.</p></speech>

We can agree on that.  I accept the point about social media and I think it is a big issue.  A very interesting conference on technology and well-being was held recently.  I will send the data on it to the Chairman.  It addressed some of the issues and people are becoming more aware of their implications.  To turn this on its head, however, people are also looking at the power of technology to intervene earlier with young people.  They are using the ReachOut.com model that was used in Australia and has been very effective.  In Australia, there are 1.6 million users and researchers have been able to gather data and look at who is using them.  Surprisingly, young people aged between 18 and 25 with suicide ideation often used it positively to help them.  E-mental health and technology can also aid GPs in the area of early intervention.</p> <p>  The new communities can be addressed in the education area and if the necessary support was there it could act as an early intervener because they are seen on a day-to-day basis.  A joined-up interdepartmental and inter-agency system, in which local community GPs and NGOs work together, is more likely to pick up early intervention issues so that a case does not have to be really severe to get attention.</p></speech>

One of them is a child psychologist.  If I need to access a service I can do so and I can do it reasonably quickly.  I also have a talking relationship with the individuals who come.  Three miles up the road in Mulhuddart, I have a good friend who does heroic work but she has psychology waiting times of 18 months, CAMHS waiting times of a year and CIPC waiting lists of five months.  GPs will find the water level and if the service is needed they will be on the lookout for it.  They will ask each other who does what and where it is and they are scrounging around to find whatever they can for the individuals concerned.  This is bearing heavily on the poor and deprived and they are the people we are failing</p></speech>

There was a question on deprivation weightings which we did not address.  We can wait for as long as we like for the new general practice contract - and I do not know if it will ever happen - but in the current system the same payment is involved for one of Dr. O'Brien's affluent cases in Castleknock and one of his or Dr. McGinnity's medical card patients in Mulhuddart.  A mechanism exists, at the flick of a switch in GMS under the primary care reimbursement system, to put in community deprivation weightings.  The HSE has the technology to do that and it can use Health Atlas Ireland for this as it has information about background levels of deprivation in communities and can map the pre-existing resources.  When they do this, all the places like Mulhuddart light up so without any new contract they could crank up the payment level and Dr. McGinnity would get &euro;227 per year for looking after a medical card patient, rather than the current &euro;156 per year.  I refer the committee to the work of our colleagues of the Dublin Deep End group, which is a group of GPs including Dr. McGinnity and Professor Susan Smith, for more information about this.  Deprivation weightings would be very easy to switch on without a new contract if we had the will to do it.</p> <p>  Actions could be taken to ensure more practice nurses and GPs.  We fully subscribe to the idea of connectedness in the middle and bottom part of the pyramid and the general practice sector will move rapidly in this respect, though we have doubts about the ability of the HSE to move rapidly on anything.</p></speech>

My team, which includes Ms Helen Dooley, our group legal counsel, and I, look forward to answering, where possible, members' questions concerning leaks recently published in the Paradise Papers. </p> <p>  To begin, I will endeavour to provide an insight into the management and operation of AIB&rsquo;s businesses in the Isle of Man and Jersey, both of which have been closed for several years now.  AIB first established an offshore presence in the Isle of Man and Jersey in 1977 and 1981, respectively.  The rationale for establishing this offshore presence was to support the bank&rsquo;s growing business franchise in Britain and the United States and to meet the banking needs of the increasing international workforce. </p> <p>  In line with all financial institutions, the variety of the products offered developed over the years and included deposit, lending and trust services.  AIB provided banking services to residents of the islands and to expatriate individuals who were working and residing in another jurisdiction, be that in the United Kingdom, the United States of America or, more latterly, in the United Arab Emirates, UAE.</p> <p>  Services did not include providing tax advice.  Clients of the offshore businesses were required to take independent tax and legal advice.  The offshore businesses worked with those advisers in full compliance with local and international regulation, to provide a range of products, for example, trust structures, that were used for a variety of reasons from estate planning to managing individual and corporate investments, to more basic banking services.  AIB ceased this trust business in the Isle of Man 14 years ago and sold the Jersey trust business in 2011. </p> <p>  In the chaos that prevailed during the financial crisis, AIB, like every other Irish bank, was focused on the imperative of protecting its deposit base.  The offshore business was no different in trying to maintain its deposit base.  In any event, AIB&rsquo;s offshore deposits declined rapidly during the bailout era, from a peak of almost sterling &pound;2.5 billion in 2008 to sterling &pound;191 million in 2012. </p> <p>  In 2012, the banking businesses in both Jersey and the Isle of Man, which at this time included Anglo Irish Bank&rsquo;s business in the Isle of Man - these had been transferred to AIB on the direction of the then Minister for Finance in February 2011 - were identified as non-core to the bank.  In April 2012, AIB announced that the remaining Isle of Man and Jersey businesses would be wound down.  The orderly wind down of the businesses commenced in May 2012 under the supervision of the local regulators and was completed in December 2013. </p> <p>  Today, AIB&rsquo;s sole interest in Jersey and the Isle of Man is in respect of its customer liabilities associated with the legacy book, which is administered in both jurisdictions by Estera, a managed services business previously owned by Appleby solicitors.  Currently, circa sterling &pound;13.5 million is being held in respect of AIB Channel Islands, CI, Limited and AIB ISL Limited as liabilities owed to customers. </p> <p>  The companies have surrendered their banking licences and have stopped doing any new business and no longer trade.  The legal entities are required, under regulatory requirements, to remain in existence for up to ten years from the date of closure to honour the liabilities of customers.  Thus, our interest, involvement and participation in the offshore business is and has been over for many years. </p> <p>  I thank the committee for allowing me the opportunity to make this introductory statement.  My team and I will, of course, answer the committee&rsquo;s questions to the best of our ability.</p></speech>

As the chief executive of a major Irish financial institution which has been bailed out by taxpayers, what is his view of the disclosure in the Panama Papers of the widespread tax evasion on which they have shone a light?</p><p>Does Mr. Byrne have a view on that matter?  While he has said the bank's activities in Jersey and the Isle of Man are long over, are there other jurisdictions or arrangements in place in which the bank continues to facilitate wealthy individuals or businesses in arranging their affairs in such a way as to avoid tax in this jurisdiction?</p><p> Mr. Byrne has described the services as including deposit, lending and trust services.  Will he give us an indication of their capital value?  He has stated bank deposits were in the realm of the figure of &pound;2.458 billion in 2008.  Is he aware of what happened to these bank deposits subsequently?  During the crash were they moved to another jurisdiction or were people bringing them back here?  Does Mr. Byrne have an indication of the capital value of trust services?  Were the lending services to facilitate back-to-back loan facilities where, for instance, people were being given loans for construction in Ireland while using deposits and other assets they may have had offshore, including trust assets in this jurisdiction or offshore, as collateral?  My understanding is such a practice would have been extensive at the time.  I draw a contrast between ordinary bank customers and those who may have been in a position to facilitate this practice.</p><p> Not too long before this particular episode occurred, the bank provided services for many Irish individuals who were persuaded by their local bank manager that they should have a DIRT, deposit interest retention tax, type account in their friendly AIB branch on the Isle of Man and in other jurisdictions.  How many of the accounts involved were business and commercial accounts and how many were held by ordinary people?  In banking terms, the sum of &pound;2.458 billion may not have been significant in the context of the bank's overall balance sheet at the time.  However, to most ordinary customers of the bank, it was an enormous sum at a time when the country was in severe difficulty.</p><p> The bank made significant losses from 2008 on which are now deferred tax assets.  Recently it gave an indication of their value at approximately &euro;3 billion.  Will Mr. Byrne advise the committee as to how long it will be before the bank will pay any corporation tax?  Does he find it acceptable or surprising or is he simply just grateful that the bank will not have to pay corporation tax and that essentially it is left to its choice?  Does it operate in any other jurisdiction which does not have an offshore avoidance structure and where it does not incur some local corporation tax or equivalent tax liabilities?</p><p> Will Mr. Byrne update us on how the situation for those unfortunate enough to have been caught by the tracker mortgage issue is being resolved?  There will also be further questions about those in difficulty with their mortgages and where the bank is at on this matter.</p></speech>

It is worthwhile looking at how the situation evolved and standing back from individual details, disclosures and media comments.  It is important to look at how the situation evolved, what the situation was for the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and how it positioned itself.  Based on my understanding, it really started in 2003 when the Revenue Commissioners became energised on the issue of offshore accounts.  Obviously, they commenced a series of separate work streams in looking at offshore accounts.  At the time they engaged with the chief executive officers of several banks in Ireland, ten in total.  This culminated in a request from them to the banks here that they write to the boards of their overseas banks which were subject to separate regulation and separate legal entities to ask them to write to their offshore customers telling them that the Irish revenue authorities were about to begin an investigation which would start in 2004 and encouraging customers to avail of the voluntary disclosure legislation in place.  That began the process in 2003.</p> <p>  By the end of December 2003 the then chairman of the Revenue Commissioners had written to the banks - in AIB's case, the chief executive officer at the time - requesting that the letter be written to the boards of the overseas subsidiaries and that these boards be asked to consider writing to customers.  I will discuss the issue of data protection later.  It was a voluntary request to do so because data protection legislation would have prevented anything more intrusive.  My understanding of the position at that stage was that the boards, particularly of the AIB-related subsidiaries, considered the request and acceded to it.  They wrote to any customer they had about this matter to advise them, as requested by the Revenue Commissioners, that a voluntary disclosure regime was in place, that they should comply with it because a full investigation would take place in March and that anybody who had not voluntarily disclosed at that point in time would not be able to avail of its benefits subsequently.  I presume the basis on which the Revenue Commissioners were doing this was to get as much information as they could on a voluntary basis which would then allow them to target more specific transactions.</p> <p>  In 2004 the Revenue Commissioners, across the financial sector, began a series of High Court orders.  It is important to point out that the only legal way they can get specific details on transactions is through the issuing of a High Court order.  It is not the order of last resort but the order of first resort.  There is no other way they can get such data.</p></speech>

They are comments that people have made and on which they have put articles together.  I am trying to bring the committee through the factual series of events.</p> <p>  Over eight years from 2004, the Revenue Commissioners put in place 14 High Court orders in respect of AIB.  The reason the High Court process is in place is that a judge must consider the details and a specific request to determine if there is enough evidence to support the disclosure of the data.  What will happen in an investigation such as this is that one will start in a certain place, more information will be discovered and there will then be a separate request.  There is a sequence of events which in this case took place over eight years.  The chairman of the Revenue Commissioners has given evidence to the committee that overall they recovered &euro;1 billion in tax on the offshore accounts.  I have no information or evidence which indicates from where it came or which customers or accounts were involved.  That is the Revenue Commissioners' information, not ours.  We complied with every single one of the orders.  There has been some commentary on that matter in the newspapers, but we are satisfied we did everything we possibly could have.  It culminated in 2014 in the conclusion of the High Court order process.</p><p>This relates to data from the 1990s.  There were incomplete data in terms of paper files and records in AIB.  The Revenue Commissioners were not able to be fully satisfied about the accuracy of the records so there was a settlement by AIB in 2014 with the Revenue in respect of offshore accounts where there were incomplete data and it could not be evidenced as to what happened.  The settlement took place in respect of the tax year 1998 and it was &euro;10.7 million.  That is the full position that took place in respect of how that process worked with all those offshore accounts.</p><p> My general comment, which I was asked about, covers the process and the procedure and I hope it is helpful to set out how it went from beginning to end.  We are very clear that we do not encourage or support non-compliance with tax law or regulation.  There has not been any encouragement.  The policy of the bank since 1998 or 1999, as far as I am aware - the awareness piece is only as to the date it started rather than when it existed - is that we in no way target Irish-resident customers in respect of overseas activities.  There is no policy in the bank in respect of that.</p><p> I joined the bank in 2010, and as we all know, the world changed around 2010 and 2011 with the recapitalisation of the bank and the introduction of &euro;20.8 billion of State capital.  I can talk to what happened subsequent to that but my knowledge and detail does not extend to what happened prior to that, in a different era and regime in terms of how the bank operated.  The board changed as well as leadership team members.  All the top 200 in the bank changed.  The decision on the offshore business is reasonably straightforward.  In 2011-----</p></speech>

There are two other categories listed in the statement, lending and trust services.  What is the number of trust services?  I know they are historic data but is there an indication of values?  I presume that whereas the deposits amount to a very significant figure at &euro;2.4 billion, trust services may also have involved significant numbers of customers and had significant assets.</p></speech>

We gave the number for 2008 as that was the date of the deposit guarantee coming into place.  The point of maximum balance was the line.  To some extent we are trying to anticipate where the questions are going.  The capital value or equity value to the business in respect of both of those activities is very modest.  These offshore businesses, certainly from 2010 onwards, were not highly valuable businesses.  When the strategic review took place in 2011 around the core activities that AIB would be engaging in as part of the recapitalisation and restructuring plan, these businesses were deemed as non-core.  In 2011, around the time the final equity from the State came in, these businesses were deemed non-core.  They were not the only ones deemed non-core at that point.  A separate exercise in respect of each of those non-core activities was engaged in to consider the strategic options for those businesses.  In December 2011, it was determined the most likely strategic option was to exit those businesses.  That effectively became a formal decision in March 2012, which was then communicated to local regulators in April.</p></speech>

Was it entirely just about the value of the business or did it come down perhaps to the bank taking a view on the fact that it had very significant deposits offshore which gave rise to tax liabilities in the Revenue examinations and which were not declared?  Given that the bank was effectively dependent on the State, was it an influencing factor in the decision-making at the time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-14a.1235" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard Byrne" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017121400002#G00500"><p>The three priorities from 2010 for the business were very clear.  One was the radical restructuring and repositioning of the bank and putting it in the position to allow the State to get back its &euro;20.8 billion.  We keep that at the forefront of our minds by seeing it as &euro;10,500 for every taxpayer.  The second was focusing the bank on delivering its core markets and customer base and in the servicing of the Irish economy in a more efficient and effective manner than before.  There was also the support of the first agenda of delivering commercial value.  The third point was dealing with all the legacy issues that would inevitably arise during the course of the years afterwards as a result of the activities of previous decades.  They were the three priorities set out by the banks.</p> <p>  If it is helpful, there is another point.  The offshore businesses failed from approximately 2009 or 2010 onwards to be able to upstream deposits.  The local regulators became concerned about the solvency of AIB and other banks and it effectively trapped deposits in the offshore businesses.  One of the considerations in terms of the strategic review would have been absolutely influenced by the fact these deposits were offshore, remaining offshore and not coming back into the core activity.  The issues that determined the non-core nature of the business were very heavily commercial at that point.  All the decisions we try to make are very heavily commercial, but we have an overview in terms of the reputation and positioning of the bank.  The decision made was strategic and concerned the bank going forward.</p> <p>  I have no idea what happened to the deposits in terms of how they ran out.  People would have just taken their deposits.  Looking at AIB in a similar period, from 2010 to the middle of 2011, approximately &euro;40 billion of deposits left the bank.  They went from &euro;100 billion to &euro;60 billion, and a major outflow of deposits took place.  That happened across the Irish system and one of the key systemic problems at the time was the exiting of deposits.  It took place in corporate, commercial and retail deposits.  It is not surprising to me that those deposits left an Irish-based institution.  I do not know if they were corporate, personal or retail deposits.</p> <p>  There was a point on the deferred tax asset issue and I have commented on that before.  It is approximately &euro;3 billion.  It is slightly less but we can keep it at that round number.  Around the time of the recapitalisation and the capital assessment set by the Central Bank, the &euro;3 billion was considered equity.  In other words, the State did not have to put in an extra &euro;3 billion in equity that it would have had to if the deferred tax assets had been disallowed.  It is very simple and therefore it was capital goods from the State's perspective.  It is really a choice issue in terms of how the Government and the Department of Finance considers the matter.  Currently, based on closing prices last night, our bank trades at a market cap of approximately &euro;14.9 billion.  Included in that is a deferred tax asset of &euro;3 billion.  The price to book - how much people pay relative to the book value - is 1.12.  They are paying 12% more than the book value of the assets.  This is choice for the State.  Does it want to realise the cash by selling the asset now and getting cash upfront or does it want to get rid of the deferred tax asset and effectively recover it in the form of corporation tax?  It is not our decision and it is part of the taxation matter on the land.  Personally, I believe the State has benefited from the treatment of deferred tax as it went in and it can currently benefit from it in terms of a sell-down position.  That is a personal view but the Government decides what to do in respect of taxation policy.  All we do is comply with what is there and operate to that system.  My comments are more about how we can see this playing out more positively if the Revenue Commissioners get the money earlier rather than later.</p></speech>

What we have read in the media is a lot more expansive.</p> <p>  Mr. Byrne mentioned that &pound;2.458 billion was the amount in 2008.  What was the peak?  We are looking at 1977 and 1981.  What did deposits peak at in terms of offshoring in the Isle of Man and Jersey?  What level did they peak at?  What was the absolute highest?</p></speech>

Our job here is to ask the questions.  What we were reading in the papers is that from 1977 to 1981, which coincided with when the DIRT accounts were coming in for ordinary deposit holders, many of whom I dealt with when I was in practice, a lot of the money was put into non-residential accounts by AIB and other banks.  A lot of them dated back to 1977 and 1981.  Were some of these accounts that were in the Isle of Man at that time DIRT accounts for ordinary deposit holders who ended up in many cases paying 500% in liabilities?  I am not even certain if many of them were fully aware of what they were doing at the time.  The banks put them into non-residential accounts.</p> <p>  The Paradise Papers give the impression that AIB was using the offshore accounts in the Isle of Man and Jersey in two ways.  In many cases they were deemed to be tax havens and the deposits that were received were being used to fund operations in Ireland.  They were effectively a conduit and people were told to put the money offshore, that they would not pay tax and get the best of both worlds.  People would not pay tax but the bank would get to use their deposits to grow its business in Ireland.  What does Mr. Byrne say to that?  That is what comes across in the Paradise Papers.  From the papers, it looks as though AIB split into pre-1998 and post-1998 in terms of offshore accounts.  Post-1998 it would only allow funds offshore for legitimate tax planning but it was not giving that assurance to pre-1998 deposits.  </p> <p>  Our job is to probe what came forward in the Paradise Papers and the veracity of the papers for the information of the public and to hear from AIB.  Mr. Byrne might comment on that.  I have given a flavour of what I believe is coming across in the Paradise Papers.</p></speech>

We can give colour and flavour but what happened in history happened in history and we can in no way control or influence what that was.  We ended up with a very dramatic event in 2010, which was the entire recapitalisation of what was a bankrupt institution at that point in time and a complete change going forward.  My main objective is to convince the committee of what has happened since then.  We can talk about and comment on the history but I have no ability to influence or control it.</p></speech>

The Senator has talked about the 1990s period.  There seems to have been a complete change in the 1998 era in terms of AIB offshore activities and whether other institutions would accept Irish resident accounts.  That did seem to change.  It is reasonably clear that is the policy that applied for 1998.  Therefore, by implication, something must have happened before that.  The investigation process with the Revenue has evolved and the fact there was a 1990s period that need to be settled suggests that those things happened.</p></speech>

We have ordinary people coming to us, who earn just above the average industrial wage, and they are paying nearly 50 cent on the euro in tax.  They see something that was going on for many years and they are asking how and why it happened and are asking us to ensure it will never happen again.  They are saying there are two worlds.  Some people are paying heavy tax, trying to educate their children, pay their mortgages yet the institution with which they hold their mortgages and which holds them to account to pay their mortgage on a monthly basis was facilitating high-worth individuals having money offshore a short distance away in the Isle of man and Jersey and paying no tax.

Winding down a bank is not easy becuase there are significant obligations to customers.  A detailed regulatory engagement took place and a plan was developed and approved by the local regulators which was delivered.  The licence was handed back and the entity formally ceased in 2013, but from the date of first notification to the regulator, there was no new business activity.  Everything was about the closure of the business.  There was no new business activity from 2012 and the entire entity closed in 2013, with the banking licence being handed back.  An amount was kept to represent customer deposits and it will sit there for up to ten years for any deposit holder who is entitled to it to claim it.</p></speech>

During the early part of this year we went through an intensive process to market the institution to international investors.  Between ourselves and the advisers appointed from the various investment banks, there were 1,400 individual meetings with international institutions.  Some were double up meetings at which they might have met us and a broker.  Many of the meetings were with just one person, but some of them might have been attended by 100 people.  There was a huge marketing campaign throughout Ireland and in AIB because one would not buy AIB unless one liked Ireland and one had to like both to participate.  There was a great deal of interest and we were pleased the initial public offering, IPO, at the back end of June had seen its way through a lot of turbulent activity.  The stock and markets have since performed well, which has been positive.  My commentary generally is that these processes come and go.  If there is a market and a willing investor set that understands the story now because stories change over time, it is often opportune to take advantage of it.  The State has a long-term objective of exiting.  As of close of business last night, the total value of cash received, plus 71% of the market value, equated to &euro;20.8 billion, which people would have said was fanciful a few years ago when we sat in this room.  We are at that position at this time.  I cannot tell the Senator what will happen next regarding valuations, but there is an opportunity which looks attractive.  Investors understand the story and have an interest in it.  They like Ireland.</p></speech>

The Minister's statement informed by the Central Bank's position, which is ongoing, will be issued next week.  We will not get involved in early disclosures in that respect because we do not have the information.  The last time we made a public statement, we commented on the fact that we had progressed pretty well.  On the total number of cases that have been identified and in which compensation has been paid, we are at a figure of more than 90%.  We have progressed well with those we have identified, but we have always said the programme will continue within the remit of the Central Bank and that it will not conclude until 2018.</p></speech>

The way I positioned the story gave context to the fact that it was all part of one sequence of events from the Revenue Commissioners' investigation.  That did not emerge from the story which makes it seem more disparate in terms of that position.  I disagree most with the statement - the headline - that we were encouraging people to do this during recent times.  I do not agree with that statement.</p></speech>

He also confirmed that he had now written to AIB seeking the information given what AIB has put on the record.  I think I got this through parliamentary questions that I put down to the Minister - that the bank has indicated that it is willing to share information.  I ask Mr. Byrne to square that circle for me.  How is the chairperson of the Revenue Commissioners of the view that there was some block?</p></speech>

In responding to the previous questioner, Deputy O'Donnell, I referenced the issue of Revenue writing to us.  I talked about that at that point in time.</p> <p>  The two points are that the data in respect of those customers resided in and is owned by an offshore entity.  Therefore, any process to request that data has to go through the owner of the data.  The Revenue has a protocol and system in place with the Isle of Man, as I understand it, where it can do that.  I am not aware whether it has or has not done that.  That is its protocol that it can comply with.  We have given all the data that we can, and that is in full compliance with the order, which is within our control.  That is what is being complied with.</p></speech>

I will read it to refresh Mr. Byrne's memory.  It states:</p><blockquote>In 2006, AIB was introducing a centralised transaction processing and data storage capability in the Republic.  In February of that year, Ray O'Connor, the head of group taxation with AIB in Dublin, wrote to Howland in the IOM suggesting that they get legal advice on whether outsourcing their data to the Republic might create a risk for their offshore branch.  <br /><br />&quot;Under current Irish legislation [this is a quote from the document that has been seen] one relevant point is whether the data could be within the &quot;power, possession and procurement&quot; of AIB plc and therefore within the scope of a potential information request from Revenue.  ... </blockquote> <p>Is this not AIB plc basically facilitating its offshore entity to make sure that it was completely out of reach of the Irish tax authorities while at the same time the witnesses knew damn well that they had Irish residents who were using that offshore account to avoid taxation in this State?</p></speech>

The way the Deputy has read it makes it sound like it was legitimate to query whether it was going to have data ownership implications.  I do not know.</p></speech>

Obviously, this did not come under the centralised system.  If that had happened, however, perhaps Revenue would not have had to go through this process and possibly we would not have had to wait for these leaks for whatever version of AIB we are talking about to provide this data.  Is it not the case that if this warning had not been issued, and it did come under the centralised transaction processing and data storage capability of the Republic, it would have come under the scope of Revenue?</p></speech>

On that issue, does Mr. Byrne acknowledge that the subsidiary had legacy customers?  The previous Deputy mentioned that in 1998, AIB Isle of Man started accepting only those residents of Ireland who could avail of legitimate tax planning opportunities.  A note drafted for a board meeting of AIB Isle of Man in 2004 broke the business into legacy customers from before 1998 and post-1998 customers who had legitimately availed of the bank's services.  For how long did AIB continue to facilitate legacy customers who, we can infer, illegitimately availed of the bank's services and who, through the structure that was created, were out of the reach of the Irish tax authorities?</p></speech>

I do not know the answer to the Deputy's question about how the banking activities and operations of the business continued.  Obviously, the provision of services continued at that stage.  As I have mentioned, there was a settlement with Revenue in respect of any 1990s data issues associated with Irish customers which could not be resolved.</p></speech>

The number for 2008 was included in our opening statement because 2008 was definitely considered to be the start of the crisis in the financial position.</p></speech>

That is a judgment call by all of us.  The entire sentence, which refers to how deposits "declined rapidly" from the peak in 2008 to a low figure of &pound;191 million in 2012, gives us a certain impression.  We have information that the post-bailout peak was in 2010, which suggests that what Mr. Byrne is stating to this committee is not true.  Irish taxpayers pumped billions of euro into AIB in 2010, which makes it an important year.  The information we have is also held by Mr. Byrne.  He told me in response to my first question that he read Colm Keena's article.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-14a.1412" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017121400002#L03800"><p>He wrote quite an important one on this matter.  It refers to a document that was produced in 2011, in which "the offshore bank said it remained 'a key provider of funding for AIB' with deposit balances peaking at &pound;2.8 billion in June 2010", which is substantially higher than the figure claimed by Mr. Byrne.  The article goes on to note that "by April 2011, deposits had fallen to &pound;1.36 billion".  That is important because Mr. Byrne gave the impression that deposits declined rapidly after 2008.  The truth is that 2008 was not the peak.  During the nationalisation period, when people had to put their hands in their pockets and mothers and fathers had to say goodbye to their sons and daughters at Dublin Airport because of the financial crisis, we saw a peak in deposits in this offshore entity.  Some people might think that is insignificant, but I think it is very significant.  Has AIB looked at that?  It has many staff members.  I assume some of them have looked at Colm Keena's article.  I have asked whether the bank disputes any of the facts set out in it.  Is this one of the facts that it disputes?  Perhaps it simply does not know whether this fact is the truth.</p></speech>

I do not ascribe the same level of significance to it, or I had not done so up until this point.  I am thinking about a different perspective from the perspective the Deputy is thinking about.  I will take it away.  We will look at what the peak was.</p></speech>

As I said in my opening statement, the reason for this was to encourage anyone who could and would be willing to come forward to create the beginning of the process, which ultimately resulted in the Revenue raising the &euro;1 billion mentioned by the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners.  I think he was simply following a request, which appears sensible in the context of encouraging people to make a qualified disclosure.  That is a system that exists under the Taxes Acts and it has been used many times in many circumstances effectively to start a process of encouraging people to come forward.  I understand that not that long ago, Revenue initiated a similar process in respect of overseas accounts in different jurisdictions.  It is part of the Revenue toolkit.  I did not read much more into it than that but perhaps my perspective is incorrect.</p></speech>

Mr. Byrne mentioned that his objective today is to talk about the future and what is happening now, which I believe.  However, that is not my objective.  What is important is that we establish to what extent AIB facilitated tax avoidance and tax evasion and thereby a substantial robbery of the public purse.</p> <p>  Mr. Byrne referred in his opening statement to the establishment of the offshore presence in the Isle of Man and Jersey in 1977 and 1981 and he said that the rationale for establishing this offshore presence was to support the bank's growing business franchise in Britain and the United States and to meet the banking needs of the increasing international workforce.  Was that really the rationale for the establishment of those offshore entities?  Jersey and the Isle of Man have populations of approximately 80,000 and 160,000 respectively.  What is special about them is that they are jurisdictions that have extensive banking secrecy laws and so I believe that the primary rationale for establishing those entities was to facilitate tax avoidance and tax evasion.</p></speech>

People who travelled and operated in different jurisdictions used it as a location.  I will return to the piece which I know the Deputy will not like, namely, that is what existed at that point in time.  That is the rationale that exists in terms of documentation that exists around why it was established.  I was not there.  It is not part of where the business is, as I see it, going forward.  I am not sure of the benefit.  I have a different view in that regard but I do not have access to a pile of data about what happened in 1977.</p></speech>

Surely that is the most obvious explanation for the approach they took in terms of secrecy of their clients and the data.</p></speech>

Sorry, I do not think we knew the time period to which the Deputy was referring.  The point is still true, which is that the data owner has the overall obligation, kept it and has a legal obligation in that respect.  It is important to point out that the Legislature has thought of this point and the only reason that High Court orders exist in respect of the data is to balance and recognise in law the requirement that a High Court judge can sit and determine whether it is appropriate that the owner of data of interest to the Revenue be entitled to pass them on to the Revenue.  It is not an unusual principle.  All legal systems have a principle addressing the protection of data.</p></speech>

The strategic intent was that the offshore businesses were non-core.  That then became a detailed implementation plan decision at the end of December 2011, which I have discussed, which then rolled into 2012.  As that decision was coming and was given to local management, they put in a position paper stating they believed the entity could have an existence and a viable future.  It may be in that context that that piece is coming out of the documentation, although I am not sure of that.  However, the view of local management was not supported by the group and was not followed.  It is not unusual for the management of a subsidiary with 300 employees that was about to be closed down to say they think there is a future for the business.  However, it did not become policy or a position for the group.</p></speech>

We deal with this issue regularly in terms of banking positions.  For example, our UK banking entity, which is based in London, is subject to the Prudential Regulation Authority, PRA, and UK law.  There is a very clear code, which applies for all Crown jurisdictions, regarding the independence of mind in respect of subsidiary activities.  It is part of the regulatory obligations.  The entity exists and has a legal personality and a form.  It has rights, responsibilities and obligations.  Data is one of those.  I understand the point the Deputy is making; it is not that I do not understand it.  Unfortunately, however, the law is the law in respect of that issue and it is different.  Subsidiaries exist and they have to obey the law.</p></speech>

Deputy Pearse Doherty said that the peak in those offshore accounts went up from &euro;2.4 billion in 2008 to &euro;2.8 billion by 2010.  Would it be fair to say that at the time the banks would have been scrambling for deposits, the bank would have to get deposits from wherever it could and that it still kept getting deposits into those offshore accounts?</p></speech>

No matter what deposit base was in the Isle of Man it could not be flowed and used as a funding vehicle after that date for regulatory reasons in those countries.  It would not matter what the balance was because, effectively, the local regulator said one cannot upstream those deposits.</p></speech>

In terms of the liquidity position of the bank, in 2008 and 2009 there were no specific liquidity requirements as there are now, so they would not have been included.  If we were to rerun the calculations today they probably would be included.  Deposits generally would be included.  However, they would count in each separate legal entity and each separate licensed entity.  The Isle of Man would have its own liquidity requirement.  AIB Plc and AIB as an operating entity subject to the licence requirements of Ireland would have its own requirement, so they would not be grouped.  There is no group piece.</p></speech>

I am asking about policy in respect of access to information.  Mr. Byrne has made it clear that the Revenue Commissioners does not have reach into the data held by AIB in the Isle of Man.

On CAB, I do not know personally.  I will ask Ms Dooley to respond to that.  The second point still applies, which is that one is not allowed to make a comment either way in respect of anything to do with the CAB.  That is a legal obligation.  One cannot make a comment as to whether somebody is or is not subject to something.  That is my understanding of it.  The third point is that we referred to the fact that the Revenue Commissioners have other routes to access information as a result of protocols and agreements with the Isle of Man authorities.  The question we are answering is in respect of our ability, not the Revenue Commissioners' ability, to use other channels.  I do not know the position for other entities such as the CAB.</p></speech>

I was of the view, as were they, that it was AIB.  That is my recollection of the conversation, but the delegates say it was not AIB.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

At the time it became clear and was accepted that AIB and other banks were involved in tax avoidance of almost an industrial scale with their customers.  It was not a matter of conjecture but was proved to be the case.  As well as the debates we had at the Committee of Public Accounts in 2003 and 2004, it resulted in a change in the law.</p> <p>  The Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2004 made it an offence to aid and abet, conceal and counsel customers in tax avoidance and tax evasion, but I am not aware of any conviction arising from the Act since.  In actual fact, several years ago, relating to HSBC and deposits held in France, the then chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, Ms Josephine Feehily, made it clear that the 2004 Act was completely insufficient.  She made a point that tax inspectors would have to be standing beside the tax official and client to actually prove a case to the criminal level of proof required.  That is still the case with regard to our tax evasion laws.  I am not asking the delegates to comment on that matter as I am asking the wrong people the question.  However, perhaps the delegates have an opinion on the current tax law, as it pertains to bank officials and tax evasion generally.</p></speech>

We believe we comply with all of the laws in place.  Our objective is to ensure we are compliant and encourage customers to be compliant.  We do not offer tax advice and it has not been part of our business structure for quite a while.  If we find evidence that people are doing it, it is not part of our policy, but they will be subject to normal internal disciplinary procedures.  It is not what we are about and it is not worth trying to target or do.  We comply with the law and our objective is encourage compliance.</p></speech>

Even though the law was changed based on the work we did in 2003, I am dubious about the efficacy and utility of the Act passed in 2004.  That has been verbalised by the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners since.</p></speech>

We issue in the region of 5,000 suspicious transaction reports a year, based on the methodology and the application of principles whereby we say it is a matter of which Revenue or the Garda needs to be aware.</p></speech>

This is not directed at Mr. Byrne or his bank.  However, I am not sure why people are surprised when it comes to continuing tax evasion and tax avoidance as it pertains to certain financial institutions.  We need to go back and take a look at the laws which govern this area.  Certainly, when it comes to the Revenue Commissioners, they are still of the opinion that the laws are not sufficient when it comes to governing the entire area.</p></speech>

At the last count, we had 120 companies in the group which grew by one this week when the new holding company was established.  I accept that 121 companies is a lot.  The reasons largely stem from the past when we acquired many entities.  There was also a practice in the past that if activity did not require to be undertaken under a banking licence, it was included in a separate subsidiary.  That is not the practice we follow today.  We intend to undertake an exercise to simplify the structure and reduce the number of subsidiaries.  Of the 121, probably 100 are in Ireland.</p></speech>

The EBS still has its own banking licence as part of a regulated entity.  Both the EBS and AIB have subsidiaries, some of which provide mortgage finance.  To comply with certain elements of legislation in including mortgages in certain structures to obtain finance, we each have subsidiaries in that respect.  As a result, they can build.  One of our tasks - it has not been highest on the list - is to go through some of them and remove dormant entities.</p></speech>
