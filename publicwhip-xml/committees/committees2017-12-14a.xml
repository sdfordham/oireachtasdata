Apologies have been received from Deputies Pat Deering, Mary Lou McDonald and Alan Kelly.</p><p>The first item on the agenda is the minutes of the meeting of 30 November 2017.  Are they agreed?  Agreed.  Are there any matters arising?  As there are no matters arising we will move on to correspondence.  There are three categories of correspondence.  Category A is the briefing documents and opening statements.  Is it agreed that we note those?  Agreed.</p><p>No. 984A,<b></b>from Department of Finance, is the opening statement for today's meeting.  Is it agreed that we note and publish it?  Agreed.</p><p>Next we have correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow-up to PAC meetings and other items for publishing.  No. 963B was carried over from last week's meeting.  It is<b></b>from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, and provides additional information that was sought at the committee meeting on 16 November 2017 in relation to education and training boards, ETBs.  We have received a considerable amount of information which has been circulated.  I suggest we hold this over again until the new year.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>No. 965B was carried over from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills and is dated 4 December 2017.  It provides further details as requested by the committee regarding the progress made in relation to the contributions being made by religious congregations <font color="#00201F">towards the costs incurred by the State in responding to residential institutional child abuse.</font>This is an ongoing process so we will request the Department to keep the committee updated on this.  Deputy Connolly may wish to comment on the information that has been provided.</p></speech>

A number of buildings are outstanding under both schemes, namely, the 2002 scheme and the 2009 scheme.</p></speech>

Agreed.</p><p>No. 969B is<b></b>from Mr. Paul Quinn, chief procurement officer, Office of Government Procurement, and is dated 5 December 2017.  It provides a note on the purchase-to-pay card system, as requested by the committee at the meeting on 16 November 2017 in response to a reference to the system by Sean Ashe, the CEO of the Kildare and Wicklow ETB.  The correspondence states the system is particularly useful where a public body has a high volume of low value purchases where otherwise there would be a considerable volume of purchase requisitions, purchase orders and invoices, among other documentation.  The system seeks to reduce costs for public bodies and suppliers and ensure prompt payment to suppliers.  Is it agreed that we note that and publish it?  Agreed.</p><p>No. 971B is from Graham Doyle, Secretary General, Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and is dated 6 December 2017.  It provides information as requested by the committee on the cost of St. Francis Bridge which is part of the Kilkenny central access scheme.  I propose to send this reply to the correspondent who raised the matter.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>No. 973B is from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills.  It is dated 6 December 2017 and relates to the legislative basis for the employment of teachers.  This information is in response to a request from the committee for information regarding the terms and conditions of employment of State employees and in particular teachers who are paid by the State but are not directly employed by the State.  I propose to forward the reply to the correspondent who made the inquiry and members may wish to study the document.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>

Nos. 974B and 980B are two items of correspondence from multinational companies which I propose we hold over for the moment and come back to when we have all of the correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>No. 975B<b></b>is from Ms Carol Hanney, chief executive of the City of Dublin ETB and is dated 7 December 2017.  It provides follow-up as requested by the committee at the meeting with the ETBs on 16 November 2017.  The information provided includes a breakdown of fees and travel expenses; a note on the key performance indicators in place and how they are managed and; a note on the training provided to staff at the level of higher executive officer and upwards and school principals on corporate governance.  Is it agreed that we note and publish this?  Agreed.</p><p>No. 976B is from Ms Angela Black, chief executive of the Citizens Information Board, and is dated 8 December 2017.  It is in relation to information requested by the committee regarding the restructuring of the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budget Service, MABS.  In summary, the decision to restructure MABS into eight regional companies was made on 15 February 2017, following a feasibility study in September 2014 and a decision by the board in November 2014 to restructure MABS and citizen information services to provide better governance arrangements for 51 MABS services and 42 citizen information service companies across the country.</p><p>According to the note, service users will not see any change in the services they receive and they will go to the same place, be looked after by the same people and get the same level of service as they currently receive.  Deputy Aylward raised the matter but he is not present.  Does anyone else wish to comment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-14a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017121400002#B01700"><p>His concerns are not just unique to one location.  There is a general concern about this but obviously a decision has already been taken.  The concern is about the loss of the local connection but as the decision has already been taken I do not think there is a lot we can do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-14a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017121400002#B01800"><p>We have two options.  We can hold over this matter.</p></speech>

In fairness to Deputy Aylward, it would be good if we could hold over this matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-14a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017121400002#B02000"><p>Is that agreed?  Agreed.  No. 977B is from Ms Fionuala McGeever, chief executive of Tipperary ETB.  It is dated 8 December 2017 and provides follow-up as requested by the committee at the meeting with ETBs on 16 November 2017.  Matters dealt with include Ferryhouse school, key performance indicators, use of a building in Thurles and details of corporate governance training for staff.  Is it agreed that we note this?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 981B is dated 12 December 2017.  It is from Mr. Des Carville, head of the shareholding and financial advisory division in the Department of Finance in relation to our meeting scheduled for today and difficulties caused by a High Court action on the IBRC liquidation.  I propose we just note the item for the moment and deal with the matter in that part of the meeting.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 982B is dated 12 December 2017 and is from Deputy Marc MacSharry on the correspondence just referred to from the Department of Finance.  Likewise, I propose we deal with this in that part of the meeting dealing with the IBRC liquidation.  Is Deputy MacSharry happy to do that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-14a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1346" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017121400002#B02100"><p>That is perfect.  We can do it altogether.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-14a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017121400002#B02200"><p>Correspondence 985B (i) and (ii) is dated 13 December 2017.  It is a copy of a letter from the Department of Finance to the IBRC special liquidators.  Again, I propose that we note it and discuss all of that correspondence when we get to that part of the meeting.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  We now move on to category C, correspondence from and related to private individuals and any other correspondence.</p><p>Item No. 964C of 4 December 2017 relates to an incident in the Irish Prison Service in 1988.  The individual was dismissed from the service in 1989, the committee requested the Minister for Justice to respond to previous correspondence from this individual and when the reply from the Minister, reference 923C, was considered on 24 November 2017 it was agreed to send a reply to the individual.  The Minister in his correspondence encouraged the individual to make information that he had in regard to the murder of a prison officer available to the Garda.  The individual has been in touch again with the secretariat and today&rsquo;s item is additional information in relation to his general situation.  While we are sympathetic to the individual&rsquo;s case, we have sought and got a clear response from the Minister which we have passed on to the individual.  It is not within our remit to take the matter of an individual&rsquo;s dismissal from his employment further.  I propose that we write to the individual accordingly.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> Correspondence item No. 968C is from Ms Orla O'Connor, National Women's Council of Ireland, dated 5 December 2017 in response to a request from the committee for information regarding its public funding.  Ms O&rsquo;Connor states that the audited accounts, which are audited by independent auditors, are approved by the membership every year at the AGM.  The matter which an individual had raised with the committee was whether it was permissible for the National Women&rsquo;s Council to use public funds to fund a pro-choice campaign.  The correspondence from Ms O'Connor does not directly address that issue and I suggest we write to her for clarification.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> Correspondence item No. 970C from Mr. Padraig Corkery, communications and public affairs manager, NAMA, dated 5 December 2017, regards further information requested by the committee in relation to a hotel in Kinsale, County Cork.  I propose to send this reply to the original correspondent and to advise the correspondent that the committee&rsquo;s consideration of the matter is closed.  Is that agreed? Agreed.</p><p> Correspondence item 978C(i) and (ii) is a copy of correspondence sent to Deputy Andrew Doyle, Minister of State, from an individual received on 8 December 2017 regarding public funding of the Irish Horse Welfare Trust.  The secretariat had previously written to the Department of Agriculture on this and will follow the matter up.  Can we note the correspondence?  Noted.</p><p> Correspondence item No. 979C is from councillors R&eacute;ada Cronin and Nicola Lawless, members of Kildare and Wicklow ETB, dated 24 November 2017 in relation to our meeting with Kildare and Wicklow ETB on 16 November 2017.  They raise concerns about evidence given to the committee at the meeting.  I propose to forward this correspondence to Dr. Richard Thorn and request him to address it in his briefing to the committee when we meet him in the new year and which we have put into our work programme.</p></speech>

It was agreed that we would put it in our work programme.  We intend to meet him after he has completed his report.  We can talk to him about his published report at that stage.  There are three items we are hoping to discuss with Dr. Thorn, namely, the report; issues in respect of the University of Limerick; and the advice he gave to the CEO and chair of Kildare and Wicklow ETB.</p></speech>

My understanding is that Dr. Thorn is continuing with his work.  Previous correspondence from councillors and members of the board has been forwarded to him and there is more information today, which will be sent on.  We are not going to meet him until after his report has been completed.  One of the areas of concern we have is over his interaction with members of the ETB.  Are we happy for him to continue with his work and to meet him afterwards, or could we write to the Department expressing a concern about the process?</p></speech>

On the screen now are five accounts and statements received since the last meeting, on 7 December 2017.  We can take them individually or simply note and agree them.  Regarding University College Dublin, the document is dated 30 September 2016 and the relevant sum is &euro;480 million.  There is a clear audit opinion but attention is drawn to the recognition of a deferred pension funding asset standing for universities and non-competitive procurement, of &euro;8.5 million, of goods and services.  I propose that we seek an explanation note on both of those items and write to those concerned directly.</p></speech>

It is the same issue that arises with all the universities.  We should deal with the second.</p></speech>

The second item is where the statement on internal financial control discloses non-competitive procurement above a certain threshold.  We draw attention to that in the audit report.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-14a.65" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017121400002#D00600"><p>This comes up time and again.  It is an issue we have addressed in general terms as a committee.  Every time it arises, we should certainly follow up with correspondence and ask for an explanation as why there is non-competitive procurement.  It is important to do so.  On both issues, particularly the second, we can stress the importance of an explanation and seek one.  Is that agreed?</p> <p>  The position on Ollscoil na h&Eacute;ireann, Gaillimh, is similar.  There was a clear audit opinion but, again, attention is drawn to the recognition of a deferred pension funding asset and non-competitive procurement, of &euro;600,000, of goods and services.  Again, I propose that we write to the college and seek an explanation.</p></speech>

Perhaps it is a small percentage overall.  We will not know until we examine the figures again.  It is about perception, however.  People on the ground supplying services must have confidence in the system.  It is important that we follow up on this regardless of the amount.</p></speech>

The remaining three accounts concern the Arts Council, Cavan and Monaghan Education and Training Board and Tipperary Education and Training Board.  In respect of all three, there is a clear audit opinion.  Can we note and agree these?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The draft work programme for 2018 is on the screen.  I propose that we have a further discussion later today as there are a couple of items related to our work programme that we will deal with in private session.  I am sure the Chairman would like to be in the Chair when we deal with the work programme.  Is it agreed to come back to that later?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Unless there is any other business before we move to the substantial part of the meeting, we will suspend for a few minutes to allow our witnesses from the Department of Finance to take their seats.</p></speech>

We are joined by the following officials from the Department of Finance: Mr. Des Carville, Assistant Secretary, head of the shareholding and advisory division; Mr. Gary Tobin, Assistant Secretary, banking division; Mr. Scott Rankin, deputy head of the shareholding and advisory division; Mr. Gary Hynds, principal officer, equivalent, shareholding and advisory division; Mr. Eoin Dorgan, principal officer, banking division; and Mr. David Tuohy, shareholding and advisory division.  They are all very welcome.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off.</p><p>I advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 186 that the committee shall also refrain from enquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.</p><p>There is an item we wish to bring to witnesses' attention before we proceed.  There were a number of items of correspondence this week on today's meeting that the committee noted earlier.  One was received on Tuesday from the Department in regard to our consideration of the liquidation of IBRC.  The Department advises us that the matter is now before the High Court.  As a result, the Department informed us it could not discuss the liquidation and that because of the case, the liquidators would not be in attendance.</p><p>However, we wrote to the liquidators again yesterday, insisting that it should attend, but it has written to say that it is adhering to its legal advice and cannot attend at present.  This will be an issue of concern for some members, so I propose that if members want to raise issues on those items of correspondence as part of their contributions they can be given extra time and latitude.  We will not count it as a separate item but will deal with it in the contributions they make.  Is that agreed?  </p></speech>

The economic impacts of the measures are both complex and long term.  Chapter 3 was compiled to provide an estimate, as at end-2016, of the net financial cost of the measures.  The chapter updates a previous report which gave the position as at the end of 2014.</p> <p>  The sums involved in recapitalising banks, including covering their losses, are relatively straightforward to identify.  Income accruing from the investments, and capital repayments or disposals of investments, are also generally clear.  Less easy to identify are the costs incurred by the State in funding the investments, which are substantial.  Estimation procedures are required to identify those funding costs, and in arriving at a valuation of the State's residual interest in banking assets. </p> <p>  The results of the examination analysis are summarised in figure 3.1 in the chapter.  The overall investment in the banks, including the value of shares accepted in lieu of dividends, totalled &euro;66.8 billion.  That resulted in additional State borrowing and the utilisation of State investment funds, at an estimated cost of &euro;14.8 billion up to the end of 2016.  Against that were receipts totalling just over &euro;25 billion from disposals of shares, income from the investments, fees for bank liability guarantees and related Central Bank surpluses. </p> <p>  By the end of 2016, the estimated net cost to the State of measures taken to stabilise the banking system was &euro;56.5 billion.  When the estimated value at that date of the State&rsquo;s remaining shareholdings in the banks and NAMA&rsquo;s projected surplus are taken into account, the estimated net outturn is a cost of around &euro;39.9 billion.</p> <p>  After taking account of the estimated residual value of the State&rsquo;s holdings in the financial institutions, the estimated net outturn, as at 31 December 2016, for each institution is as shown in figure 1.</p> <p>  We estimated that, up to 31 December 2016, support for the IBRC had cost the State a net &euro;35.8 billion, support for AIB had cost a net &euro;7.9 billion, support for Permanent TSB cost a net &euro;1 billion, and there was a net surplus of &euro;1.8 billion in respect of the State&rsquo;s support for Bank of Ireland.</p> <p>  The projected &euro;3 billion in receipts arising from the winding up of NAMA offsets a part of those net losses but cannot be attributed across the rescued institutions.  I emphasise that all those estimates are at a point in time, and that the final cost of the measures will not be identifiable for some time to come.  In particular, the cost of servicing residual banking-related State debt will be an ongoing economic cost.  It is estimated that this cost will be around &euro;1.7 billion for 2017.  In the longer term, this cost is estimated at between &euro;1 billion and &euro;1.4 billion annually, if the State&rsquo;s average cost of borrowing is in the range 2.5% to 3.5% a year.  To put that in context, the NTMA&rsquo;s average cost of borrowing was around 3% at end June 2017.</p> <p>  Of course, other factors will also be at play in determining the final overall cost of the stabilisation measures.  These will include the amount the State ultimately realises from the disposal of its remaining bank investments, and the period for which the Central Bank continues to hold Government bonds related to redemption of the IBRC promissory notes.</p></speech>

With me this morning are Mr. Gary Tobin, Assistant Secretary General in the banking division in the Department of Finance, Mr. Scott Rankin, deputy head of the shareholding and financial advisory division, Mr. Gary Hynds, senior banking specialist in the shareholding and financial advisory division, Mr Eoin Dorgan, principal officer in the banking division, and Mr. David Tuohy, banking specialist in the shareholding and financial advisory division.</p> <p>  I will focus on chapter 3 of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report on the accounts of the public service 2016.  Chapter 3 of this report deals with the cost of the banking stabilisation measures as at year end 2016.  From its invitation to the Department of Finance, I understand that the committee particularly wished to discuss the special liquidation of IBRC and specifically the costs incurred as part of the liquidation.  However, as per my letter to the committee dated 12 December 2017, having consulted with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, unfortunately we are not in a position to respond to queries concerning the costs associated with the special liquidation given that these matters are now the subject of dispute in the High Court awaiting determination.  This is as a result of the Department of Finance being served with a plenary summons on 8 December 2017 seeking declaratory reliefs against the Minister for Finance with regard to a number of matters pertaining to the terms and conditions of remuneration and expenses of the special liquidators and their oversight by the Department.  We have shared the plenary summons with the committee so it will appreciate its scope.  While the special liquidators were due to attend with us today, their legal advice is that it would not be appropriate for them to be present.  We have shared the correspondence between the Department and the special liquidators in this regard with the committee for full transparency.</p> <p>  We are very disappointed and frustrated that we are not able to discuss the costs of the liquidation as this is a topic in which we invest considerable efforts to ensure that the taxpayer is getting value for money.  We warmly welcome the committee&rsquo;s interest in this topic as we recognise that the absolute quantum of fees are, on the face of it, large.  It was for this reason that in 2014 the first of four detailed reports were published to provide transparency on the work streams associated with the special liquidation and the associated costs of each of these work streams.</p></speech>

The gross cost of recapitalising the banking system during the period 2009-2011 stands at &euro;66.8 billion, which was funded through a combination of funding from the Exchequer and National Pension Reserve Fund.  Taking into account the cost of servicing the debt to end of 2016 of &euro;14.8 billion and the income earned on investments to the end of 2016 of &euro;25.1 billion, the net cost estimated by the Comptroller and Auditor General was &euro;56.5 billion as at the end of 2016.  When the estimated value at that date of the State&rsquo;s remaining shareholdings in AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB - a combined &euro;13.6 billion - and NAMA&rsquo;s projected surplus of &euro;3 billion are taken into account, the estimated net outturn at the end of 2016 is a cost of around &euro;39.9 billion.  This shows a reduction of approximately &euro;3 billion since this analysis was last conducted at the end of 2014, which reflects additional receipts of &euro;5 billion and the recognition of the estimated &euro;3 billion surplus now expected when NAMA winds down in 2020.  This was offset by the increase in the cost of debt servicing associated with these investments by &euro;6.1 billion over the period. </p> <p>  At the end of 2016 the value in the State&rsquo;s shareholdings in the three quoted banks was &euro;13.6 billion.  Since then the State realised &euro;3.4 billion from the initial public offering, IPO, of AIB in June this year leaving it with a 71% remaining shareholding in that bank.  The IPO of AIB was managed by the Department and was the second largest IPO globally in 2017, the largest in Europe in 2017 and the largest on the London Stock Exchange since 2011 as measured by the level of funds raised.</p><p>As of the close of business on 12 December 2017, the market value of our remaining investments in these banks stood at &euro;12.4 billion, indicating a net increase in the value of our shareholdings since the end of 2016 of almost &euro;2.2 billion when the proceeds from the AIB IPO are taken into consideration.</p><p> In respect of banking stabilisation-related Central Bank income, for the years 2009 to 2016 the examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General has estimated that in the region of &euro;7.7 billion of the Central Bank's surplus income of &euro;12.5 billion was attributable to financial instruments held as a result of banking stabilisation measures taken by the State.  These financial instruments were in the form of exceptional liquidity assistance and Government bonds held by the Central Bank.  The report estimates that 97% of the &euro;7.7 billion portion of the Central Bank&rsquo;s surplus income for the years 2009 to 2016 is attributable to transactions between the Central Bank and IBRC. </p><p> Subsequent to the liquidation of IBRC in February 2013, the Central Bank acquired just over &euro;25 billion of floating rate notes, FRNs, and &euro;3.46 billion of fixed rate treasury bonds.  Between 2013 and 2016, the Central Bank earned net interest of &euro;2.7 billion from the bonds and realised gains of &euro;3.2 billion from the disposal of some of these bonds.  The Central Bank stated in its 2016 annual report that it intends to sell the remaining floating rate bonds as soon as possible, provided conditions of financial stability permit. </p><p> As at 13 December 2017, the bank has so far disposed of &euro;9.5 billion nominal of the floating rate notes, significantly exceeding its minimum targets outlined in 2013.  While the pace of these disposals is significantly ahead of the minimum schedule, it is positive that the NTMA is locking in current low market rates now rather than some time in the future, at which point rates could be higher.  Furthermore, the cancellation of these bonds will also increase the amount of Irish debt that the ECB can purchase in the sovereign debt markets, which should help in further reducing the cost of the State&rsquo;s borrowing.  Notwithstanding these positives, clearly this acceleration needs to balance the negative consequences of the purchase and cancellation which includes the potential creation of excess supply in the market and the forgoing to the State of ongoing Central Bank profits related to these bonds. </p><p> The debt-related cost to the State associated with the investments in the bank was in the region of &euro;14.8 billion over the period 2009 to 2016.  These costs are estimated by the Comptroller and Auditor General and reflect the additional annual debt servicing costs and other related costs incurred by the State as a result of the borrowings used to invest in the banks. </p><p> The Comptroller and Auditor General highlights that the Exchequer continues to incur the cost of servicing the debt associated with the net &euro;56.5 billion cost of the investments in the banks and the report estimates that this cost is likely to be in the region of &euro;1.7 billion for 2017 with over &euro;1 billion of this in respect of IBRC and a further &euro;0.6 billion in respect of AIB.  The ongoing annual cost of servicing the debt associated with Permanent TSB is estimated at around &euro;50 million per annum.  The State has recouped its investment in Bank of Ireland and therefore incurs no ongoing debt servicing costs in respect of Bank of Ireland.</p><p> The long-term cost of servicing the debt associated with the bank investments will depend on a number of factors, including the amount the State realises from its remaining investments; the period for which the Central Bank continues to hold government bonds; and the cost of funding for the State as it refinances existing debt when it matures.  The State guaranteed certain bank liabilities under three main schemes, namely, the deposit guarantee scheme, the credit institutions (financial support) scheme, and the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme.  By the end of 2016, the State had received net income in the region of &euro;3.7 billion under the schemes with the majority of this relating to the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme.  Included in this figure is &euro;280 million received as an interim dividend from the special liquidators of IBRC and it is expected a second interim dividend of &euro;280 million will be received in the next few weeks following the announcement last week of a further 25% payment to admitted unsecured creditors of IBRC. </p><p> In respect of NAMA, its board has approved a projected terminal surplus of up to &euro;3 billion over the course of its life, which is dependent on favourable market conditions being maintained when realising remaining assets.  This surplus will be paid to the Exchequer to reduce the overall cost of banking stabilising measures. </p><p> I thank the Chairman and committee for their attention.  I hope members will appreciate that the stance adopted by the Department today is in the interests of protecting the position of the State in the proceedings that have been brought against it.  I would welcome any follow-on questions.</p></speech>

There were two pieces of correspondence that came in after I had emailed my concerns on 13 December.  What times on the 13th did they come in?  There was one from the Department of Finance, I think, and one from IBRC, the joint special liquidators.  Which one came at 15:57?  Was that the one from the Department?</p></speech>

The other letter came in on the 12th, informing us of the plenary summons seeking declaration reliefs.  From my layman's point of view, and I stand to be corrected if I am wrong, a declaration relief is where the Minister is not being sued for money or such recourse.  If the person wins the case, the court will make declarations to do with how the liquidation is going.  Costs is what the State would lose in the event that the person wins the case.  It is unfortunate they took it last Thursday.</p> <p>  When I wrote to raise issues, I wanted to know if we had invited the special joint liquidators individually.  I think we did not do so, which is unfortunate.  That was what I intended when I raised this last September.  The Department of Finance replied on 12 December saying it that in light of developments, the special liquidators would not be coming either.  Then we have this email going in and the timing of it.  To me, it looks choreographed.  I raised the question of why the Department is telling the special liquidators what to do.  It is matter for them if they come in.  They are not party to these proceedings.  They are not named in the proceedings against the Minister.  They should be here.</p> <p>  It was implied that the Attorney General was advising them and I raised that point.  Then, lo and behold, we got a letter saying they had their own legal advice but they understood the Attorney General was advising the Department of the same.  It looks grubby.  It looks like there is collusion between the three.  Frankly, as is so often the case these days, it looks like this is being used as a device for bodies that are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General to opt not to answer questions.</p> <p>  While I appreciate on a personal level Mr. Carville's saying he is disappointed he cannot talk about this, I have steam coming out my ears when I hear him say so.  The practice we see here is one of avoidance, with bodies saying they cannot answer our questions.  Maybe Mr. Carville is being absolutely genuine and I will take him at his word.  However, we had education and training boards, ETBs, coming in here saying they would not say anything because of legal advice.  We had the Acting Garda Commissioner saying he would not talk about a liaison committee.  We had a previous Garda Commissioner referring something to GSOC late at night to avoid answering questions on an issue here.</p> <p>  The Government may as well abolish the Committee of Public Accounts for the disdain and contempt with which it is frequently treated.  Ultimately, our responsibility here is not votes.  There are not many votes going for being on the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is about putting in hours of reading and research to try to pursue things that have nothing to do with one's constituency.</p><p>It is about taxpayers' money and, in this instance, it is about &euro;222 million of taxpayers' money as of the end of 2016.  Mr. Carville is disappointed that the liquidators cannot come in.  I am bound to conclude that there was collusion between the Office of the Attorney General, the Department of Finance and the special liquidators to come in today and say how disappointed they are that something cannot be discussed.  There was no stopping whoever it was in the Department who yesterday rushed to tell the <i>Irish Independent</i>that everything was perfect - a Department official was quoted in an article by Shane Phelan - yet nothing can be said today.  I have a serious problem with this.  The new way of avoiding questions when appearing at the Committee of Public Accounts is simply to say that one has legal advice and cannot say anything.  It is a disgraceful abuse of that term in the Civil Service and in Departments.  It is so often the practice.  What would one say in here when explaining the expenditure of taxpayers' money that one would not say in the courts?  The Department has its legal advice from the Attorney General.  The joint special liquidators are saying they have their legal advice.  I have mine too.  <br/><br/>Notwithstanding what the Chair might tell me as we go, I will proceed to ask my questions.  In the event that I am ruled out of order, I will be ruled out of order.  However, I see no reason that any question I am about to ask the witness should not be answered.  There is no reason whatsoever.  I would like him to take that on board.  I would also like him to bring back to Merrion Street that I for one, as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts for however long I will be here, will not be putting up with the constant disdain and contempt being shown for this committee, the only constitutional committee of the State where witnesses are under the auspices of the Comptroller and Auditor General and where it is our job to ask questions of them.  I know the answer to this but, for the record, why is the Secretary General, the Accounting Officer, not here? </p></speech>

This is very important.  We negotiate contracts with service providers, for example, investment banks.  Let us use that as an example.  It is a good example because it is similar to hiring an accountancy firm such as KPMG.  If we agree certain terms and conditions for a specific contract, it could become a race to the bottom if that contract was publically available.  The next investment bank or service provider coming to us would look for those terms and try to chip on those terms again.  I am not convinced that is in the interests of taxpayers.</p></speech>

Do we have oversight in the Department?  Let me put it a different way.  Is there expertise in the Department that could challenge something like that?  Could someone in the Department decide that a team of three partners and two juniors on a case is too much and that one partner and one junior, or an accounts clerk or one basic chartered accountant would be enough?  Does the Department have expertise to challenge that?</p></speech>

I asked all of these questions in the parliamentary questions I tabled in September.  I got no answers in terms of scrutiny, and this was before any case.  That led me to believe there was no scrutiny, particularly without a committee of inspection.  I have no reason to think the situation has changed despite the fine expertise of KPMG, the same firm as the liquidator.  It is a great firm.  The Minister responded and stated should the officials have any queries related to the professional fees associated with the liquidator or other costs incurred the matter would be raised during these update meetings.  There are update meetings with the liquidators.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

We can issue directions to the special liquidators.  My understanding from memory is if we have a problem with a fee we can issue a direction.  We are effectively like the High Court or the Taxing Master.  That is my understanding.

We discuss things on a more formal basis at the regular scheduled meetings.  It would be natural to expect that to include fees.</p></speech>

When they were appointed, the liquidators had expectations or budgets on costs, and when I think back the work was actually much more complex than any of us envisaged.

It is not the rates per hour.  We know those.  It is about how many people are working at those rates and who is checking the amount of people per task.  How many people are involved and how many hours are they putting into particular tasks, and who is checking that and scrutinising it?  In the absence of a committee of inspection I am not sure anybody is.  The case being taken prevented me getting the answers I wanted last Friday.  I received waffle answers to the 20 parliamentary questions I asked on 9 and 11 September, about having regular updates and meetings and if the Department has issues it can raise them there, and about commercially sensitive stuff that the people are entitled to know, even though we only know the cost per hour.  Because of the amount of money involved in this the public is entitled to an awful lot more, and the complexion and choreography of correspondence this week does not give me any confidence that there is not something to see here.  What have we got to hide?</p></speech>

That is why we have produced four very detailed reports.  If there was a committee of inspection, one would not get the equivalent level of information and detail.  As a Department, we are very keen on transparency and openness, which is why we have published four reports.</p></speech>

That is a problem when so much public money is involved.  The complexion on this is that the liquidator is paying itself from recoveries and sales.  It is writing its own cheque which the Minister signs off after the fact.  I know an informal process may exist involving a degree of horse trading on fees but Mr. Carville is telling the committee no direction to reduce fees has been issued to the liquidators.  They really pushed the boat out in terms of the bounds of their charitable instincts and give us a rebate of 2.5% on &euro;222 million.  I have serious problem with this and I would like to make a further contribution on it.</p> <p>  I reiterate that nothing I have said is personal.  Mr. Carville is the conduit on behalf of the Department and I have a job to do on behalf of citizens.  He should not take anything personally. </p></speech>

Mr. Carville stated that &euro;280 million was received in 2016 as an interim dividend, a further 25% payment will be made to the admitted unsecured creditors of IBRC and a further interim dividend of &euro;280 million will be received in the next few weeks.  This is all set out in the opening statement.  The intention to pay an interim dividend is in the public domain and the witnesses are able to discuss that issue.  However, they cannot discuss other matters.  Mr. Carville will accept that members of the public may have difficulty understanding the Jesuitical approach being taken.  I would like to tease this matter out with him.  I note from a letter received from the special liquidator yesterday that representatives of IBRC have been advised not to attend the committee.  The Department's letter essentially states that it is advised that officials from the Department will be available to discuss any other matter today.  Mr. Carville has been advised not to discuss the issue that is before the courts.</p></speech>

Has he been advised that it would better not to discuss it or has he been precluded from discussing it?  There is a big difference between being advised not to do something and being told one may not do something.  The Department has used the word "advised".  My interpretation is that the Attorney General has not told the Department it is precluded from discussing the matter.  I take the same reading from the letter from the special liquidator which refers to advice being given not to attend the meeting.  There is no indication that he is precluded from attending.  Some weeks ago, the chief executive of Wicklow and Kildare Education and Training Board indicated to the committee that he had received advice not to answer questions.  The legal adviser to the committee stated that while the chief executive may have received advice to that effect, he was certainly not precluded from answering questions.  Is Mr. Carville in the same category of having received advice but not being precluded from discussing the matter or has he been precluded from doing so?  Does he understand the difference I am making between being advised and being precluded?</p></speech>

The Chairman used the word "Jesuitical" and I would almost think, in response, that the distinction the Chairman is making is somewhat Jesuitical, with respect.

There is a difference between the two.  The education and training board also informed the committee last week that it had been advised not to answer questions, even though there was nothing to preclude it from doing so.

If I was in a car accident, my insurance company would take charge of the case and tell me not to discuss it.  That is the insurance company taking charge.  We understand the position.</p> <p>   I referred to the second sum of &euro;280 million.  Why is Mr. Carville free to discuss these commercial aspects of the liquidation when he is not free to discuss other aspects of it?  Where has the Department drawn the line between what it can discuss commercially and what information it can and cannot place in the public arena.  </p></speech>

The &euro;280 million which we received last year is a receipt from the special liquidators to the State as an unsecured creditor.  We are an unsecured creditor to about &euro;1.1 billion or &euro;1.2 billion.  The special liquidators have stated they intend or that their expectation is that unsecured creditor claims which are validly accepted by the special liquidators should expect to receive between 75% and 100% of that claim in due course.  This is subject to a whole raft of assumptions behind that.</p></speech>

I think it prejudices our position if we were to make that available because the next person doing something broadly similar would just look for the best possible terms and then try to chip us on other terms.  That becomes a downward spiral for us.</p></speech>

He gave the example of investment banks.  His principal rationale for claiming this is commercially sensitive is that there may be another liquidation or something major of this scale in future and he does not want to disclose this information in case it prejudices the State's negotiations the next time around.  This is a once-off case for which special legislation was introduced in the Oireachtas and on which the Minister has powers to supersede the normal creditors' committee.  Let us hope for everyone's sake that we do not have another one of these cases in our lifetimes.  I expect the Department will ensure this does not recur.</p> <p>  The rationale is that this commercially sensitive but there is nothing commercial sensitive.  It is commercial and there is no sensitivity involved because the fees are publicly available and the amounts to be paid should also be publicly available.  It does not have a knock-on effect because I cannot envisage a similar case arising again, whereas Mr. Carville can envisage another such case where this case could be used as the benchmark.  Is the reason this is commercially sensitive that another project of a similar scale could arise and releasing information now could jeopardise negotiations at a future date?  It is hardly the case that Mr. Carville is aware of such a case and we are not aware of it. </p></speech>

The other side has very sophisticated legal advisers behind it.  It is always trying to drive the best deal that it can get.  That is fine, because that is what it is entitled to do.

The Department only has two WTE staff and maybe a solicitor working on it.  Even if Mr. Carville tells me that one and a half solicitors are working on it, that does not change the complexion from where we sit.  He is telling us that everything the Department is doing is to protect the interests of the State in this liquidation, but the staffing complement gives us zero confidence that those interests as they relate to cost are being adequately protected.</p></speech>

I am satisfied that we have enough staff to deal with what we must do.</p> <p>  The 175 cases are managed by the special liquidators and legal advisers.  That was the number at the end of last year.  I will cite two figures.  One hundred and forty-three cases were pursued against the bank rather than the other way around.  As of yesterday, the 175 cases have decreased to 119.  The special liquidators are doing their job, that is, managing the way through to litigation.  From memory, the figure prior to 175 might have been as high as 500.  I have in mind a figure of 350.  The number has decreased rapidly.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-14a.372" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017121400002#M00200"><p>I also want to register serious concern about the committee not being able to discuss this issue today.  This has been on our work plan for some months.  When one looks at the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, not that one would need to, the one organisation that jumps off the page is IBRC in terms of the totality of what we are dealing with here.  We all know and accept that.  It is pretty exceptional and if it is ever repeated, I think I will be long gone.  One thing that was said around the time of the beef tribunal was that there would have been no need for that tribunal had questions been replied to.  I am looking at what has been sought in the courts - monetary remuneration, a transparent process, monitoring the remuneration and expenses sought for and paid, protecting the interests of the taxpayer, properly and effectively assessing and-or monitoring remuneration of the joint special liquidators' expenses sought and paid etc.  That is what we are looking for.  I do not know how the State can be protected by elongating that process, which is essentially what is happening.  If those issues were addressed, the case before the courts would be moot.  There would be nothing to answer.  I do not understand how the State is protected.  The length of time this will take in the courts is indeterminate but judging by the length of time it takes for cases to go through the courts, particularly a case like this one, we are likely to be looking at least 12 months during which time we will not have oversight.  The period could be even longer.  If this was addressed now, is the State not protected by virtue of the fact that we have transparency and we understand how remuneration is monitored?  I really do not understand the logic of that legal advice.  In the question posed by the Chairman regarding taking advice and whether the Department was restricted in terms of answering, there is real merit in coming back and actually answering those questions because it may short-circuit the process through the courts and engender far more confidence that the Department is dealing with this matter.  That is a comment as opposed to a question but will the Department at least undertake to go back and consider that point with legal advisers because it is not obvious what is being served by delaying this except that the Department answers the questions in the court that it will not answer before the Committee of Public Accounts?  Will the Department at least go back and have that discussion with its legal advisers and perhaps with the Minister?</p></speech>

I am trying to be helpful because we must defend this in due course.  I agree with things like the declaration that the each and all of the defendants have a duty to ensure there is a transparent process for accounting for the remuneration.  There are other ones where the State is accused of failing to do various things.  I disagree absolutely with those.  The Department is hugely frustrated because we really want to answer the committee's questions.  We have a really good story to tell here and we are hugely frustrated that we cannot communicate this today.</p> <p>  In respect of the second point, as this case evolves, we will continually reassess what the legal position is.  Let me try this hypothetical scenario.  Supposing the plaintiff was thinking of filing this claim today and had an opportunity to hear what we had to say before this committee today, I would like to think that the plaintiff might not file the case tomorrow because they would be satisfied today.  Unfortunately, the cart and horse just got transposed in a rather unfortunate way.  </p></speech>

There is an issue with transparency.  Will the Department will go back and talk to its legal advisers and perhaps the Minister about reconsidering the approach it is taking with the committee?

Mr. Carville said that it involved the equivalent of two people at the moment.  It was then stated that prior to that, at the height of it, it involved ten people.  I received documents from the Department under the freedom of information process.  They were heavily redacted but from what I could make out of the pieces I could read - this goes back to 2014 and 2015 - some of the terminology was that a number of very large transactions were poorly executed.  That was after the fact so there was history here relating to how things were handled.  The Department sought to put its own person on the board at that stage.  Then, of course, the liquidation happened.  There was some forewarning of the kind of supervisory role that should have been in place.  When the liquidation happened, and some of us were here until whatever hour of the morning it was dealing with the legislation which was very rushed, did the Department consider an oversight provision, for example, the same way as the Comptroller and Auditor General is embedded in NAMA?  Was that kind of thing considered or was the special liquidator the only thing that was considered?</p></speech>

The role of the special liquidator does not differ from that of a normal liquidator.  His responsibility is to deliver the best value for all creditors in a liquidation.  That is a tried and trusted structure that is in place.  The liquidator stepped into the role of running the bank and effecting transactions from that point on with that in mind, as well as that he has responsibilities to creditors.  We cannot get into the detail of the oversight or what the Department does on a day-to-day basis for the reasons set out in the statement of claim.</p></speech>

Documents I received relating to that period indicate that several very large transactions were poorly executed.  The Department did not cover itself in glory in respect of its supervision in that regard.  Mr. Hynds can understand why consideration might have been given to ensuring some added protection, even for the Department.  Was that considered?</p></speech>

That completely changed on the date of liquidation, when a liquidation phase began, a liquidator was appointed and our oversight changed in that respect.  It is difficult to compare the two periods in that manner.  The relationship framework no longer existed and the special liquidators, whose role was akin that of a normal liquidator governed by the High Court, were appointed.  Our role was to oversee that rather than the courts for reasons we will get into in due course but currently cannot because of the ongoing case.</p></speech>

According to Mr. Carville's opening statement, "it is expected a second interim dividend of &euro;280 million will be received in the next few weeks following the announcement last week of a further 25% payment to admitted unsecured creditors of IBRC".  Is that all unsecured creditors?  How many or which creditors were admitted and what was the basis for that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-14a.396" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Des Carville" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017121400002#N01300"><p>That is a good question.  There is a very involved process when a creditor puts in a claim.  Special liquidators must ensure that every claim is valid and that all of the paperwork stacks up and so on, which protects the interests of taxpayers.  I have the figures to hand in that regard.  The liquidators accepted 1,200 claims, rejected 1,000 and 800 are in progress.  Those figures are slightly rounded.  The most recent update report, issued at the end of February, indicated that 3,000 claims were received and I am just updating those numbers.  For the 1,200 accepted claims, if that is the accepted level as at the record date when the special liquidators decide to make the second payment, the creditor will receive 25% of its accepted claim.  Some creditors were not accepted when the first payment was made and will receive a catch-up payment to bring them to the 50% level.  As soon as a case of the 800 that are in progress is accepted, it will receive a catch-up payment to the 50% level.</p></speech>

The special liquidators have to assist the State in various ongoing criminal prosecutions and there are huge discovery exercises.  They have to assist the commission of investigation and there is an ongoing interest remediation exercise.  They also have to deal with the litigation to which I referred.  They have to sell the remaining &euro;3.5 billion worth of loans for whatever they happen to be worth.  The biggest swing factor is probably the litigation to which I referred.  We focus on the material bits of it because they will move the deal from the State's point of view.  We cannot predict beyond the fact that the figure is expected to be between 75% and 100%, but that is subject to change.</p></speech>

They have been accelerating the sale of the floating rate bonds and are ahead of schedule because of interest rates and the NTMA.  We never had the game changer which was related to the promissory notes.  Have we fully accepted this and has there been any challenge to it?  Is there any follow-up to the commitments that were made but never delivered on?  Is it now over for the Department or is it a political issue?</p></speech>

When it was mooted as a concept, the world was a different place.  We now have a different scenario in which, with the exclusion of IBRC, the shareholdings we have in the banks show on a paper basis a profit of &euro;1.6 billion.  A sum of &euro;64 billion was put into the banks.  We distinguish between the living and the dead, or liquidated banks, in that regard, of which the latter cost &euro;35 billion as per the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  A total of &euro;29.4 billion was put into the three living banks which are quoted.  We expect to get back more than &euro;29 billion; therefore, it offers a better outcome than retrospective recapitalisation would have.</p></speech>

Most of us understood the promissory notes represented money that was being extinguished.  That was the word used when some of us met the Governor of the Central Bank.  I am reminded that Ashoka Mody, one of the people involved on the IMF side in the negotiations for the troika, was quite critical of the way Ireland had been treated.  By turning the floating rate or promissory notes into sovereign debt, as we did in the D&aacute;il, although I did not vote in favour of it, is the Department giving up on any prospect of relief on that front?</p></speech>

The then Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, said in 2016 that the process had been brought to an end.  As Mr. Carville said, the returns achieved on the living banks would not justify the investment.  As the then Minister said, the process for dealing with the promissory notes reflected the best outcome for the State at the time.  A sales schedule has been set out, but it is a matter for the Central Bank to decide independently.  It has stated it is committed to disposing of the floating rate notes as soon as possible, provided financial stability conditions permit.</p></speech>

It is not a reflection on the witnesses but it is certainly a reflection of the Department.  I will come back to the general endorsement of claim that is being served and will pick up on a point made by Deputy Murphy on setting out the plaintiff's claim.  Mr. Carville agreed with two and he could not disagree with them.  There were only eight declarations sought and declarations Nos. 2 and 3 simply set out that the Department has a duty to properly and effectively analyse, assess and so on.  There is no problem with that, I presume.  There is also a declaration of a transparent process.  That leaves six to look at, and we can leave the further or other relief from costs.  From the eight declarations, two are conceded, which relate to duty.  That leaves us with the other few.  As my colleague has stated and I have said repeatedly in the D&aacute;il Chamber, if questions were answered we would not have tribunals of inquiry.  The Department has a duty, as it accepts in the declarations.  There is a duty to outline to members of this committee that there is value for money.  That is not happening at present.  The witnesses have taken a vow of <i>omerta</i>or silence on the basis of advice.  There is a duty to account to us value for money in everything the Department does.</p></speech>

I am not asking the witness to go through the document but I am referring to it because it is on my desk and the witnesses' desk.  It clearly put the cat among the pigeons.  That somebody would have to take a case to ensure accountability is a serious indictment of the failure of the Department of Finance to show it is open and accountable.  These are simple declarations.  The witnesses have acknowledged two of them and the Department must account for that.  Surely that should be part of the process.  The Chairman has already picked up the point about commercial sensitivity.</p> <p>  Let us spell out what we are talking about.  It is what I hope will be a once-off liquidation of this nature.  It refers to Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  Is that correct?  I like clear language.  We are talking about Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society in this new entity in liquidation.  Is that right?</p></speech>

We come back to value for money, which is the whole purpose of the Comptroller and Auditor General's chapter.  It deals with the cost of the banking stabilisation measures and value for money.

It seems to be set out there are serious costs in that regard and we are still paying them.  These are very simple questions and I tend to be kind of straight and simple, for want of a better word.  Figures and monetary terms can be used to overwhelm us.  A bank that existed for property speculation is still causing a huge financial cost in 2017.  Is that right?  Was it worth it and was there value for money?</p></speech>

It was a policy matter at the end of the day.  I will see if I can explain it to the Deputy as I can understand from where she is coming with the question.  It is a good way of looking at it.  We had a choice in that period of either bailing out the banks or not doing so.  The policy was to bail out all the banks and put the bank guarantee in place.  Ultimately, shareholdings would be taken in the banks and there would be investment in contingent convertible capital notes and preference shares etc.  The cost of that-----</p></speech>

I do not accept Mr. Carville's answer.  I do not expect him to go through this with me, but he accepts Nos. 2 and 3 concerning the duty and responsibility on the Department.  Arising from that duty and responsibility, he has to be able to set out to the committee, at any stage and well before a statement of claim, whether he is complying with that duty.

We have a problem with banks, in particular Anglo Irish Bank.  At some stage the Government nationalised the bank, something it could never do before, which is interesting.  It could nationalise a bank to take on debt but not for us to get a benefit from it.  That is a story for another day.  It might be a cause for reflection in the Department of Finance.  We will move on from that.  That bank was taken over and a promissory note - which I understand is an IOU - was given.  The bank was in serious trouble and was involved in business for the purposes of property speculation.  A Government, in its wisdom, decided to write it IOUs.  Is that right?  Am I wrong?</p></speech>

We will all agree on the graphics and that the bank was a bank of speculators.  We agree that the Government wrote an IOU and Anglo Irish Bank took that and went to the Central Bank.  It said it would give the bank money to keep it going.  In addition, under the IOU the Government had to pay periodic payments to the bank.  One can imagine how long it has taken me to get my head around this.  A bank was not worth saving but the Government saved it with IOUs.  The Government needed to borrow a great deal of money to finance those IOUs.  It also raided the pension fund.</p></speech>

We need to come back to this in more general terms because there is a pattern here.  References to commercial sensitivity and legal advice and the outsourcing of some work are creating a barrier between this committee and witnesses and accounting officers.  While such officials are not legally compelled to come here and answer questions, there would be an expectation that they would answer basic questions.  I would say they are certainly obliged to do so.  In recent months, representatives of Nursing Homes Ireland, the HSE, the education and training boards, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department of Education and Skills, HIQA, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Department of Finance - in terms of PPPs - have offered references to commercial sensitivity or legal advice as a cover or cloak to avoid answering what I would see as basic questions.  I think we need to come back to it.  Deputy MacSharry is right when he asks how we can do our work in such circumstances.  I am not putting this as a question to Mr. Carville.  I am making an observation and recommending that we should come back to his issue as part of our discussion on our work programme at a later stage.  On that subject, will Mr. Carville outline to the committee the nature of the court case that is being taken?</p></speech>

The rate for a trainee accountant is not applicable.  We can do something else that is helpful.  There are quarter-proved rates.  This is one of the things we wanted to get into today.

There is plenty of litigation against the State through the Department of Finance or the Minister for Finance.  The approach we are adopting here is entirely consistent with the approach we have adopted in the cases I have mentioned.  I am quite happy to talk about this again as long as we can defend our position successfully, which is our objective.  As I mentioned to Deputies Catherine Murphy and Connolly earlier, we will revisit this as we go through the process.  I am not saying we are going to wait until the very end of this process.  If we can get refreshed legal advice that tells me I can talk about this in greater detail, we will act on that.  We will let the Chairman and the secretariat know straightaway.</p></speech>

The Department has committed to go back to seek further legal advice.  Part of the problem here is that what we get in general terms is a synopsis of the legal advice, which is that these legal issues cannot be dealt with.  The parameters of what can and cannot be discussed are never set out for us.  We would then have a view that there might be some logic in not answering one set of questions, but no logic in answering another set of questions.</p><p>What we get is a blanket or a wall put between us, which is that the Department cannot answer any of the questions and, obviously, we are not privy to the legal advice the Department received.</p><p> I think there is a serious problem for the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Department said it would come back to the committee once it got legal advice.  There is a clear lack of accountability and this goes back in the Department for a long period of time.  The Department of Justice and Equality has been under scrutiny for a culture of secrecy.  If there is a culture of lack of transparency in any Department, that would worry me.  Given what I have seen so far today, I think there is still such a culture in the Department of Finance and I am not happy with it.  I am putting that on the record.  Mr. Carville has defended his Department and said that is not the case.  I am accepting what he said but I am giving him my opinion, which is my personal opinion and not that of the committee.  I want to come back to the broader issue later.  If Mr. Carville wants to comment, he can do so.</p></speech>

This is a voluntary document.  There is no legal requirement for us to publish this document but we published four of them.  This was the Department's idea in consultation with the Minister, Deputy Noonan, at the time in 2014.  We felt it was a good idea to provide transparency.  There is a huge amount of detail in these documents.  The latest one is probably lighter than the other ones because there is less work going on now.  When we were going through the various loan sale processes, there was a huge wealth of detail in these documents.  While I respect what the Deputy is saying, these are voluntary documents.  We did not have to produce them and had no obligation whatsoever to do so, and we did.</p></speech>

The bodies of the chapters are quite substantial and we have not had, in my view, a fair opportunity to even probe them because we have spent so much time going over and back in respect of this issue.  That is problematic.  I am going to park that now because I have made my point and the assistant secretary general, if that is Mr. Carville's position-----</p></speech>

I will turn to the substantive issue.  The gross cost of capitalising the banks, according to the Comptroller and Auditor General's office, is &euro;66.8 billion, the net cost to the State is &euro;39.9 billion and there is an average cost of between &euro;1 billion and &euro;1.4 billion a year to service the associated debt.  These are the headline figures in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  All of this is a consequence of the fact the State essentially recapitalised the banks and, as a consequence of that, nationalised some of these banks as well.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

There were 14 banks operating in the country before the crash - I am thinking of retail mortgage banks.  Some were owned by foreign subsidiaries, some left the market for various reasons, some closed down, some were sold and two were merged into IBRC, as the Deputy knows.

However, after the crash there was a decision to nationalise them, which came on the back of the bank guarantee.  As a consequence of having to recapitalise the banks by investing so much in the banks, the <i>quid pro quo</i>was that the State would become a shareholder and, essentially, would own the banks <i>de facto</i>.  That was a consequence of the policy decision that was taken.  Is that what Mr. Carville is saying?</p></speech>

When we had debt-like instruments, contingent convertible capital notes, or CoCos, and preference shares, we received interest on those instruments.  In the case of AIB, the Deputy might have seen earlier this year it declared its first dividend for nine or ten years, and we received 99% of that, so we receive dividend income as well.  We also receive income when we sell the investments.</p><p>We have sold the preference shares and CoCos in Bank of Ireland.  We have redeemed preference shares in AIB.

A sovereign bond is very similar in a sense but it is a sovereign debt instrument that has been given out.  It is essentially that the State will repay a debt in due course.</p></speech>

This goes back to what I was saying earlier.  As members of the Committee of Public Accounts, we are working from a report of the Comptroller and Auditor General that gives headline figures.  Our job is to probe those figures and conduct a deep dive in terms of where the money went.  There is a headline figure of &euro;31.8 billion paid from NAMA to banks, essentially, to take bad loans off the banks' books.  I am looking for a breakdown, in the first instance, of how much went to what banks, and the information is not to hand.  I am also looking for a range of the value of those loans, and that information is not to hand.  Why was that work not done in advance of today's meeting?

I thank the witnesses for continuing to be here.  I am sorry if at times it is adversarial.  As many of us have said, it is not personal; we have a job to do.  I have just carried out a Google search in respect of some of these matters and I note that the plaintiff in this case is referred to as the director of the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation.  That individual took a case on the promissory notes in 2013.  The case was dismissed because he was deemed not to have standing.  Mr. Carville mentioned earlier that he accepted that this case was being brought or whatever.  Is it the Department's position that this person, as an advocate for mortgage holders, has standing in respect of this matter?</p></speech>

It is not that I was not listening attentively, but I was researching some matters.  The individual in question took a case in respect of the promissory notes which was dismissed on the basis of the State's defence to the effect that he did not have standing.  The court ruled that he would have had to be a Deputy.  Subsequently, a Deputy took a case and it went that route.  In this instance, is it the Department's position that he would have standing?</p></speech>

That is against the backdrop of the parliamentary questions.  I said I would refer back to those.  One of my parliamentary questions in September related to the frequency of meetings of the committee - these are the update committees.  The answer stated that in 2016 there were eight such update meetings.  At that stage in 2017 - up to 20 September - there had only been three, but another was planned.  To the layperson, that does not inspire confidence.  We had eight and now we only have three.  If-----</p></speech>

I think this is a really important point the Deputy is getting to.  These are formal update meetings.  In total, we have had 74.  This reflects the work of the special liquidation.  We must remember the liquidation started in 2013.  This will not be an annualised figure, but I can probably annualise it in my head quickly.  As one would expect, in 2013 there were 36 meetings because that was when all the activity was taking place.  That was when most of the fees were being incurred.  There were 18 meetings in 2014.  The difference between 2013 and 2014 and then between 2015, 2016 and 2017 is that &euro;21 billion par-value loans were sold over that period.  This was the bulk of work.  This was where all the activity was taking place in terms of liquidation.  I believe it is entirely appropriate that we step back.</p></speech>

I am trying to understand the whole process and procedure around liquidation.  We move resources when they are required.  We have one liquidation specialist, two whole-time equivalents and a solicitor.  It is less important to have those formal update meetings in 2017 because the Department is not as busy with that issue as was the case in 2016.  It sounds very haphazard to me.  That is why we should have the committee of inspection or whatever.  Is there a defined process?  Is what is supposed to happen written down anywhere in the Department or is it haphazard and generic?  For example, what is the process if the Department has a problem with the number of partner hours being associated with a particular task?  Does Mr. Carville ring Kieran Wallace or someone else in KPMG to say that he has a problem with something?  Are there informal arrangements?  Is it that simple?  Is it informal or is a process defined?</p></speech>

Around other matters, absolutely, if something emerges, we get information or we have to deal with parliamentary questions or whatever the issues is, the special liquidators are incredibly responsive to us.  They are our main point of contact.  It is not as if they subcontract the work way down the chain to somebody very junior, we deal with-----</p></speech>

I do not want to delay on this matter, but I want to go further down the list of parliamentary questions.  Mr. Carville called out for Deputy David Cullinane the hourly rate for partners.  I want a breakdown of how many partners are being used and for how many hours to perform certain tasks.  The Minister, or perhaps the witnesses on his behalf, wrote back to say he had been advised by the special liquidators that these matters were commercially sensitive.  Who is driving the bus?  If I ask a parliamentary questin on behalf of the people, do we have to check with the special liquidators to find out if it is okay for me to tell the public, our employer, for how many hours the liquidators are being paid to do a certain job?  Why would that even appear in a parliamentary question: "I am advised by the special liquidators"?  The special liquidators are not advisers.  If I get my hair cut, it will cost me &euro;X.  I do not need the hairdresser's permission to share the fact that it took a half an hour and cost me &euro;20.  That is my business to decide if I want to share the information.</p></speech>

That is the way it should be, but Mr. Carville and I are not getting &euro;222 million.  The liquidators are and I think the public are entitled to know.  The Comptroller and Auditor General and the Department of Finance have no role in the procurement of the joint special liquidators.  If we have all of these powers that trump those of a committee of inspection, why are we not using them?  Is it not legitimate for us to say to someone to whom we are paying &euro;222 million that, while we want them to achieve the best value for money on all of the services they are procuring, we want to have an input?  However, we have no role in that regard.  </p> <p>  The contract is commercially sensitive.  We had a lengthy engagement on the basis that we knew the price being paid per hour, but we could not see the contract because it was commercially sensitive.  I disagree with this.  We are told we cannot have a copy of the indemnity document because it is commercially sensitive too.  They were the answers from the Minister last September.  He would not tell us whether there had been a fee increase or what staff were assigned to perform each task as the information was commercially sensitive.  Minutes of meetings are also described as being commercially sensitive and this was at a time when there was no legal case.  I am bound to say that - I am sure the witnesses as individuals are doing extremely difficult and time consuming work - if a case had not been taken last Friday, they would have been sent here today with riding instructions and that we would be listening to the line, "That is commercially sensitive". </p></speech>

The auditing expression we would have used when training in KPMG once upon a time was "professional scepticism".  We apply it to everything we do.  Just because somebody says something is commercially sensitive we do not say that is fine.  We probe and push to satisfy ourselves that there is a case to be made, but my point about the previous opening statement is that the committee will get a sense of its tone and what we were trying to do in it.  In due course we will share that information with the committee when we come back and deliver a different opening statement.</p></speech>

I will tell you as soon as it suits me to tell you."  Mr. Carville is professionally sceptical; that is his training as an accountant.  He studied for many years and was the top of the class.  We are trying to be professionally sceptical, but what we are seeing is that there is no defined process and that there are no procedures.  We took out the bit that existed in law, in the Companies Acts, in respect of the committee of inspection and are taking refuge in commercial sensitivity.  Mr. Carville as much as admitted to me that the concept of commercial sensitivity will still apply.</p></speech>

We cannot allow the public to know how much it is getting for its euro.  That is laughable and unacceptable.  The committee has a job to do.  The Department of Finance is not alone.  Time and again departmental officials have queued to tell us that information is commercially sensitive and what is the legal advice, etc.  It actually does not matter that Mr. Hall took the case last week because the reality is that Mr. Carville will tell us nothing.  He has spoken about the report the Department produces periodically, which is great.  I said to another Secretary General last week that we were not here to celebrate all of what the witnesses were doing well.  What is contained in the report is great, but we are only interested in finding what can be improved to get better value for money.  That is what is missing from the report.  Regardless of the case, Mr. Carville has confirmed for me that I need not waste any more time on this issue at the Committee of Public Accounts because witnesses will not tell us because of the commercial sensitivity of information.  I have taken up enough time and I am bound to conclude.  There is a culture across departmental agencies and organisations audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General which uses evasion and any device within their reach to avoid an appearance or candour at the Committee of Public Accounts and that subverts the people's right to know that they are getting value for money.  On the basis of the parliamentary that were not answered in September, the fact that the case was taken last week and what we have just heard, it can be proved that we have no chance of having the level of public scrutiny required of this matter.</p><p>We need former staff of IBRC before the committee.  I proposed this earlier and the Chairman will come back to it.  We need the Secretary General before the committee as soon as he is well.  I also believe, while it is not common practice, that the Minister needs to come before the committee to discuss this issue.  It is heading for &euro;300 million, it could be &euro;1 billion by the time it is all over and I it is far too much public money for us simply to be told, "We are doing a great job here.  You have nothing to worry about."  That is simply not good enough.  I thank the gentlemen for their attendance.  I am not happy.</p></speech>

Mr. Carville talked about the net amount in respect of the cost of the bank, stabilisation measures and capitalisation.  I assume that the Department did not include the tax forgone that can be set aside for up to 20 years and which was recently in the news.  Has the Department calculated what that might have otherwise been?</p></speech>

Deputy Murphy is talking about the tax losses, the deferred tax assets, that the banks hold.  There are probably several important points in this regard, which are often overlooked, unfortunately.

Second, the banks have a bank levy, which is &euro;150 million per annum.  That was put in place in 2014.  In last year's Finance Act it was extended to 2021, which amounts to &euro;750 million.  Therefore, the banks do pay tax and that has been approved by the Oireachtas.  There are a few really important things to note about the tax losses.  First of all, tax losses are normal.  I think all OECD countries have the concept of tax losses, so there is nothing unusual about the banks having tax losses <i>per se</i>if one imagines other Irish corporates that are tax-resident in this country.  Second, we do get value for the deferred tax assets, DTAs, or tax losses.  When we value the shareholdings in the banks, the market gives us value for those today.  Hypothetically, if we were to eliminate tax losses today, the share prices would fall correspondingly tomorrow.</p></speech>

Therefore, there is a very big difference and it does not appear that there is a Statute of Limitations, even uniquely on the banks, in respect of losses, which seems extraordinary given the investment that was made in the main by citizens, including those who have not even been born yet.</p></speech>

It is a very good question.  When we make an IPO for the bank, what is important is one must assess our performance when the last share is sold, so the assessment ranges over a period.  We own 99.9% of the bank, so one has to assess when the final share is sold, not as we sell, because in capital market terms what we want to do is sell into a rising market.  Therefore, every time we sell shares, in an ideal world - it will not work out like this in practice because it will take many years - we will continually sell at a higher price.  There are plenty of examples of this not working and examples of it working really well.  I am glad to say AIB is one example of it having worked really well.  The morning the shares opened on the London and Irish stock markets the share price went up 4.6%.  When the markets closed that day the share price was up 5.8% or 5.6%.  I think it was 5.8%.  A day later it was up 8%, I think, and it stayed at that level for quite some time.  Markets since then-----</p></speech>

I wish to refer to another sale of shares, namely, the Bank of Ireland shares.  A European Parliament report on this has come out just in the last few days.  I refer to the hedge fund with which Wilbur Ross was associated in 2011.  It bought something like 34% or 35% of the shares after a large amount of money had been injected into Bank of Ireland and it took many people by surprise that they were sold at such a low rate.  I think it was about 10 cent.  There is an accusation now that when a large amount of the shares were sold in 2014, there was possible insider information and, obviously, insider trading because there was some knowledge of the market moving.  Is the Department looking at this again?  Is it a concern for the Department?  Has there been any discussion about it?</p></speech>

I am familiar with the report and the allegation.  I am also familiar with Wilbur Ross's very detailed rebuttal of the allegation.  I think that should be looked at because it explains the situation very well.  At that point in time I was not working in the Department of Finance; I was an adviser to Bank of Ireland.  I was Bank of Ireland's sponsor to its listing on the Irish Stock Exchange and co-sponsor, with UBS, to its listing on the London Stock Exchange.  I was therefore responsible for the prospectus that was written to support that rights issue in 2010.  I was also responsible for a prospectus written in 2011.  With that hat on, I am absolutely satisfied, as were the directors of the bank because that is what they state on the first page of the document, that all the information investors needed to make a properly informed decision was in that document.

I am sure Mr. Ross will not mind me noting this but he has made other investments in the banking space in other parts of Europe that have not been as successful.  The point I am making is that investments in equities are inherently risky.  I remember in 2011 when the Fairfax consortium, including Wilbur Ross, invested in the country.  That was a seminal moment.  When we look back and the history of that decade is written, the moment when he and his co-investors took a risk will be regarded as a seminal moment for Ireland.  That is when the tide started turning.  That was the moment.</p></speech>

Obviously Mr. Mario Draghi is the current President of the European Central Bank, ECB, but he was formerly the Governor of Banca d'Italia.  My question relates to the allegations that were made by the then risk manager at UniCredit, Mr. Jonathan Sugarman, who has appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  Mr. Sugarman went to the Central Bank and disclosed some information in his role as risk manager.  We have been told that the central banks share a lot of information.   They are subsidiaries of the ECB.  Mr. Draghi has flatly denied having any knowledge that there was any risk or that he was aware of anything that was disclosed to the Central Bank of Ireland.  Yet, in 2010, the then Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan, claimed that the Central Bank maintained a close relationship with the ECB.  How do we square that circle whereby that information was not shared when it was received?  Was it just dismissed?  How do we treat whistleblowers?  If somebody went to the Central Bank today and disclosed that there was a risk, how would the information be treated?  Would it be treated any differently to the way this was treated?  Was it disclosed to the Central Bank or would Mr. Carville know that?  Is that something that should be pursued with the Central Bank?</p></speech>

In disclosures of this type, under section 33AK of the Central Bank Act, there are specified gateways for information to flow to various State agencies.  There is no gateway for that sort of information to flow to us.</p></speech>

I suppose we are all being very careful about making sure it does not happen again and whistleblowers are particularly important from that point of view.  I am just looking for the route information takes.</p></speech>

The Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 had a provision for whistleblowers which predated that 2014 Act.  The Central Bank views these disclosures as a very important tool for it in regulation and supervision, allowing access to information to which it may not get access.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked about the culture around whistleblowers.  It is really important to say that within the Department of Finance, we receive training around whistleblowers and what to do if there is a protected disclosure to us.  We are very familiar with that at assistant secretary level, and even at principal officer level as well.</p></speech>

The Central Bank produces an annual report on the number of protected disclosures that are made to it.  It is subject to European rules about banking confidentiality.  One of the capital requirements directives, CRD, specifies there must be very established gateways for regulatory and supervisory information to flow to other State bodies.  That is considered to be a matter for a regulator and then potentially for the Garda or other authorities, depending on what the disclosure is about.</p></speech>

There are at least ten material checkpoints, which must be passed.  Everything leads to one word; "valuation".  That is the only thing that matters.  We start with the programme for partnership Government, which gave us permission to sell up to 25% plus the over-allotment option, which was the extra circa 4% we sold.  That gives us 29%.  That is a standard feature of a deal like this on the capital markets .  About ten different items were involved.  I will give the Deputy the list very quickly, because it really-----</p></speech>

I was just thinking about it, so I am delighted you asked the question.</p> <p>  These items are not in any order.  We had to select the selling syndicate, that is, the investment banks that acted on our behalf.  We had a huge procurements exercise to make sure we got the best possible advisers.  We worked on the listing venue to ensure that the bank was listed.  It moved from the junior market in Dublin to the main market in Dublin, as well as to the main market in London.  That is a similar arrangement to UK banks, for example.  It is really important to buyers on the other side, because they like buying premium-listed companies rather than junior-listed or standard-listed companies.</p> <p>  The bank itself had declared its first dividend and in valuation terms this was an absolute game-changer.  We would not have advised the Minister to execute an initial public offering, IPO, if the bank was not paying a dividend.  It has that much of a material impact on the valuation of the bank.  The bank had also done some work around pension volatility at the end of last year, which is very important from an investor perspective.</p> <p>  We also did our own roadshow.  I referred to professional scepticism earlier.  Investment banks tell us various things, which sound nice.  They want to do a deal because they only get paid if there is a deal.  Along with other colleagues including Mr. Rankin and Ms Ann Nolan, the former Second Secretary General to the Department, I travelled to meet a selection of the best investors in the world in London and New York.  We satisfied ourselves that they understood the story of AIB, understood the Irish economic situation and were prepared to pay a decent price for the bank.</p> <p>  The bank itself played a huge part in this, in fairness to the chief executive officer, Mr. Bernard Byrne, the chief financial officer, Mr. Mark Bourke, and the rest of the management team.  We also attended capital markets day in London.  The results came out and we had to assess how the results were received; a week later was capital markets day in London.  We all went over to that event and we were in the room for the whole day, talking with the analysts and making sure the offer was resonating. </p></speech>

Regarding the 25% - the programme for Government figure was up to 25% - a huge amount went into considering why it would be that level.  To expand on that, say we picked 5%, then we would still own 95%.  We are dealing with very sophisticated buyers on the other side who are paid multiples of what we are paid.  They are multiples better than we are whose job is to get the State to pay at the lowest possible price and ours it to ensure that we sell the shares at the highest possible price, bearing in mind that we have other transactions to make and shares to sell.  It was very important to us that if we sold 5%, the other side would have felt that was not much to trade and they might look for a liquidity discount.  They would think that we have 95% left and they would look for an overhang discount.  I could anticipate the valuation falling.  The converse would have been true had the programme for Government allowed us to sell 50% or 51%.  Then we would look as though we were a distressed seller, and they would want to apply a discount on that or we could have been selling so many shares that the market could not absorb it.  As I said in my opening statement, it was the second largest IPO in the world this year.  A sum of &euro;3.4 billion is a huge transaction.  We had lots of advice, including independent advice from Rothschild, that 25% was the right figure to sell.  That is borne out by the share price only rose 4.6% in the first day.  It is what we call the Goldilocks zone.  It does not get better than that.</p></speech>

That is what we call it.  To give the example of another privatisation in the UK, the share price popped 38% in the first day and was followed by several parliamentary investigations.   If the share price goes below what we call break issue - that would be below the &euro;4.40 price - that would also be a disaster because we would have sold too high and we would still have 71%.</p></speech>

We examined this with Goldman Sachs in 2015.  This advice was free of charge, incidentally, as we had Goldman Sachs on retainer for a year free of charge.  We examined it again in 2016 when, following a public procurement exercise we appointed Rothschild as our independent financial adviser.  This examination considered precisely the question the Deputy raised, along with other questions.  Using our own expertise we did our own internal analysis.  All three led to the inescapable conclusion that if we were to hold the bank in perpetuity and run it for dividends it would take decades - I think it was 30 years - to recover the money.</p></speech>

Government policy is to sell the bank investments, get the money back and use it to do other, more important things.  The State would rather it did not hold large investments in the banking sector.  The next time there is a recession, and inevitably there will be one, it might be unlikely to happen in the next 12 months but whether it is in three, five, ten years or whenever, bank shares are risky.  That is the primary reason why Government policy is to ultimately sell these investments.  Stock markets internationally, particularly in the US, appear to be making new highs daily.  This stock market rally, or bull market, is very mature, in a few months it will be the longest ever, and we are very conscious of that.</p></speech>

The wisdom of putting State funds into speculative banks is one very serious lesson, and there are many others, but obviously the witnesses are not policy makers.</p> <p>  My second point related to value for money.  I finished before I left the room on my last round of questioning.  Eight people have died since August.  I knew the figure and I did not wish to say it.  I was not trying to catch the officials out over one or two people.  I was using it as an indicator of the magnitude of the problem.  It has a direct bearing in regard to policy decisions.  I was away while Deputy Cullinane was asking his questions.  Did we have to save Anglo Irish Bank given that we could not?   Looking back, was this a bad decision?  Were alternatives considered?  Have alternatives been considered since in terms of value for money?  What value for money exercise has been done in regard to learning lessons?</p></speech>

One now sees the use of macroprudential tools and analysis so that banks now must hold higher levels of buffers.  The key lesson is the roll-out of bank recovery and resolution plans across all systemic banks so that in future there should be greater protection for taxpayers and bank customers.</p></speech>

It is not a silly question.  I want the witnesses to explain precisely what &euro;29 billion, a huge amount of taxpayers' money that was put into a private organisation, was used for.  I do not want to hear the general term that it was used to recapitalise the bank.  The money that was given was used for something.  What was it used for?</p></speech>

This is a bad bank.  It is a developer's bank, essentially, and it is extraordinary that we can make a statement that if that investment was not made, the entirety of the banking system could have collapsed.  That might hold some logic if one was talking about Allied Irish Banks, AIB, and Bank of Ireland but one cannot assume that for Anglo Irish Bank.</p></speech>

With respect, the Deputy has the luxury of being able to look at it in hindsight and see how things played out subsequently.  At that point, the policy decision was taken to rescue the Irish banking system through the injection of &euro;64 billion, or &euro;66 billion if it is grossed up, into the system.</p></speech>

It would be useful if we could get a breakdown of exactly how that money was spent.  For example, which banks got what from the first &euro;66 billion?  What was the money used for when the banks were recapitalised?  What did they do with the money?  Are there reports that we could get a breakdown?  The Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis may have gone through all of this.  It is an extraordinary amount of taxpayers' money to put into private institutions, which we really had no legal requirement to do but did anyway on the premise that, at the time, a decision was taken that this would have been a massive shock to the economy had we not done it.  We can argue or disagree about the degree of shock that would have happened with regard to the different banks involved.  I think that the information we have is far too vague and that we need a further breakdown.</p></speech>

At the end of the process, all we got was a broken bank which was liquidated at a cost to the taxpayer and we are being told that this was being done in the national interest and if we had not done it, it would have amounted to the potential collapse of the entire banking system.

I wish all the witnesses a happy Christmas, and I hope Mr. Carville, who said that he has a chest infection, recovers.  I thank him for coming here today despite that.</p> <p>  From the figure at 2.1 which breaks down NAMA's loans we can see the total borrower debt, the NAMA payment for loans, which is the amount that NAMA got.  The discount, or loss, is given as a percentage.  Can we get a breakdown of each of those?  Taxpayers' money was used.  If we look at AIB for example, can we get a breakdown of how many loans there were, as well as the range in value?  Was the range from &euro;1 million to &euro;500 million?  We do not want the client's names, only the range.  We would like the same for Anglo Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland.  We want this because, if it is the case in Anglo Irish Bank that the volume of loans is, say 100, but 10 of those were very high amounts that add up to 50% of the overall amount, it shows us that we essentially bailed out a very small number of developers.  It would be interesting and worthwhile to have that breakdown.  The figures to be provided are for each of the banks involved and will show the volume and the range.  </p></speech>

The promissory note was for ten years, and we are transferring it into a sovereign bond at a lower rate.  We are saving a certain amount for the next ten years.  The sovereign bond has a life of 35 years, so the interest can only be compared over that 35 year period against what was paid under the promissory note.  What is the cost of the promissory note over its full life?  Had I asked this question 18 months ago a different interest rate would apply.  How would the witnesses answer it as things stand now?</p> <p>  Have the various minutes between the Department of Finance and the special liquidator been examined by the Comptroller and Auditor General?</p></speech>

Perhaps there should be an independent audit.  The financial statements should be produced, rather than relying on a process which has court approval at the end, or in the case of the witnesses the Minister approving it.  I understand the PMPA liquidation could have went on for over 30 years because people could claim up to the age of 18 and so the liquidation had to be kept open in case claims emerged over the lifetime of minors.  Some liquidations can run for decades before they finish.  I suspect we might be in that territory in this case.</p></speech>

My point is that the special liquidator is contracted to the State to do work and it submits a report to the Comptroller and Auditor General when the job is done and that is the end of it.  From the point of view of the Committee on Public Accounts we have no method of verifying that what is happening is in line with Government procurement and everything else that goes on.  I know that it is not a public sector body.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is telling us that he does not have access to the minutes.</p></speech>

That still applies.  There is nothing in the IBRC Act that takes away that responsibility.</p></speech>

This one has the same procedure but is carried out in a publically owned body.  I am trying to separate the two.  There is no method for intermittent independent reports on the liquidation process.  It might be said that is not provided for, but there would be a benefit if there was an equivalent independent audit produced at the end of each year, especially when a liquidation is likely to span several years.  When the special liquidator gives his report to the Comptroller and Auditor General it is published, and nobody has any way of knowing if it is true or not.  That is probably why this case is going on at the moment.  There is a missing link in terms of public accountability when a public, State owned organisation is being liquidated, compared to the private sector.  That is my observation.</p></speech>

We have the ability to impose legislation, provided the Oireachtas approves it.  If I or my colleagues felt that we were missing something or that the IBRC Act was somehow deficient with the benefit of hindsight because it was done at a particular point in time it would be incumbent on us to put our hands up and say that we think that additional powers are required.  We are not in that place, and we do not believe additional powers are required.</p></speech>

That is a little like the Higher Education Authority saying, "We are happy with how the universities are running their business and there is no need for formal reports to the committee.  If we were not happy we would flag that".  That is fine and we accept your bona fides, but that does not give us any comfort.  We are relying on believing what you are saying.  We have no way of verifying what you have said.  That is the point.</p></speech>

I hope you get our frustration regarding how we cannot communicate better today.  Hopefully, your concerns will be substantially mitigated when we can talk freely about what we are doing.  The special liquidators were due to appear with us today.  We did not have to ask or compel them.  They were quite happy to come here because they believe they have a good story to tell.  They will be here with us in due course, but I do not know when that will be.  We look forward to that day.</p></speech>

You should consider the point that some Deputies made today regarding some of the information being sought.  If some of that was going to made available here today, there is a case for putting part of that out in the public domain.  You do not have to hold it all just to get to the court.  Some of it is available and could be dealt with.  I am not advising you on your strategy but you have heard the view of some members.  If some of this can be put out in public, and there is nothing preventing that, you should not wait until you are on the steps of the court to provide it, if it can be done without compromising the case.</p></speech>

The committee knows what has been happening for the last while and we wanted to inform people who have been viewing the proceedings all along that we have agreed our report.  I want to take the opportunity to thank each member of the committee.  It has been a very constructive committee.  I have never ceased to be impressed, surprised and amazed at the work that has gone into this committee.  For the most part, we worked extremely well together, and I want to pay tribute to every member with whom I have really enjoyed working.  On a personal level, I have made some friends and I am really grateful to have had that opportunity.</p> <p>  The amendments we have made reflect the votes we took yesterday and the evidence we heard overall.  I think we all agree it has been a very challenging experience.  I have personally found it challenging.  I have learned things about myself that I did not know, and I have learned things in general.  Overall, members have been on a journey.  I am very impressed with the Members of the Oireachtas on this committee.  I suppose I am biased in saying this but we have really shown how effective an Oireachtas committee can be, and on this most difficult and divisive issue.  I do not think anyone on this committee would ever seek to underestimate the challenge put in front of us.  It is part of an overall process.  We are now handing this over to ourselves, as Members of the Oireachtas, and to our colleagues to facilitate a vote of the Irish people, who will ultimately be the decision-makers on this, and it is very important to clarify that.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses who attended the committee.  We are indebted to them.  They did the State some service in attending.  We had excellent witnesses for the most part.  I wish to express our gratitude.  I very much thank the secretariat.  I hope Ms Suzanne Gunn and Ms Claudia Zelli will not mind me singling out the clerk, Mr. Ted McEnery, who we will all agree has been absolutely excellent.  His nature is such that he is an absolute pleasure to work with and, besides that, he is extremely strong and supportive.  We have all benefitted from his very considerable experience in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Everybody has said how lucky I am to have had the clerk that I have, and there is a reason he was put into the position. That is very really important.</p> <p>  I also want to thank Mr. Tom Malone, who is not here at the moment and who has been supportive also.  I am very grateful for the legal advice I have received.  I also thank Ms Zelli for all her support.  The amount of work she has done is underestimated.  I thank our legal adviser, Ms Nuala Butler, an excellent senior counsel, who also did us some service.</p> <p>  We will leave it at that.  The committee will launch its report next Wednesday.  I know the Vice Chairman is indicating a wish to speak.  On another committee, she might have had more opportunity to take the chair but the way the situation evolved, it became important that we had consistency in the chairing.  However, the Vice Chairman was very supportive, and I appreciated that support.  We have agreed that it suits everybody to launch our report at 12 noon next Wednesday.  Thank you, everyone.</p></speech>

At one stage she spoke about me not being appointed as Chairman of this committee.  It is probably good that I was not appointed because I would not have been able to show the patience, calmness, strength and bravery shown by her in the face of considerable criticism and many attacks in difficult discussions and conversations.  I know where my skills lie and they are definitely not on the Chairman's side of the table.  I am glad, therefore, that she was able to maintain consistency.  On behalf of members and the people of Ireland, I thank her for taking the brave step to chair the committee.  It is very much appreciated.  This is only the beginning.</p></speech>

AIB first established an offshore presence in the Isle of Man and Jersey in 1977 and 1981, respectively.  The rationale for establishing this offshore presence was to support the bank&rsquo;s growing business franchise in Britain and the United States and to meet the banking needs of the increasing international workforce. </p> <p>  In line with all financial institutions, the variety of the products offered developed over the years and included deposit, lending and trust services.  AIB provided banking services to residents of the islands and to expatriate individuals who were working and residing in another jurisdiction, be that in the United Kingdom, the United States of America or, more latterly, in the United Arab Emirates, UAE.</p> <p>  Services did not include providing tax advice.  Clients of the offshore businesses were required to take independent tax and legal advice.  The offshore businesses worked with those advisers in full compliance with local and international regulation, to provide a range of products, for example, trust structures, that were used for a variety of reasons from estate planning to managing individual and corporate investments, to more basic banking services.  AIB ceased this trust business in the Isle of Man 14 years ago and sold the Jersey trust business in 2011. </p> <p>  In the chaos that prevailed during the financial crisis, AIB, like every other Irish bank, was focused on the imperative of protecting its deposit base.  The offshore business was no different in trying to maintain its deposit base.  In any event, AIB&rsquo;s offshore deposits declined rapidly during the bailout era, from a peak of almost sterling &pound;2.5 billion in 2008 to sterling &pound;191 million in 2012. </p> <p>  In 2012, the banking businesses in both Jersey and the Isle of Man, which at this time included Anglo Irish Bank&rsquo;s business in the Isle of Man - these had been transferred to AIB on the direction of the then Minister for Finance in February 2011 - were identified as non-core to the bank.  In April 2012, AIB announced that the remaining Isle of Man and Jersey businesses would be wound down.  The orderly wind down of the businesses commenced in May 2012 under the supervision of the local regulators and was completed in December 2013. </p> <p>  Today, AIB&rsquo;s sole interest in Jersey and the Isle of Man is in respect of its customer liabilities associated with the legacy book, which is administered in both jurisdictions by Estera, a managed services business previously owned by Appleby solicitors.  Currently, circa sterling &pound;13.5 million is being held in respect of AIB Channel Islands, CI, Limited and AIB ISL Limited as liabilities owed to customers. </p> <p>  The companies have surrendered their banking licences and have stopped doing any new business and no longer trade.  The legal entities are required, under regulatory requirements, to remain in existence for up to ten years from the date of closure to honour the liabilities of customers.  Thus, our interest, involvement and participation in the offshore business is and has been over for many years. </p> <p>  I thank the committee for allowing me the opportunity to make this introductory statement.  My team and I will, of course, answer the committee&rsquo;s questions to the best of our ability.</p></speech>

As the chief executive of a major Irish financial institution which has been bailed out by taxpayers, what is his view of the disclosure in the Panama Papers of the widespread tax evasion on which they have shone a light?</p><p>Does Mr. Byrne have a view on that matter?  While he has said the bank's activities in Jersey and the Isle of Man are long over, are there other jurisdictions or arrangements in place in which the bank continues to facilitate wealthy individuals or businesses in arranging their affairs in such a way as to avoid tax in this jurisdiction?</p><p> Mr. Byrne has described the services as including deposit, lending and trust services.  Will he give us an indication of their capital value?  He has stated bank deposits were in the realm of the figure of &pound;2.458 billion in 2008.  Is he aware of what happened to these bank deposits subsequently?  During the crash were they moved to another jurisdiction or were people bringing them back here?  Does Mr. Byrne have an indication of the capital value of trust services?  Were the lending services to facilitate back-to-back loan facilities where, for instance, people were being given loans for construction in Ireland while using deposits and other assets they may have had offshore, including trust assets in this jurisdiction or offshore, as collateral?  My understanding is such a practice would have been extensive at the time.  I draw a contrast between ordinary bank customers and those who may have been in a position to facilitate this practice.</p><p> Not too long before this particular episode occurred, the bank provided services for many Irish individuals who were persuaded by their local bank manager that they should have a DIRT, deposit interest retention tax, type account in their friendly AIB branch on the Isle of Man and in other jurisdictions.  How many of the accounts involved were business and commercial accounts and how many were held by ordinary people?  In banking terms, the sum of &pound;2.458 billion may not have been significant in the context of the bank's overall balance sheet at the time.  However, to most ordinary customers of the bank, it was an enormous sum at a time when the country was in severe difficulty.</p><p> The bank made significant losses from 2008 on which are now deferred tax assets.  Recently it gave an indication of their value at approximately &euro;3 billion.  Will Mr. Byrne advise the committee as to how long it will be before the bank will pay any corporation tax?  Does he find it acceptable or surprising or is he simply just grateful that the bank will not have to pay corporation tax and that essentially it is left to its choice?  Does it operate in any other jurisdiction which does not have an offshore avoidance structure and where it does not incur some local corporation tax or equivalent tax liabilities?</p><p> Will Mr. Byrne update us on how the situation for those unfortunate enough to have been caught by the tracker mortgage issue is being resolved?  There will also be further questions about those in difficulty with their mortgages and where the bank is at on this matter.</p></speech>

It is worthwhile looking at how the situation evolved and standing back from individual details, disclosures and media comments.  It is important to look at how the situation evolved, what the situation was for the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and how it positioned itself.  Based on my understanding, it really started in 2003 when the Revenue Commissioners became energised on the issue of offshore accounts.  Obviously, they commenced a series of separate work streams in looking at offshore accounts.  At the time they engaged with the chief executive officers of several banks in Ireland, ten in total.  This culminated in a request from them to the banks here that they write to the boards of their overseas banks which were subject to separate regulation and separate legal entities to ask them to write to their offshore customers telling them that the Irish revenue authorities were about to begin an investigation which would start in 2004 and encouraging customers to avail of the voluntary disclosure legislation in place.  That began the process in 2003.</p> <p>  By the end of December 2003 the then chairman of the Revenue Commissioners had written to the banks - in AIB's case, the chief executive officer at the time - requesting that the letter be written to the boards of the overseas subsidiaries and that these boards be asked to consider writing to customers.  I will discuss the issue of data protection later.  It was a voluntary request to do so because data protection legislation would have prevented anything more intrusive.  My understanding of the position at that stage was that the boards, particularly of the AIB-related subsidiaries, considered the request and acceded to it.  They wrote to any customer they had about this matter to advise them, as requested by the Revenue Commissioners, that a voluntary disclosure regime was in place, that they should comply with it because a full investigation would take place in March and that anybody who had not voluntarily disclosed at that point in time would not be able to avail of its benefits subsequently.  I presume the basis on which the Revenue Commissioners were doing this was to get as much information as they could on a voluntary basis which would then allow them to target more specific transactions.</p> <p>  In 2004 the Revenue Commissioners, across the financial sector, began a series of High Court orders.  It is important to point out that the only legal way they can get specific details on transactions is through the issuing of a High Court order.  It is not the order of last resort but the order of first resort.  There is no other way they can get such data.</p></speech>

They are comments that people have made and on which they have put articles together.  I am trying to bring the committee through the factual series of events.</p> <p>  Over eight years from 2004, the Revenue Commissioners put in place 14 High Court orders in respect of AIB.  The reason the High Court process is in place is that a judge must consider the details and a specific request to determine if there is enough evidence to support the disclosure of the data.  What will happen in an investigation such as this is that one will start in a certain place, more information will be discovered and there will then be a separate request.  There is a sequence of events which in this case took place over eight years.  The chairman of the Revenue Commissioners has given evidence to the committee that overall they recovered &euro;1 billion in tax on the offshore accounts.  I have no information or evidence which indicates from where it came or which customers or accounts were involved.  That is the Revenue Commissioners' information, not ours.  We complied with every single one of the orders.  There has been some commentary on that matter in the newspapers, but we are satisfied we did everything we possibly could have.  It culminated in 2014 in the conclusion of the High Court order process.</p><p>This relates to data from the 1990s.  There were incomplete data in terms of paper files and records in AIB.  The Revenue Commissioners were not able to be fully satisfied about the accuracy of the records so there was a settlement by AIB in 2014 with the Revenue in respect of offshore accounts where there were incomplete data and it could not be evidenced as to what happened.  The settlement took place in respect of the tax year 1998 and it was &euro;10.7 million.  That is the full position that took place in respect of how that process worked with all those offshore accounts.</p><p> My general comment, which I was asked about, covers the process and the procedure and I hope it is helpful to set out how it went from beginning to end.  We are very clear that we do not encourage or support non-compliance with tax law or regulation.  There has not been any encouragement.  The policy of the bank since 1998 or 1999, as far as I am aware - the awareness piece is only as to the date it started rather than when it existed - is that we in no way target Irish-resident customers in respect of overseas activities.  There is no policy in the bank in respect of that.</p><p> I joined the bank in 2010, and as we all know, the world changed around 2010 and 2011 with the recapitalisation of the bank and the introduction of &euro;20.8 billion of State capital.  I can talk to what happened subsequent to that but my knowledge and detail does not extend to what happened prior to that, in a different era and regime in terms of how the bank operated.  The board changed as well as leadership team members.  All the top 200 in the bank changed.  The decision on the offshore business is reasonably straightforward.  In 2011-----</p></speech>

There are two other categories listed in the statement, lending and trust services.  What is the number of trust services?  I know they are historic data but is there an indication of values?  I presume that whereas the deposits amount to a very significant figure at &euro;2.4 billion, trust services may also have involved significant numbers of customers and had significant assets.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-14a.1034" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard Byrne" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017121400002#G00300"><p>I do not know the answer but we will see if we can find the information.  We gave the number for 2008 as that was the date of the deposit guarantee coming into place.  The point of maximum balance was the line.  To some extent we are trying to anticipate where the questions are going.  The capital value or equity value to the business in respect of both of those activities is very modest.  These offshore businesses, certainly from 2010 onwards, were not highly valuable businesses.  When the strategic review took place in 2011 around the core activities that AIB would be engaging in as part of the recapitalisation and restructuring plan, these businesses were deemed as non-core.  In 2011, around the time the final equity from the State came in, these businesses were deemed non-core.  They were not the only ones deemed non-core at that point.  A separate exercise in respect of each of those non-core activities was engaged in to consider the strategic options for those businesses.  In December 2011, it was determined the most likely strategic option was to exit those businesses.  That effectively became a formal decision in March 2012, which was then communicated to local regulators in April.</p></speech>

Was it entirely just about the value of the business or did it come down perhaps to the bank taking a view on the fact that it had very significant deposits offshore which gave rise to tax liabilities in the Revenue examinations and which were not declared?  Given that the bank was effectively dependent on the State, was it an influencing factor in the decision-making at the time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-14a.1036" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard Byrne" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017121400002#G00500"><p>The three priorities from 2010 for the business were very clear.  One was the radical restructuring and repositioning of the bank and putting it in the position to allow the State to get back its &euro;20.8 billion.  We keep that at the forefront of our minds by seeing it as &euro;10,500 for every taxpayer.  The second was focusing the bank on delivering its core markets and customer base and in the servicing of the Irish economy in a more efficient and effective manner than before.  There was also the support of the first agenda of delivering commercial value.  The third point was dealing with all the legacy issues that would inevitably arise during the course of the years afterwards as a result of the activities of previous decades.  They were the three priorities set out by the banks.</p> <p>  If it is helpful, there is another point.  The offshore businesses failed from approximately 2009 or 2010 onwards to be able to upstream deposits.  The local regulators became concerned about the solvency of AIB and other banks and it effectively trapped deposits in the offshore businesses.  One of the considerations in terms of the strategic review would have been absolutely influenced by the fact these deposits were offshore, remaining offshore and not coming back into the core activity.  The issues that determined the non-core nature of the business were very heavily commercial at that point.  All the decisions we try to make are very heavily commercial, but we have an overview in terms of the reputation and positioning of the bank.  The decision made was strategic and concerned the bank going forward.</p> <p>  I have no idea what happened to the deposits in terms of how they ran out.  People would have just taken their deposits.  Looking at AIB in a similar period, from 2010 to the middle of 2011, approximately &euro;40 billion of deposits left the bank.  They went from &euro;100 billion to &euro;60 billion, and a major outflow of deposits took place.  That happened across the Irish system and one of the key systemic problems at the time was the exiting of deposits.  It took place in corporate, commercial and retail deposits.  It is not surprising to me that those deposits left an Irish-based institution.  I do not know if they were corporate, personal or retail deposits.</p> <p>  There was a point on the deferred tax asset issue and I have commented on that before.  It is approximately &euro;3 billion.  It is slightly less but we can keep it at that round number.  Around the time of the recapitalisation and the capital assessment set by the Central Bank, the &euro;3 billion was considered equity.  In other words, the State did not have to put in an extra &euro;3 billion in equity that it would have had to if the deferred tax assets had been disallowed.  It is very simple and therefore it was capital goods from the State's perspective.  It is really a choice issue in terms of how the Government and the Department of Finance considers the matter.  Currently, based on closing prices last night, our bank trades at a market cap of approximately &euro;14.9 billion.  Included in that is a deferred tax asset of &euro;3 billion.  The price to book - how much people pay relative to the book value - is 1.12.  They are paying 12% more than the book value of the assets.  This is choice for the State.  Does it want to realise the cash by selling the asset now and getting cash upfront or does it want to get rid of the deferred tax asset and effectively recover it in the form of corporation tax?  It is not our decision and it is part of the taxation matter on the land.  Personally, I believe the State has benefited from the treatment of deferred tax as it went in and it can currently benefit from it in terms of a sell-down position.  That is a personal view but the Government decides what to do in respect of taxation policy.  All we do is comply with what is there and operate to that system.  My comments are more about how we can see this playing out more positively if the Revenue Commissioners get the money earlier rather than later.</p></speech>

We are here today to discuss the Paradise Papers.  I want to deal with that.  Mr. Byrne's presentation was very short.  I have no doubt brevity is the soul of wit but his presentation was particularly concise.  What we have read in the media is a lot more expansive.</p> <p>  Mr. Byrne mentioned that &pound;2.458 billion was the amount in 2008.  What was the peak?  We are looking at 1977 and 1981.  What did deposits peak at in terms of offshoring in the Isle of Man and Jersey?  What level did they peak at?  What was the absolute highest?</p></speech>

The 2008 number was the one we took, which was the date of the guarantee.  I am happy to look back and figure out what it is.

Our job here is to ask the questions.  What we were reading in the papers is that from 1977 to 1981, which coincided with when the DIRT accounts were coming in for ordinary deposit holders, many of whom I dealt with when I was in practice, a lot of the money was put into non-residential accounts by AIB and other banks.  A lot of them dated back to 1977 and 1981.  Were some of these accounts that were in the Isle of Man at that time DIRT accounts for ordinary deposit holders who ended up in many cases paying 500% in liabilities?  I am not even certain if many of them were fully aware of what they were doing at the time.  The banks put them into non-residential accounts.</p> <p>  The Paradise Papers give the impression that AIB was using the offshore accounts in the Isle of Man and Jersey in two ways.  In many cases they were deemed to be tax havens and the deposits that were received were being used to fund operations in Ireland.  They were effectively a conduit and people were told to put the money offshore, that they would not pay tax and get the best of both worlds.  People would not pay tax but the bank would get to use their deposits to grow its business in Ireland.  What does Mr. Byrne say to that?  That is what comes across in the Paradise Papers.  From the papers, it looks as though AIB split into pre-1998 and post-1998 in terms of offshore accounts.  Post-1998 it would only allow funds offshore for legitimate tax planning but it was not giving that assurance to pre-1998 deposits.  </p> <p>  Our job is to probe what came forward in the Paradise Papers and the veracity of the papers for the information of the public and to hear from AIB.  Mr. Byrne might comment on that.  I have given a flavour of what I believe is coming across in the Paradise Papers.</p></speech>

We can give colour and flavour but what happened in history happened in history and we can in no way control or influence what that was.  We ended up with a very dramatic event in 2010, which was the entire recapitalisation of what was a bankrupt institution at that point in time and a complete change going forward.

The Senator has talked about the 1990s period.  There seems to have been a complete change in the 1998 era in terms of AIB offshore activities and whether other institutions would accept Irish resident accounts.  That did seem to change.  It is reasonably clear that is the policy that applied for 1998.  Therefore, by implication, something must have happened before that.  The investigation process with the Revenue has evolved and the fact there was a 1990s period that need to be settled suggests that those things happened.</p></speech>

We have ordinary people coming to us, who earn just above the average industrial wage, and they are paying nearly 50 cent on the euro in tax.  They see something that was going on for many years and they are asking how and why it happened and are asking us to ensure it will never happen again.  They are saying there are two worlds.  Some people are paying heavy tax, trying to educate their children, pay their mortgages yet the institution with which they hold their mortgages and which holds them to account to pay their mortgage on a monthly basis was facilitating high-worth individuals having money offshore a short distance away in the Isle of man and Jersey and paying no tax.  These are questions we have to ask.</p></speech>

The licence was handed back and the entity formally ceased in 2013, but from the date of first notification to the regulator, there was no new business activity.  Everything was about the closure of the business.  There was no new business activity from 2012 and the entire entity closed in 2013, with the banking licence being handed back.

During the early part of this year we went through an intensive process to market the institution to international investors.  Between ourselves and the advisers appointed from the various investment banks, there were 1,400 individual meetings with international institutions.  Some were double up meetings at which they might have met us and a broker.  Many of the meetings were with just one person, but some of them might have been attended by 100 people.  There was a huge marketing campaign throughout Ireland and in AIB because one would not buy AIB unless one liked Ireland and one had to like both to participate.  There was a great deal of interest and we were pleased the initial public offering, IPO, at the back end of June had seen its way through a lot of turbulent activity.  The stock and markets have since performed well, which has been positive.  My commentary generally is that these processes come and go.  If there is a market and a willing investor set that understands the story now because stories change over time, it is often opportune to take advantage of it.  The State has a long-term objective of exiting.  As of close of business last night, the total value of cash received, plus 71% of the market value, equated to &euro;20.8 billion, which people would have said was fanciful a few years ago when we sat in this room.  We are at that position at this time.  I cannot tell the Senator what will happen next regarding valuations, but there is an opportunity which looks attractive.  Investors understand the story and have an interest in it.  They like Ireland.</p></speech>

The last time we made a public statement, we commented on the fact that we had progressed pretty well.  On the total number of cases that have been identified and in which compensation has been paid, we are at a figure of more than 90%.  We have progressed well with those we have identified, but we have always said the programme will continue within the remit of the Central Bank and that it will not conclude until 2018.</p></speech>

In responding to the previous questioner, Deputy O'Donnell, I referenced the issue of Revenue writing to us.  I talked about that at that point in time.</p> <p>  The two points are that the data in respect of those customers resided in and is owned by an offshore entity.  Therefore, any process to request that data has to go through the owner of the data.  The Revenue has a protocol and system in place with the Isle of Man, as I understand it, where it can do that.  I am not aware whether it has or has not done that.  That is its protocol that it can comply with.  We have given all the data that we can, and that is in full compliance with the order, which is within our control.  That is what is being complied with.</p></speech>

I will read it to refresh Mr. Byrne's memory.  It states:</p><blockquote>In 2006, AIB was introducing a centralised transaction processing and data storage capability in the Republic.  In February of that year, Ray O'Connor, the head of group taxation with AIB in Dublin, wrote to Howland in the IOM suggesting that they get legal advice on whether outsourcing their data to the Republic might create a risk for their offshore branch.  <br /><br />&quot;Under current Irish legislation [this is a quote from the document that has been seen] one relevant point is whether the data could be within the &quot;power, possession and procurement&quot; of AIB plc and therefore within the scope of a potential information request from Revenue.  ... </blockquote> <p>Is this not AIB plc basically facilitating its offshore entity to make sure that it was completely out of reach of the Irish tax authorities while at the same time the witnesses knew damn well that they had Irish residents who were using that offshore account to avoid taxation in this State?</p></speech>

The way the Deputy has read it makes it sound like it was legitimate to query whether it was going to have data ownership implications.  I do not know.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-14a.1177" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017121400002#L00200"><p>We can all take different interpretations.  Obviously, this did not come under the centralised system.  If that had happened, however, perhaps Revenue would not have had to go through this process and possibly we would not have had to wait for these leaks for whatever version of AIB we are talking about to provide this data.  Is it not the case that if this warning had not been issued, and it did come under the centralised transaction processing and data storage capability of the Republic, it would have come under the scope of Revenue?</p></speech>

On that issue, does Mr. Byrne acknowledge that the subsidiary had legacy customers?  The previous Deputy mentioned that in 1998, AIB Isle of Man started accepting only those residents of Ireland who could avail of legitimate tax planning opportunities.  A note drafted for a board meeting of AIB Isle of Man in 2004 broke the business into legacy customers from before 1998 and post-1998 customers who had legitimately availed of the bank's services.  For how long did AIB continue to facilitate legacy customers who, we can infer, illegitimately availed of the bank's services and who, through the structure that was created, were out of the reach of the Irish tax authorities?</p></speech>

I do not know the answer to the Deputy's question about how the banking activities and operations of the business continued.  Obviously, the provision of services continued at that stage.  As I have mentioned, there was a settlement with Revenue in respect of any 1990s data issues associated with Irish customers which could not be resolved.</p></speech>

It is claimed that after the bailout in which we pumped billions of euro into AIB, an offshore entity of that bank continued to have the deposits of customers who were Irish residents in offshore accounts, thereby enabling those people to avoid tax.

It is important to say that again.  Mr. Byrne has a responsibility to answer on behalf of AIB past and present.  I have time for Mr. David Duffy, who drew a handsome salary from the State for many years, but he is refusing to come here to answer questions about what happened during this time when he was in charge of AIB.  Therefore, we have to put these questions to Mr. Byrne who has a responsibility to answer for others.  Will he find out whether a subsidiary of AIB plc was facilitating legacy customers after the bailout?  Is that something Mr. Byrne can find out?</p></speech>

That is a judgment call by all of us.  The entire sentence, which refers to how deposits "declined rapidly" from the peak in 2008 to a low figure of &pound;191 million in 2012, gives us a certain impression.  We have information that the post-bailout peak was in 2010, which suggests that what Mr. Byrne is stating to this committee is not true.  Irish taxpayers pumped billions of euro into AIB in 2010, which makes it an important year.  The information we have is also held by Mr. Byrne.  He told me in response to my first question that he read Colm Keena's article.</p></speech>

It refers to a document that was produced in 2011, in which "the offshore bank said it remained 'a key provider of funding for AIB' with deposit balances peaking at &pound;2.8 billion in June 2010", which is substantially higher than the figure claimed by Mr. Byrne.  The article goes on to note that "by April 2011, deposits had fallen to &pound;1.36 billion".  That is important because Mr. Byrne gave the impression that deposits declined rapidly after 2008.  The truth is that 2008 was not the peak.  During the nationalisation period, when people had to put their hands in their pockets and mothers and fathers had to say goodbye to their sons and daughters at Dublin Airport because of the financial crisis, we saw a peak in deposits in this offshore entity.  Some people might think that is insignificant, but I think it is very significant.  Has AIB looked at that?  It has many staff members.  I assume some of them have looked at Colm Keena's article.  I have asked whether the bank disputes any of the facts set out in it.  Is this one of the facts that it disputes?  Perhaps it simply does not know whether this fact is the truth.</p></speech>

I do not ascribe the same level of significance to it, or I had not done so up until this point.  I am thinking about a different perspective from the perspective the Deputy is thinking about.  I will take it away.  We will look at what the peak was.</p></speech>

As I said in my opening statement, the reason for this was to encourage anyone who could and would be willing to come forward to create the beginning of the process, which ultimately resulted in the Revenue raising the &euro;1 billion mentioned by the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners.  I think he was simply following a request, which appears sensible in the context of encouraging people to make a qualified disclosure.  That is a system that exists under the Taxes Acts and it has been used many times in many circumstances effectively to start a process of encouraging people to come forward.  I understand that not that long ago, Revenue initiated a similar process in respect of overseas accounts in different jurisdictions.  It is part of the Revenue toolkit.  I did not read much more into it than that but perhaps my perspective is incorrect.</p></speech>

Mr. Byrne mentioned that his objective today is to talk about the future and what is happening now, which I believe.  However, that is not my objective.  What is important is that we establish to what extent AIB facilitated tax avoidance and tax evasion and thereby a substantial robbery of the public purse.</p> <p>  Mr. Byrne referred in his opening statement to the establishment of the offshore presence in the Isle of Man and Jersey in 1977 and 1981 and he said that the rationale for establishing this offshore presence was to support the bank's growing business franchise in Britain and the United States and to meet the banking needs of the increasing international workforce.  Was that really the rationale for the establishment of those offshore entities?  Jersey and the Isle of Man have populations of approximately 80,000 and 160,000 respectively.  What is special about them is that they are jurisdictions that have extensive banking secrecy laws and so I believe that the primary rationale for establishing those entities was to facilitate tax avoidance and tax evasion.</p></speech>

Rather it is because they are jurisdictions wherein there are significant banking secrecy laws.</p></speech>

Sorry, I do not think we knew the time period to which the Deputy was referring.  The point is still true, which is that the data owner has the overall obligation, kept it and has a legal obligation in that respect.  It is important to point out that the Legislature has thought of this point and the only reason that High Court orders exist in respect of the data is to balance and recognise in law the requirement that a High Court judge can sit and determine whether it is appropriate that the owner of data of interest to the Revenue be entitled to pass them on to the Revenue.  It is not an unusual principle.  All legal systems have a principle addressing the protection of data.</p></speech>

The strategic intent was that the offshore businesses were non-core.  That then became a detailed implementation plan decision at the end of December 2011, which I have discussed, which then rolled into 2012.  As that decision was coming and was given to local management, they put in a position paper stating they believed the entity could have an existence and a viable future.  It may be in that context that that piece is coming out of the documentation, although I am not sure of that.  However, the view of local management was not supported by the group and was not followed.  It is not unusual for the management of a subsidiary with 300 employees that was about to be closed down to say they think there is a future for the business.  However, it did not become policy or a position for the group.</p></speech>

I asked him about this matter and he has repeatedly stated that this statement in the article was inaccurate: "Leaked files from the Isle of Man (IOM) offices of offshore law firm Appleby reveal Government-owned AIB also refused to give the Revenue Commissioners access to data on its offshore customers when responding to a court order in 2015."  Again and again Mr. Byrne has said that is inaccurate-----</p></speech>

We deal with this issue regularly in terms of banking positions.  For example, our UK banking entity, which is based in London, is subject to the Prudential Regulation Authority, PRA, and UK law.  There is a very clear code, which applies for all Crown jurisdictions, regarding the independence of mind in respect of subsidiary activities.  It is part of the regulatory obligations.  The entity exists and has a legal personality and a form.  It has rights, responsibilities and obligations.  Data is one of those.  I understand the point the Deputy is making; it is not that I do not understand it.  Unfortunately, however, the law is the law in respect of that issue and it is different.  Subsidiaries exist and they have to obey the law.</p></speech>

Deputy Pearse Doherty said that the peak in those offshore accounts went up from &euro;2.4 billion in 2008 to &euro;2.8 billion by 2010.  Would it be fair to say that at the time the banks would have been scrambling for deposits, the bank would have to get deposits from wherever it could and that it still kept getting deposits into those offshore accounts?</p></speech>

No matter what deposit base was in the Isle of Man it could not be flowed and used as a funding vehicle after that date for regulatory reasons in those countries.  It would not matter what the balance was because, effectively, the local regulator said one cannot upstream those deposits.</p></speech>

In terms of the liquidity position of the bank, in 2008 and 2009 there were no specific liquidity requirements as there are now, so they would not have been included.  If we were to rerun the calculations today they probably would be included.  Deposits generally would be included.  However, they would count in each separate legal entity and each separate licensed entity.  The Isle of Man would have its own liquidity requirement.  AIB Plc and AIB as an operating entity subject to the licence requirements of Ireland would have its own requirement, so they would not be grouped.  There is no group piece.</p></speech>

I am asking about policy in respect of access to information.  Mr. Byrne has made it clear that the Revenue Commissioners does not have reach into the data held by AIB in the Isle of Man.

On CAB, I do not know personally.  I will ask Ms Dooley to respond to that.  The second point still applies, which is that one is not allowed to make a comment either way in respect of anything to do with the CAB.  That is a legal obligation.  One cannot make a comment as to whether somebody is or is not subject to something.  That is my understanding of it.  The third point is that we referred to the fact that the Revenue Commissioners have other routes to access information as a result of protocols and agreements with the Isle of Man authorities.  The question we are answering is in respect of our ability, not the Revenue Commissioners' ability, to use other channels.  I do not know the position for other entities such as the CAB.</p></speech>

At the time it became clear and was accepted that AIB and other banks were involved in tax avoidance of almost an industrial scale with their customers.  It was not a matter of conjecture but was proved to be the case.  As well as the debates we had at the Committee of Public Accounts in 2003 and 2004, it resulted in a change in the law.</p> <p>  The Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2004 made it an offence to aid and abet, conceal and counsel customers in tax avoidance and tax evasion, but I am not aware of any conviction arising from the Act since.  In actual fact, several years ago, relating to HSBC and deposits held in France, the then chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, Ms Josephine Feehily, made it clear that the 2004 Act was completely insufficient.  She made a point that tax inspectors would have to be standing beside the tax official and client to actually prove a case to the criminal level of proof required.  That is still the case with regard to our tax evasion laws.  I am not asking the delegates to comment on that matter as I am asking the wrong people the question.  However, perhaps the delegates have an opinion on the current tax law, as it pertains to bank officials and tax evasion generally.</p></speech>

We believe we comply with all of the laws in place.  Our objective is to ensure we are compliant and encourage customers to be compliant.  We do not offer tax advice and it has not been part of our business structure for quite a while.  If we find evidence that people are doing it, it is not part of our policy, but they will be subject to normal internal disciplinary procedures.  It is not what we are about and it is not worth trying to target or do.  We comply with the law and our objective is encourage compliance.</p></speech>

Even though the law was changed based on the work we did in 2003, I am dubious about the efficacy and utility of the Act passed in 2004.  That has been verbalised by the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners since.</p></speech>

We issue in the region of 5,000 suspicious transaction reports a year, based on the methodology and the application of principles whereby we say it is a matter of which Revenue or the Garda needs to be aware.</p></speech>

This is not directed at Mr. Byrne or his bank.  However, I am not sure why people are surprised when it comes to continuing tax evasion and tax avoidance as it pertains to certain financial institutions.  We need to go back and take a look at the laws which govern this area.  Certainly, when it comes to the Revenue Commissioners, they are still of the opinion that the laws are not sufficient when it comes to governing the entire area.</p></speech>

At the last count, we had 120 companies in the group which grew by one this week when the new holding company was established.  I accept that 121 companies is a lot.  The reasons largely stem from the past when we acquired many entities.  There was also a practice in the past that if activity did not require to be undertaken under a banking licence, it was included in a separate subsidiary.  That is not the practice we follow today.  We intend to undertake an exercise to simplify the structure and reduce the number of subsidiaries.  Of the 121, probably 100 are in Ireland.</p></speech>

The EBS still has its own banking licence as part of a regulated entity.  Both the EBS and AIB have subsidiaries, some of which provide mortgage finance.  To comply with certain elements of legislation in including mortgages in certain structures to obtain finance, we each have subsidiaries in that respect.  As a result, they can build.  One of our tasks - it has not been highest on the list - is to go through some of them and remove dormant entities.</p></speech>

I would like to ask for clarification, because I agree with Ms Dooley, it is confusing.  Mr. Byrne was talking about AIB plc, and he omitted the comma at one point.  People watching might laugh, but is it the case that there is an an AIB plc?  Is there a UK company called "AIB plc"?</p></speech>
