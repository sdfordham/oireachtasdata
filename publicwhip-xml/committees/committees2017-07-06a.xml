Whether we like it, disagree with it or are happy with it is another issue.  Does anyone want to make a specific comment on the matter?  </p></speech>

I find it extraordinary that when Caranua and the Department were here before us, and please correct me if I am wrong but I think the Secretary General of the Department attended on that occasion, nobody seemed to know the rental position and least of all Caranua.  Originally Caranua said it did not pay rent and the matter has since been clarified.  I mention this matter because at that point, Caranua said it was not paying rent and subsequently corrected itself.  The Department official who attended the meeting did not know anything about rent.  We now have a letter dated 16 June informing us that from the very beginning, the Department of Education and Skills directed that Caranua had to pay.</p></speech>

The fact that Caranua did not pay and allowances were made for it is to be welcomed.  I have a difficulty with the fact that the official from the Department of Education and Skills sat in on the meeting on that day yet it took until 16 June and our persistence to find out the position.  I still have no idea why further provision was not made for Caranua in the circumstances but that is for a different forum.  I am most unhappy with the way the information has been relayed to us.  I am also unhappy that rent amounting to approximately &euro;250,000 will be taken every year, if one takes VAT into account, in a fund that was specifically set up under statutory obligations to support victims who had attended institutions.  I shall leave the matter at that for today.  I am most unhappy with the Department of Education and Skills and that Caranua must now pay almost &euro;250,000 when there should be no need for it to do so.  Caranua should be facilitated in appropriate buildings that are owned by the State.</p> <p>  Prior to Caranua being set up, a different forum existed under the direct guidance or direct-----</p></speech>

Essentially, it boils down to the position being well known by all of the public bodies involved - the OPW, the Department of Education and Skills and Caranua.  There was a lack of candour and being upfront.  No-one told us straight up on the first day we asked the question.  We should not have had to go to such an extent to extract the information that we have received.  We might not like the information but it was well known to everybody who sat opposite us at all stages.  We had to extract the information.  It felt like we were pulling teeth.</p></speech>

We have a special report on financial reporting in the public sector, although it might not be relevant.  It deals with accounts and the presentation of information.

We expect them to assist us.  The point is well made and we will come back to it.  That is the OPW situation.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 625B, correspondence received on 30 June 2017 from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The document provides an analysis of expenditure relating to the Garda College division from 2009 to 2016 as requested by the committee.  We note and publish that and will discuss it as part of our compilation and report on the Templemore issue.</p> <p>  The next two items, Nos. 654B(i) and 654B(ii), comprise correspondence, dated 29 June, from Dr. Brendan Murphy, President of Cork Institute of Technology, on the 2015 financial statements.  This was requested at our meeting.  I have asked the people finalising the report on third-level institutions to review the document.  We hope to have the final sign-off on that education report in private session later today.  I have asked for anything that needs to be in our draft report to be brought forward.  In fairness, it is a good and comprehensive reply on the information we sought.  We have to acknowledge that a lot of information has been provided there.</p> <p>  The next item is correspondence dated 30 June from the Dublin Institute of Technology enclosing a breakdown of the library budget and legal fees for 2014 to 2016.  That or extracts from it can be considered for inclusion our report which we hope to finalise this afternoon and launch early next week.  We will come to our work programme shortly.  The correspondence is noted and will be published.</p> <p>  The next item is correspondence dated 3 July 2017 from Mr. John Barrett, executive director of human resources and people development in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We will come to that in a minute with the other Garda correspondence to take the two together.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 659B, correspondence received on 30 June 2017 from University College Cork enclosing information requested at the meeting of 22 June on the acquisition of IMI and on the Irish Maritime and Energy Research Cluster, IMERC, of companies.  I have asked for that information to be taken into consideration in the report we hope to finalise this afternoon.  In fairness, UCC provides comprehensive answers to the questions we asked.  We have good information there.  It is interesting that both CIT and UCC deal with a common interest in the IMERC and have provided a briefing note on the group of companies.  We received the same document from both on foot of our questions last week.</p></speech>

It is an extensive document.  They explain all the different subsidiaries.  When the representatives from the college appeared before us, we asked the president about the acronym SNO and whether it is the name of a company.  He could not provide full information on the day.  It is called SEFtec NMCI Offshore Limited.  That is where he got SNO Limited.  He has given us exact details of the company and the other subsidiaries.  The question was asked whether they paid Cork Institute of Technology for the use of its facilities.  It is confirmed that the company paid &euro;242,680 excluding VAT in respect of its costs before there was any dividend.  They also paid dividends of &euro;340,000 to CIT.  The functioning, costs and contributions of those organisations is well set out in the letter.  It is good to get that because the question was asked specifically the last day.</p></speech>

I asked for clarification on the internal audit and the procedure on it going to the board of governors.  I asked about the external review of IMERC, its status and a copy of it.  I asked for clarification as to whether a senior lecturer or lecturers had been appointed in non-compliance with procedures.  That information was not available.  They were to clarify those three things for me.</p></speech>

There are 17 pages in that.  In fact, both UCC and CIT provided the same report.  I see a reference to the internal audit committee in the reply from UCC also.  During the course of the next couple of hours, we might have an opportunity to review that in private session at least.  They appear to have provided good information.  That is UCC, CIT and some information from DIT on the library issue.  We note and publish all of those and will deal with them in private session before we complete our report later on today.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 649C, correspondence from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, in reply to a request from the committee for a response to correspondence sent to the committee by an individual on the use of public funds to obtain legal advice.  I propose to forward the reply from the Department to the correspondent.  We have dealt with it extensively and that is a further reply from the Department.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Next item is No. 650, correspondence of 23 June from an organisation on a complaint being investigated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the winding up of the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland in 2014.  The committee has been copied with the correspondence but it is addressed to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As such, we note it but someone else is acting on it.</p><p>No. 651C is correspondence received from a number of individuals with regard to Clonkeen College in Blackrock, County Dublin.  This was discussed last week and the secretariat has written to the Department of Education and Skills for a response.  I propose that we write to the correspondents informing them that we are awaiting a response and will contact them when have it.  Is that agreed? Agreed.  <br/><br/>No. 656C is correspondence dated 30 June 2017 from the chief executive officer of Horse Racing Ireland in response to a query sent by the committee about Dundalk racetrack and how much it actually costs, as well as various issues around loans and debenture which had been granted over the assets of the company.  This issue goes back several years but we will note this and send a copy of that response to the individual who wrote to us. <br/><br/>No. 657C is correspondence dated<b></b>2 July 2017 from an individual and concerns an investigation by the Revenue Commissioners into a complaint made by the individual as an employee.  I propose we write to Revenue to establish the process for hiring companies to carry out investigations of this nature.  The individual is, I believe, now a former employee.  We will wait for a reply and ask Departments and public bodies questions on their processes and procedures if there is a loss to the taxpayer.<br/><br/>Before I complete the correspondence there are two more items I want to bring to the committee's attention.  The first of these is item No. 658B, dated 3 July 2017, from Mr. John Barrett, executive director of human resources and people development at An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The document refers to matters concerning evidence heard by this committee about Templemore Garda College that Mr. Barrett believes is incorrect.  Other matters covered include the handling of a complaint about Mr. Barrett, a tracing methodology in respect of EU funds and a timeline of events from 2015 to present.  We will note that and consider it as part of drafting our report.  We had a meeting in private session yesterday and are scheduled to have another meeting next Tuesday.  We can discuss that then.  Would any member like to make any particular comment on this at this stage?</p></speech>

I just want to be clear about the status of any documentation that we get at this point.  Claims may be made that need to be either substantiated or examined.  Is it the case that it is not possible for us to do so at this point?</p></speech>

We will have no more public meetings so we have to conclude.  If there are issues on which we cannot conclude then we will just have to state that and consider them for further examination in part two of our report, which will be carried out after the summer recess.</p> <p>  Finally, we come to No. 663(i).  This is from Mr. John Nugent, chief administrative officer, and concerns various questions we asked in public session.  It is a short letter, less than a page, and I think we need to put it on the public record because it follows up on matters on the public record and directly replies to us.  I am also informed that further information from Mr. Nugent arrived in this morning.  This is currently being circulated.  All of this will have to be taken into account before we finalise our report on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The information here is not extensive but there is some information that is relevant to what we have been discussing. </p> <p>  The first issue in this letter concerns Mr. Culhane and Mr. Howard and responds to Mr. Culhane's earlier correspondence about the draft internal audit interim report.  The letter states that a recent meeting of the Committee for Public Accounts confirmed the Garda Commissioner initially sought legal advice over this serious matter and that Mr. Culhane was consequently invited to respond to Mr. Howard's correspondence.  The letter then goes on to say that Mr. Culhane responded and confirmed that he has withdrawn the two letters to Mr. Kelly, the internal auditor, at the Committee of Public Accounts, including the comments he made about Mr. Kelly's professionalism, personal motives and integrity.</p> <p>  We need to verify the transcript.  I know that I discussed this issue with Mr. Culhane and that he certainly did withdraw certain comments.  I do not specifically recall him withdrawing those two letters before this committee, which is what this letter said he did.  When the Commissioner was in here the second time I specifically asked her about the status of that letter, whether it still stood and whether it would still be standing by the time we came to producing our report. If that was the case, we would have to conclude that it reflected the official position of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Both she and Mr. Nugent said that the matter was going through a process.  We now have a letter saying that it was withdrawn in public session several weeks earlier.  This letter contradicts what we were told at the subsequent public meeting.  We need to get this verified.  It is possible that we missed the full withdrawal of the letter in public session.  If we did then we would be happy to put that formally on the record but first we need that verified.</p></speech>

This correspondence is, unfortunately, still coming in to us now, at the 11th hour.  They know that we are up against the clock and that we have to get a report out.  It strikes me that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is waiting until the very last minute to give us the information we need.  Does the Chairman know if there is still a deficit of information?</p></speech>

This is to be welcomed on one level but cannot take away from any perceived failures in process and procedures.  Retractions and withdrawals can be noted but we are dealing with what happened in real time.  This needs to stated clearly.  We can welcome and acknowledge withdrawals and retractions but they should not influence our report.</p></speech>

If this committee did not receive the full level of co-operation expected then that in itself will be an issue in our final report.  I am putting that on the record here now.  To corroborate what Deputy Cullinane just said, this letter from Mr. Culhane would never have been withdrawn, if it is indeed withdrawn, but for the fact that it was raised here at the Committee of Public Accounts.</p></speech>

There are a lot of remarks about other people and we have not tested these either.  I do not expect that we will be able to include this as part of an appendix to a published report of the Committee of Public Accounts.  We will have to discuss this.  We would have to go through the letter line by line to see if we could put our names to including it in our report.  There is certainly information here that we can work into the report but full publication is a different issue.</p></speech>

For one thing, I must say that I found it very helpful.  It contains opinion, certainly, but there is no difficulty in discounting that.  It also points to certain facts that I found to be very helpful.  I read this in advance of yesterday's meeting in private session and gave my view of the issues arising from it.</p><p>As far as I am concerned, there is wilful delay on the part of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are being drip fed information in response to very simple questions.  The letter from Mr. Nugent to do with Mr. Culhane is a kind of catch-all to cover all the bases, having been dragged kicking and screaming to give some kind of a response.  I recall him withdrawing comments under pressure, but, in the first instance, how does one withdraw a letter?  Had Mr. Culhane written to Mr. Kelly and copied to us an apology, a seeking to withdraw, a regret and all the rest of it, that might be one thing, but this is in effect a third party, albeit the line manager, writing on behalf of someone-----</p></speech>

I have read this morning's correspondence as well.  While there are these full pages with brief comments on item this and item that, it is a box ticking exercise.  One issue came up in the stuff that I read this morning about the 50 accounts.  It said all are closed except those that are private or club accounts.  That is an issue for me.  What private and club accounts?  What money is in those?</p></speech>

We received this letter yesterday and I think another one came late yesterday evening.  It might have been circulated last night or this morning.  From that point of view, it came in.  However, what we have to adjudicate next week is the replies we did not get, that is, that which is outstanding.  If something happens or we get useful information, we are pragmatists.  We are not giving an extension but we will not ignore it next Tuesday.  Definitely not.</p></speech>

The other thing is that a letter would have gone to the Central Bank about the credit union.  I am presuming it did go.  I had understood that it was being sent more than a week ago.

We will note that.</p> <p>  The next item is the work programme.  To be clear, today I am proposing, once we finish this session, to bring in the officials from the Department of Finance to deal with the Finance Vote.  In the afternoon, we will have those from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in regard to its Votes.  That session will also include the special report on financial reporting in the public service which the Comptroller and Auditor General produced a little while ago.  We will discuss that with the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the afternoon.</p> <p>  Before we get to that session, I want to have a private meeting to utterly finalise the education report which we hope - it is not definite - to launch next Tuesday.  We are at a very advanced stage.  If we complete the session with the Department of Finance before the voting block, we will start into that private session.  If not, I really want to finish with the Department of Finance before the voting block and then we will commence immediately after the voting to sign off on the education report during a short private session.  We will then move onto the session with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  That is the working plan.  If we leave signing off the education report until after the session with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, it will be later on in the day and some members may not be able to be here at that stage, so we will get that cleared.</p> <p>  As I said, we are meeting in private session next week in regard to the Templemore report.  The other thing I want to highlight relates to next week's meeting.  The Garda Commissioner will be in to deal with the Garda Vote.  There will also be officials from the Courts Service to deal with its Vote.  There will be a joint session with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service to discuss the collection of fines and the penalty points issue.</p> <p>  We asked that the report on the number of breath tests was to be dealt with as well but we were informed last night that the report is not expected to be finished by next Thursday.  It was one of the items that was on our agenda.  We are informed that the report is not expected until the end of the month.  Therefore, we will not be able to deal with the issue in any great detail.  We had scheduled this to be our last meeting of the year to give time to have this report done.  We were informed last night that it will not be finished in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na until the end of the month.  By the way, I wish to say that Deputy Commissioner Twomey will not be available on that day.  However, the Commissioner is here as the principal witness with her two assistant commissioners.  Therefore, it is only out of courtesy that I am saying that he personally cannot be here on that day, but the report will not be available to us on that day.  I think that is a matter-----</p></speech>

The Committee on Justice and Equality has dealt with the issue already.  At that point, it was expected that there would be answers to questions.  Here we are months later.  We had scheduled the meeting but the report is still not complete, which means that the public still does not have answers to those questions as to exactly what happened.  I imagine it will now be the autumn before we can come back to it.  Is that so?</p></speech>

I will commence by speaking about the finance accounts.  The annual finance accounts present the receipts into and issues from the Central Fund of the Exchequer, together with a set of statements that itemise the transactions.  The financial statements of the national debt, which are prepared by the National Treasury Management Agency, are presented in full as Part 2 of the finance accounts.</p> <p>  The finance accounts provide a statement of Central Fund transactions on a cash basis and are not a comprehensive set of annual financial statements for the State or central government.  All revenues of the State are paid into the Central Fund of the Exchequer, unless otherwise determined by law.  Examples of State revenue which is not paid directly into the Central Fund include PRSI receipts which are paid into the Social Insurance Fund and the proceeds of motor tax which are paid into the local government fund.</p> <p>  The chapters that are the subject of today&rsquo;s meeting were compiled to highlight key aggregates and trends in Central Fund transactions and in broader State liabilities. </p> <p>  Chapter 1 summarises the Exchequer outturn for 2015.  Receipts in 2015 totalled &euro;58.6 billion, representing an increase of &euro;8.9 billion, or 18%, compared with 2014.  This was mainly due to increases in tax revenues of &euro;4.3 billion and a number of one-off capital receipts totalling &euro;3.6 billion.</p><p>Issues from the Central Fund in 2015 of &euro;58.7 billion were &euro;750 million or 1.3% higher than in 2014.  The movement in Central Fund receipts and issues is shown in the diagram which is now on screen.  This indicates that in 2015 the Exchequer deficit was almost eliminated - the shortfall for the year was just &euro;64 million.  This compares to an Exchequer deficit of &euro;8.2 billion in 2014.</p><p> Members may wish to know that I issued my audit report on the finance accounts for 2016 last week.  It is the Department's responsibility to present the accounts to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</p><p> In chapter 2 of my report, I outline the trends and composition of Government debt and the cost of debt servicing.  The most comprehensive measure of Government debt is general Government debt.  This is an internationally standardised measure of the total gross debt owed by all Government bodies to third parties outside government.  At the end of 2015, the general Government debt stood at just over &euro;200 billion.  There was a very small decline in the level of debt year on year.  However, the ratio of general Government debt to GDP declined to 79% at the end of 2015 from 108% at the end of 2014.  This sharp reduction reflected an exceptional increase in the estimated value of Ireland's GDP in 2015, attributed to the activities of a small number of large multinational firms, including the relocation to Ireland in 2014-15 of a few big economic operators.</p><p> The main component of Ireland's general Government debt at the end of 2015 was the gross national debt.  This is the cumulative borrowing undertaken by the National Treasury Management Agency on behalf of the State.</p><p> Gross national debt stood at &euro;196.6 billion at the end of 2015, down marginally from the end of 2014.  The cost of servicing the national debt fell by 6% to &euro;7.1 billion in 2015.  This reflected a fall in the estimated average cost of servicing the debt, from 3.8% at the end of 2014 to 3.5% at the end of 2015.  By June 2016, the average had fallen further to 3.4%.</p><p> Turning now to chapter 18 in relation to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012 requires me to report to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann with respect to the correctness of the sums brought to account by the council each year.  Chapter 18 is my report for 2015.  My report on the audit was issued on 30 June 2016 and I gave a clear audit opinion.  Expenditure by the council in 2015 amounted to &euro;823,000.</p><p> The 2015 appropriation account for the Vote of the Office of the Minister for Finance records expenditure totalling &euro;26.3 million on five programme areas.  The expenditure on financial services policy recorded in the appropriation accounts is &euro;7.6 million.  However, it should be noted that this does not include costs associated with staff who are seconded to the Department from the NTMA to deal with banking sector issues, and certain related consultancy costs.  Those costs are borne by the NTMA and are not recouped from the Department.  The level of costs in that regard is not disclosed in either the appropriation account for Vote 7 or the NTMA's financial statements.  At the end of 2015, a net &euro;6.1 million was liable for surrender from Vote 7 back to the Exchequer.</p></speech>

I am joined by Ms Ann Nolan, second Secretary General, Mr. John McCarthy, chief economist, Mr. Derek Tierney, head of corporate affairs, and Mr. Fiachra Quinlan of the finance unit.<br/><br/>I would like to focus on the four specific items on today&rsquo;s agenda.  The first is Vote 7 and the 2015 appropriation accounts for the Department.  The Estimate for 2015 was set at &euro;30.6 million.  Spend for 2015 was &euro;24.4 million, leaving a surplus to be surrendered of approximately &euro;6.2 million.  This surplus arose for a number of reasons.  Recruitment did not progress at the pace anticipated, resulting in a pay bill underspend of around &euro;1.1 million and a further &euro;600,000 underspend on non-pay administration expenses.  There was also an underspend of &euro;3.1 million on programme related costs arising from the completion of some work in-house and lower costs in relation to the shareholder management unit.  The Department also recouped an additional &euro;500,000 in respect of costs associated with the stabilisation of the banking sector.  We remain committed to seeking to minimise costs where possible, subject to achieving the best outturn for the State.<br/><br/>I draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to the following key points.  Tax revenues for 2015, at &euro;45.6 billion, were up &euro;4.3 billion or 10.5% year on year and &euro;3.3 billion or 7.8% on profile.  Within that figure for tax revenues, the increase was distributed across the three key tax heads.  Income tax grew by 7%, corporation tax by 48.9% and VAT by 7.1% year on year.  On the expenditure side, total expenditure, at &euro;58.6 billion, was up &euro;700 million or 1.2% year on year.  This was driven by increased voted expenditure which showed an increase of &euro;600 million.<br/><br/>General Government debt as a percentage of GDP fell to 78.7% in 2015 from a peak of 119.5% in 2012.  This downward trend is projected to continue with a debt to GDP ratio of some 72.9% forecast for 2017, which is in line with the euro area average. <br/><br/>I would like briefly to turn to performance and outputs in recent years.  The Department was restructured around two directorates in 2016 &ndash; the economic and fiscal directorate and the finance and banking directorate.  This structure remains largely unchanged in 2017.  The Department is working towards achieving two broad goals, namely, a sustainable macroeconomic environment and sound public finances; and a balanced and equitable economy enabled by a restructured, vibrant, secure and well regulated financial sector. <br/><br/>I am greatly encouraged by the robust pace of the recovery in the economy, with GDP increasing by 5.2% last year.  The increase in economic activity is broadly based and economic fundamentals are strong.  Export growth in recent years has been robust and exports continue to contribute positively to growth.  This is a reflection of the progress which has been made to restore our competitiveness.  Notably, the domestic sector is now driving growth in the economy, with private consumption up 3% in 2016. <br/><br/>Recovery is perhaps most clearly evident in the labour market, with annual employment having increased in each of the last 18 quarters, representing an increase of 231,000 jobs since the low point in 2012.  Strong employment gains have driven a substantial turnaround in unemployment, which has fallen from a peak of more than 15% to 6.4% in May.<br/><br/>Key economic indicators point to continued solid growth this year.  The Department is forecasting growth of 4.3% this year and 3.7% next year.  Despite the pace of the recovery and the strength of our underlying economic fundamentals, we must be conscious of the uncertainty in the external environment which underlines the need for caution supported by prudent economic and fiscal policies.<br/><br/>Public finances also continue to move in the right direction, with significant progress being made on the general Government deficit.  Ireland exited the excessive deficit procedure in 2016 and it is planned to reach the medium-term objective of a structurally balanced budget in 2018.<br/><br/>Underpinned by a growing economy, the hard won improvements in our public finances provide a sustainable budgetary platform upon which funding for the provision of public services can be provided in the years ahead.  The market reaction to our management of the public finances has been positive but it is vital that we sustain our progress.  We must guard against complacency, maintain our prudent management of the public finances and continue with competitiveness oriented policies. <br/><br/>Brexit is one of the serious challenges for the economy<b>. </b>The Government approach has outlined twin Brexit goals, the first to secure the closest possible economic and trading relationship between the EU and UK, and the second to prepare the economy to cope with turbulence of coming years and the structural shift of new realities of Brexit.  The best and most immediate policy within the Government's control to counter the likely turbulence of coming years is to prudently manage the public finances to ensure Ireland's economy continues to remain competitive in the face of future economic headwinds. <br/><br/>The last budget outlined a number of policies targeted at the most exposed sectors, measures to support small and medium enterprises, entrepreneurship, agrifood, and exporters, while also targeting potential economic opportunities, such as competing for mobile international investment in the international financial services sector.  The Government has also put forward Dublin as an excellent location for the European Banking Authority post-Brexit.<br/><br/>A key focus for the Department in the past year has been the sale of the State's investment in AIB.  The successful capital reorganisation of the bank in 2015 provided a supportive backdrop for the commencement of this process and significant work has been undertaken by the Department and its advisers over this period to achieve a successful outcome for the State.  The recent completion of the initial public offering, IPO, represents a significant milestone and not only has it resulted in a substantial sum of money being returned to the State, but it also creates a strong platform for the State to recover all of the money it has invested in AIB over time.  At the end of this process, the State will continue to hold 71% of AIB, which is worth around &euro;9 billion, and will continue to be a substantial focus for the Department for some time. <br/><br/>As with any organisation, we must strive to evolve, improve and embed the skills necessary to the job at hand.  This is an ongoing process.  I am pleased to report that the Department was awarded the best learning and development organisation for 2017 for a medium-sized organisation as part of the Irish Institute of Training and Development awards.</p><p>The award is an endorsement of the commitment of the Department and its staff to the development of a learning culture focusing on both hard skills and those of leadership and management necessary for the job.</p><p> I express my appreciation to the staff at the Department for their ongoing hard work.  It is only through their continuing commitment and dedication that we can deliver on our objectives.  The Department will strive for continuous improvement and develop into the best organisation it can possibly be.

The delegates are very welcome.  I want to start with the Government debt.  In 2014, it was &euro;203 billion.  By 2015, it was &euro;201 billion.  The debt-GDP ratio dropped by 120% to 79%.  Am I right on that?</p></speech>

The year 2015 saw a very significant increase in GDP.  I recall a figure of 26%.  We do not have the details of the companies because the CSO collects that information.  If it is a small number, it does not make it public.  The figure resulted from a number of factors, primarily the onshoring of intellectual property, which has a very high capital content.</p></speech>

The net result was that we had a very big GDP number that drove down the debt ratios and, in fact, improved all the ratios.  Internationally, debt ratios and fiscal ratios are reported against GDP.  The net result is that we needed to look through the national accounts figures to see if we could develop an alternative that gave a truer picture of the underlying indebtedness of the State.  An expert group was set up under the chairmanship of the Governor of the Central Bank, with participation by Mr. McCarthy and a range of other people.  We anticipate, with the publication of the national accounts in a few weeks, that we will have the first indication of what is known as gross national income (Star), GNI*.  This will be a measure that cleans out a lot of those issues related to globalisation and it will give a truer sense of what the ratio should be.</p></speech>

With regard to aspects of that debt, I want to strip the matter back a little.  How is the turning of the promissory notes into sovereign debt captured?  I got a reply to a parliamentary question referring to the acceleration of the paying down of the debt.  A minimum amount was to be paid off.  I do not know the exact terminology.  The eight floating rate notes had a range of maturity dates from 2038 to 2053.  Between 2016 and 2018, the figure was to be &euro;0.5 billion per year.  From 2019 to 2023, it was to be &euro;1 billion per year, and from 2024 onwards, it was to be &euro;2 billion per year.  The process has been accelerated.  There is now an outstanding balance of &euro;17.5 billion in terms of floating rate notes.  Essentially, there has been an acceleration.  How is that reflected in the debt?</p></speech>

It is debt whether it is in the Central Bank or the NTMA.  To that extent, how it is stated is the same.  One reason the NTMA has accelerated the buy-back is that interest rates are extremely low at the moment.  I refer to floating rate notes.  If interest rates were to increase, it would increase on those notes.  If one can borrow for 20 years and lock in a low interest rate, one would be as well off to accelerate that swap.</p></speech>

I totally get the Deputy's political point that she does not believe the country should have accepted that debt.  They are Government bonds that rank <i>pari passu</i>whether they are held in the Central Bank or somewhere else.<br/><br/>In terms of the classification of debt and the issue of whether there was a game-changer, the argument from a purely market-based point of view was that unless there was a prospect of that debt being locked in for a long time, we could not have gone back into the markets and got the interest rates down to where they are now, which is an extremely low level, much lower than we would have imagined even when we did the deal.  Now that the interest rates are so low and there is a possibility of them going up, if we accept that it is debt, which we do, I, as a technician, have to accept it is debt and that the Government has taken it.</p></speech>

In terms of being prudent, to what extent is that factored into the management of the economy because, increasingly, we are seeing those costs absorbing huge amounts of household income?  Google, for example, said more than two years ago that accommodation was a real issue for it.  Is it a real issue for the Department of Finance in terms of prudently managing the economy?</p></speech>

It has consistently done that.</p> <p>  One of the issues that we have with success is that as employment numbers go up and as unemployment falls, we start to get to a capacity constraint.  We have got higher demand for goods such as housing and so on, but also as one gets down to near enough what technically would be full employment, let us say 5% or thereabouts, one starts to get those additional pressures and the potential for overheating within the economy.  I do not think we are quite there yet, but we have to and should be concerned about it.  In terms of cost of living and accommodation, everybody is very aware of the supply constraints within the housing sector.  That is a concern for all of Government and a set of policy responses is either in place or is being put in place.  The reality is that there is a big gap between demand and supply and that puts pressure on prices.</p></speech>

Competitiveness goes beyond simply wages.  There are lots of other issues as well, including the capacity constraints, for instance within the housing sector.</p> <p>  The increase in capital expenditure that has already been announced for 2018, including the additional funding for the Action Plan for Housing, is just shy of 17%, and there is an increase of nearly 15% in 2019.  At the moment we are looking at capital spending going from approximately 4.5% or 4.6% this year up to over &euro;7 billion on the basis of unchanged policies by 2021.  That has of course to be done within a fiscal framework.  There are fiscal rules that make sure we do not let debt and deficits get out of hand but the Government is prioritising capital expenditure within that envelope.  I do not want to get into policy.</p></speech>

Obviously a whole lot of things help to define it.  It is not just the Department of Finance.  I am acutely aware that local authorities, for example, hold several hundred million, for example, in development contributions that they are not permitted to spend because it is obviously keeping a balance in terms of the overall balance of the State's finances.  We heard recently from the universities when they were before the committee.  For example, there was a purchase by UCC of the IMI, both the company and the assets.  We heard from one of the witnesses that a look is being taken at other issues that might come into play as part of the debt that are not currently counted as part of it.  First, the Department has to have some controls and that is evident with local authorities but it does not seem to extend to all sectors, for example, the university sector.  Does that stand out in any particular way?</p></speech>

It is a question of what is on the Government balance sheet and what is off it.  The university sector is not on the Government's balance sheet.  There is a rule of thumb but it is much more complicated than this, but if an entity derives more than 50% of its income from non-governmental sectors it is outside the general Government expenditure and not counted in that piece.  Clearly, local authorities do not do that but the universities do.  They have to manage their affairs in that way so it does not fall within our remit.</p></speech>

I want to come back to the overall debt and the exposure as given that it can move in, equally, it can move out.

It will only leave the escrow when the determination is made at the end of whatever period of years the case takes.

One has to realise that the economy, as it grows, will increase the GDP, which is the denominator, and it will come down, not at the rate we saw in 2015 but it will come down.  As we move from a situation of borrowing large amounts of money to not borrowing, it will help with the ratio falling as well.  There is a dynamic there.  The affordability of debt is ultimately how much the economy earns in a year and its capacity to repay.</p></speech>

We pay more taxes and all of that.  In terms of our exposure, onshoring seems to me to be something to which we should be paying very serious attention.  Has a risk analysis been carried out in respect of it?  If it was to go back up to 120% as a result of an overnight change, how would it impact on us?</p></speech>

It is more a function of the nominal growth and such growth was 32% in 2015.  The onshoring or growth rate in 2015 reduced the debt ratio by 25 percentage points.  We published analysis in June which says that we do not have the GNI* available and GNI*, as the Secretary General mentioned, strips out some of these strange issues.  Our best estimate is that the debt ratio to GNI* is still in excess of 100%.  We will be able to calculate it accurately next Friday when the CSO publishes GNI* for the first time ever.  Our exposure is on the GNI* basis rather than the GDP.  The Deputy is absolutely right.  There is an exposure if this IP is very mobile.  It can move out as well as in.  In quarter 4 of last year, we saw more IP coming onshore in Ireland.  It is a risk so we carry out a debt sustainability analysis.  We have published our annual debt report.  What would be the impact on the debt ratio if for instance GDP was to fall by x% or x+2%, if interest rates were to go up or if there was a contingent liability shock?  We are doing that war-gaming, so to speak.</p></speech>

In the corporate tax space, there has been this base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process.  Part of the drive of that was to take intangible assets out of tax havens, usually small islands in the Caribbean, and bring them onshore to countries that had substantive and positive tax rates.  It is part of that process.  In some respects, the scale of it was more surprising than anything else.  Some of the impact on the national account is a result of the way the onshoring was structured.  What one will see over a period of years is more and more multinationals taking those intangible assets out of the Caribbean and bringing them into-----</p></speech>

A very important distinction is that when intellectual property is brought into the country, it has to be treated as a separate trade.  Capital allowances do not swamp the core activities of the companies.  It is treated as a separate trade.  The capital allowances are offset against that and, ultimately, taxed on that base.  It probably removes the risk to the corporate tax that has been paid within the jurisdiction.  This is real.  It is a consequence of what was happening around the BEPS process.</p></speech>

We did not see a whole lot of it in 2015.  There are very real things, such as housing, that have a real impact on the economy on a permanent basis.  Where, in theory, there are some funds available, our ability to borrow is one of the big impediments to solving this problem.  Would there be some value, in the context of being prudent in managing the economy, to invest more heavily in one of the things that is actually restricting growth in the domestic economy by virtue of the amount of money being absorbed by households in terms of the cost of accommodation.</p></speech>

We have a set of rules and those rules prescribed a direction.  There is a freedom for any Government to make a decision at any point to spend any amount of money but the rules require that we raise the moneys in a way that is sustainable, in other words through a tax or a charge or other channel.  We get into debates about fiscal space.  Fiscal space is only that piece we can do without going to discretionary revenue measures, without raising taxes.</p></speech>

The piece for the Civil Service costs goes back to the guarantee.  There is probably very little of that left now because there is hardly any of the guarantee left but there are other things that have happened subsequently where we have, for example, sold the preference shares.  It would have been in the original deeds of the preference shares that if we had expenses, they paid them.

The scale of what hit us before anybody else is quite significant, and Mr. McCarthy was a member of the group.  Ten or 11 countries showed a particular interest because they have a greater or less exposure around this.  In terms of what it is fundamentally, it is for us not to forget that we have a very high <i>per capita</i>debt and a huge sovereign debt burden.  The legal denominator will always be GDP for all the reports internationally, but there are differences in the structure of the Irish economy that we need to acknowledge.  GNI* gives us that metric to look at that.  We will see the number next Friday, but it will probably be around 100% compared to 73%, which I believe is our current estimate for the end of this year.  Mr. McCarthy might deal with our interest internationally.</p></speech>

As the Secretary General mentioned, other countries have this issue as well.  Within the EU 28, I am aware of 14 or 15 national statistical institutes that have identified onshoring of intellectual property, IP, as being an issue for them.  Some of them are large countries and the IP coming onshore is not ginormous, whereas we have the opposite.  We are a very small country in terms of IP coming onshore, so it completely distorts our accounts.  What we need to do is to try to get an indication in terms of repayment capacity.  Debt to GDP is not a good indicator of repayment capacity.  Debt to GNI* is.</p> <p>  The reality is that we are at the coalface in terms of these issues.  We are a very globalised economy and that presents challenges for us as advisers and for politicians in terms of making decisions, but also for statisticians in trying to measure what is going on because we have issues such as production that takes place in the Far East but which is included in the Irish national accounts for legal and statistical reasons.  There are huge statistical issues, so we believe GNI* will be a better indicator of what is going on in the economy.</p></speech>

It is perfectly plausible to me, especially when we have a debt ratio on a GNI* of 100% or &euro;201 billion, to be exact, that one should not finance this by issuing more debt.  If we decide that we have needs in a particular area, be it infrastructure or whatever, as I mentioned, we are doing it but we have to be able to finance it. That is not unreasonable.</p></speech>

If there are particular needs in one area, one makes choices around how that area is prioritised over others.

We did not get an adequate return for that.  That was a mistake.

Are we calculating the fiscal rules on measurements which are less reliable in this State than they are in other states?  I am not interested in the consequences.  We have to work within the fiscal rules and calculate how they work in this State.  We were calculating them on debt-to-GDP on GDP figures.  Mr. John McCarthy just said they are less reliable in this State because of the extent of how multinationals locate here.</p></speech>

The information content in GDP is much less in Ireland than it is in other countries.  We are still obliged to use GDP by our legal obligations.  International organisations and financial markets will continue to look at GDP because it is the internationally accepted norm.  GNI* is a domestic measure which no other country produces because it gives a better indication as to what is going on in the economy.</p></speech>

That is correct.</p> <p>  On the debt-to-GDP rules, Mr. John McCarthy earlier said the rules are silent on how long it would take to get to the correction of the 60% of debt-to-GDP and that it would have to be done at a reasonable or correct pace.  The only absolute rule is that it would be done on the basis of a one-twentieth ratio.  Are we exceeding that ratio year on year?</p></speech>

The debt relates to the stock but the more important and binding rule is the balanced budget rule and the need to achieve the MTO, medium-term budgetary objectives, and to correct it at a sufficient pace which is 0.5% of GDP per annum.  Both rules are binding.  While we may overcorrect or reduce the debt ratio faster, we are still obliged to correct the structural balance.</p></speech>

I think everybody is on the same page, so what we are trying to do is to look at ways in which we can increase capital spending if possible.  If it is not possible under the rules that is fair enough but we just need absolute certainty.</p> <p>  The final issue I wish to raise is the marginal tax rate above 50%.  We hear a great deal about that.  How many PAYE workers are paying a marginal tax rate above 50%?</p></speech>

I just wanted to get confirmation on it.  The marginal tax rate is the income tax rate, the USC rate at the top, which is 8%, and then the PRSI rate.  For those who earn between &euro;32,800 and &euro;70,000 the maximum they would pay is 49% to 40% on a portion of their salary on PAYE, 5% USC and 4.1% PRSI.  Is that correct?

That is the first thing.</p><p>I am reminded of <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>.  This is a tale of two countries.  I am fascinated by the language that is used.  I wish I had more time today to examine it.  I know we are a bilingual country but we certainly have two languages going on here, namely, the language of economics, which is very restricted, and the language of those on the ground who are at the receiving end of this very narrow view.  I will preface my comments with that.  Do the economists and financial people look at that?  The last statistic I looked at before I came in here was that house prices are rising by &euro;1,000 per week.  At the end of the month 375 people were on trolleys in hospitals, 37 in Galway, and there are constant moderate reports from consultants telling us that a direct consequence of spending time on trolleys is premature death.  Before I ask any specific questions, does that come into their reckoning at all?</p></speech>

What we try to do is take an overview of the financial and economic position into which all of those challenges fit.  In terms of whether we talk to representative groups or people about those sorts of challenges, the answer is "Yes".</p></speech>

Mr. Moran said he does not deal with the policy but in a sense the Department has made judgments in terms of the use of phrases such as: "Key economic indicators point to continued solid growth".  He also said: "I am greatly encouraged by the robust pace of the recovery".  In addition, he referred to "a balanced and equitable economy".  I could name any amount of statistics but if we take health and housing where the latter is in major crisis, where does that feature in the overall report in the context of the "robust pace of recovery"?  Where does housing come into that?</p></speech>

The key economic indicators are that the economy is growing.  That does not mean the growth is evenly spread.  It does not mean that we are without problems.  What happens perhaps after the depth of crisis we have had is that periods of underinvestment catch up with one.  The reality is that over the past four to five years there are 230,000 more people in work than were heretofore.  The unemployment rate has dropped from more than 15% to just over 6% and is on its way down.  In terms of what the Department of Finance does, it is a measure of well-being.  Below that, in terms of Government policy and in the policy space generally-----</p></speech>

I accept that employment is up and that must be welcomed, but it is a discussion for another day as to what type of employment is up, for example, zero-hours contracts and work involving precarious hours.  Mr. Moran presents some figures by way of backup for the thriving economy and his view that we are going in the right direction.</p><p>There are other figures that indicate the economy is not thriving at all.  We see house prices increasing by &euro;1,000 a week and a complete crisis in direct construction by local authorities which is leading to vast waiting lists.  For example, the waiting list in Galway goes back to 2002, which means that people have been waiting for 15 years and not a single house has been constructed.  Mr. McCarthy has referred to the billions going into housing, but the money is actually going into housing assistance payments which go straight into the pockets of landlords.  In turn, this artificially maintains house prices at an unacceptable level.  Where does this feature in the five-page document?  Can the Department of Finance stand over it as housing policy?</p></speech>

When it comes to an analysis of the economy, the indicators are the ones about which I spoke.  Within any financial framework the Government of the day makes choices as to where it will invest and how it will address the problems to which the Deputy is alluding.

However, the Department of Finance's paper refers to certain indicators while ignoring others.  That is what I am taking exception to, although that might be too strong a word to use, but that is what I am highlighting.  The paper refers to being greatly encouraged by the robust pace of the recovery and so on.  There are many other indicators that tell us we should be very concerned about the pace of the economy.

House prices are continuing to go up and they are going up at a rapid pace.  Is that something at which those of us in the Department look and about which we are concerned?  Yes, it is.  However, house prices are still about 30% below their peak.  I do not think anyone should aspire to reaching their peak values because they were not sustainable, but they are well below them.  They are, however, going up faster than earnings.  Is that a cause of concern at which we look?  Yes, it is.  Is it being driven by cheap credit or a credit bubble?  The answer is no.  Credit is not that cheap and the level of mortgage lending is still subdued.  Are people over-leveraging, as they did in the past, with all of the social and financial consequences?  The macro-fiscal rules the bank has brought in place absolute constraints on what people can borrow as a multiple of their income.  We have to take a number of views on it.  Are we looking at it as an economic risk factor and so on?  Yes, we are.</p></speech>

We lost &euro;18 billion in revenues on the fiscal side per annum, all of which had to be replaced.  At the same time the unemployment rate climbed from full employment to 15% in that period.  Suddenly, we had significant outlays in social spending.  Spending pressures increased and we had a fiscal contribution.</p></speech>

This drags us back into-----</p></speech>

I am looking at risk assessments here and specific mention was made of Brexit.  I actually think that Brexit offers opportunities, as has been acknowledged by many people, but that is for another day.</p> <p>  This is the last D&aacute;il in which to take any meaningful step to stop climate change.  The 2006 Stern report, which I am sure the witnesses have read, is a landmark study on the economics of climate change.  It clearly pointed out in 2006 that it would be 20 times cheaper to prevent further climate change.  The London School of Economics, not known to be a particularly radical organisation, published a paper in 2015 that concluded that the net economic benefits to countries from tackling climate change continue to outweigh the costs.  I could quote many other groups, none of them radical, arguing that we must tackle climate change and that it is major risk to economies and to economic productivity on many levels.  Where is that built in here?  Where is the Department alerting the Government to this risk?</p></speech>

Let us look at how we feed into the issue of mitigation.  In 2008 we changed the vehicle registration tax to base it on carbon emissions rather than engine capacity as expressed in cubic centimetres.  This was a mitigation factor to try to improve quality.  That raises other issues as we go on.  Other gases become important and that raises policy challenges in itself.  In 2010 we introduced a carbon tax, initially on oil fuels, but now on solid fuels as well.  The plastic bag levy is another example.  We have had many policy inputs on this matter.</p></speech>

We need to hold these up, however, against what needs to be done.  I am talking about the economic challenges posed to our country by climate change in terms both of the direct effects and of the enormous fines we will be obliged to pay within few years, which range from &euro;600 million up to more than &euro;5 billion.  We are talking monopoly money here.  That is not built in the witnesses' statement.  Why is Brexit the only risk outlined here?  Am I in trouble, Chairman?</p></speech>

We are about to get an opening statement from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It will refer to the key importance of addressing infrastructural needs.  The European Union, which apparently sets the fiscal rules we cannot change, is criticising us for not investing in infrastructure.

I will tell the witnesses what we are talking about in the Committee of Public Accounts which we feel the Department is missing entirely.  The first is the amount that is due under the redundancy and insolvency fund.  We have heard the Taoiseach - the witnesses need not get into the politics - talking a lot about publishing the names of people caught for social welfare fraud of more than &euro;5,000 while it is &euro;33,000 for taxpayers.  There is a lower threshold.  We understand the majority of the redundancy and insolvency fund will not be paid.  We are satisfied from what we have heard that no one gives a hoot about collecting it in public bodies.  It used to be in the Department of Enterprise and Employment, which shipped it over to the Department of Social Protection, which has not done an analysis of how much of it is actually collectible.  Some of it has to be collected.  Some of it refers to companies that have been restructured and are still there.  We have had correspondence from the Department of Social Protection.  It says that it writes to Revenue to find out if PAYE numbers are still valid.  However, there is no connection.  If it related to interest on a deposit account of someone on social welfare, the State would be able to match that up and track that down.  However, there is no proper tracking down of it here.  I am just saying that there is a gap in the Department's national accounts and it needs to look at it.</p> <p>  I will give a second example.  When companies are liquidated, sometimes there is an asset at the end of the liquidation process which, ultimately, if there are no shareholders, is to be transferred to the State.  We have not established the Department has a mechanism to do that.  The Department got a big receipt the year before last of &euro;10 million.  A company in England sent it over to us.  We heard about that during a meeting last year.  To put it in layman's terms, it is the corporate equivalent of someone dying intestate.  I am satisfied that there is no mechanism in place by anyone.</p> <p>  I am just giving three examples that have crossed our desk in the past 12 months.  The third example relates to the household charge.  Before the local property tax was introduced, there was a &euro;100 per annum charge.  If it was not paid, interest was charged.  If it was never paid, &euro;7,200 is now due.  In the year in question, the Department collected &euro;30 million.  The following year, it collected &euro;30 million.  Last year, it was a lesser amount.  When selling a house, a person has to get an up-to-date certificate from the local authorities and normally has to discharge that charge before the sale can go through.  That proves to me that there is money out there to be collected but the Department is doing nothing about it.  It is only if someone is selling a house that he or she gets caught at that point.  There has to be a mechanism in place.  The Department has to talk to the people who are over collecting the money.  This is not just the Revenue Commissioners.  The Department collects money separate from them.  The Department needs to talk to those people about having a mechanism to compare those houses which have come into the local property tax net, which I think is nearly 100%, with those that should have had a liability for the household charge.  There is tens of millions of euro out there that zero effort is being made by the State to collect.  It collects some of it by default when someone tries to sell a house.  Some of that is contingent income which I think the Department does not take into account.</p> <p>  How much is in the rainy day fund?  I think it was established last year.</p></speech>

Okay.  Everyone pays an annual dividend.  Two years ago it was projecting &euro;2 billion, &euro;2.5 billion, &euro;2.6 billion, &euro;3 billion, &euro;3.2 billion and now &euro;4 billion.  Given that NAMA is tidying up property loans which contributed to the housing problem and is sitting on what is expected to be a conservative surplus of &euro;3 billion to &euro;4 billion, can some of that not be used in the meantime to deal with the housing crisis?</p><p>There are two aspects to that.  First, the surplus is projected.  It does not exist yet to some extent, although NAMA is making profits at present.  However, it does not have a surplus because it has not yet paid off all the debt.  The surplus is what will be left when it pays off all the debt.</p></speech>

There is nothing exactly like NAMA.  I am not promising the committee anything since I am retiring and I will not be responsible for it, but the instinctive rule will be to say it is the same.  However, we have between now and then - it will depend on what comes back - to develop a case that might allow us to use the money in another way.</p></speech>

It has to be nearer the time.  One can develop the case but if one puts it upfront, it will just say "No".  One develops the case between now and 2020, and it depends on how the money is coming back.  One has to ensure all the debt is repaid.</p></speech>

It is on target.  It was set up with a ten-year term.  The Minister encouraged the quick big sales to the vulture funds.  We have had special reports on that and a commission is looking at Project Eagle, which was the first big sale.  That was all in an effort to get NAMA to wrap up a little sooner.  What if it does?  It sounds as if the Department has not made a case yet.  I am disappointed to hear that.  While there is certainly a minimum surplus of &euro;3 billion, which is a conservative estimate, because we think it is not coming to us any sooner, we are not making a case as to how those funds could be utilised.  This is known as planning ahead.  Ms Nolan is also saying - in light of current thinking - that NAMA's projected surplus of at least &euro;3 billion will sit there until 2020 and all the good things-----</p></speech>

Half a dozen semi-State companies have made dividend payments to the State each year.  They cannot be guaranteed to be profitable two or three years hence.  It is exceptionally conservative that NAMA cannot even pay an interim dividend or an interim payment.</p></speech>

It is the state-aid rules under which the EU agreed to keep NAMA off-balance sheet in the first place.  NAMA must repay all the debt, which is the senior debt we guaranteed and the junior debt that it owed to the banks, before it makes any dividend payment to the State.  The arrangement is that we get the surplus at the end.  That was the arrangement from the beginning.</p></speech>

Perhaps Ms Nolan will send the committee a note on how she thinks that is shaping up.  There might be a quick answer to my next question.  When some of the banks got into trouble, the taxpayer had to bail them out.  Essentially, what happened was that the bank debt, which was a problem debt, was handed over to NAMA, another State organisation, which, through its work, effectively reprivatised that debt to vulture funds such as Cerberus, etc.  Instead of the debt being held by Irish banks, it is now held by the international vulture funds.  Are the main companies that bought the funds from NAMA regulated here?</p></speech>

We only bailed out the banks because the Irish people had deposits in those banks and if we had not bailed them out the Irish people would have been at a loss.  Perhaps, even more importantly, Irish businesses needed the banking system to keep working so they could keep working.</p></speech>

Others might not, but I do.  That is my personal view.  AIB and Bank of Ireland are now profitable and they are starting to pay dividends.  What is the position with corporation tax from the banks we bailed out?  Now that they are profitable and talking about profits of &euro;1 billion, when will we see corporation tax from those banks?</p></speech>

When one reads the banks' annual accounts, however, one can see that they still have deferred tax assets, that is, they have losses on their books that they set against corporation tax.  We talked earlier about the bank levy and that is one of the main reasons we have a bank levy.  It is not just the banks that we bailed out, it is all the banks in the system that have deferred tax assets or losses on their systems.</p></speech>

Like the other semi-States that I mentioned.</p> <p>  I have one or two more questions.  Looking at page 11 of the finance accounts, will the witnesses tell me about what is not here in the Central Fund?  In 2015, Ireland paid &euro;1.952 billion to the EU.  Under that there are receipts from the EU of &euro;66 million, a fraction of that.  We had it here with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and it slipped away from the Committee of Public Accounts because the money that we received from the EU in respect of agriculture does not come through the Department Vote or the Central Fund because it is audited by the European auditor.  Essentially, it has not crossed our desk, except that we have asked for it in the last year.  What is the net position of Ireland being a net contributor?  Could we have a breakdown of the last few years?</p></speech>

On the money that we borrowed from the troika, at the end of 2015 we still owe &euro;50 billion, mainly from the European Stability Fund, and the Stability Mechanism Fund.  Some of it does not have to be repaid for some time.  The average repayment of that is up to 18 years.  It is the case that we have paid off the IMF contribution in full?</p></speech>

The UK, Sweden and Denmark loans are also about five years.  There are mixed views on this.  Some would say that having the troika keeping an eye over our shoulder is a good thing for the Department of Finance, given what happened.  Perhaps it is no harm that it is still under its surveillance but the other view is that if they were paid off, the Department would not be under its direct surveillance.  Can the Department give us a note on the pros and cons?  Is it good for Ireland to be under the surveillance of the troika or not?  As the Secretary General of the Department of Finance, would Mr. Moran prefer to have the IMF having direct surveillance over his Department or would he prefer if were an ordinary member of the IMF, where it makes an annual visit as it does elsewhere?</p></speech>

It is the decision of the three funding agencies, not only what we would like.  We have two visits from the troika annually.  They are relatively short compared to what they were.  They are primarily interested in our capacity to repay the money we owe it.  There is nothing much beyond that.  In terms of an annual article 4, our relations with the IMF is back to a regularised position.  That is our main engagement with it  It is always useful to get some sort of external view.  We get that primarily through engagement in the traditional way, such as with the OECD and the IMF visits, not from the surveillance missions.</p></speech>

Looking at the AIB sale again, given that money was borrowed to buy out AIB, now that the State has got some of that money back, it has to go back against the borrowings as a financial transaction.  I understand that.  Has the Department calculated the interest that Irish taxpayers paid through current revenue on the borrowings to bail out AIB since 2008, since the bailout?  I would expect a minimum of that because it was interest paid on a year-by-year basis that came out of current revenues.  We could argue about capital, but there is a strong case that part of the proceeds of the sale of AIB should go back to recouping the interest that we paid on the bailout of AIB as a minimum.  What are the Department's figures on that equation and where are we on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-06a.695" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Derek Moran" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017070600002#T03200"><p>All borrowings are just that.  The State borrows the money it needs.  It is not separately identified against what the need was.  We do not have a stream of borrowing that is identified as AIB.  It is possible to look at the money that was injected and track what that might have cost over time but it is not an exercise that we do.</p></speech>

During the years when we were paying interest, the income from AIB was probably higher than the interest going out.  That is not to say that justifies what we did but it is not simply one way of the other.</p></speech>

The Department might look at that.  I would have thought the capital which we borrowed is different from the interest that we paid on that capital borrowing.  It cost taxpayers money to pay for that during that period.</p></speech>

The briefing note we got from the Department of Finance was document No. 653A(ii).  It is interesting how this was brought into it.  On page 34, it states that the Department of Finance received &euro;12 million in 2015 under the fair deal scheme into the Central Fund.  That note says that the collection of funds commenced in 2011.  I do not have the previous years' figures.  I ask the witnesses for a note on what has come in from the nursing home support scheme from 2011 up to the estimate for 2017.  Is that money collected from the estates of deceased people, or what are we talking about there?</p></speech>

It is not right that &euro;12 million from the fair deal scheme, where payments are being met out of the HSE current budget, comes in the back door to the Central Fund and the Department of Finance for receipts from the fair deal scheme, and that there is no mechanism in place to pass it directly back to the HSE to pay for ongoing fair deal schemes.

Since we meet credit rating agencies, the IMF and investors as part of our day-to-day job, we had to try to explain where this was coming from.

I understand the minimum amount for 2016 to 2018 was &euro;500 million a year.  According to a reply to a parliamentary question I got last night, it was &euro;3 billion in 2016.  It is &euro;2 billion so far in 2017.  That is way ahead.  We met the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Philip Lane, maybe a year ago about this.  I think he said that they would be "extinguished".  My understanding is that we printed money and have to take it back out of the economy and that is what the IOUs were, and that we have to extinguish them.  We do not have to extinguish them as quickly, and the witnesses explained about how money is cheap at the moment.  If we can park that and just spend it, and pay it down in the timeframe - I have a real problem with it and do not think we should be doing that - does that not leave some capacity to borrow for things that we can borrow for now and save later on?</p> <p>  I want to come back to a point that Deputy Catherine Connolly made.  We are going to have cash fines imposed on us as a consequence of not meeting our 2020 climate targets.  It will become a real issue for the Department of Finance when there are cash fines.  It will not be something theoretical but something in practice.  We are going to miss the 2020 targets and by virtue of the fact that we are on the wrong trajectory, we are going to have a real challenge with the 2030 targets.  We should spend on some of the things that would ensure we avoid those fines, which could be very substantial.  Would that not be a more prudent approach if there is the ability to pay this other way?  Does that space exist if we do not approach the payment of those floating rate notes and have not accelerated it?  Does that create a space to spend money in a different way where it is cheap to borrow and we will save money in hard cash and fines as early as 2020?</p></speech>

The accelerated programme of selling over the minimum has been to avail of very positive interest rate environment which probably makes it sensible to do that.</p> <p>  On borrowing to invest, essentially any borrowing we do at the moment is for investment purposes.  The current account is in balance or in surplus and any borrowing we do is on the investment side only.  We are not borrowing for day-to-day spending.  On climate mitigation, Deputy Murphy is absolutely right.  We face a challenge in 2021 and beyond of fines and not meeting the targets, and we are on the wrong trajectory.</p></speech>

The two areas we can probably influence the most are housing or built stock - in terms retrofitting and avoiding the loss of energy in order to make buildings more energy-efficient - and public transport.  Some of those projects are very big.  The ones that will bring a real return are those such as the DART underground, where we could borrow for a long-term purpose in the same way that led to the construction of the London Underground in Victorian times.  I am only talking about the capital side here.  It strikes me that we are paying off promissory notes when we could invest to save by at least heading towards the 2030 targets by taking an initiative now.  I cannot understand why this is not seen as prudent.  I am probably straying into policy.</p></speech>

That is a different story and it is just my opinion.  At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, the Minister said that the fiscal rules are not fit for purpose in light of Ireland's demographic situation and capital needs.

We have heard a great deal from a lot of commentators and Mr. McCarthy and Mr. Moran will be aware that the Committee on Budgetary Oversight has done much work examining capital spend with regard to fiscal rules.

We have gotten a range of changes and clarifications at a European level which have actually improved the application.  I sometimes upset Mr. McCarthy when I say a "problem with the rules", but the rules are a single set of rules to fit every country in the EU.  It is a "one size fits all" approach.  They are not very adaptable to the peculiarities and particularities of individual countries.  In each of the years since the rules have been put in place we have worked through them and we have gotten a number of very technical changes which have helped us.  Mr. McCarthy is the chairman of what is known as the output gap working group, which is an integral part of the process.  He chairs that group at a European level in order to drive forward an approach based on a greater degree of common sense.</p></speech>

This is unfortunately technical and we will try to provide a note in layman's terms as the Chairman has requested, although it is not easy.  In 2015 or 2016, after we came out of the excessive deficit procedure we were concerned about the reference rate, which is a key metric which feeds into the calculation of fiscal space.  It is updated in the rules every three years.  It is calculated out over a ten-year timeframe and it has backward and forward-looking components.  We felt that process was unfavourable in an Irish context because in 2015 it would have taken into account the negative potential growth rate in 2010 and 2011, when the economy was in the depths of the crisis.  We made a very strong economic argument to the Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs, DG  ECFIN, that it should be updated on a annual basis, which would have meant eliminating those years from the calculation.  I am open to correction on this because it was a couple of years ago but that change increased fiscal space by approximately &euro;400 million to &euro;500 million in that year and in subsequent years.</p></speech>

That would be helpful.  Mr. McCarthy offered up a staunch defence of the fiscal rules a number of times.  That is fair enough.  He also spoke a number of times about the economic crash and said that the reason it occurred was because we did not have rules to the extent that we do now.</p> <p>  We need to bring a big elephant into the room, and park it there, in terms of the reason for the crash.  In the first instance, there was an over-reliance on consumption taxes.  There was excessive commercial borrowing and excessive lending by the banks which led to the crash.  The Department of Finance, the people who in the past sat where Mr. McCarthy and Mr. Moran sit now, were also asleep at the wheel and did not see any of the flags.  Let us be realistic when Mr. McCarthy throws this issue back at us in respect of the crash.  We understand there was a crash.  The people we represent suffered greatly because of it.  The Department of Finance, however, needs to take responsibility for having been partly responsible for a lot of the policy decisions and their implementation.  Does Mr. Moran think it is possible that in making sure that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past that we are now going too far in the opposite direction?  Are we restricting spending to the extent that we are creating pressures in health, housing and infrastructure?  Everybody accepts that these pressures are there.  Does he understand how difficult it is for us as public representatives to see these huge pressures in public services?  They are obvious and real.  They are not imagined.  Yet all we hear is that academic, economic language about the fiscal rules, which may or may not be appropriate.  A debate can be had on them.  Mr. Moran can imagine our frustration.  That is why I am asking this question.  </p> <p>  The Minister has said today that the fiscal rules which currently exist are not fit for purpose because of the demographic pressures in this State.  For once I agree with the Minister for Finance.  Changes need to be made.  What work has Mr. Moran and his Department done specfically up to now to make sure that we can get the changes we need to allow us to spend money - not unrealistically or recklessly - in the way that is necessary to ensure that the people who need health care get health care and that the people who need a roof over their head get a roof over their head?  Will Mr. Moran point out to me, in simple language, what changes to the fiscal rules he and his Department have sought but not gotten?</p></speech>

It goes back to this concept in the rules.  I will say this carefully, the fiscal rules as they stand are in general probably a good thing as a framework.  We have a set of rules that apply to the totality of the EU.  The economies of the area are very different in terms of scale, size, dynamics, recent history and so on.  To that extent, there are occasions where they can be entirely counterintuitive in terms of how they apply at any point in time.  I absolutely recognise that.  In the end, we have come from a situation - and I think we began some of this discussion earlier - where in 2007 we had a debt rate of 25% and we reached 120% within a couple of years, which exposed the country to huge problems.  We have to try to get the balance right to prevent that happening again.  In the end of the day, the rules are an integral part of the overall fiscal pact.  There was a referendum on this whole structure a number of years ago and it is the framework in which we operate.</p></speech>

I was one of those who campaigned against that referendum.  It is very interesting that people who campaigned for it are now saying the fiscal rules are a "one size fits all" approach which needs to be changed.  I welcome their conversion.  In my view, which is possibly correct, it is possible that we have gone too far in the opposite direction and have put a straitjacket on ourselves.  That is the point I am making.  If I was to be political about it, and I do not want to be, I measured the policies of the Tea Party in the United States against the fiscal rules and found very little difference between them.  And yet, that group would be seen as very economically conservative, even by the standards of the US.</p> <p>  I would like to comment on capital gains tax, which is discussed on page 11 of the briefing note Mr. Moran has provided to the committee.  It says that the top ten in terms of capital gains tax, CGT-----</p></speech>

It says that the top ten returns accounted for almost two thirds of receipts with a similar share attributable to company directors or shareholders.  This seems to be very similar to corporation tax in that it is peculiar to a small number of companies.  Mr. Moran was asked earlier about the corporation tax for companies and he said that Revenue does not give the Department the names of the companies.  Is it possible that these are the same companies and that not only do we again have an overdependence on a small number of companies in respect of corporation tax but potentially that same overdependence in terms of capital gains tax?</p></speech>

We are well aware of the concentration risk on the corporate side, which is a big number in overall terms while the capital gains tax represents a smaller figure.  The difficulty with CGT is that when a gain is made at a certain point in time the tax paid becomes payable at that point, so it varies over time.  I do not have a particular insight which I can offer the Deputy around how CGT returns match with the top ten payers in the context of corporation tax.</p></speech>

There is a whole movement here with all sorts of things such as trusts and, particularly, foundations.  The point has been made to us by numerous third level institutions that less than 50% of their funding comes from the State, so I thank Mr. Moran for clarifying this.  We have had Garda representatives come before the committee repeatedly and given them a very tough time regarding off-balance-sheet transactions.  It might be a bit of an exaggeration, but it is a parallel system of accounts, and it seems off-balance-sheet methods are the direction in which the Government is now going.  If it can find a way to build houses off balance sheet and have a health system off-balance sheet, it will seek to do so.  Is that right?  Am I wrong?  Am I simple-minded?</p></speech>

The Garda, for example, thought - as did the Department of Justice and Equality, mind - that it was okay to be off-balance sheet.  Is this not worrying for the Department of Finance?  In the witnesses' training, do they not look at other things that are equally important in a thriving economy and learn that housing is the most basic requirement?  If we have a housing crisis, property prices rising by &euro;1,000 a week and Government policy stating it will give money to the private system in the guise of social housing, does that not trouble Mr. Moran as an indicator that this economy is not thriving?  Should the Department not be looking at the rules and telling the Government it will comply with them as that is its job, but that this is the result and the collateral damage?</p></speech>

It is not a response, but I will make it seeing as it was mentioned that he chairs a group dealing with some of the fiscal rules at EU level.  There would be a concern in some countries - I am not saying it is a unanimous view - that the fiscal rules and this drive to be off-balance sheet to keep within the fiscal rules is resulting in what I would call social engineering.</p><p>It is having a serious social engineering effect because of the issue with building houses. We had a financial crash, the banks went bust and some people have large mortgages.  We are very quickly moving from a position where 80% of Irish people owned their own houses in one generation to being lucky if 20% of the next generation will own their homes.  That is what happens at European level.  The attitude to that is so be it, but in the way that Irish people live their lives that represents social engineering in Ireland.</p><p> Does the way society operates in various countries come within the financial strictures of Mr. McCarthy's work at EU level?  I know that is not exactly the reason that Mr. McCarthy is at this meeting.  I accept that he may not agree with that viewpoint, but would he accept that it is a point of view?</p></speech>

I stressed this point when responding to Deputy Catherine Murphy at the start, and the Secretary General also made a reference to it.  The fiscal rules do not constrain what one spends, they simply constrain the bottom line.  If one wants to choose a Swedish type of expenditure model, one can do it but one has to be able to finance it.  If one chooses an UK type, where Government spending as a portion of GDP is at the lower end of the spectrum, one can do that as well.  It is a policy choice.</p> <p>  I do not want to go into policy but it is a policy choice as to whether we want to spend to address these issues, and certainly there are issues to address.  We do not live in a bubble.  There is nobody present who is not conscious of the issues, but it is a question of how to finance them.  We would be concerned.  The Chairman has a view, which is legitimate.  I have a view that fiscal sustainability is the issue, because if we loose that it is back to the troika again.  That would create issues.  We spoke of the &euro;201 billion debt.</p> <p>  Other countries have issues.  I chair a very technical group on how one measures the structural balance, rather than the policy about it.  There is another element to it in which I am not involved, that is, the statistical treatment of some of these issues, to which the Secretary General alluded.  EUROSTAT does not like anything that Government tries to put off balance sheet.  EUROSTAT had its fingers burnt with Greece, where Greece got the data wrong and suddenly it had a deficit that was three or four times what they thought it was going to be.  EUROSTAT has become increasingly strict in terms of the balance sheet treatment of anything.  We saw that with Irish Water.  We considered that, in conjunction with our colleagues in the CSO and in the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government that we had done enough to keep it off balance sheet, but EUROSTAT came up with obscure reasons, which we still do not understand, as to-----</p></speech>

We are dealing with: Vote 11 - Office of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Vote 12 - Superannuation and Retired Allowances, Vote 18 - Shared Services, and Vote 39 - Office of Government Procurement.</p> <p>  We had also intended to consider the special report by the Comptroller and Auditor General on the financial reporting in the public sector but because of the late hour, we will hold over that special report and come back to it in the autumn.  There is one other special report from the Comptroller and Auditor General we will have to get to as well, but we will leave that to one side.  If anyone had in their opening comments a reference to that, we will come back to that separately.  We will stick with the Department, including Chapter 3 - Vote Accounting and Budget Management, and leave the special report to one side today.</p> <p>  First, I apologise for the late hour of starting.  Mr. Watt will be aware we dealt with the Department of Finance this morning.  The committee had four or five meetings with third level institutions over the past month or two, and as we are getting near the end of the D&aacute;il session, we wanted to finalise our report in committee today, which we have done, with a view to launching it on Tuesday next.</p><p>That took a little bit of extra time to finalise.  Even though the D&aacute;il has still to sit for a few hours, we are only now, at this time of the evening, getting to the second half of the public part of the meeting.  I have indicated the topics we are going to cover.  We are joined today by Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and also Mr. Paul Quinn, Mr. David Feeney, Ms Helen Codd, Ms Paula Lyons, Mr. Frank Griffin and Ms Fionnuala Burke.<br/><br/>I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  The witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br/><br/>Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits or objectives of such policies.  They are also reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/><br/>I call the Comptroller and Auditor General to make an opening statement.</p></speech>

The 2015 appropriation account for the Office of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform records gross expenditure totalling &euro;40.8 million, divided across two programme areas: the public service management and reform programme, on which &euro;24.1 million was spent, or 59% of the expenditure, and the public expenditure and sectoral policy programme, which accounted for the balance.  At the end of the year, the Department had underspent by a net &euro;4.1 million relative to its budget.</p> <p>  Vote 12, superannuation and retired allowances, is used to pay for Civil Service and prison officer pensions.  Pension payments for other public servants are charged, directly or indirectly, to other votes, including those for education, health, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Army pensions.  The gross expenditure on Vote 12 in 2015 amounted to &euro;499 million, an increase of 5.3% compared with 2014.  Appropriations-in-aid, mainly comprising employee pension contributions, amounted to &euro;136 million in 2015, up 30% from 2014.  The increase was due mainly to employee contributions in respect of the public service single pension scheme, which was introduced for all public servants appointed since 2013.</p> <p>  An unusual feature of the account for Vote 12 is the absence of administration expenses.  The Department of Finance administered the pension payments charged to Vote 12 on behalf of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and charged the associated administration costs to its own Vote.  In December 2015, responsibility for administration of the pension payments transferred to Vote 18, shared services.</p> <p>  The 2015 appropriation account for the Vote for shared services records gross expenditure totalling &euro;26.2 million.  Overall, there was underspend of &euro;18.7 million, almost 42% relative to the Estimate.  A sum of &euro;13.2 million was spent on activities related to PeoplePoint, which handles human resources activities centrally.  A sum of &euro;9.3 million was spent on payroll shared services, and &euro;2.3 million on other shared services projects, including a shared financial management project.  Expenditure on the payroll shared services centre was &euro;7.8 million, or 46%, less than provided for in the Estimate, mainly due to the later than anticipated transition of certain payroll clients to the shared services office.  Expenditure incurred on set-up costs for the financial management project was &euro;8.2 million, or 78%, below estimate.</p> <p>  In the statement on internal financial control, the Accounting Officer draws attention to salary overpayments and steps taken to address this issue.  I am carrying out a review of the issue this year and expect to include a chapter in my report on the 2016 accounts of the public services later this year. </p> <p>  The year 2015 was the second year of operation for the Office of Government Procurement.  Gross expenditure of &euro;14.3 million was &euro;5.3 million, or 27%, lower than estimated.  Note 3 explains that a delay in obtaining office accommodation impacted on recruitment with knock-on effects in other areas of planned non-pay expenditure, resulting in an underspend of &euro;2.8 million.  Procurement and subsequent implementation of external support services for the office also took longer than originally planned, resulting in an underspend of &euro;2.4 million.</p> <p>  Chapter 3 is a standard report that aims to consolidate and summarise Vote expenditure for 2015 across all Votes and to demonstrate medium to long-term trends.  Gross voted expenditure across all Votes in 2015 was &euro;46 billion, the same as in 2014.  This represents a cumulative reduction of almost 13% since 2010.</p></speech>

There are issues in regard to underexpenditure across a number of the Votes.  The reasons for that have been set out very clearly.  They relate mainly to a number of reform projects that have been committed to.  We had a slower than expected take-up on a number of initiatives, slow recruitment processes and retention of contractors involved in delivering some of these projects.  These projects are very significant.  Obviously, what Mr. Paul Quinn is driving in terms of procurement reform and what we are doing in shared services comprise very significant transformation projects.  We have an issue all the time in respect of trying to get the pacing right and trying to pace our projects in a sensible way, ensuring value for money while at the same time ensuring we are spending what is allocated and keeping within profile.  We are aware that, for 2015, there were significant underspends, as set out in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  As a Department, we are very much conscious of ensuring we set out only Estimates and draw down amounts as close as possible to those, consistent with the financial procedures.</p> <p>  More generally, in terms of managing spending, the committee will be aware that a key part of our job is not just preparation of the budget but also executing it during the year.  A key issue for us is to ensure overall spending stays within profile.  Again, the Comptroller and Auditor General has set out in the report our performance in this respect.  It varies from year to year.  On average in recent years, we stayed at about 2%.  The variance against profile is around 2%.  There are many reasons for that.  They relate to forecasting errors, issues around forecasting demand, particularly in regard to the health service, and specifically Government decisions on issues such as the Christmas bonus or additional moneys allocated for capital programmes.  Especially during 2015, as taxes exceeded profile, the Government had the opportunity to make some additional investments in capital infrastructure and it provided for some restoration of the Christmas bonus.  That was the first time it was done since the economic crash.  It is an ongoing challenge for our Department in terms of managing spending in line with profile.</p> <p>  I will touch on some of the reform issues with which we are pushing ahead.  Procurement reform, shared services and digitalisation are issues we discussed previously at meetings of this committee.  We are pushing ahead with those.  Two issues that have taken up a lot of our time this year relate to the negotiations on the recent pay agreement.  Deputies will be aware that the unions are now in a process of balloting in respect of the new agreement, the extension of the Lansdowne Road agreement.  It is very important in terms of securing industrial peace and co-operation with ongoing reform but also necessary to ensure we have a pay settlement that is affordable and sustainable for the State.</p> <p>  My next point is on the capital review.  I heard some of the discussions this morning when the members were debating with colleagues from the Department of Finance on capital spending and issues associated with that.  The Government is now considering the mid-term review of the current capital plan.  The Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, hopes to announce on budget day some additional projects and allocations in respect of capital spending.  It is a key part of what the Department is engaged in now.</p> <p>  We are delighted to be here and to answer any questions that arise.  I thank colleagues in the Department for all their work.  It is very rare we get the opportunity to thank people in the Department for all the effort they put in.  Members are aware of the significant work that goes on in the Department in terms of the various projects.</p></speech>

The SEUPB organises the process of inviting grant applications, vetting grants and allocating the money.  The accountability mechanism, as the Deputy will probably recall, reports to our Department and our counterpart in Northern Ireland, the Department of Finance and Personnel, DFP, and the two relevant Ministers have overall responsibility for its management.</p></speech>

There were differing views between ourselves and the Revenue Commissioners as to whether this should be the subject to either professional service withholding tax or PAYE.  We reached a view and then in further discussions with the Revenue Commissioners they disagreed with that view.  On settlement of the matter, we had to pay a further amount.  It was, therefore, a different interpretation of exactly what the relationship of the people involved was in the contract with the Department.  Obviously, if the Revenue came to a different view, we had to then make that settlement with the Revenue.</p></speech>

There, the Taoiseach and Ministers discussed the budget and heard from a variety of interest groups concerning their budget priorities.

What was agreed and what we were told would form part of the new open and transparent consultative process was a summer economic statement in the first instance followed by the NED.  Just because the Government decides that it will rejig Departments should not mean that this sequence should not be followed.  I am concerned that we have already reverted back to type and that we are engaged in box-ticking rather than genuine consultation.  That is my opinion.  Why was there a delay in the SES?</p></speech>

The Deputy knows that we have a new Government, with a new Taoiseach and a new Minister.  It is appropriate for the new Government to consider its budgetary strategy.  In parallel to this, the Minister has appeared before several committees over the past week to discuss where he believes the economy and the budget are.  Mr. Derek Moran and I have attended the Committee on Budgetary Oversight and spent several days at the NED discussing matters with people.</p> <p>  There is a more open and different approach to budgeting.  When I was involved in the Department of Finance in the early 1990s, the budget was prepared and announced to the people on one day and there was no SES, NED, oversight committee, performance report or Maastricht returns.  Our current approach to budgeting is different and more open, with Deputies having an opportunity based on parameters set out by the Department to discuss the budget and the options that the Government faces.  It is a different situation.  Obviously, it would have been better and more desirable had the SES been published in advance of the NED.  Hopefully, we will revert to that sequence next year.</p></speech>

In the absence of fiscal rules from the EU, we would still have to manage our affairs in a way that would put a constraint on the resources that we use for current and capital spending.

A debate is happening outside the Houses.  The trade union movement through ICTU, IBEC on behalf of the business groups and almost every other group is saying that the fiscal rules in respect of capital spending are not fit for purpose.

How has it engaged with its sister Department - the Department of Finance - and the European Commission?</p></speech>

We will increase it by 70% between last year and 2021.  That is the main thing that we are doing.</p> <p>  No matter what the rules are, we will need to manage our affairs in a way that will place a constraint on our amount of current and capital spending.  We must decide on whether to fund capital by borrowing within the rules or by increasing taxation within the rules.  That is possible for us.  There is no bar on the Government deciding that it wants to fund more capital or current spending within the fiscal rules by taxing people or generating the revenue.  As constructed, the rules count capital spending the same way as other spending apart from the smoothing rule, of which the Deputy will be aware and under which an increase in spending of, for example, &euro;100 million would only use up &euro;25 million of the fiscal space in any given year and the full amount by the end of the four-year period.  There is an issue in terms of capital smoothing.</p> <p>  The only change to the fiscal rules that would make a difference would be if it was decided at EU level that capital would be treated in a different way so that governments would be allowed to balance current spending and borrow for capital purposes, which is the so-called golden rule.  That differs from the approach that underpins our current rules.</p></speech>

We are moving towards it, so our spending can grow in line with potential growth adjusted for the convergent margin, which is a function of how far our deficit is away from the structural balance.

Smoothing is one example, and the Department of Finance told us there were others which we had succeeded in getting from the Commission.  If there are other flexibilities which the Department has sought but not got, perhaps Mr. Watt would furnish us with a report on those.</p></speech>

The only issue on capital spend relates to smoothing and there are ongoing debates between the Department of Finance and the European Commission about the application of the rules, because they are ambiguous.  They refer to a structural balance but this is unobservable.  There will always be a debate on potential growth and the convergence margin.  The Department of Finance has set out the details but this will always be uncertain and subject to discussion.  We do not know how fast the economy can grow in real or nominal terms and we do not know at any given time where we are in the economic cycle, whether we are close to potential output, whether there is an output gap or whether it is minus or plus.  All these factors have an impact on the way we can grow spending.</p></speech>

I have a slight concern that, outside the Committee of Public Accounts, there is an ongoing live and necessary debate on the application of the fiscal rules and their fairness, and whether they are fit for purpose.  In a D&aacute;il committee this morning, the Minister expressed the view that they were not but I do not get a sense of urgency from either the Department of Finance or the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, or that they recognise the debate going on outside.  I ask Mr. Watt to forward on to me any information on changes that have been secured or sought.  I am only giving my opinion on these things.</p></speech>

There was a strike by ASTI members in secondary schools but I do not think any other public servants have gone out on strike in recent years, though there may have been strike notices.  There were issues with Luas and other drivers but the secondary teachers represented by ASTI were the only example I can think of in the public service.  As the economy has recovered, people's expectations change as do their perceptions about what the State can afford.  They see unemployment falling and wage growth in the private sector again and public servants feel they should benefit from the upturn in the economy.  They had very significant cutbacks in pay during the crisis and average pay reductions for teachers, garda&iacute; etc. were between 10% and 15%, with more significant decreases for those at higher levels.  People legitimately have an expectation of getting some of this back and that has led to greater debate on how we manage resources to meet those expectations.</p></speech>

I have met Mr. Watt and the Minister a number of times on this issue and have tried to get a costing for returning the public service to a single-tier pay structure.  We were given a figure of &euro;208 million but it was not dealt with in the extension of the Lansdowne Road agreement.  It is extraordinary to have an agreement seeking to maintain industrial peace but which failed to deal with the driver of a lot of the industrial unrest which still looms in some unions.  It is extraordinary that this one key issue was not dealt with.  We have a recruitment problem in some areas of the public service but the issue of new entrants was not dealt with.  Can Mr. Watt explain why?  Notwithstanding any requests from the trade union movement, did the Department have its own priorities going into public sector pay talks?  Why was returning the public service to a single-tier pay structure not a priority issue for the Department?</p></speech>

There is a limited pot and whatever money was used for other things would have to have been taken away from the general increase across the different grades.  There always has to be a trade-off and a discussion about what we can do within the resources.  Many anomalies that arose from decisions taken between 2008 and 2011 were addressed and in the previous agreement new scales were put in place to close much of the gap.</p> <p>  There are different opinions on the idea of equal pay for equal work.  The Department has an assistant principal and an administrative officer on the first and second point of the scale.  They are doing the same work as somebody who came in a few years earlier but that person will be on a different point on the scale.  There are colleagues who are also on different pension arrangements.  People who came in after 2012 are part of the single pension scheme and pension conditions and contributions are very different from those of colleagues who came in before.  Equal pay for equal work is open to interpretation and there are issues around it.</p></speech>

This mainly affects people who came in after 2012 but the new agreement leads to very significant reductions in the pension-related deduction, PRD, contributions to be made by people who came in after 2012.  The new entrants who lost out from the pension arrangements benefit from the agreement significantly in this regard.</p> <p>  Any employer needs to look at what rates of pay are required to attract staff.  After the end of this agreement, new entrants to the teaching profession on 1 January 2018 will have a starting salary of &euro;35,000, which will go up to &euro;37,000, &euro;38,000 etc.  Given the marketplace for graduates, starting salaries are very competitive.  The Department recruits administrative officers as the standard graduate intake, whose starting salary is between &euro;29,500 and &euro;30,000, and we have no difficulty attracting fantastic graduates at that rate.  The Government has to strike a balance, to be fair to different groups while-----</p></speech>

From 1 January 2011, in addition to all of the other FEMPI cuts, workers who came into the system suffered further cuts.  There was some merging of bands in the Haddington Road agreement and there were PRD changes in the most recent agreement.  I fully understand what was taken and given back and the workers to whom I referred are still not on the same pay scale.  We are not operating a single-tier pay structure.  Mr. Watt knows that it is an issue for some trade unions, as it is for that category of workers.  We had a debate on FEMPI recently and some of those workers were in the Public Gallery.</p><p>It is an issue for them.  It was an issue, unfortunately, for the different Departments that underpinned a lot of the threatened industrial action, and potentially still further industrial action.  Yet, it was not dealt with.  I find it incredible that it was not dealt with even as an equality issue.  I would have thought the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform would have wanted to deal with that first, notwithstanding all the other balancing acts that Mr. Watt says must be done.  I find it-----</p></speech>

There are no issues as such that have come up.  The concern in the past has always been that when there was one Minister for spending and one for revenue that there would not be the same level of integration or coherence because the budget needs to be considered in the round.  Having one Minister responsible for both sides of it should help in that respect.  Things are moving along.  We are busy with the Minister in the preparations for the budget and we are all engaged in that.  There is no immediate issue that is problematic for us.

The two Ministers at the time, Deputies Howlin and Noonan, are both of the view that it helped in managing all the different dimensions of the crisis, including the troika.  One of the dimensions of the job that has changed over the years relates to Eurogroup and ECOFIN, whereby the Minister would have to be away for two or three days per month at those meetings.  This is an extra element that was probably not as demanding in the past, given the nature of monetary union and our obligations in that regard.</p></speech>

On the other hand we are not going to push ahead with projects just to spend the money if we are not happy about being in a position to deliver in terms of the objectives.  It is always a balancing act.</p></speech>

The pension scheme we have now is pay-as-you-go.  The liabilities we have every year are met from the general Exchequer.  We have not pre-funded the pensions and we do not pre-fund them.

The single pension scheme has reduced the pension benefits for people who came in after 2013.  They are also making the contribution to the pension.  This will help in the future sustainability of pensions.  With regard to the agreement that is now subject to balloting, the pension related deduction, which was seen as emergency measures during the crisis, this year yielded &euro;740 million.  Some &euro;550 million will turn into a permanent contribution that people are making to their pensions - some 70% of the public service are now making a greater contribution - if that agreement is put in to force.</p> <p>  The steps we are taking to ensure the sustainability into the future involve changes to the pension benefits and also the higher contribution, especially those who came in before 2013 and who benefit from the higher pensions.  We believe that measures have been taken.  The Comptroller and Auditor General commented on one of our reports that looked at the actuarial liability of pensions.  In 2007 public service pensions were estimated at around &euro;115 billion.  In the most recent analysis this figure was down to between &euro;85 billion and &euro;90 billion.  The changes we have made have had a big impact upon the costs of the future liability of pensions, as expressed in today's terms.  We are not complacent or sanguine about it, but we are in a better position than we were previously.</p></speech>

We must do something about it in the near future or we are going to have a big problem down the line.  Deputy Cullinane spoke of the special EU programmes body, SEUPB, and its PEACE III project.

It was set up to manage the INTERREG North-South programme and the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation funds.  It is a body which, on behalf of the authorities on both sides of the Border, manages the programme.  There are many cross-Border projects and projects along the Border.  The body sets out, with agreement of the Ministers, a broad strategy and then manages the drawdown of the funds.  It invites applications from a variety of different community and other groups to access the funding, it assesses applications, it manages the payments and ensures that the recipients of grants actually deliver on what they said they would.  SEUPB manages the expenditure on these programmes.  Its work, as I mentioned, is accountable to both Ministers.</p></speech>

This is an issue that has now been given more visibility because we have established the shared services of PeoplePoint.  In the past, overpayments took place across Departments but we did not have the same visibility that we have of them now.  Now that we have moved transactional HR and, increasingly, payroll to the shared centres, we have more visibility of this issue.  That is the first point.  The second point is that we changed the entitlements of sick leave.  Previously, public servants would get six months' full pay and then six months' half pay.  That has been reduced now to three months and three months.  There are more and more people who are pushing up against the threshold when they do not have full pay.  As people are paid in advance rather than in arrears in the public service, if we are not notified in a timely fashion that someone has-----</p></speech>

In effect, normally one would get paid on a Friday for the work one has done.  In the public service, people tend to get paid in advance.

The pay run closes on, let us say, a Tuesday for the following week's payment.  That is to allow for the process in which a bank file has to be run to distribute the payments.  The issue is in capturing any change that would be pay-impacted as a result of absence.  That can be sick absence or annual leave.  It is about the window of opportunity available.</p> <p>  There are a number of different causes of overpayments.  Some of them relate to delay.  We have moved to a self-service system, so it is now reliant on employee input or manager input to keep the system updated.  That then informs changes that have to be made in the payroll processing.  We have put in a lot of effort in recent years in terms of the communication and training processes for employees and managers to input correctly in a timely manner to minimise overpayments.</p> <p>  In response to the Deputy's inquiry-----</p></speech>

There have been some changes this year that will assist us in getting the recoupment process up and running and having the money paid back more quickly.  Auto-recoupment means that if there is a recoupment for less than five days, there is now an automatic process.  We do not need to go through stages of the agreement process on the value of the overpayment or to set a plan for recoupment.  There has also been a change in respect of the value of the overpayment.  It had been calculated with either a gross or a net value.  That has been changed in this year's legislation to a net value only.  That speeds up the calculation of the overpayment.</p></speech>

It was litigation that arose originally in the Office of Public Works when the national procurement service resided within that body.  The staff members transferred to the Office of Government Procurement in 2014.  The case and case management system also travelled to the new office.

It is too late in the evening and I have already run through all of these matters.  I ask him to note that I have a difficulty with his use of language.  I have a difficulty when officials use difficult language as opposed to what I or ordinary people understand.  When economic language is so different from the norm it becomes a crisis for democracy.  Rather it serves a particular purpose but that is a debate for another day.</p> <p>  As for specific questions on the Department's documents, I have an outstanding question on the allegation of fraud and the money.

It has a work programme and remit.  It undertook an investigation or forensic audit and discovered that there was an issue.  Perhaps the money was intended for a particular purpose but was not spent on that purpose.  I am only speculating here.  Let us say there is a project to support a particular community group or activity and then it transpired, with audit, that the spending was undertaken for a different purpose.  In effect, the SEUPB has a responsibility to us then.  We are the body to which it is accountable.</p></speech>

I welcome the initiative.  I believe it is very necessary to empower citizens but we disempower them by using language that they cannot understand.

The Secretary General should clarify and elaborate on that point.</p></speech>

The card is the physical manifestation of the process.  It is most important that we have identification that we know.

I am reading from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  In December 2009 the Department of Social Protection entered into a contract with a supplier at a fixed price of &euro;19.7 million.  I am not going to catch Mr. Watt out on little figures, but I am giving a timeline and examples of the large costs involved.  In 2009 the contract was entered into at a fixed price of &euro;19.7 million, plus 21% tax.  What was the contract for?  It was to produce 3 million cards by 2013.  Mr. Watt's Department and the Department of Social Protection were to work together, ag obair as l&aacute;mh a ch&eacute;ile.  That was the target.  Was it reached?  The answer is no.  Have we even reached that target?  The answer is no.  By June 2016 there were 2.6 million cards.  According to the report, the figure is now &euro;60 million.  Mr. Watt might update me, but the current position is that the Department has entered into a contract with a provider.  If it does not succeed in providing a certain number of card, the Department will still pay.  Mr. Watt is nodding.  Will he clarify the nature of the contract?</p></speech>

We can provide the Deputy with details of where it is.  We fully support this initiative which absolutely has been slower than we would have hoped.  The Deputy has indicated the numbers.  There are costs, but we must look at them versus the benefits.  We carried out surveys recently in which we asked people about their experience in interaction with the Civil Service.

It indicated the benefits from the perspective of the Department of Social Protection.  I am asking Mr. Watt about the matter in his very senior capacity.  He has described the process as exemplary, but he has not referred to a single problem that arose.  He does not refer to the cost involved, but he does tell us the card is the way forward.  I am telling him that so far &euro;60 million has been spent and that the 2016 contract provides for an advance payment to be made by the Department of Social Protection in January 2017 of 50% of the outstanding balance.  We will be paying in advance.  The cost of cards produced in 2017 is to be deducted in full from the advance payment.  Should the target of 3 million cards not be reached by the end of 2017, the cost of cards not produced will become payable in full.  It is late, but I cannot accept Mr. Watt telling us that the process is exemplary.  I ask him to look at that comment.  He could not possibly call it exemplary.  There is, however, a bigger issue.  This started as a social welfare card, but it has changed, at huge cost to the taxpayer and with no business case being made in advance.  It has metamorphosed into an identity card without any open discussion being held. but that is not Mr. Watt's fault.  Every person in the country must have it to access a passport.  Have I lost Mr. Watt somewhere?</p></speech>

I see it now.  We have been criticised repeatedly in that when it comes to the provision of digital services, we are not doing as well as we should.  The reason is we do not have a digital identity for every citizen in the country.  That is what the process is about.  The <i>mygovid.ie</i>gateway will be transformative.  I hope that in the future we can have a discussion with the Deputy about the benefits in comparison with the costs.</p></speech>

If I were to have a general discussion, it would be in the context of calling this a thriving economy, but that is a matter for another day.</p></speech>

What has the Department learned?  Why did it cost this much?  Why was there no business case made?  Why has the process been ongoing since 2004?  I am subject to correction, but it certainly has been ongoing since 2007 or 2009 and we are now in 2017.  Why has it still not been rolled out and why has it cost us a fortune?  Those were my questions and I have the answers.</p></speech>

We are almost done.  </p> <p>  I get the point on the public services card.  As I have not yet had to apply for one, everyone has not had to apply.  It started with the Department of Social Protection as a card that was needed or else a person would not receive anything.  It has since moved on and is now required to be issued with a passport or have one renewed.  It is a system that will eventually catch most adults.  If a person does not depend on receiving something from the State, separate from a passport, for now he or she can get by without it, but the need to have a passport will be the hook from which people will not be able to escape.  If a person does not want to have a passport or claim a pension or social welfare payment, he or she will able to survive without it.  That is how I see it.  </p> <p>  With regard to Deputy Catherine Connolly's questions, there are benefits to the card, but our job in this committee is to inquire about costs, the contract and lessons to be learned.  There are benefits, but we have to look at something else.  Mr. Watts knows this.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions about the Department's information and communications technology, ICT, strategy in general.  Will Mr. Watt give us the list of services that may be migrated to a digital platform?  We have just been talking about being able to tax a car while sitting at the kitchen table or applying for a passport or a driver's licence, with the ability to take a picture on one's phone.  What are the main services still being considered?</p></speech>

It is important that Mr. Watt listens to what I say next.   The Department now has to do the same for protected disclosures.  I have yet to meet a single body that knows how to deal with a protected disclosure.  Members of this committee are being inundated and I have yet to see a public body that has dealt satisfactorily with protected disclosure.  It is no good Mr. Watt saying that the Department has sent the circulars.  The Department needs to do what it did with FOI.  That is why I teased out that question.</p> <p>  We deal with third level institutions and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and almost every week people tell us about protected disclosures because people are utterly dissatisfied.  There are commissions of investigation into Sergeant McCabe's protected disclosure, and a social worker in the south east had to make a protected disclosure about Grace, who was placed in foster care by the HSE.  The system could not cope with that protected disclosure.  There have been others in the Irish Prison Service and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p>  For the third time I say I have to yet see a State body handling a protected disclosure adequately.  I note we probably only see the ones that did not work out.  There is ineptitude.  I have seen protected disclosures go to mediation, retired judges doing the adjudication and the public body three months later goes into the Labour Relations Commission and disowns the mediation report.  That was a case in the Irish Prison Service.  Mr. Watt might have been aware of that.  We are utterly at a loss and frustrated at the lack of ability in the public service to deal with these.  Whoever did the FOI training needs to bring that thinking to the protected disclosure and must move to that next. </p></speech>

We are providing overview training and more advanced training but I take the point.  Our Department has produced policy guidelines on how to deal with a protected disclosure and we have a process there which we go through.  All public bodies now have to have that same guide.  I might share that with the committee.  It is a question of people understanding, training and culture.  The culture needs to change.</p></speech>

It is a big system and lots of different things were mentioned.  Mr. Watt might give us a note on some of the lessons the Department learned, three years into implementing the new system.  It is important that lessons are learned because the Department cannot have got it all right.  I am not setting out to criticise because nobody can get everything right the first time.  There is no point seeing a mistake, correcting it and making a different one the next month.</p></speech>

I suspect very few, if any, of the issues set out in the first FEMPI legislation as to why we were in a financial emergency still exist, apart from the level of national debt.  I do not think Mr. Watt will be able to answer this question but do the criteria that existed when the measures were first introduced still exist?  We are inventing new excuses each year to keep it alive.</p></speech>

If there was a case for FEMPI then there is a case for housing emergency legislation in the public interest.  That is not Mr. Watt's Department but he could take that on board because it is a recurring theme here.</p> <p>  We feel that while mistakes were made getting into the financial crisis, one of the biggest mistakes made during the crisis was not to plan for the exit from it.  We are talking now about planning, zoning, sites and speeding up the planning process.  That should have been done three years ago at very little cost so that the houses we need now would have been built rather than in the next two or three years.  The housing plan is going out.  The troika left in 2013 and while another country would have planned for the recovery, we made no plans.  We waited till we got to where we are and sat back for two years.  We are two years behind catching up in the housing situation.  I am not saying this is the fault of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform but collectively, the Government and the Oireachtas did not plan adequately and we are playing massive catch up and it is getting harder and harder to catch up.</p> <p>  As there are no more questions I thank everybody for coming here today.  I apologise again for the late start.  One of the reasons for it was that we wanted to conclude all our business on the Votes in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report before the D&aacute;il recess and we had other reports on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and third level education, not to mention Project Eagle, which took up quite a lot of our work a few months earlier. </p> <p>  The committee agrees to dispose of Votes 7, Chapters 1, 2 and 18, the finance Votes, which it discussed this morning.  It also agrees to dispose of Votes 11, 12, 18 and 39 and Chapter 3 for this Department, which we have discussed.</p></speech>
