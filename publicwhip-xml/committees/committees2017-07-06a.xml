Whether we like it, disagree with it or are happy with it is another issue.  Does anyone want to make a specific comment on the matter?  </p></speech>

I find it extraordinary that when Caranua and the Department were here before us, and please correct me if I am wrong but I think the Secretary General of the Department attended on that occasion, nobody seemed to know the rental position and least of all Caranua.  Originally Caranua said it did not pay rent and the matter has since been clarified.  I mention this matter because at that point, Caranua said it was not paying rent and subsequently corrected itself.  The Department official who attended the meeting did not know anything about rent.  We now have a letter dated 16 June informing us that from the very beginning, the Department of Education and Skills directed that Caranua had to pay.</p></speech>

The fact that Caranua did not pay and allowances were made for it is to be welcomed.  I have a difficulty with the fact that the official from the Department of Education and Skills sat in on the meeting on that day yet it took until 16 June and our persistence to find out the position.  I still have no idea why further provision was not made for Caranua in the circumstances but that is for a different forum.  I am most unhappy with the way the information has been relayed to us.  I am also unhappy that rent amounting to approximately &euro;250,000 will be taken every year, if one takes VAT into account, in a fund that was specifically set up under statutory obligations to support victims who had attended institutions.  I shall leave the matter at that for today.  I am most unhappy with the Department of Education and Skills and that Caranua must now pay almost &euro;250,000 when there should be no need for it to do so.  Caranua should be facilitated in appropriate buildings that are owned by the State.</p> <p>  Prior to Caranua being set up, a different forum existed under the direct guidance or direct-----</p></speech>

Essentially, it boils down to the position being well known by all of the public bodies involved - the OPW, the Department of Education and Skills and Caranua.  There was a lack of candour and being upfront.  No-one told us straight up on the first day we asked the question.  We should not have had to go to such an extent to extract the information that we have received.  We might not like the information but it was well known to everybody who sat opposite us at all stages.  We had to extract the information.  It felt like we were pulling teeth.</p></speech>

We have a special report on financial reporting in the public sector, although it might not be relevant.  It deals with accounts and the presentation of information.

We expect them to assist us.  The point is well made and we will come back to it.  That is the OPW situation.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 625B, correspondence received on 30 June 2017 from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The document provides an analysis of expenditure relating to the Garda College division from 2009 to 2016 as requested by the committee.  We note and publish that and will discuss it as part of our compilation and report on the Templemore issue.</p> <p>  The next two items, Nos. 654B(i) and 654B(ii), comprise correspondence, dated 29 June, from Dr. Brendan Murphy, President of Cork Institute of Technology, on the 2015 financial statements.  This was requested at our meeting.  I have asked the people finalising the report on third-level institutions to review the document.  We hope to have the final sign-off on that education report in private session later today.  I have asked for anything that needs to be in our draft report to be brought forward.  In fairness, it is a good and comprehensive reply on the information we sought.  We have to acknowledge that a lot of information has been provided there.</p> <p>  The next item is correspondence dated 30 June from the Dublin Institute of Technology enclosing a breakdown of the library budget and legal fees for 2014 to 2016.  That or extracts from it can be considered for inclusion our report which we hope to finalise this afternoon and launch early next week.  We will come to our work programme shortly.  The correspondence is noted and will be published.</p> <p>  The next item is correspondence dated 3 July 2017 from Mr. John Barrett, executive director of human resources and people development in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We will come to that in a minute with the other Garda correspondence to take the two together.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 659B, correspondence received on 30 June 2017 from University College Cork enclosing information requested at the meeting of 22 June on the acquisition of IMI and on the Irish Maritime and Energy Research Cluster, IMERC, of companies.  I have asked for that information to be taken into consideration in the report we hope to finalise this afternoon.  In fairness, UCC provides comprehensive answers to the questions we asked.  We have good information there.  It is interesting that both CIT and UCC deal with a common interest in the IMERC and have provided a briefing note on the group of companies.  We received the same document from both on foot of our questions last week.</p></speech>

It is an extensive document.  They explain all the different subsidiaries.  When the representatives from the college appeared before us, we asked the president about the acronym SNO and whether it is the name of a company.  He could not provide full information on the day.  It is called SEFtec NMCI Offshore Limited.  That is where he got SNO Limited.  He has given us exact details of the company and the other subsidiaries.  The question was asked whether they paid Cork Institute of Technology for the use of its facilities.  It is confirmed that the company paid &euro;242,680 excluding VAT in respect of its costs before there was any dividend.  They also paid dividends of &euro;340,000 to CIT.  The functioning, costs and contributions of those organisations is well set out in the letter.  It is good to get that because the question was asked specifically the last day.</p></speech>

I asked for clarification on the internal audit and the procedure on it going to the board of governors.  I asked about the external review of IMERC, its status and a copy of it.  I asked for clarification as to whether a senior lecturer or lecturers had been appointed in non-compliance with procedures.  That information was not available.  They were to clarify those three things for me.</p></speech>

There are 17 pages in that.  In fact, both UCC and CIT provided the same report.  I see a reference to the internal audit committee in the reply from UCC also.  During the course of the next couple of hours, we might have an opportunity to review that in private session at least.  They appear to have provided good information.  That is UCC, CIT and some information from DIT on the library issue.  We note and publish all of those and will deal with them in private session before we complete our report later on today.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 649C, correspondence from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, in reply to a request from the committee for a response to correspondence sent to the committee by an individual on the use of public funds to obtain legal advice.  I propose to forward the reply from the Department to the correspondent.  We have dealt with it extensively and that is a further reply from the Department.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Next item is No. 650, correspondence of 23 June from an organisation on a complaint being investigated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the winding up of the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland in 2014.  The committee has been copied with the correspondence but it is addressed to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As such, we note it but someone else is acting on it.</p><p>No. 651C is correspondence received from a number of individuals with regard to Clonkeen College in Blackrock, County Dublin.  This was discussed last week and the secretariat has written to the Department of Education and Skills for a response.  I propose that we write to the correspondents informing them that we are awaiting a response and will contact them when have it.  Is that agreed? Agreed.  <br/><br/>No. 656C is correspondence dated 30 June 2017 from the chief executive officer of Horse Racing Ireland in response to a query sent by the committee about Dundalk racetrack and how much it actually costs, as well as various issues around loans and debenture which had been granted over the assets of the company.  This issue goes back several years but we will note this and send a copy of that response to the individual who wrote to us. <br/><br/>No. 657C is correspondence dated<b></b>2 July 2017 from an individual and concerns an investigation by the Revenue Commissioners into a complaint made by the individual as an employee.  I propose we write to Revenue to establish the process for hiring companies to carry out investigations of this nature.  The individual is, I believe, now a former employee.  We will wait for a reply and ask Departments and public bodies questions on their processes and procedures if there is a loss to the taxpayer.<br/><br/>Before I complete the correspondence there are two more items I want to bring to the committee's attention.  The first of these is item No. 658B, dated 3 July 2017, from Mr. John Barrett, executive director of human resources and people development at An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The document refers to matters concerning evidence heard by this committee about Templemore Garda College that Mr. Barrett believes is incorrect.  Other matters covered include the handling of a complaint about Mr. Barrett, a tracing methodology in respect of EU funds and a timeline of events from 2015 to present.  We will note that and consider it as part of drafting our report.  We had a meeting in private session yesterday and are scheduled to have another meeting next Tuesday.  We can discuss that then.  Would any member like to make any particular comment on this at this stage?</p></speech>

I just want to be clear about the status of any documentation that we get at this point.  Claims may be made that need to be either substantiated or examined.  Is it the case that it is not possible for us to do so at this point?</p></speech>

We will have no more public meetings so we have to conclude.  If there are issues on which we cannot conclude then we will just have to state that and consider them for further examination in part two of our report, which will be carried out after the summer recess.</p> <p>  Finally, we come to No. 663(i).  This is from Mr. John Nugent, chief administrative officer, and concerns various questions we asked in public session.  It is a short letter, less than a page, and I think we need to put it on the public record because it follows up on matters on the public record and directly replies to us.  I am also informed that further information from Mr. Nugent arrived in this morning.  This is currently being circulated.  All of this will have to be taken into account before we finalise our report on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The information here is not extensive but there is some information that is relevant to what we have been discussing. </p> <p>  The first issue in this letter concerns Mr. Culhane and Mr. Howard and responds to Mr. Culhane's earlier correspondence about the draft internal audit interim report.  The letter states that a recent meeting of the Committee for Public Accounts confirmed the Garda Commissioner initially sought legal advice over this serious matter and that Mr. Culhane was consequently invited to respond to Mr. Howard's correspondence.  The letter then goes on to say that Mr. Culhane responded and confirmed that he has withdrawn the two letters to Mr. Kelly, the internal auditor, at the Committee of Public Accounts, including the comments he made about Mr. Kelly's professionalism, personal motives and integrity.</p> <p>  We need to verify the transcript.  I know that I discussed this issue with Mr. Culhane and that he certainly did withdraw certain comments.  I do not specifically recall him withdrawing those two letters before this committee, which is what this letter said he did.  When the Commissioner was in here the second time I specifically asked her about the status of that letter, whether it still stood and whether it would still be standing by the time we came to producing our report. If that was the case, we would have to conclude that it reflected the official position of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Both she and Mr. Nugent said that the matter was going through a process.  We now have a letter saying that it was withdrawn in public session several weeks earlier.  This letter contradicts what we were told at the subsequent public meeting.  We need to get this verified.  It is possible that we missed the full withdrawal of the letter in public session.  If we did then we would be happy to put that formally on the record but first we need that verified.</p></speech>

This correspondence is, unfortunately, still coming in to us now, at the 11th hour.  They know that we are up against the clock and that we have to get a report out.  It strikes me that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is waiting until the very last minute to give us the information we need.  Does the Chairman know if there is still a deficit of information?</p></speech>

This is to be welcomed on one level but cannot take away from any perceived failures in process and procedures.  Retractions and withdrawals can be noted but we are dealing with what happened in real time.  This needs to stated clearly.  We can welcome and acknowledge withdrawals and retractions but they should not influence our report.</p></speech>

If this committee did not receive the full level of co-operation expected then that in itself will be an issue in our final report.  I am putting that on the record here now.  To corroborate what Deputy Cullinane just said, this letter from Mr. Culhane would never have been withdrawn, if it is indeed withdrawn, but for the fact that it was raised here at the Committee of Public Accounts.</p></speech>

There are a lot of remarks about other people and we have not tested these either.  I do not expect that we will be able to include this as part of an appendix to a published report of the Committee of Public Accounts.  We will have to discuss this.  We would have to go through the letter line by line to see if we could put our names to including it in our report.  There is certainly information here that we can work into the report but full publication is a different issue.</p></speech>

For one thing, I must say that I found it very helpful.  It contains opinion, certainly, but there is no difficulty in discounting that.  It also points to certain facts that I found to be very helpful.  I read this in advance of yesterday's meeting in private session and gave my view of the issues arising from it.</p><p>As far as I am concerned, there is wilful delay on the part of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are being drip fed information in response to very simple questions.  The letter from Mr. Nugent to do with Mr. Culhane is a kind of catch-all to cover all the bases, having been dragged kicking and screaming to give some kind of a response.  I recall him withdrawing comments under pressure, but, in the first instance, how does one withdraw a letter?  Had Mr. Culhane written to Mr. Kelly and copied to us an apology, a seeking to withdraw, a regret and all the rest of it, that might be one thing, but this is in effect a third party, albeit the line manager, writing on behalf of someone-----</p></speech>

I have read this morning's correspondence as well.  While there are these full pages with brief comments on item this and item that, it is a box ticking exercise.  One issue came up in the stuff that I read this morning about the 50 accounts.  It said all are closed except those that are private or club accounts.  That is an issue for me.  What private and club accounts?  What money is in those?</p></speech>

We received this letter yesterday and I think another one came late yesterday evening.  It might have been circulated last night or this morning.  From that point of view, it came in.  However, what we have to adjudicate next week is the replies we did not get, that is, that which is outstanding.  If something happens or we get useful information, we are pragmatists.  We are not giving an extension but we will not ignore it next Tuesday.  Definitely not.</p></speech>

The other thing is that a letter would have gone to the Central Bank about the credit union.  I am presuming it did go.  I had understood that it was being sent more than a week ago.

We will note that.</p> <p>  The next item is the work programme.  To be clear, today I am proposing, once we finish this session, to bring in the officials from the Department of Finance to deal with the Finance Vote.  In the afternoon, we will have those from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in regard to its Votes.  That session will also include the special report on financial reporting in the public service which the Comptroller and Auditor General produced a little while ago.  We will discuss that with the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the afternoon.</p> <p>  Before we get to that session, I want to have a private meeting to utterly finalise the education report which we hope - it is not definite - to launch next Tuesday.  We are at a very advanced stage.  If we complete the session with the Department of Finance before the voting block, we will start into that private session.  If not, I really want to finish with the Department of Finance before the voting block and then we will commence immediately after the voting to sign off on the education report during a short private session.  We will then move onto the session with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  That is the working plan.  If we leave signing off the education report until after the session with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, it will be later on in the day and some members may not be able to be here at that stage, so we will get that cleared.</p> <p>  As I said, we are meeting in private session next week in regard to the Templemore report.  The other thing I want to highlight relates to next week's meeting.  The Garda Commissioner will be in to deal with the Garda Vote.  There will also be officials from the Courts Service to deal with its Vote.  There will be a joint session with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service to discuss the collection of fines and the penalty points issue.</p> <p>  We asked that the report on the number of breath tests was to be dealt with as well but we were informed last night that the report is not expected to be finished by next Thursday.  It was one of the items that was on our agenda.  We are informed that the report is not expected until the end of the month.  Therefore, we will not be able to deal with the issue in any great detail.  We had scheduled this to be our last meeting of the year to give time to have this report done.  We were informed last night that it will not be finished in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na until the end of the month.  By the way, I wish to say that Deputy Commissioner Twomey will not be available on that day.  However, the Commissioner is here as the principal witness with her two assistant commissioners.  Therefore, it is only out of courtesy that I am saying that he personally cannot be here on that day, but the report will not be available to us on that day.  I think that is a matter-----</p></speech>

The Committee on Justice and Equality has dealt with the issue already.  At that point, it was expected that there would be answers to questions.  Here we are months later.  We had scheduled the meeting but the report is still not complete, which means that the public still does not have answers to those questions as to exactly what happened.  I imagine it will now be the autumn before we can come back to it.  Is that so?</p></speech>

I will commence by speaking about the finance accounts.  The annual finance accounts present the receipts into and issues from the Central Fund of the Exchequer, together with a set of statements that itemise the transactions.  The financial statements of the national debt, which are prepared by the National Treasury Management Agency, are presented in full as Part 2 of the finance accounts.</p> <p>  The finance accounts provide a statement of Central Fund transactions on a cash basis and are not a comprehensive set of annual financial statements for the State or central government.  All revenues of the State are paid into the Central Fund of the Exchequer, unless otherwise determined by law.  Examples of State revenue which is not paid directly into the Central Fund include PRSI receipts which are paid into the Social Insurance Fund and the proceeds of motor tax which are paid into the local government fund.</p> <p>  The chapters that are the subject of today&rsquo;s meeting were compiled to highlight key aggregates and trends in Central Fund transactions and in broader State liabilities. </p> <p>  Chapter 1 summarises the Exchequer outturn for 2015.  Receipts in 2015 totalled &euro;58.6 billion, representing an increase of &euro;8.9 billion, or 18%, compared with 2014.  This was mainly due to increases in tax revenues of &euro;4.3 billion and a number of one-off capital receipts totalling &euro;3.6 billion.</p><p>Issues from the Central Fund in 2015 of &euro;58.7 billion were &euro;750 million or 1.3% higher than in 2014.  The movement in Central Fund receipts and issues is shown in the diagram which is now on screen.  This indicates that in 2015 the Exchequer deficit was almost eliminated - the shortfall for the year was just &euro;64 million.  This compares to an Exchequer deficit of &euro;8.2 billion in 2014.</p><p> Members may wish to know that I issued my audit report on the finance accounts for 2016 last week.  It is the Department's responsibility to present the accounts to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</p><p> In chapter 2 of my report, I outline the trends and composition of Government debt and the cost of debt servicing.  The most comprehensive measure of Government debt is general Government debt.  This is an internationally standardised measure of the total gross debt owed by all Government bodies to third parties outside government.  At the end of 2015, the general Government debt stood at just over &euro;200 billion.  There was a very small decline in the level of debt year on year.  However, the ratio of general Government debt to GDP declined to 79% at the end of 2015 from 108% at the end of 2014.  This sharp reduction reflected an exceptional increase in the estimated value of Ireland's GDP in 2015, attributed to the activities of a small number of large multinational firms, including the relocation to Ireland in 2014-15 of a few big economic operators.</p><p> The main component of Ireland's general Government debt at the end of 2015 was the gross national debt.  This is the cumulative borrowing undertaken by the National Treasury Management Agency on behalf of the State.</p><p> Gross national debt stood at &euro;196.6 billion at the end of 2015, down marginally from the end of 2014.  The cost of servicing the national debt fell by 6% to &euro;7.1 billion in 2015.  This reflected a fall in the estimated average cost of servicing the debt, from 3.8% at the end of 2014 to 3.5% at the end of 2015.  By June 2016, the average had fallen further to 3.4%.</p><p> Turning now to chapter 18 in relation to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012 requires me to report to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann with respect to the correctness of the sums brought to account by the council each year.  Chapter 18 is my report for 2015.  My report on the audit was issued on 30 June 2016 and I gave a clear audit opinion.  Expenditure by the council in 2015 amounted to &euro;823,000.</p><p> The 2015 appropriation account for the Vote of the Office of the Minister for Finance records expenditure totalling &euro;26.3 million on five programme areas.  The expenditure on financial services policy recorded in the appropriation accounts is &euro;7.6 million.  However, it should be noted that this does not include costs associated with staff who are seconded to the Department from the NTMA to deal with banking sector issues, and certain related consultancy costs.  Those costs are borne by the NTMA and are not recouped from the Department.  The level of costs in that regard is not disclosed in either the appropriation account for Vote 7 or the NTMA's financial statements.  At the end of 2015, a net &euro;6.1 million was liable for surrender from Vote 7 back to the Exchequer.</p></speech>

I am joined by Ms Ann Nolan, second Secretary General, Mr. John McCarthy, chief economist, Mr. Derek Tierney, head of corporate affairs, and Mr. Fiachra Quinlan of the finance unit.<br/><br/>I would like to focus on the four specific items on today&rsquo;s agenda.  The first is Vote 7 and the 2015 appropriation accounts for the Department.  The Estimate for 2015 was set at &euro;30.6 million.  Spend for 2015 was &euro;24.4 million, leaving a surplus to be surrendered of approximately &euro;6.2 million.  This surplus arose for a number of reasons.  Recruitment did not progress at the pace anticipated, resulting in a pay bill underspend of around &euro;1.1 million and a further &euro;600,000 underspend on non-pay administration expenses.  There was also an underspend of &euro;3.1 million on programme related costs arising from the completion of some work in-house and lower costs in relation to the shareholder management unit.  The Department also recouped an additional &euro;500,000 in respect of costs associated with the stabilisation of the banking sector.  We remain committed to seeking to minimise costs where possible, subject to achieving the best outturn for the State.<br/><br/>I draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to the following key points.  Tax revenues for 2015, at &euro;45.6 billion, were up &euro;4.3 billion or 10.5% year on year and &euro;3.3 billion or 7.8% on profile.  Within that figure for tax revenues, the increase was distributed across the three key tax heads.  Income tax grew by 7%, corporation tax by 48.9% and VAT by 7.1% year on year.  On the expenditure side, total expenditure, at &euro;58.6 billion, was up &euro;700 million or 1.2% year on year.  This was driven by increased voted expenditure which showed an increase of &euro;600 million.<br/><br/>General Government debt as a percentage of GDP fell to 78.7% in 2015 from a peak of 119.5% in 2012.  This downward trend is projected to continue with a debt to GDP ratio of some 72.9% forecast for 2017, which is in line with the euro area average. <br/><br/>I would like briefly to turn to performance and outputs in recent years.  The Department was restructured around two directorates in 2016 &ndash; the economic and fiscal directorate and the finance and banking directorate.  This structure remains largely unchanged in 2017.  The Department is working towards achieving two broad goals, namely, a sustainable macroeconomic environment and sound public finances; and a balanced and equitable economy enabled by a restructured, vibrant, secure and well regulated financial sector. <br/><br/>I am greatly encouraged by the robust pace of the recovery in the economy, with GDP increasing by 5.2% last year.  The increase in economic activity is broadly based and economic fundamentals are strong.  Export growth in recent years has been robust and exports continue to contribute positively to growth.  This is a reflection of the progress which has been made to restore our competitiveness.  Notably, the domestic sector is now driving growth in the economy, with private consumption up 3% in 2016. <br/><br/>Recovery is perhaps most clearly evident in the labour market, with annual employment having increased in each of the last 18 quarters, representing an increase of 231,000 jobs since the low point in 2012.  Strong employment gains have driven a substantial turnaround in unemployment, which has fallen from a peak of more than 15% to 6.4% in May.<br/><br/>Key economic indicators point to continued solid growth this year.  The Department is forecasting growth of 4.3% this year and 3.7% next year.  Despite the pace of the recovery and the strength of our underlying economic fundamentals, we must be conscious of the uncertainty in the external environment which underlines the need for caution supported by prudent economic and fiscal policies.<br/><br/>Public finances also continue to move in the right direction, with significant progress being made on the general Government deficit.  Ireland exited the excessive deficit procedure in 2016 and it is planned to reach the medium-term objective of a structurally balanced budget in 2018.<br/><br/>Underpinned by a growing economy, the hard won improvements in our public finances provide a sustainable budgetary platform upon which funding for the provision of public services can be provided in the years ahead.  The market reaction to our management of the public finances has been positive but it is vital that we sustain our progress.  We must guard against complacency, maintain our prudent management of the public finances and continue with competitiveness oriented policies. <br/><br/>Brexit is one of the serious challenges for the economy<b>. </b>The Government approach has outlined twin Brexit goals, the first to secure the closest possible economic and trading relationship between the EU and UK, and the second to prepare the economy to cope with turbulence of coming years and the structural shift of new realities of Brexit.  The best and most immediate policy within the Government's control to counter the likely turbulence of coming years is to prudently manage the public finances to ensure Ireland's economy continues to remain competitive in the face of future economic headwinds. <br/><br/>The last budget outlined a number of policies targeted at the most exposed sectors, measures to support small and medium enterprises, entrepreneurship, agrifood, and exporters, while also targeting potential economic opportunities, such as competing for mobile international investment in the international financial services sector.  The Government has also put forward Dublin as an excellent location for the European Banking Authority post-Brexit.<br/><br/>A key focus for the Department in the past year has been the sale of the State's investment in AIB.  The successful capital reorganisation of the bank in 2015 provided a supportive backdrop for the commencement of this process and significant work has been undertaken by the Department and its advisers over this period to achieve a successful outcome for the State.  The recent completion of the initial public offering, IPO, represents a significant milestone and not only has it resulted in a substantial sum of money being returned to the State, but it also creates a strong platform for the State to recover all of the money it has invested in AIB over time.  At the end of this process, the State will continue to hold 71% of AIB, which is worth around &euro;9 billion, and will continue to be a substantial focus for the Department for some time. <br/><br/>As with any organisation, we must strive to evolve, improve and embed the skills necessary to the job at hand.  This is an ongoing process.  I am pleased to report that the Department was awarded the best learning and development organisation for 2017 for a medium-sized organisation as part of the Irish Institute of Training and Development awards.</p><p>The award is an endorsement of the commitment of the Department and its staff to the development of a learning culture focusing on both hard skills and those of leadership and management necessary for the job.</p><p> I express my appreciation to the staff at the Department for their ongoing hard work.  It is only through their continuing commitment and dedication that we can deliver on our objectives.  The Department will strive for continuous improvement and develop into the best organisation it can possibly be.

The delegates are very welcome.  I want to start with the Government debt.  In 2014, it was &euro;203 billion.  By 2015, it was &euro;201 billion.  The debt-GDP ratio dropped by 120% to 79%.  Am I right on that?</p></speech>

The year 2015 saw a very significant increase in GDP.  I recall a figure of 26%.  We do not have the details of the companies because the CSO collects that information.  If it is a small number, it does not make it public.  The figure resulted from a number of factors, primarily the onshoring of intellectual property, which has a very high capital content.</p></speech>

The net result was that we had a very big GDP number that drove down the debt ratios and, in fact, improved all the ratios.  Internationally, debt ratios and fiscal ratios are reported against GDP.  The net result is that we needed to look through the national accounts figures to see if we could develop an alternative that gave a truer picture of the underlying indebtedness of the State.  An expert group was set up under the chairmanship of the Governor of the Central Bank, with participation by Mr. McCarthy and a range of other people.  We anticipate, with the publication of the national accounts in a few weeks, that we will have the first indication of what is known as gross national income (Star), GNI*.  This will be a measure that cleans out a lot of those issues related to globalisation and it will give a truer sense of what the ratio should be.</p></speech>

With regard to aspects of that debt, I want to strip the matter back a little.  How is the turning of the promissory notes into sovereign debt captured?  I got a reply to a parliamentary question referring to the acceleration of the paying down of the debt.  A minimum amount was to be paid off.  I do not know the exact terminology.  The eight floating rate notes had a range of maturity dates from 2038 to 2053.  Between 2016 and 2018, the figure was to be &euro;0.5 billion per year.  From 2019 to 2023, it was to be &euro;1 billion per year, and from 2024 onwards, it was to be &euro;2 billion per year.  The process has been accelerated.  There is now an outstanding balance of &euro;17.5 billion in terms of floating rate notes.  Essentially, there has been an acceleration.  How is that reflected in the debt?</p></speech>

It is debt whether it is in the Central Bank or the NTMA.  To that extent, how it is stated is the same.  One reason the NTMA has accelerated the buy-back is that interest rates are extremely low at the moment.  I refer to floating rate notes.  If interest rates were to increase, it would increase on those notes.  If one can borrow for 20 years and lock in a low interest rate, one would be as well off to accelerate that swap.</p></speech>

I totally get the Deputy's political point that she does not believe the country should have accepted that debt.  They are Government bonds that rank <i>pari passu</i>whether they are held in the Central Bank or somewhere else.<br/><br/>In terms of the classification of debt and the issue of whether there was a game-changer, the argument from a purely market-based point of view was that unless there was a prospect of that debt being locked in for a long time, we could not have gone back into the markets and got the interest rates down to where they are now, which is an extremely low level, much lower than we would have imagined even when we did the deal.  Now that the interest rates are so low and there is a possibility of them going up, if we accept that it is debt, which we do, I, as a technician, have to accept it is debt and that the Government has taken it.</p></speech>

In terms of being prudent, to what extent is that factored into the management of the economy because, increasingly, we are seeing those costs absorbing huge amounts of household income?  Google, for example, said more than two years ago that accommodation was a real issue for it.  Is it a real issue for the Department of Finance in terms of prudently managing the economy?</p></speech>

It has consistently done that.</p> <p>  One of the issues that we have with success is that as employment numbers go up and as unemployment falls, we start to get to a capacity constraint.  We have got higher demand for goods such as housing and so on, but also as one gets down to near enough what technically would be full employment, let us say 5% or thereabouts, one starts to get those additional pressures and the potential for overheating within the economy.  I do not think we are quite there yet, but we have to and should be concerned about it.  In terms of cost of living and accommodation, everybody is very aware of the supply constraints within the housing sector.  That is a concern for all of Government and a set of policy responses is either in place or is being put in place.  The reality is that there is a big gap between demand and supply and that puts pressure on prices.</p></speech>

Competitiveness goes beyond simply wages.  There are lots of other issues as well, including the capacity constraints, for instance within the housing sector.</p> <p>  The increase in capital expenditure that has already been announced for 2018, including the additional funding for the Action Plan for Housing, is just shy of 17%, and there is an increase of nearly 15% in 2019.  At the moment we are looking at capital spending going from approximately 4.5% or 4.6% this year up to over &euro;7 billion on the basis of unchanged policies by 2021.  That has of course to be done within a fiscal framework.  There are fiscal rules that make sure we do not let debt and deficits get out of hand but the Government is prioritising capital expenditure within that envelope.  I do not want to get into policy.</p></speech>

Obviously a whole lot of things help to define it.  It is not just the Department of Finance.  I am acutely aware that local authorities, for example, hold several hundred million, for example, in development contributions that they are not permitted to spend because it is obviously keeping a balance in terms of the overall balance of the State's finances.  We heard recently from the universities when they were before the committee.  For example, there was a purchase by UCC of the IMI, both the company and the assets.  We heard from one of the witnesses that a look is being taken at other issues that might come into play as part of the debt that are not currently counted as part of it.  First, the Department has to have some controls and that is evident with local authorities but it does not seem to extend to all sectors, for example, the university sector.  Does that stand out in any particular way?</p></speech>

It is a question of what is on the Government balance sheet and what is off it.  The university sector is not on the Government's balance sheet.  There is a rule of thumb but it is much more complicated than this, but if an entity derives more than 50% of its income from non-governmental sectors it is outside the general Government expenditure and not counted in that piece.  Clearly, local authorities do not do that but the universities do.  They have to manage their affairs in that way so it does not fall within our remit.</p></speech>

I want to come back to the overall debt and the exposure as given that it can move in, equally, it can move out.

It will only leave the escrow when the determination is made at the end of whatever period of years the case takes.

One has to realise that the economy, as it grows, will increase the GDP, which is the denominator, and it will come down, not at the rate we saw in 2015 but it will come down.  As we move from a situation of borrowing large amounts of money to not borrowing, it will help with the ratio falling as well.  There is a dynamic there.  The affordability of debt is ultimately how much the economy earns in a year and its capacity to repay.</p></speech>

We pay more taxes and all of that.  In terms of our exposure, onshoring seems to me to be something to which we should be paying very serious attention.  Has a risk analysis been carried out in respect of it?  If it was to go back up to 120% as a result of an overnight change, how would it impact on us?</p></speech>

It is more a function of the nominal growth and such growth was 32% in 2015.  The onshoring or growth rate in 2015 reduced the debt ratio by 25 percentage points.  We published analysis in June which says that we do not have the GNI* available and GNI*, as the Secretary General mentioned, strips out some of these strange issues.  Our best estimate is that the debt ratio to GNI* is still in excess of 100%.  We will be able to calculate it accurately next Friday when the CSO publishes GNI* for the first time ever.  Our exposure is on the GNI* basis rather than the GDP.  The Deputy is absolutely right.  There is an exposure if this IP is very mobile.  It can move out as well as in.  In quarter 4 of last year, we saw more IP coming onshore in Ireland.  It is a risk so we carry out a debt sustainability analysis.  We have published our annual debt report.  What would be the impact on the debt ratio if for instance GDP was to fall by x% or x+2%, if interest rates were to go up or if there was a contingent liability shock?  We are doing that war-gaming, so to speak.</p></speech>

In the corporate tax space, there has been this base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process.  Part of the drive of that was to take intangible assets out of tax havens, usually small islands in the Caribbean, and bring them onshore to countries that had substantive and positive tax rates.  It is part of that process.  In some respects, the scale of it was more surprising than anything else.  Some of the impact on the national account is a result of the way the onshoring was structured.  What one will see over a period of years is more and more multinationals taking those intangible assets out of the Caribbean and bringing them into-----</p></speech>

A very important distinction is that when intellectual property is brought into the country, it has to be treated as a separate trade.  Capital allowances do not swamp the core activities of the companies.  It is treated as a separate trade.  The capital allowances are offset against that and, ultimately, taxed on that base.  It probably removes the risk to the corporate tax that has been paid within the jurisdiction.  This is real.  It is a consequence of what was happening around the BEPS process.</p></speech>

We did not see a whole lot of it in 2015.  There are very real things, such as housing, that have a real impact on the economy on a permanent basis.  Where, in theory, there are some funds available, our ability to borrow is one of the big impediments to solving this problem.  Would there be some value, in the context of being prudent in managing the economy, to invest more heavily in one of the things that is actually restricting growth in the domestic economy by virtue of the amount of money being absorbed by households in terms of the cost of accommodation.</p></speech>

We have a set of rules and those rules prescribed a direction.  There is a freedom for any Government to make a decision at any point to spend any amount of money but the rules require that we raise the moneys in a way that is sustainable, in other words through a tax or a charge or other channel.  We get into debates about fiscal space.  Fiscal space is only that piece we can do without going to discretionary revenue measures, without raising taxes.</p></speech>

The piece for the Civil Service costs goes back to the guarantee.  There is probably very little of that left now because there is hardly any of the guarantee left but there are other things that have happened subsequently where we have, for example, sold the preference shares.  It would have been in the original deeds of the preference shares that if we had expenses, they paid them.

The scale of what hit us before anybody else is quite significant, and Mr. McCarthy was a member of the group.  Ten or 11 countries showed a particular interest because they have a greater or less exposure around this.  In terms of what it is fundamentally, it is for us not to forget that we have a very high <i>per capita</i>debt and a huge sovereign debt burden.  The legal denominator will always be GDP for all the reports internationally, but there are differences in the structure of the Irish economy that we need to acknowledge.  GNI* gives us that metric to look at that.  We will see the number next Friday, but it will probably be around 100% compared to 73%, which I believe is our current estimate for the end of this year.  Mr. McCarthy might deal with our interest internationally.</p></speech>

As the Secretary General mentioned, other countries have this issue as well.  Within the EU 28, I am aware of 14 or 15 national statistical institutes that have identified onshoring of intellectual property, IP, as being an issue for them.  Some of them are large countries and the IP coming onshore is not ginormous, whereas we have the opposite.  We are a very small country in terms of IP coming onshore, so it completely distorts our accounts.  What we need to do is to try to get an indication in terms of repayment capacity.  Debt to GDP is not a good indicator of repayment capacity.  Debt to GNI* is.</p> <p>  The reality is that we are at the coalface in terms of these issues.  We are a very globalised economy and that presents challenges for us as advisers and for politicians in terms of making decisions, but also for statisticians in trying to measure what is going on because we have issues such as production that takes place in the Far East but which is included in the Irish national accounts for legal and statistical reasons.  There are huge statistical issues, so we believe GNI* will be a better indicator of what is going on in the economy.</p></speech>

It is perfectly plausible to me, especially when we have a debt ratio on a GNI* of 100% or &euro;201 billion, to be exact, that one should not finance this by issuing more debt.  If we decide that we have needs in a particular area, be it infrastructure or whatever, as I mentioned, we are doing it but we have to be able to finance it. That is not unreasonable.</p></speech>

If there are particular needs in one area, one makes choices around how that area is prioritised over others.

We did not get an adequate return for that.  That was a mistake.

Are we calculating the fiscal rules on measurements which are less reliable in this State than they are in other states?  I am not interested in the consequences.  We have to work within the fiscal rules and calculate how they work in this State.  We were calculating them on debt-to-GDP on GDP figures.  Mr. John McCarthy just said they are less reliable in this State because of the extent of how multinationals locate here.</p></speech>

The information content in GDP is much less in Ireland than it is in other countries.  We are still obliged to use GDP by our legal obligations.  International organisations and financial markets will continue to look at GDP because it is the internationally accepted norm.  GNI* is a domestic measure which no other country produces because it gives a better indication as to what is going on in the economy.</p></speech>

That is correct.</p> <p>  On the debt-to-GDP rules, Mr. John McCarthy earlier said the rules are silent on how long it would take to get to the correction of the 60% of debt-to-GDP and that it would have to be done at a reasonable or correct pace.  The only absolute rule is that it would be done on the basis of a one-twentieth ratio.  Are we exceeding that ratio year on year?</p></speech>

The debt relates to the stock but the more important and binding rule is the balanced budget rule and the need to achieve the MTO, medium-term budgetary objectives, and to correct it at a sufficient pace which is 0.5% of GDP per annum.  Both rules are binding.  While we may overcorrect or reduce the debt ratio faster, we are still obliged to correct the structural balance.</p></speech>

I think everybody is on the same page, so what we are trying to do is to look at ways in which we can increase capital spending if possible.  If it is not possible under the rules that is fair enough but we just need absolute certainty.</p> <p>  The final issue I wish to raise is the marginal tax rate above 50%.  We hear a great deal about that.  How many PAYE workers are paying a marginal tax rate above 50%?</p></speech>

I just wanted to get confirmation on it.  The marginal tax rate is the income tax rate, the USC rate at the top, which is 8%, and then the PRSI rate.  For those who earn between &euro;32,800 and &euro;70,000 the maximum they would pay is 49% to 40% on a portion of their salary on PAYE, 5% USC and 4.1% PRSI.  Is that correct?

That is the first thing.</p><p>I am reminded of <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>.  This is a tale of two countries.  I am fascinated by the language that is used.  I wish I had more time today to examine it.  I know we are a bilingual country but we certainly have two languages going on here, namely, the language of economics, which is very restricted, and the language of those on the ground who are at the receiving end of this very narrow view.  I will preface my comments with that.  Do the economists and financial people look at that?  The last statistic I looked at before I came in here was that house prices are rising by &euro;1,000 per week.  At the end of the month 375 people were on trolleys in hospitals, 37 in Galway, and there are constant moderate reports from consultants telling us that a direct consequence of spending time on trolleys is premature death.  Before I ask any specific questions, does that come into their reckoning at all?</p></speech>

What we try to do is take an overview of the financial and economic position into which all of those challenges fit.  In terms of whether we talk to representative groups or people about those sorts of challenges, the answer is "Yes".</p></speech>

Mr. Moran said he does not deal with the policy but in a sense the Department has made judgments in terms of the use of phrases such as: "Key economic indicators point to continued solid growth".  He also said: "I am greatly encouraged by the robust pace of the recovery".  In addition, he referred to "a balanced and equitable economy".  I could name any amount of statistics but if we take health and housing where the latter is in major crisis, where does that feature in the overall report in the context of the "robust pace of recovery"?  Where does housing come into that?</p></speech>

The key economic indicators are that the economy is growing.  That does not mean the growth is evenly spread.  It does not mean that we are without problems.  What happens perhaps after the depth of crisis we have had is that periods of underinvestment catch up with one.  The reality is that over the past four to five years there are 230,000 more people in work than were heretofore.  The unemployment rate has dropped from more than 15% to just over 6% and is on its way down.  In terms of what the Department of Finance does, it is a measure of well-being.  Below that, in terms of Government policy and in the policy space generally-----</p></speech>

I accept that employment is up and that must be welcomed, but it is a discussion for another day as to what type of employment is up, for example, zero-hours contracts and work involving precarious hours.  Mr. Moran presents some figures by way of backup for the thriving economy and his view that we are going in the right direction.</p><p>There are other figures that indicate the economy is not thriving at all.  We see house prices increasing by &euro;1,000 a week and a complete crisis in direct construction by local authorities which is leading to vast waiting lists.  For example, the waiting list in Galway goes back to 2002, which means that people have been waiting for 15 years and not a single house has been constructed.  Mr. McCarthy has referred to the billions going into housing, but the money is actually going into housing assistance payments which go straight into the pockets of landlords.  In turn, this artificially maintains house prices at an unacceptable level.  Where does this feature in the five-page document?  Can the Department of Finance stand over it as housing policy?</p></speech>

When it comes to an analysis of the economy, the indicators are the ones about which I spoke.  Within any financial framework the Government of the day makes choices as to where it will invest and how it will address the problems to which the Deputy is alluding.

However, the Department of Finance's paper refers to certain indicators while ignoring others.  That is what I am taking exception to, although that might be too strong a word to use, but that is what I am highlighting.  The paper refers to being greatly encouraged by the robust pace of the recovery and so on.  There are many other indicators that tell us we should be very concerned about the pace of the economy.

House prices are continuing to go up and they are going up at a rapid pace.  Is that something at which those of us in the Department look and about which we are concerned?  Yes, it is.  However, house prices are still about 30% below their peak.  I do not think anyone should aspire to reaching their peak values because they were not sustainable, but they are well below them.  They are, however, going up faster than earnings.  Is that a cause of concern at which we look?  Yes, it is.  Is it being driven by cheap credit or a credit bubble?  The answer is no.  Credit is not that cheap and the level of mortgage lending is still subdued.  Are people over-leveraging, as they did in the past, with all of the social and financial consequences?  The macro-fiscal rules the bank has brought in place absolute constraints on what people can borrow as a multiple of their income.  We have to take a number of views on it.  Are we looking at it as an economic risk factor and so on?  Yes, we are.</p></speech>

We lost &euro;18 billion in revenues on the fiscal side per annum, all of which had to be replaced.  At the same time the unemployment rate climbed from full employment to 15% in that period.  Suddenly, we had significant outlays in social spending.  Spending pressures increased and we had a fiscal contribution.</p></speech>

This drags us back into-----</p></speech>

I am looking at risk assessments here and specific mention was made of Brexit.  I actually think that Brexit offers opportunities, as has been acknowledged by many people, but that is for another day.</p> <p>  This is the last D&aacute;il in which to take any meaningful step to stop climate change.  The 2006 Stern report, which I am sure the witnesses have read, is a landmark study on the economics of climate change.  It clearly pointed out in 2006 that it would be 20 times cheaper to prevent further climate change.  The London School of Economics, not known to be a particularly radical organisation, published a paper in 2015 that concluded that the net economic benefits to countries from tackling climate change continue to outweigh the costs.  I could quote many other groups, none of them radical, arguing that we must tackle climate change and that it is major risk to economies and to economic productivity on many levels.  Where is that built in here?  Where is the Department alerting the Government to this risk?</p></speech>

Let us look at how we feed into the issue of mitigation.  In 2008 we changed the vehicle registration tax to base it on carbon emissions rather than engine capacity as expressed in cubic centimetres.  This was a mitigation factor to try to improve quality.  That raises other issues as we go on.  Other gases become important and that raises policy challenges in itself.  In 2010 we introduced a carbon tax, initially on oil fuels, but now on solid fuels as well.  The plastic bag levy is another example.  We have had many policy inputs on this matter.</p></speech>

We need to hold these up, however, against what needs to be done.  I am talking about the economic challenges posed to our country by climate change in terms both of the direct effects and of the enormous fines we will be obliged to pay within few years, which range from &euro;600 million up to more than &euro;5 billion.  We are talking monopoly money here.  That is not built in the witnesses' statement.  Why is Brexit the only risk outlined here?  Am I in trouble, Chairman?</p></speech>

We are about to get an opening statement from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It will refer to the key importance of addressing infrastructural needs.  The European Union, which apparently sets the fiscal rules we cannot change, is criticising us for not investing in infrastructure.

I will tell the witnesses what we are talking about in the Committee of Public Accounts which we feel the Department is missing entirely.  The first is the amount that is due under the redundancy and insolvency fund.  We have heard the Taoiseach - the witnesses need not get into the politics - talking a lot about publishing the names of people caught for social welfare fraud of more than &euro;5,000 while it is &euro;33,000 for taxpayers.  There is a lower threshold.  We understand the majority of the redundancy and insolvency fund will not be paid.  We are satisfied from what we have heard that no one gives a hoot about collecting it in public bodies.  It used to be in the Department of Enterprise and Employment, which shipped it over to the Department of Social Protection, which has not done an analysis of how much of it is actually collectible.  Some of it has to be collected.  Some of it refers to companies that have been restructured and are still there.  We have had correspondence from the Department of Social Protection.  It says that it writes to Revenue to find out if PAYE numbers are still valid.  However, there is no connection.  If it related to interest on a deposit account of someone on social welfare, the State would be able to match that up and track that down.  However, there is no proper tracking down of it here.  I am just saying that there is a gap in the Department's national accounts and it needs to look at it.</p> <p>  I will give a second example.  When companies are liquidated, sometimes there is an asset at the end of the liquidation process which, ultimately, if there are no shareholders, is to be transferred to the State.  We have not established the Department has a mechanism to do that.  The Department got a big receipt the year before last of &euro;10 million.  A company in England sent it over to us.  We heard about that during a meeting last year.  To put it in layman's terms, it is the corporate equivalent of someone dying intestate.  I am satisfied that there is no mechanism in place by anyone.</p> <p>  I am just giving three examples that have crossed our desk in the past 12 months.  The third example relates to the household charge.  Before the local property tax was introduced, there was a &euro;100 per annum charge.  If it was not paid, interest was charged.  If it was never paid, &euro;7,200 is now due.  In the year in question, the Department collected &euro;30 million.  The following year, it collected &euro;30 million.  Last year, it was a lesser amount.  When selling a house, a person has to get an up-to-date certificate from the local authorities and normally has to discharge that charge before the sale can go through.  That proves to me that there is money out there to be collected but the Department is doing nothing about it.  It is only if someone is selling a house that he or she gets caught at that point.  There has to be a mechanism in place.  The Department has to talk to the people who are over collecting the money.  This is not just the Revenue Commissioners.  The Department collects money separate from them.  The Department needs to talk to those people about having a mechanism to compare those houses which have come into the local property tax net, which I think is nearly 100%, with those that should have had a liability for the household charge.  There is tens of millions of euro out there that zero effort is being made by the State to collect.  It collects some of it by default when someone tries to sell a house.  Some of that is contingent income which I think the Department does not take into account.</p> <p>  How much is in the rainy day fund?  I think it was established last year.</p></speech>

Okay.  Everyone pays an annual dividend.  Two years ago it was projecting &euro;2 billion, &euro;2.5 billion, &euro;2.6 billion, &euro;3 billion, &euro;3.2 billion and now &euro;4 billion.  Given that NAMA is tidying up property loans which contributed to the housing problem and is sitting on what is expected to be a conservative surplus of &euro;3 billion to &euro;4 billion, can some of that not be used in the meantime to deal with the housing crisis?</p><p>There are two aspects to that.  First, the surplus is projected.  It does not exist yet to some extent, although NAMA is making profits at present.  However, it does not have a surplus because it has not yet paid off all the debt.  The surplus is what will be left when it pays off all the debt.</p></speech>

There is nothing exactly like NAMA.  I am not promising the committee anything since I am retiring and I will not be responsible for it, but the instinctive rule will be to say it is the same.  However, we have between now and then - it will depend on what comes back - to develop a case that might allow us to use the money in another way.</p></speech>

It has to be nearer the time.  One can develop the case but if one puts it upfront, it will just say "No".  One develops the case between now and 2020, and it depends on how the money is coming back.  One has to ensure all the debt is repaid.</p></speech>

It is on target.  It was set up with a ten-year term.  The Minister encouraged the quick big sales to the vulture funds.  We have had special reports on that and a commission is looking at Project Eagle, which was the first big sale.  That was all in an effort to get NAMA to wrap up a little sooner.  What if it does?  It sounds as if the Department has not made a case yet.  I am disappointed to hear that.  While there is certainly a minimum surplus of &euro;3 billion, which is a conservative estimate, because we think it is not coming to us any sooner, we are not making a case as to how those funds could be utilised.  This is known as planning ahead.  Ms Nolan is also saying - in light of current thinking - that NAMA's projected surplus of at least &euro;3 billion will sit there until 2020 and all the good things-----</p></speech>

Half a dozen semi-State companies have made dividend payments to the State each year.  They cannot be guaranteed to be profitable two or three years hence.  It is exceptionally conservative that NAMA cannot even pay an interim dividend or an interim payment.</p></speech>

It is the state-aid rules under which the EU agreed to keep NAMA off-balance sheet in the first place.  NAMA must repay all the debt, which is the senior debt we guaranteed and the junior debt that it owed to the banks, before it makes any dividend payment to the State.  The arrangement is that we get the surplus at the end.  That was the arrangement from the beginning.</p></speech>

Perhaps Ms Nolan will send the committee a note on how she thinks that is shaping up.  There might be a quick answer to my next question.  When some of the banks got into trouble, the taxpayer had to bail them out.  Essentially, what happened was that the bank debt, which was a problem debt, was handed over to NAMA, another State organisation, which, through its work, effectively reprivatised that debt to vulture funds such as Cerberus, etc.  Instead of the debt being held by Irish banks, it is now held by the international vulture funds.  Are the main companies that bought the funds from NAMA regulated here?</p></speech>

We only bailed out the banks because the Irish people had deposits in those banks and if we had not bailed them out the Irish people would have been at a loss.  Perhaps, even more importantly, Irish businesses needed the banking system to keep working so they could keep working.</p></speech>

Others might not, but I do.  That is my personal view.  AIB and Bank of Ireland are now profitable and they are starting to pay dividends.  What is the position with corporation tax from the banks we bailed out?  Now that they are profitable and talking about profits of &euro;1 billion, when will we see corporation tax from those banks?</p></speech>

When one reads the banks' annual accounts, however, one can see that they still have deferred tax assets, that is, they have losses on their books that they set against corporation tax.  We talked earlier about the bank levy and that is one of the main reasons we have a bank levy.  It is not just the banks that we bailed out, it is all the banks in the system that have deferred tax assets or losses on their systems.</p></speech>

Like the other semi-States that I mentioned.</p> <p>  I have one or two more questions.  Looking at page 11 of the finance accounts, will the witnesses tell me about what is not here in the Central Fund?  In 2015, Ireland paid &euro;1.952 billion to the EU.  Under that there are receipts from the EU of &euro;66 million, a fraction of that.  We had it here with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and it slipped away from the Committee of Public Accounts because the money that we received from the EU in respect of agriculture does not come through the Department Vote or the Central Fund because it is audited by the European auditor.  Essentially, it has not crossed our desk, except that we have asked for it in the last year.  What is the net position of Ireland being a net contributor?  Could we have a breakdown of the last few years?</p></speech>

On the money that we borrowed from the troika, at the end of 2015 we still owe &euro;50 billion, mainly from the European Stability Fund, and the Stability Mechanism Fund.  Some of it does not have to be repaid for some time.  The average repayment of that is up to 18 years.  It is the case that we have paid off the IMF contribution in full?</p></speech>

The UK, Sweden and Denmark loans are also about five years.  There are mixed views on this.  Some would say that having the troika keeping an eye over our shoulder is a good thing for the Department of Finance, given what happened.  Perhaps it is no harm that it is still under its surveillance but the other view is that if they were paid off, the Department would not be under its direct surveillance.  Can the Department give us a note on the pros and cons?  Is it good for Ireland to be under the surveillance of the troika or not?  As the Secretary General of the Department of Finance, would Mr. Moran prefer to have the IMF having direct surveillance over his Department or would he prefer if were an ordinary member of the IMF, where it makes an annual visit as it does elsewhere?</p></speech>

It is the decision of the three funding agencies, not only what we would like.  We have two visits from the troika annually.  They are relatively short compared to what they were.  They are primarily interested in our capacity to repay the money we owe it.  There is nothing much beyond that.  In terms of an annual article 4, our relations with the IMF is back to a regularised position.  That is our main engagement with it  It is always useful to get some sort of external view.  We get that primarily through engagement in the traditional way, such as with the OECD and the IMF visits, not from the surveillance missions.</p></speech>

Looking at the AIB sale again, given that money was borrowed to buy out AIB, now that the State has got some of that money back, it has to go back against the borrowings as a financial transaction.  I understand that.  Has the Department calculated the interest that Irish taxpayers paid through current revenue on the borrowings to bail out AIB since 2008, since the bailout?  I would expect a minimum of that because it was interest paid on a year-by-year basis that came out of current revenues.  We could argue about capital, but there is a strong case that part of the proceeds of the sale of AIB should go back to recouping the interest that we paid on the bailout of AIB as a minimum.  What are the Department's figures on that equation and where are we on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-06a.695" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Derek Moran" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017070600002#T03200"><p>All borrowings are just that.  The State borrows the money it needs.  It is not separately identified against what the need was.  We do not have a stream of borrowing that is identified as AIB.  It is possible to look at the money that was injected and track what that might have cost over time but it is not an exercise that we do.</p></speech>

During the years when we were paying interest, the income from AIB was probably higher than the interest going out.  That is not to say that justifies what we did but it is not simply one way of the other.</p></speech>

The Department might look at that.  I would have thought the capital which we borrowed is different from the interest that we paid on that capital borrowing.  It cost taxpayers money to pay for that during that period.</p></speech>

The briefing note we got from the Department of Finance was document No. 653A(ii).  It is interesting how this was brought into it.  On page 34, it states that the Department of Finance received &euro;12 million in 2015 under the fair deal scheme into the Central Fund.  That note says that the collection of funds commenced in 2011.  I do not have the previous years' figures.  I ask the witnesses for a note on what has come in from the nursing home support scheme from 2011 up to the estimate for 2017.  Is that money collected from the estates of deceased people, or what are we talking about there?</p></speech>

It is not right that &euro;12 million from the fair deal scheme, where payments are being met out of the HSE current budget, comes in the back door to the Central Fund and the Department of Finance for receipts from the fair deal scheme, and that there is no mechanism in place to pass it directly back to the HSE to pay for ongoing fair deal schemes.

Since we meet credit rating agencies, the IMF and investors as part of our day-to-day job, we had to try to explain where this was coming from.

I understand the minimum amount for 2016 to 2018 was &euro;500 million a year.  According to a reply to a parliamentary question I got last night, it was &euro;3 billion in 2016.  It is &euro;2 billion so far in 2017.  That is way ahead.  We met the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Philip Lane, maybe a year ago about this.  I think he said that they would be "extinguished".  My understanding is that we printed money and have to take it back out of the economy and that is what the IOUs were, and that we have to extinguish them.  We do not have to extinguish them as quickly, and the witnesses explained about how money is cheap at the moment.  If we can park that and just spend it, and pay it down in the timeframe - I have a real problem with it and do not think we should be doing that - does that not leave some capacity to borrow for things that we can borrow for now and save later on?</p> <p>  I want to come back to a point that Deputy Catherine Connolly made.  We are going to have cash fines imposed on us as a consequence of not meeting our 2020 climate targets.  It will become a real issue for the Department of Finance when there are cash fines.  It will not be something theoretical but something in practice.  We are going to miss the 2020 targets and by virtue of the fact that we are on the wrong trajectory, we are going to have a real challenge with the 2030 targets.  We should spend on some of the things that would ensure we avoid those fines, which could be very substantial.  Would that not be a more prudent approach if there is the ability to pay this other way?  Does that space exist if we do not approach the payment of those floating rate notes and have not accelerated it?  Does that create a space to spend money in a different way where it is cheap to borrow and we will save money in hard cash and fines as early as 2020?</p></speech>

The accelerated programme of selling over the minimum has been to avail of very positive interest rate environment which probably makes it sensible to do that.</p> <p>  On borrowing to invest, essentially any borrowing we do at the moment is for investment purposes.  The current account is in balance or in surplus and any borrowing we do is on the investment side only.  We are not borrowing for day-to-day spending.  On climate mitigation, Deputy Murphy is absolutely right.  We face a challenge in 2021 and beyond of fines and not meeting the targets, and we are on the wrong trajectory.</p></speech>

The two areas we can probably influence the most are housing or built stock - in terms retrofitting and avoiding the loss of energy in order to make buildings more energy-efficient - and public transport.  Some of those projects are very big.  The ones that will bring a real return are those such as the DART underground, where we could borrow for a long-term purpose in the same way that led to the construction of the London Underground in Victorian times.  I am only talking about the capital side here.  It strikes me that we are paying off promissory notes when we could invest to save by at least heading towards the 2030 targets by taking an initiative now.  I cannot understand why this is not seen as prudent.  I am probably straying into policy.</p></speech>

That is a different story and it is just my opinion.  At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, the Minister said that the fiscal rules are not fit for purpose in light of Ireland's demographic situation and capital needs.

We have heard a great deal from a lot of commentators and Mr. McCarthy and Mr. Moran will be aware that the Committee on Budgetary Oversight has done much work examining capital spend with regard to fiscal rules.

We have gotten a range of changes and clarifications at a European level which have actually improved the application.  I sometimes upset Mr. McCarthy when I say a "problem with the rules", but the rules are a single set of rules to fit every country in the EU.  It is a "one size fits all" approach.  They are not very adaptable to the peculiarities and particularities of individual countries.  In each of the years since the rules have been put in place we have worked through them and we have gotten a number of very technical changes which have helped us.  Mr. McCarthy is the chairman of what is known as the output gap working group, which is an integral part of the process.  He chairs that group at a European level in order to drive forward an approach based on a greater degree of common sense.</p></speech>

This is unfortunately technical and we will try to provide a note in layman's terms as the Chairman has requested, although it is not easy.  In 2015 or 2016, after we came out of the excessive deficit procedure we were concerned about the reference rate, which is a key metric which feeds into the calculation of fiscal space.  It is updated in the rules every three years.  It is calculated out over a ten-year timeframe and it has backward and forward-looking components.  We felt that process was unfavourable in an Irish context because in 2015 it would have taken into account the negative potential growth rate in 2010 and 2011, when the economy was in the depths of the crisis.  We made a very strong economic argument to the Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs, DG  ECFIN, that it should be updated on a annual basis, which would have meant eliminating those years from the calculation.  I am open to correction on this because it was a couple of years ago but that change increased fiscal space by approximately &euro;400 million to &euro;500 million in that year and in subsequent years.</p></speech>

That would be helpful.  Mr. McCarthy offered up a staunch defence of the fiscal rules a number of times.  That is fair enough.  He also spoke a number of times about the economic crash and said that the reason it occurred was because we did not have rules to the extent that we do now.</p> <p>  We need to bring a big elephant into the room, and park it there, in terms of the reason for the crash.  In the first instance, there was an over-reliance on consumption taxes.  There was excessive commercial borrowing and excessive lending by the banks which led to the crash.  The Department of Finance, the people who in the past sat where Mr. McCarthy and Mr. Moran sit now, were also asleep at the wheel and did not see any of the flags.  Let us be realistic when Mr. McCarthy throws this issue back at us in respect of the crash.  We understand there was a crash.  The people we represent suffered greatly because of it.  The Department of Finance, however, needs to take responsibility for having been partly responsible for a lot of the policy decisions and their implementation.  Does Mr. Moran think it is possible that in making sure that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past that we are now going too far in the opposite direction?  Are we restricting spending to the extent that we are creating pressures in health, housing and infrastructure?  Everybody accepts that these pressures are there.  Does he understand how difficult it is for us as public representatives to see these huge pressures in public services?  They are obvious and real.  They are not imagined.  Yet all we hear is that academic, economic language about the fiscal rules, which may or may not be appropriate.  A debate can be had on them.  Mr. Moran can imagine our frustration.  That is why I am asking this question.  </p> <p>  The Minister has said today that the fiscal rules which currently exist are not fit for purpose because of the demographic pressures in this State.  For once I agree with the Minister for Finance.  Changes need to be made.  What work has Mr. Moran and his Department done specfically up to now to make sure that we can get the changes we need to allow us to spend money - not unrealistically or recklessly - in the way that is necessary to ensure that the people who need health care get health care and that the people who need a roof over their head get a roof over their head?  Will Mr. Moran point out to me, in simple language, what changes to the fiscal rules he and his Department have sought but not gotten?</p></speech>

It goes back to this concept in the rules.  I will say this carefully, the fiscal rules as they stand are in general probably a good thing as a framework.  We have a set of rules that apply to the totality of the EU.  The economies of the area are very different in terms of scale, size, dynamics, recent history and so on.  To that extent, there are occasions where they can be entirely counterintuitive in terms of how they apply at any point in time.  I absolutely recognise that.  In the end, we have come from a situation - and I think we began some of this discussion earlier - where in 2007 we had a debt rate of 25% and we reached 120% within a couple of years, which exposed the country to huge problems.  We have to try to get the balance right to prevent that happening again.  In the end of the day, the rules are an integral part of the overall fiscal pact.  There was a referendum on this whole structure a number of years ago and it is the framework in which we operate.</p></speech>

I was one of those who campaigned against that referendum.  It is very interesting that people who campaigned for it are now saying the fiscal rules are a "one size fits all" approach which needs to be changed.  I welcome their conversion.  In my view, which is possibly correct, it is possible that we have gone too far in the opposite direction and have put a straitjacket on ourselves.  That is the point I am making.  If I was to be political about it, and I do not want to be, I measured the policies of the Tea Party in the United States against the fiscal rules and found very little difference between them.  And yet, that group would be seen as very economically conservative, even by the standards of the US.</p> <p>  I would like to comment on capital gains tax, which is discussed on page 11 of the briefing note Mr. Moran has provided to the committee.  It says that the top ten in terms of capital gains tax, CGT-----</p></speech>

It says that the top ten returns accounted for almost two thirds of receipts with a similar share attributable to company directors or shareholders.  This seems to be very similar to corporation tax in that it is peculiar to a small number of companies.  Mr. Moran was asked earlier about the corporation tax for companies and he said that Revenue does not give the Department the names of the companies.  Is it possible that these are the same companies and that not only do we again have an overdependence on a small number of companies in respect of corporation tax but potentially that same overdependence in terms of capital gains tax?</p></speech>

We are well aware of the concentration risk on the corporate side, which is a big number in overall terms while the capital gains tax represents a smaller figure.  The difficulty with CGT is that when a gain is made at a certain point in time the tax paid becomes payable at that point, so it varies over time.  I do not have a particular insight which I can offer the Deputy around how CGT returns match with the top ten payers in the context of corporation tax.</p></speech>

There is a whole movement here with all sorts of things such as trusts and, particularly, foundations.  The point has been made to us by numerous third level institutions that less than 50% of their funding comes from the State, so I thank Mr. Moran for clarifying this.  We have had Garda representatives come before the committee repeatedly and given them a very tough time regarding off-balance-sheet transactions.  It might be a bit of an exaggeration, but it is a parallel system of accounts, and it seems off-balance-sheet methods are the direction in which the Government is now going.  If it can find a way to build houses off balance sheet and have a health system off-balance sheet, it will seek to do so.  Is that right?  Am I wrong?  Am I simple-minded?</p></speech>

The Garda, for example, thought - as did the Department of Justice and Equality, mind - that it was okay to be off-balance sheet.  Is this not worrying for the Department of Finance?  In the witnesses' training, do they not look at other things that are equally important in a thriving economy and learn that housing is the most basic requirement?  If we have a housing crisis, property prices rising by &euro;1,000 a week and Government policy stating it will give money to the private system in the guise of social housing, does that not trouble Mr. Moran as an indicator that this economy is not thriving?  Should the Department not be looking at the rules and telling the Government it will comply with them as that is its job, but that this is the result and the collateral damage?</p></speech>

It is not a response, but I will make it seeing as it was mentioned that he chairs a group dealing with some of the fiscal rules at EU level.  There would be a concern in some countries - I am not saying it is a unanimous view - that the fiscal rules and this drive to be off-balance sheet to keep within the fiscal rules is resulting in what I would call social engineering.</p><p>It is having a serious social engineering effect because of the issue with building houses. We had a financial crash, the banks went bust and some people have large mortgages.  We are very quickly moving from a position where 80% of Irish people owned their own houses in one generation to being lucky if 20% of the next generation will own their homes.  That is what happens at European level.  The attitude to that is so be it, but in the way that Irish people live their lives that represents social engineering in Ireland.</p><p> Does the way society operates in various countries come within the financial strictures of Mr. McCarthy's work at EU level?  I know that is not exactly the reason that Mr. McCarthy is at this meeting.  I accept that he may not agree with that viewpoint, but would he accept that it is a point of view?</p></speech>

I stressed this point when responding to Deputy Catherine Murphy at the start, and the Secretary General also made a reference to it.  The fiscal rules do not constrain what one spends, they simply constrain the bottom line.  If one wants to choose a Swedish type of expenditure model, one can do it but one has to be able to finance it.  If one chooses an UK type, where Government spending as a portion of GDP is at the lower end of the spectrum, one can do that as well.  It is a policy choice.</p> <p>  I do not want to go into policy but it is a policy choice as to whether we want to spend to address these issues, and certainly there are issues to address.  We do not live in a bubble.  There is nobody present who is not conscious of the issues, but it is a question of how to finance them.  We would be concerned.  The Chairman has a view, which is legitimate.  I have a view that fiscal sustainability is the issue, because if we loose that it is back to the troika again.  That would create issues.  We spoke of the &euro;201 billion debt.</p> <p>  Other countries have issues.  I chair a very technical group on how one measures the structural balance, rather than the policy about it.  There is another element to it in which I am not involved, that is, the statistical treatment of some of these issues, to which the Secretary General alluded.  EUROSTAT does not like anything that Government tries to put off balance sheet.  EUROSTAT had its fingers burnt with Greece, where Greece got the data wrong and suddenly it had a deficit that was three or four times what they thought it was going to be.  EUROSTAT has become increasingly strict in terms of the balance sheet treatment of anything.  We saw that with Irish Water.  We considered that, in conjunction with our colleagues in the CSO and in the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government that we had done enough to keep it off balance sheet, but EUROSTAT came up with obscure reasons, which we still do not understand, as to-----</p></speech>

We are dealing with: Vote 11 - Office of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Vote 12 - Superannuation and Retired Allowances, Vote 18 - Shared Services, and Vote 39 - Office of Government Procurement.</p> <p>  We had also intended to consider the special report by the Comptroller and Auditor General on the financial reporting in the public sector but because of the late hour, we will hold over that special report and come back to it in the autumn.  There is one other special report from the Comptroller and Auditor General we will have to get to as well, but we will leave that to one side.  If anyone had in their opening comments a reference to that, we will come back to that separately.  We will stick with the Department, including Chapter 3 - Vote Accounting and Budget Management, and leave the special report to one side today.</p> <p>  First, I apologise for the late hour of starting.  Mr. Watt will be aware we dealt with the Department of Finance this morning.  The committee had four or five meetings with third level institutions over the past month or two, and as we are getting near the end of the D&aacute;il session, we wanted to finalise our report in committee today, which we have done, with a view to launching it on Tuesday next.</p><p>That took a little bit of extra time to finalise.  Even though the D&aacute;il has still to sit for a few hours, we are only now, at this time of the evening, getting to the second half of the public part of the meeting.  I have indicated the topics we are going to cover.  We are joined today by Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and also Mr. Paul Quinn, Mr. David Feeney, Ms Helen Codd, Ms Paula Lyons, Mr. Frank Griffin and Ms Fionnuala Burke.<br/><br/>I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  The witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br/><br/>Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits or objectives of such policies.  They are also reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/><br/>I call the Comptroller and Auditor General to make an opening statement.</p></speech>

The 2015 appropriation account for the Office of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform records gross expenditure totalling &euro;40.8 million, divided across two programme areas: the public service management and reform programme, on which &euro;24.1 million was spent, or 59% of the expenditure, and the public expenditure and sectoral policy programme, which accounted for the balance.  At the end of the year, the Department had underspent by a net &euro;4.1 million relative to its budget.</p> <p>  Vote 12, superannuation and retired allowances, is used to pay for Civil Service and prison officer pensions.  Pension payments for other public servants are charged, directly or indirectly, to other votes, including those for education, health, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Army pensions.  The gross expenditure on Vote 12 in 2015 amounted to &euro;499 million, an increase of 5.3% compared with 2014.  Appropriations-in-aid, mainly comprising employee pension contributions, amounted to &euro;136 million in 2015, up 30% from 2014.  The increase was due mainly to employee contributions in respect of the public service single pension scheme, which was introduced for all public servants appointed since 2013.</p> <p>  An unusual feature of the account for Vote 12 is the absence of administration expenses.  The Department of Finance administered the pension payments charged to Vote 12 on behalf of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and charged the associated administration costs to its own Vote.  In December 2015, responsibility for administration of the pension payments transferred to Vote 18, shared services.</p> <p>  The 2015 appropriation account for the Vote for shared services records gross expenditure totalling &euro;26.2 million.  Overall, there was underspend of &euro;18.7 million, almost 42% relative to the Estimate.  A sum of &euro;13.2 million was spent on activities related to PeoplePoint, which handles human resources activities centrally.  A sum of &euro;9.3 million was spent on payroll shared services, and &euro;2.3 million on other shared services projects, including a shared financial management project.  Expenditure on the payroll shared services centre was &euro;7.8 million, or 46%, less than provided for in the Estimate, mainly due to the later than anticipated transition of certain payroll clients to the shared services office.  Expenditure incurred on set-up costs for the financial management project was &euro;8.2 million, or 78%, below estimate.</p> <p>  In the statement on internal financial control, the Accounting Officer draws attention to salary overpayments and steps taken to address this issue.  I am carrying out a review of the issue this year and expect to include a chapter in my report on the 2016 accounts of the public services later this year. </p> <p>  The year 2015 was the second year of operation for the Office of Government Procurement.  Gross expenditure of &euro;14.3 million was &euro;5.3 million, or 27%, lower than estimated.  Note 3 explains that a delay in obtaining office accommodation impacted on recruitment with knock-on effects in other areas of planned non-pay expenditure, resulting in an underspend of &euro;2.8 million.  Procurement and subsequent implementation of external support services for the office also took longer than originally planned, resulting in an underspend of &euro;2.4 million.</p> <p>  Chapter 3 is a standard report that aims to consolidate and summarise Vote expenditure for 2015 across all Votes and to demonstrate medium to long-term trends.  Gross voted expenditure across all Votes in 2015 was &euro;46 billion, the same as in 2014.  This represents a cumulative reduction of almost 13% since 2010.</p></speech>

There are issues in regard to underexpenditure across a number of the Votes.  The reasons for that have been set out very clearly.  They relate mainly to a number of reform projects that have been committed to.  We had a slower than expected take-up on a number of initiatives, slow recruitment processes and retention of contractors involved in delivering some of these projects.  These projects are very significant.  Obviously, what Mr. Paul Quinn is driving in terms of procurement reform and what we are doing in shared services comprise very significant transformation projects.  We have an issue all the time in respect of trying to get the pacing right and trying to pace our projects in a sensible way, ensuring value for money while at the same time ensuring we are spending what is allocated and keeping within profile.  We are aware that, for 2015, there were significant underspends, as set out in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  As a Department, we are very much conscious of ensuring we set out only Estimates and draw down amounts as close as possible to those, consistent with the financial procedures.</p> <p>  More generally, in terms of managing spending, the committee will be aware that a key part of our job is not just preparation of the budget but also executing it during the year.  A key issue for us is to ensure overall spending stays within profile.  Again, the Comptroller and Auditor General has set out in the report our performance in this respect.  It varies from year to year.  On average in recent years, we stayed at about 2%.  The variance against profile is around 2%.  There are many reasons for that.  They relate to forecasting errors, issues around forecasting demand, particularly in regard to the health service, and specifically Government decisions on issues such as the Christmas bonus or additional moneys allocated for capital programmes.  Especially during 2015, as taxes exceeded profile, the Government had the opportunity to make some additional investments in capital infrastructure and it provided for some restoration of the Christmas bonus.  That was the first time it was done since the economic crash.  It is an ongoing challenge for our Department in terms of managing spending in line with profile.</p> <p>  I will touch on some of the reform issues with which we are pushing ahead.  Procurement reform, shared services and digitalisation are issues we discussed previously at meetings of this committee.  We are pushing ahead with those.  Two issues that have taken up a lot of our time this year relate to the negotiations on the recent pay agreement.  Deputies will be aware that the unions are now in a process of balloting in respect of the new agreement, the extension of the Lansdowne Road agreement.  It is very important in terms of securing industrial peace and co-operation with ongoing reform but also necessary to ensure we have a pay settlement that is affordable and sustainable for the State.</p> <p>  My next point is on the capital review.  I heard some of the discussions this morning when the members were debating with colleagues from the Department of Finance on capital spending and issues associated with that.  The Government is now considering the mid-term review of the current capital plan.  The Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, hopes to announce on budget day some additional projects and allocations in respect of capital spending.  It is a key part of what the Department is engaged in now.</p> <p>  We are delighted to be here and to answer any questions that arise.  I thank colleagues in the Department for all their work.  It is very rare we get the opportunity to thank people in the Department for all the effort they put in.  Members are aware of the significant work that goes on in the Department in terms of the various projects.</p></speech>

The SEUPB organises the process of inviting grant applications, vetting grants and allocating the money.  The accountability mechanism, as the Deputy will probably recall, reports to our Department and our counterpart in Northern Ireland, the Department of Finance and Personnel, DFP, and the two relevant Ministers have overall responsibility for its management.</p></speech>

There were differing views between ourselves and the Revenue Commissioners as to whether this should be the subject to either professional service withholding tax or PAYE.  We reached a view and then in further discussions with the Revenue Commissioners they disagreed with that view.  On settlement of the matter, we had to pay a further amount.  It was, therefore, a different interpretation of exactly what the relationship of the people involved was in the contract with the Department.  Obviously, if the Revenue came to a different view, we had to then make that settlement with the Revenue.</p></speech>

There, the Taoiseach and Ministers discussed the budget and heard from a variety of interest groups concerning their budget priorities.

What was agreed and what we were told would form part of the new open and transparent consultative process was a summer economic statement in the first instance followed by the NED.  Just because the Government decides that it will rejig Departments should not mean that this sequence should not be followed.  I am concerned that we have already reverted back to type and that we are engaged in box-ticking rather than genuine consultation.  That is my opinion.  Why was there a delay in the SES?</p></speech>

The Deputy knows that we have a new Government, with a new Taoiseach and a new Minister.  It is appropriate for the new Government to consider its budgetary strategy.  In parallel to this, the Minister has appeared before several committees over the past week to discuss where he believes the economy and the budget are.  Mr. Derek Moran and I have attended the Committee on Budgetary Oversight and spent several days at the NED discussing matters with people.</p> <p>  There is a more open and different approach to budgeting.  When I was involved in the Department of Finance in the early 1990s, the budget was prepared and announced to the people on one day and there was no SES, NED, oversight committee, performance report or Maastricht returns.  Our current approach to budgeting is different and more open, with Deputies having an opportunity based on parameters set out by the Department to discuss the budget and the options that the Government faces.  It is a different situation.  Obviously, it would have been better and more desirable had the SES been published in advance of the NED.  Hopefully, we will revert to that sequence next year.</p></speech>

In the absence of fiscal rules from the EU, we would still have to manage our affairs in a way that would put a constraint on the resources that we use for current and capital spending.

A debate is happening outside the Houses.  The trade union movement through ICTU, IBEC on behalf of the business groups and almost every other group is saying that the fiscal rules in respect of capital spending are not fit for purpose.

How has it engaged with its sister Department - the Department of Finance - and the European Commission?</p></speech>

We will increase it by 70% between last year and 2021.  That is the main thing that we are doing.</p> <p>  No matter what the rules are, we will need to manage our affairs in a way that will place a constraint on our amount of current and capital spending.  We must decide on whether to fund capital by borrowing within the rules or by increasing taxation within the rules.  That is possible for us.  There is no bar on the Government deciding that it wants to fund more capital or current spending within the fiscal rules by taxing people or generating the revenue.  As constructed, the rules count capital spending the same way as other spending apart from the smoothing rule, of which the Deputy will be aware and under which an increase in spending of, for example, &euro;100 million would only use up &euro;25 million of the fiscal space in any given year and the full amount by the end of the four-year period.  There is an issue in terms of capital smoothing.</p> <p>  The only change to the fiscal rules that would make a difference would be if it was decided at EU level that capital would be treated in a different way so that governments would be allowed to balance current spending and borrow for capital purposes, which is the so-called golden rule.  That differs from the approach that underpins our current rules.</p></speech>

We are moving towards it, so our spending can grow in line with potential growth adjusted for the convergent margin, which is a function of how far our deficit is away from the structural balance.

Smoothing is one example, and the Department of Finance told us there were others which we had succeeded in getting from the Commission.  If there are other flexibilities which the Department has sought but not got, perhaps Mr. Watt would furnish us with a report on those.</p></speech>

The only issue on capital spend relates to smoothing and there are ongoing debates between the Department of Finance and the European Commission about the application of the rules, because they are ambiguous.  They refer to a structural balance but this is unobservable.  There will always be a debate on potential growth and the convergence margin.  The Department of Finance has set out the details but this will always be uncertain and subject to discussion.  We do not know how fast the economy can grow in real or nominal terms and we do not know at any given time where we are in the economic cycle, whether we are close to potential output, whether there is an output gap or whether it is minus or plus.  All these factors have an impact on the way we can grow spending.</p></speech>

I have a slight concern that, outside the Committee of Public Accounts, there is an ongoing live and necessary debate on the application of the fiscal rules and their fairness, and whether they are fit for purpose.  In a D&aacute;il committee this morning, the Minister expressed the view that they were not but I do not get a sense of urgency from either the Department of Finance or the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, or that they recognise the debate going on outside.  I ask Mr. Watt to forward on to me any information on changes that have been secured or sought.  I am only giving my opinion on these things.</p></speech>

There was a strike by ASTI members in secondary schools but I do not think any other public servants have gone out on strike in recent years, though there may have been strike notices.  There were issues with Luas and other drivers but the secondary teachers represented by ASTI were the only example I can think of in the public service.  As the economy has recovered, people's expectations change as do their perceptions about what the State can afford.  They see unemployment falling and wage growth in the private sector again and public servants feel they should benefit from the upturn in the economy.  They had very significant cutbacks in pay during the crisis and average pay reductions for teachers, garda&iacute; etc. were between 10% and 15%, with more significant decreases for those at higher levels.  People legitimately have an expectation of getting some of this back and that has led to greater debate on how we manage resources to meet those expectations.</p></speech>

I have met Mr. Watt and the Minister a number of times on this issue and have tried to get a costing for returning the public service to a single-tier pay structure.  We were given a figure of &euro;208 million but it was not dealt with in the extension of the Lansdowne Road agreement.  It is extraordinary to have an agreement seeking to maintain industrial peace but which failed to deal with the driver of a lot of the industrial unrest which still looms in some unions.  It is extraordinary that this one key issue was not dealt with.  We have a recruitment problem in some areas of the public service but the issue of new entrants was not dealt with.  Can Mr. Watt explain why?  Notwithstanding any requests from the trade union movement, did the Department have its own priorities going into public sector pay talks?  Why was returning the public service to a single-tier pay structure not a priority issue for the Department?</p></speech>

There is a limited pot and whatever money was used for other things would have to have been taken away from the general increase across the different grades.  There always has to be a trade-off and a discussion about what we can do within the resources.  Many anomalies that arose from decisions taken between 2008 and 2011 were addressed and in the previous agreement new scales were put in place to close much of the gap.</p> <p>  There are different opinions on the idea of equal pay for equal work.  The Department has an assistant principal and an administrative officer on the first and second point of the scale.  They are doing the same work as somebody who came in a few years earlier but that person will be on a different point on the scale.  There are colleagues who are also on different pension arrangements.  People who came in after 2012 are part of the single pension scheme and pension conditions and contributions are very different from those of colleagues who came in before.  Equal pay for equal work is open to interpretation and there are issues around it.</p></speech>

This mainly affects people who came in after 2012 but the new agreement leads to very significant reductions in the pension-related deduction, PRD, contributions to be made by people who came in after 2012.  The new entrants who lost out from the pension arrangements benefit from the agreement significantly in this regard.</p> <p>  Any employer needs to look at what rates of pay are required to attract staff.  After the end of this agreement, new entrants to the teaching profession on 1 January 2018 will have a starting salary of &euro;35,000, which will go up to &euro;37,000, &euro;38,000 etc.  Given the marketplace for graduates, starting salaries are very competitive.  The Department recruits administrative officers as the standard graduate intake, whose starting salary is between &euro;29,500 and &euro;30,000, and we have no difficulty attracting fantastic graduates at that rate.  The Government has to strike a balance, to be fair to different groups while-----</p></speech>

From 1 January 2011, in addition to all of the other FEMPI cuts, workers who came into the system suffered further cuts.  There was some merging of bands in the Haddington Road agreement and there were PRD changes in the most recent agreement.  I fully understand what was taken and given back and the workers to whom I referred are still not on the same pay scale.  We are not operating a single-tier pay structure.  Mr. Watt knows that it is an issue for some trade unions, as it is for that category of workers.  We had a debate on FEMPI recently and some of those workers were in the Public Gallery.</p><p>It is an issue for them.  It was an issue, unfortunately, for the different Departments that underpinned a lot of the threatened industrial action, and potentially still further industrial action.  Yet, it was not dealt with.  I find it incredible that it was not dealt with even as an equality issue.  I would have thought the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform would have wanted to deal with that first, notwithstanding all the other balancing acts that Mr. Watt says must be done.  I find it-----</p></speech>

There are no issues as such that have come up.  The concern in the past has always been that when there was one Minister for spending and one for revenue that there would not be the same level of integration or coherence because the budget needs to be considered in the round.  Having one Minister responsible for both sides of it should help in that respect.  Things are moving along.  We are busy with the Minister in the preparations for the budget and we are all engaged in that.  There is no immediate issue that is problematic for us.

The two Ministers at the time, Deputies Howlin and Noonan, are both of the view that it helped in managing all the different dimensions of the crisis, including the troika.  One of the dimensions of the job that has changed over the years relates to Eurogroup and ECOFIN, whereby the Minister would have to be away for two or three days per month at those meetings.  This is an extra element that was probably not as demanding in the past, given the nature of monetary union and our obligations in that regard.</p></speech>

On the other hand we are not going to push ahead with projects just to spend the money if we are not happy about being in a position to deliver in terms of the objectives.  It is always a balancing act.</p></speech>

The pension scheme we have now is pay-as-you-go.  The liabilities we have every year are met from the general Exchequer.  We have not pre-funded the pensions and we do not pre-fund them.

The single pension scheme has reduced the pension benefits for people who came in after 2013.  They are also making the contribution to the pension.  This will help in the future sustainability of pensions.  With regard to the agreement that is now subject to balloting, the pension related deduction, which was seen as emergency measures during the crisis, this year yielded &euro;740 million.  Some &euro;550 million will turn into a permanent contribution that people are making to their pensions - some 70% of the public service are now making a greater contribution - if that agreement is put in to force.</p> <p>  The steps we are taking to ensure the sustainability into the future involve changes to the pension benefits and also the higher contribution, especially those who came in before 2013 and who benefit from the higher pensions.  We believe that measures have been taken.  The Comptroller and Auditor General commented on one of our reports that looked at the actuarial liability of pensions.  In 2007 public service pensions were estimated at around &euro;115 billion.  In the most recent analysis this figure was down to between &euro;85 billion and &euro;90 billion.  The changes we have made have had a big impact upon the costs of the future liability of pensions, as expressed in today's terms.  We are not complacent or sanguine about it, but we are in a better position than we were previously.</p></speech>

We must do something about it in the near future or we are going to have a big problem down the line.  Deputy Cullinane spoke of the special EU programmes body, SEUPB, and its PEACE III project.

It was set up to manage the INTERREG North-South programme and the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation funds.  It is a body which, on behalf of the authorities on both sides of the Border, manages the programme.  There are many cross-Border projects and projects along the Border.  The body sets out, with agreement of the Ministers, a broad strategy and then manages the drawdown of the funds.  It invites applications from a variety of different community and other groups to access the funding, it assesses applications, it manages the payments and ensures that the recipients of grants actually deliver on what they said they would.  SEUPB manages the expenditure on these programmes.  Its work, as I mentioned, is accountable to both Ministers.</p></speech>

This is an issue that has now been given more visibility because we have established the shared services of PeoplePoint.  In the past, overpayments took place across Departments but we did not have the same visibility that we have of them now.  Now that we have moved transactional HR and, increasingly, payroll to the shared centres, we have more visibility of this issue.  That is the first point.  The second point is that we changed the entitlements of sick leave.  Previously, public servants would get six months' full pay and then six months' half pay.  That has been reduced now to three months and three months.  There are more and more people who are pushing up against the threshold when they do not have full pay.  As people are paid in advance rather than in arrears in the public service, if we are not notified in a timely fashion that someone has-----</p></speech>

In effect, normally one would get paid on a Friday for the work one has done.  In the public service, people tend to get paid in advance.

The pay run closes on, let us say, a Tuesday for the following week's payment.  That is to allow for the process in which a bank file has to be run to distribute the payments.  The issue is in capturing any change that would be pay-impacted as a result of absence.  That can be sick absence or annual leave.  It is about the window of opportunity available.</p> <p>  There are a number of different causes of overpayments.  Some of them relate to delay.  We have moved to a self-service system, so it is now reliant on employee input or manager input to keep the system updated.  That then informs changes that have to be made in the payroll processing.  We have put in a lot of effort in recent years in terms of the communication and training processes for employees and managers to input correctly in a timely manner to minimise overpayments.</p> <p>  In response to the Deputy's inquiry-----</p></speech>

There have been some changes this year that will assist us in getting the recoupment process up and running and having the money paid back more quickly.  Auto-recoupment means that if there is a recoupment for less than five days, there is now an automatic process.  We do not need to go through stages of the agreement process on the value of the overpayment or to set a plan for recoupment.  There has also been a change in respect of the value of the overpayment.  It had been calculated with either a gross or a net value.  That has been changed in this year's legislation to a net value only.  That speeds up the calculation of the overpayment.</p></speech>

It was litigation that arose originally in the Office of Public Works when the national procurement service resided within that body.  The staff members transferred to the Office of Government Procurement in 2014.  The case and case management system also travelled to the new office.

It is too late in the evening and I have already run through all of these matters.  I ask him to note that I have a difficulty with his use of language.  I have a difficulty when officials use difficult language as opposed to what I or ordinary people understand.  When economic language is so different from the norm it becomes a crisis for democracy.  Rather it serves a particular purpose but that is a debate for another day.</p> <p>  As for specific questions on the Department's documents, I have an outstanding question on the allegation of fraud and the money.

It has a work programme and remit.  It undertook an investigation or forensic audit and discovered that there was an issue.  Perhaps the money was intended for a particular purpose but was not spent on that purpose.  I am only speculating here.  Let us say there is a project to support a particular community group or activity and then it transpired, with audit, that the spending was undertaken for a different purpose.  In effect, the SEUPB has a responsibility to us then.  We are the body to which it is accountable.</p></speech>

I welcome the initiative.  I believe it is very necessary to empower citizens but we disempower them by using language that they cannot understand.

The Secretary General should clarify and elaborate on that point.</p></speech>

The card is the physical manifestation of the process.  It is most important that we have identification that we know.

I am reading from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  In December 2009 the Department of Social Protection entered into a contract with a supplier at a fixed price of &euro;19.7 million.  I am not going to catch Mr. Watt out on little figures, but I am giving a timeline and examples of the large costs involved.  In 2009 the contract was entered into at a fixed price of &euro;19.7 million, plus 21% tax.  What was the contract for?  It was to produce 3 million cards by 2013.  Mr. Watt's Department and the Department of Social Protection were to work together, ag obair as l&aacute;mh a ch&eacute;ile.  That was the target.  Was it reached?  The answer is no.  Have we even reached that target?  The answer is no.  By June 2016 there were 2.6 million cards.  According to the report, the figure is now &euro;60 million.  Mr. Watt might update me, but the current position is that the Department has entered into a contract with a provider.  If it does not succeed in providing a certain number of card, the Department will still pay.  Mr. Watt is nodding.  Will he clarify the nature of the contract?</p></speech>

We can provide the Deputy with details of where it is.  We fully support this initiative which absolutely has been slower than we would have hoped.  The Deputy has indicated the numbers.  There are costs, but we must look at them versus the benefits.  We carried out surveys recently in which we asked people about their experience in interaction with the Civil Service.

It indicated the benefits from the perspective of the Department of Social Protection.  I am asking Mr. Watt about the matter in his very senior capacity.  He has described the process as exemplary, but he has not referred to a single problem that arose.  He does not refer to the cost involved, but he does tell us the card is the way forward.  I am telling him that so far &euro;60 million has been spent and that the 2016 contract provides for an advance payment to be made by the Department of Social Protection in January 2017 of 50% of the outstanding balance.  We will be paying in advance.  The cost of cards produced in 2017 is to be deducted in full from the advance payment.  Should the target of 3 million cards not be reached by the end of 2017, the cost of cards not produced will become payable in full.  It is late, but I cannot accept Mr. Watt telling us that the process is exemplary.  I ask him to look at that comment.  He could not possibly call it exemplary.  There is, however, a bigger issue.  This started as a social welfare card, but it has changed, at huge cost to the taxpayer and with no business case being made in advance.  It has metamorphosed into an identity card without any open discussion being held. but that is not Mr. Watt's fault.  Every person in the country must have it to access a passport.  Have I lost Mr. Watt somewhere?</p></speech>

I see it now.  We have been criticised repeatedly in that when it comes to the provision of digital services, we are not doing as well as we should.  The reason is we do not have a digital identity for every citizen in the country.  That is what the process is about.  The <i>mygovid.ie</i>gateway will be transformative.  I hope that in the future we can have a discussion with the Deputy about the benefits in comparison with the costs.</p></speech>

If I were to have a general discussion, it would be in the context of calling this a thriving economy, but that is a matter for another day.</p></speech>

What has the Department learned?  Why did it cost this much?  Why was there no business case made?  Why has the process been ongoing since 2004?  I am subject to correction, but it certainly has been ongoing since 2007 or 2009 and we are now in 2017.  Why has it still not been rolled out and why has it cost us a fortune?  Those were my questions and I have the answers.</p></speech>

We are almost done.  </p> <p>  I get the point on the public services card.  As I have not yet had to apply for one, everyone has not had to apply.  It started with the Department of Social Protection as a card that was needed or else a person would not receive anything.  It has since moved on and is now required to be issued with a passport or have one renewed.  It is a system that will eventually catch most adults.  If a person does not depend on receiving something from the State, separate from a passport, for now he or she can get by without it, but the need to have a passport will be the hook from which people will not be able to escape.  If a person does not want to have a passport or claim a pension or social welfare payment, he or she will able to survive without it.  That is how I see it.  </p> <p>  With regard to Deputy Catherine Connolly's questions, there are benefits to the card, but our job in this committee is to inquire about costs, the contract and lessons to be learned.  There are benefits, but we have to look at something else.  Mr. Watts knows this.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions about the Department's information and communications technology, ICT, strategy in general.  Will Mr. Watt give us the list of services that may be migrated to a digital platform?  We have just been talking about being able to tax a car while sitting at the kitchen table or applying for a passport or a driver's licence, with the ability to take a picture on one's phone.  What are the main services still being considered?</p></speech>

It is important that Mr. Watt listens to what I say next.   The Department now has to do the same for protected disclosures.  I have yet to meet a single body that knows how to deal with a protected disclosure.  Members of this committee are being inundated and I have yet to see a public body that has dealt satisfactorily with protected disclosure.  It is no good Mr. Watt saying that the Department has sent the circulars.  The Department needs to do what it did with FOI.  That is why I teased out that question.</p> <p>  We deal with third level institutions and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and almost every week people tell us about protected disclosures because people are utterly dissatisfied.  There are commissions of investigation into Sergeant McCabe's protected disclosure, and a social worker in the south east had to make a protected disclosure about Grace, who was placed in foster care by the HSE.  The system could not cope with that protected disclosure.  There have been others in the Irish Prison Service and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p>  For the third time I say I have to yet see a State body handling a protected disclosure adequately.  I note we probably only see the ones that did not work out.  There is ineptitude.  I have seen protected disclosures go to mediation, retired judges doing the adjudication and the public body three months later goes into the Labour Relations Commission and disowns the mediation report.  That was a case in the Irish Prison Service.  Mr. Watt might have been aware of that.  We are utterly at a loss and frustrated at the lack of ability in the public service to deal with these.  Whoever did the FOI training needs to bring that thinking to the protected disclosure and must move to that next. </p></speech>

We are providing overview training and more advanced training but I take the point.  Our Department has produced policy guidelines on how to deal with a protected disclosure and we have a process there which we go through.  All public bodies now have to have that same guide.  I might share that with the committee.  It is a question of people understanding, training and culture.  The culture needs to change.</p></speech>

If there was a case for FEMPI then there is a case for housing emergency legislation in the public interest.  That is not Mr. Watt's Department but he could take that on board because it is a recurring theme here.</p> <p>  We feel that while mistakes were made getting into the financial crisis, one of the biggest mistakes made during the crisis was not to plan for the exit from it.  We are talking now about planning, zoning, sites and speeding up the planning process.  That should have been done three years ago at very little cost so that the houses we need now would have been built rather than in the next two or three years.  The housing plan is going out.  The troika left in 2013 and while another country would have planned for the recovery, we made no plans.  We waited till we got to where we are and sat back for two years.  We are two years behind catching up in the housing situation.  I am not saying this is the fault of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform but collectively, the Government and the Oireachtas did not plan adequately and we are playing massive catch up and it is getting harder and harder to catch up.</p> <p>  As there are no more questions I thank everybody for coming here today.  I apologise again for the late start.  One of the reasons for it was that we wanted to conclude all our business on the Votes in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report before the D&aacute;il recess and we had other reports on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and third level education, not to mention Project Eagle, which took up quite a lot of our work a few months earlier. </p> <p>  The committee agrees to dispose of Votes 7, Chapters 1, 2 and 18, the finance Votes, which it discussed this morning.  It also agrees to dispose of Votes 11, 12, 18 and 39 and Chapter 3 for this Department, which we have discussed.</p></speech>

A comprehensive strategy against organ transplant abuse in China has two prongs: efforts to combat the abuse directly in China and to combat complicity abroad in the abuse in China.  I have ten recommendations addressed to each prong.</p> <p>  In terms of efforts to combat abuse in China the foreign policy of Ireland should incorporate these features: organ transplant abuse in China should be condemned; the Irish Government should conduct an investigation into organ transplant abuse in China and international instances should be asked to conduct such an investigation, which request should be made to the Council of Europe, the European Union, the United Nations Human Rights Council and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, with China being asked to provide historical and present death penalty statistics; China should be asked to make publicly accessible its aggregate data from its four transplant registries for heart, liver, lung and kidney; China should be asked to allow independent outside investigators access to hospital patient and organ donor files; China should be asked to allow independent outside investigators access to hospital financial records and in particular, the amounts received from patients for organ transplants and the amounts spent on all pharmaceuticals related to transplantation; China should be asked to allow independent outside investigators to make unannounced visits to transplant hospitals and organ donation centres; China should be asked to allow access to its prisons by the International Committee of the Red Cross; China should be asked to stop the persecution of prisoners of conscience, including specifically Falun Gong, Tibetans, Uighurs and House Christians; and China should be asked to disqualify from the transplant profession any person involved in the persecution of Falun Gong or other prisoners of conscience.</p><p> The second prong is governmental policy and parliamentary legislation to avoid complicity in transplant abuse in China.  Legislation combatting complicity in foreign organ transplant abuse should incorporate the following ten features.  Extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction should be enacted to allow prosecution for participation in organ transplant abuse.  The law should allow the courts to assume jurisdiction over any accused within the territory irrespective of the status of the accused in the territory, whether the accused is a citizen, permanent resident or visitor.  A Council of Europe treaty currently commits state parties to enact extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction for nationals but it does not go beyond that to permanent residents or visitors.</p><p> Legislation should ban brokerage, advertising, soliciting, trafficking and trading in organ transplantation.  Reporting of transplant tourism by health professionals to the health system should be compulsory.  Aggregate data accumulated from the reporting of transplant tourism should be publicly accessible.  Entry bans should be imposed on those who have been complicit in organ transplant abuse.  The ban should encompass visitors, students and workers, as well as immigrants.</p><p> The Government should be mandated to maintain a list of those banned entry because of their participation in organ transplant abuse.  An exception needs to be made to state immunity legislation to allow those acting in an official capacity to be sued civilly for organ transplant abuse.  Both public and private health insurance systems should be prohibited from providing coverage for transplant tourism.  This form of health service should be uninsurable.  Professionals should be subject to disqualification, losing their professional licences for complicity in transplant tourism.  Pharmaceutical companies should be prohibited from engaging in anti-rejection drug trials in China.</p><p> Those are my recommendations.  I and other researchers have come to the conclusion we did that organ transplant abuse against prisoners of conscience, primarily Falun Gong, is happening and that no precautions were put in place to prevent it from happening.  Regrettably, that is still largely so.  I submit that Ireland needs to put those precautions in place. </p></speech>

I am rooting for Ireland to get the contract on the Rugby World Cup.<br/><br/>Four years ago, I gave testimony to the committee on how the forced organ harvesting of prisoners of conscience evolved from a handful of Uighur political prisoners being exploited for party cadres into a medical procedure employed in every province of China.  Back then - it is wonderful to see familiar faces - I also gave the committee casualty estimates, including 65,000 dead Falun Gong, several thousand Uighurs, Tibetans and house Christians.  In the passion of that moment the committee released a spontaneous statement condemning China for this procedure.  Just outside these doors, people hugged and cried that day.  <br/><br/>However, my testimony contained an error.  My casualty estimates and those of my colleagues David Matas and David Kilgour were too conservative.  In 2013, we spoke of tens of thousands murdered by the Chinese state.  Today, we count the deaths in the hundreds of thousands.  In 2013, we accepted Beijing&rsquo;s claim of 10,000 organ transplants per year.  Today, we know that is a lie; our 700-page update published last year presented explicit evidence that annual Chinese transplant volume is 60,000 to 100,000 per year.<br/><br/>In Washington DC, three Chinese researchers from the Congressional-Executive Commission on China act as sentries, warding off false information from reaching the US Congress.  After examining our report for six weeks, the researchers delivered the verdict that Congress should hold a hearing.  On the eve of that hearing, the House of Representatives passed a detailed and explicit resolution condemning China&rsquo;s practice of harvesting prisoners of conscience.  Two weeks later the European Parliament passed an identical resolution.  Over the past year, every major Western newspaper has broken their silence on this issue.  <i>The</i><i>New York Times</i>has had seven articles and counting.  Given this global momentum, why am I in Ireland today?  The answer is that history is not changed by resolutions, but by actions. <br/><br/>Back in 2008, one man, a heart surgeon and son of a Holocaust survivor, challenged the Israeli Parliament to ban Israeli citizens from going to China for organ transplants and that parliament did so.  Spain followed.  In 2015 Taiwan did so.  In 2016 Italy did so.  One might ask what these countries have in common.  Integrity is one aspect, as is a highly developed sense of tragedy and the historical wisdom to know that the big players - the US, UK and so forth - may not interfere with an ongoing crime against humanity.  We cannot leave it up to them.  None of these states paid any measurable price in terms of contracts with China or even in their relationships with China.  I would be happy to answer questions on that.<br/><br/>This is an ongoing slaughter.  In two high-profile conferences, including at the Vatican itself, Beijing pushed the line that Chinese harvesting of prisoner organs is pretty much over and done with.  Neither attempt persuaded the conference, the press or, at the Vatican conference, the Pope, because he did not address the conference as he was scheduled to do.<br/><br/>David Matas, David Kilgour and I see no reform.  Instead, we see an $8 billion to $9 billion Chinese transplant industry engaged in business as usual.  We see a British architectural firm, TFP Ryder Healthcare, intending to build an organ-harvesting centre in Dalian, one of the most notorious organ harvesting locations in China.  It is also the origins of the body show that is currently in Dublin.  Human Rights Watch sees a comprehensive Chinese attempt to gather the DNA of the entire Uighur population of Xinjiang.  Those DNA samples can then be used for tissue matching the organs of 15 million highly vulnerable people.  We can no longer rule out the unthinkable.  My name is Gutmann, so I do not take comparisons to the Holocaust lightly, but the phrase &ldquo;Final Solution&rdquo; persistently enters my mind and I suspect that phrase also occurred to many of the committee members just now. <br/><br/>What does this mean for Ireland?  It means that if it is going to act, this is the critical moment to do so.  I ask the committee members to seriously consider introducing some sort of ban regarding organ tourism to China or anywhere else we suspect illegal organ transplants are taking place.  I look forward to a frank discussion and any questions or concerns on members' minds.</p></speech>

This is the most frequently asked question for me.  To understand how, one must think like a Chinese.  Born to the Chinese society, born straight into the washing machine and having one's brain washed from the very beginning, one then became a fully programmed member of the society, ready to fulfil the task ahead without asking why.  This is the society created by George Orwell in his novel <i>1984</i>, but in the real world.<br/><br/>Rumour of organ thieves can be traced back to 1990.  I was then a young, energetic physician, an oncologist surgeon with a bright future in the society, working in the central railway hospital of &Uuml;r&uuml;mqi.  During my time in our outpatient department, I saw at least three children with a scar on their bodies, indicating an organ had been stolen. <br/><br/>In 1995, it came to my turn to do it.  It was a Wednesday, my two chief surgeons called me into their office and told me to assemble a team with the capability of the largest possible surgery and report to them on the morning of the next day.  At 9.30 a.m. next day, we met at the hospital gate and headed towards the western mountain execution ground, where I was told to wait for them until hearing the gunshots.</p><p>After the gunshots were heard, we rushed in.  An armed officer directed us to the far-right corner, where I could see a male in civilian clothes lying on the ground with a single bullet wound to his right chest.  My chief surgeons ordered me to extract the liver and two kidneys.  The man was alive and tried to resist my scalpel cut but was too weak to avoid my action.  There was bleeding.  He was still alive but I did not feel guilty.  In fact, I did not feel anything but like a fully programmed robot doing its task.  I believed I was carrying out my duty to eliminate the enemy of the state.  After the operation, the chief surgeons took organs to strange-looking boxes and told me to take my team back to the hospital and remember nothing happened.  I followed the order.  We never talked about it.</p><p> It is not acceptable that a normal buy-one-get-one-free shopping pattern can be seen in organ transplantation.  A predetermined date for one's heart transplantation means that someone has been made dead for one.  Giving away organs to promote business means there are plenty of organs.  An unlimited supply of organs can be achieved only if those organs are carried in living bodies and are waiting to be taken on demand.</p><p> News broke last June that the Chinese Communist Party, CCP, is giving Uighur people in Xinjiang a free national health check-up.  With no explanation, we suspect that the CCP is building the national database for organ trade.  It is also widely reported that the CCP is carrying out DNA tests in the region with the stated objective of improving the quality of life for the Uighurs.  I believe this is a lie.</p></speech>

I am a transplant surgeon in Belfast.  Organ transplantation saves many lives but there is a big problem with inequality of access to organs in addition to a lack of organs.  That is a problem in both the developed and developing world.  Kidney, liver, lung, pancreas and heart transplants were once experimental treatments but they are now very much mainstream in medical practice.  There is a movement to incorporate tissue donations, such as face and arm transplants.  In spite of successful moves to increase organ donation rates, waiting lists for organs in Ireland and throughout the world continue to grow.</p> <p>  In Ireland last year, 280 transplants were carried out.  There are currently approximately 650 people on the waiting list.  The committee will hear more about that from Dr. O'Seaghdha shortly.  People die waiting for organs.  Quality of life while waiting is often very poor because of the severe symptoms of end-stage organ failure, including renal, heart and liver failure.  These difficult circumstances place enormous strain on families and patients and can give rise to relationship breakups, job loss and many other problems.</p> <p>  The waiting time for organs varies from country to country.  Depending on the organ, it is typically between one to five years.  Between 5% and 20% of patients die waiting for organs.  This very poor outlook and the very poor quality of life drive many people waiting for organs to seek them from sources other than the deceased donor waiting list.  For kidneys, live donation from a family member or friend is a possibility but this fails to meet excess demand for organs.  Some people have sought to obtain transplants through organ trafficking or transplant tourism.  Unscrupulous medical teams and middlemen brokers exploit vulnerable donors and recipients for selfish profit.</p> <p>  China has been a major hub for transplant tourism for several years.  Other hotbeds for this criminal practice include Pakistan, Egypt and India.  At present, with the considerable amount of people trafficking through Libya, vulnerable individuals are exploited and sent to Egypt in order to pay for passage across to Europe on boats.  China is unique among all these countries in executing prisoners for the sale of organs.  Members of several ethnic and faith groups have been imprisoned for their beliefs and callously executed for their use of organs in transplant operations.  This arguably constitutes a crime against humanity and must be condemned in the strongest terms.  China sent two surgeons to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences' Summit on Organ Trafficking and Transplant Tourism in February 2017, which I attended.  They openly admitted to the unethical execution of prisoners for organs.  They described efforts in China to reduce the number of these executions but highlighted the difficulties in policing the laws in such a massive country.</p> <p>  Ireland must take a very critical stance during diplomacy with China in light of its horrific human rights abuses.  Transplant tourism must be considered a crime, with prosecution of all involved parties.  Global attention needs to be drawn to this issue.</p></speech>

I am the medical director of the National Kidney Transplant Service in Ireland.  My clinical specialty is transplant nephrologist, which is a medical consultant with expertise in kidney transplantation.  All kidney transplantation in the Republic of Ireland is performed by the National Kidney Transplant Service, based in Beaumont Hospital, where I work.  Last year, 172 kidney transplants were performed in the Republic of Ireland, comprising 50 living donor kidney transplants and 122 deceased donor transplants.  As of the beginning of last month, there were 439 people on the kidney transplant waiting list in the Republic of Ireland, with a further 18 on the kidney-pancreas or heart-kidney waiting lists and an additional 87 people temporarily suspended from the waiting list for clinical or personal reasons.  In total, there are 544 on the waiting list.</p> <p>  Due to welcome improvements in road safety and neurosurgical care, the rate of deceased organ donation has been steadily decreasing.  The average waiting time for a deceased donor kidney transplant is currently 35 months.  This datum is very skewed, however.  Some patients on the list have been waiting over ten years, with little prospect of receiving suitable kidneys.  The median waiting time, or the time by which half of the people on the waiting list have a transplant, is currently 19 months, which again underscores the skewed nature of the data.</p> <p>  While we have no official data on transplant tourism from Ireland, I can confirm there have been cases where patients resident in Ireland underwent kidney transplantations foreign countries and returned to Ireland for their post-transplant care.  For the most part, these were patients born outside Ireland who travelled to their region of ethnicity for transplants and returned to Ireland for care afterwards.  We are aware, however, of at least one case of an Irish citizen having engaged in transplant tourism also.</p> <p>  I wish to add my voice to those condemning the practice of transplant tourism globally and, in particular, I call for an end to the obscene practice of live organ harvesting in China.</p></speech>

On behalf of the Falun Dafa Association of Ireland and all Falun Gong practitioners in Ireland, I acknowledge the help, kindness and compassion of the Irish people and Government over the past 18 years during the inexplicable and barbaric persecution of almost 100 million people in China.  We have outside this room today over 50,000 petition signatures, collected mainly last year but also in previous years on the streets of Dublin and of various other cities and towns throughout Ireland.  They are collected by my fellow practitioners, some of whom are sitting here and others of whom sit outside the gate in all weather, including heavy rain, cold, storms and baking sun.  This petition came from selfless people who made a stand during this very dark hour for humanity.  We dearly request - I was told this is not possible - that the signatures be handed to the Government.  We presented the Government with many other signatures in previous years.</p><p>The petition demonstrates the peaceful appeal made by Falun Gong practitioners in Ireland and elsewhere.</p><p> One of two most commonly asked questions when we meet people is what is Falun Gong.  Falun Gong is an ancient Chinese spiritual discipline that teaches people to follow the principles of truth, compassion and forbearance.  We do five gentle exercises to make people fit and healthy.  However, under the dictatorship of the communist party, large groups are not allowed to adhere to any ideology other than communism.  For this reason, Falun Gong was banned in China on 20 July 1999 and nobody is allowed to practise it.  The government estimated that between 70 million and 100 million people were practising Falun Gong by 1999.  Many practitioners have been locked up in labour camps, prisons and brainwashing classes.  These provide a possible source of organs, an issue about which the other respected guests spoke.</p><p> Besides organ harvesting, other forms of persecution and torture are also practised.  Some members may be familiar with the case of Mr. Zhao Ming, a gentleman in the Gallery, on whose behalf we had a major campaign seeking his freedom.  Mr. Ming was locked up in a labour camp for almost two years when he visited China on holiday and during that time, he was subject to various means of torture, which included sleep deprivation and the use of electric batons.  He is only one of more than 1 million people who have been persecuted and he is lucky to be sitting in the Gallery today.  We were able to secure his return because he was studying in Trinity College and had a connection to Ireland.  Many other vulnerable, innocent Chinese people who are engaged in harmless practice have no way to have their voices heard.  I refer in particular to those whose organs have been harvested. </p><p> I thank the committee and hope it will be able to do something.  Ireland has helped a great deal already by securing the return of Mr. Ming and another student who is not present today.  The joint committee has also held a number of hearings at which Falun Gong representatives have made presentations.  We are very thankful for all the help we have received.</p></speech>

They have outlined circumstances which would trouble anyone with a shred of decency or concern for human rights.  It is horrific to consider the number of people involved.  I recall that Mr. Gutmann made a presentation to the committee some years ago.  He indicated this morning that he underestimated the numbers of victims of this particular practice at that time.</p><p>Mr. Bughda used the phrase &quot;buy one get one free&quot;.  In civilised society, we never thought such a phrase would be applicable to human organs.  It is frightening that this practice is taking place.Trafficking of human organs is truly reprehensible and utterly demeaning of human life.  It is a deplorable activity, which has developed into a global problem that violates human rights and the dignity of individuals.</p><p>We are Members of a Parliament that represents a small population.  However, as I am sure will be reflected in members' contributions, we have an attachment to human rights and the dignity of the individual.  The witnesses have engaged regularly with the joint committee, both at formal and private meetings, and all members are concerned about the activities they describe. </p><p>International co-operation is needed on this matter.  Ireland signed the Council of Europe Convention against Trafficking in Human Organs in 2015.  A legislative process is needed to implement the convention and the Department of Health must introduce certain legislative measures.  While I am not <i>au fait </i>with the status of these legislative measures, we can engage with the Department and Minister to ensure there are no unforeseen delays in introducing these measures.</p><p>The presence of Dr. McDaid and Dr. O'Seaghda brings a national perspective to this issue.  Through our work as public representatives, all members are well aware of the excellence of the services provided in the hospitals in which the two doctors work and the many patients throughout the island who are thankful for the work done by their teams and colleagues.  Their presence reinforces the importance of this issue.  Dr. O'Seaghda indicated he was aware of one person on this island who was involved in organ harvesting.</p></speech>

While it is very hard to get clear information on this, in circumstances where somebody travels overseas and returns within a short timeframe having had a kidney transplant, we can surmise, given the logistics involved in arranging an organ transplant here, that this could only have occurred by means of transplant tourism.</p></speech>

A colleague of mine who worked in Manchester until recently has indicated he encounters two or three patients every year who have returned from overseas having had a transplant.  It is important to point out that these patients often return in very poor health.  They experience high rates of transmissible infection, including hepatitis and tuberculosis, and outcomes are poor.  One of the drivers of that activity is the difference in cultural make-up between, for example, Manchester and Ireland.  For this reason, the problem is not as great here as elsewhere.  However, we need to look forward because as society becomes more diverse, this is likely to become a growing problem here too.</p></speech>

However, the health system knows about the individuals in question because those who benefit from transplant tourism need anti-rejection drugs on their return.  The information is available and if a compulsory reporting system were in place, it would be possible to arrive at aggregates without in any way violating doctor-patient confidentiality.  We get caught in a vicious circle in which people do not know the extent of the problem and, as a result, not much is done about it.  If a compulsory reporting system were in place, we would find out the extent of the problem.</p></speech>

China is the number one destination for liver transplants.  The country is ahead of the rest of the world by far in terms of heart transplants, lung transplants and so forth.  In fact, I am missing a spleen and China is the only country where it is possible to have a spleen transplant.</p></speech>

Sadly, the message from their contributions is that there is a lack of regard for the lives of certain people and that we do not value all life equally.  Reference was made to some progress being made and motions that have been passed.  Clearly, this will not be enough and action is needed.  Apart from having motions passed, what other progress can be made in this area?</p> <p>  Mr. Matas referred to advertising.  How is that done?</p><p>If I were in need of an organ transplant and wanted to go somewhere to get it, where would that be advertised?  Obviously, it is an underground activity.  Can we make headway in tackling organ harvesting by addressing the advertising aspect?</p><p> If transplant tourism is to be considered a crime, it must be recognised internationally.  International organisations must work together and take that on board.</p><p> Regarding the conference that Dr. McDaid attended where Chinese surgeons admitted to doing this, what was the reaction?  Should international medical organisations play a stronger role?  Doctors take an oath, but what has been done undermines that oath.  How did the doctors at the conference feel when these matters were raised with them?</p><p> According to the note that we received, China asserts that it has embarked on reforms.  Is there any sign of that happening?</p></speech>

We have heard testimony on this matter previously.  When I first heard of it, I was shocked and did not believe that any human being would do this to another.  Maybe I was a bit naive about whether a country would do this to its citizens.  Even the associated language appals me - "organ tourism".  I know of people who travel abroad to get dental treatment or have operations, such as facelifts, done.  That is common, but we are discussing someone travelling abroad for a transplant not knowing, or maybe not wanting to know, from where the organ came.</p> <p>  I know people who have donated kidneys, for example.  A colleague - a councillor out my way - donated a kidney to a friend of his this year.  A close friend of mine died while awaiting an organ transplant.  I know of families' desperation for their loved ones, for example, children.  However, the idea that someone would use organs in these circumstances is appalling.</p> <p>  I was not aware of the Egyptian connection with the refugees.  Could the witnesses expand on that point?  Some of us are involved in international organisations, so I would like to raise the matter there.</p> <p>  Mention was made of a possible case and the necessary treatment.  Is there an onus on the medical profession to report that to anyone?  What would be the ideal approach?</p> <p>  The Houses are collectively appalled by the situation, so if legislation was introduced, Members from all parties and none would support it.  The concern is that drafting the legislation might be delayed, but I accept that the matter is probably complex.</p> <p>  Mention was made of banning citizens from travelling to, for example, China for organ transplants.  How would that work?  The witnesses gave examples of other countries having done this.  People can genuinely claim to be travelling on a tourist visa, but an onus arises when they return seeking treatment.  How would that work physically?  How can it be inserted into law?</p> <p>  Although I asked this question previously, people at home will want to know the answer.  Is this just happening to Falun Gong practitioners in China?  I believe not, but the witnesses might explain whether it is happening to other political prisoners as well, for example, the Uyghur minority and Tibetans.</p> <p>  Does China allow the Red Cross to visit prisoners in jail?  Could the Red Cross play a role in stopping this?</p> <p>  We have a note asserting that China has embarked on reforms of organ donation and is stamping out illegal and unethical practices.  I have been told that the embassy here is in co-operation with other EU states and is supposedly monitoring these reform efforts.  What does that entail exactly?</p> <p>  The British firm TFP Ryder Healthcare intends to build an organ harvesting centre in Dalian, which was referred to as one of the most notorious areas for organ harvesting.  Can any legal action be taken in that regard?</p> <p>  I am conscious that many of those involved are travelling out of desperation and want themselves or loved ones to stay alive, but what can we do to close off that option?  The moral argument is probably lost on them.  If people break a legislative embargo, should they be sent to jail or fined?  What is the ultimate sanction?</p> <p>  I am sickened to my stomach by the idea of organ harvesting.  I presume that is why some of our members are missing.  There is a sense of disbelief.  The idea that anyone would do this to another individual is immoral and all of those words.  The language around it is appalling.</p> <p>  In light of today's intervention by the witnesses, I hope that we can push this legislation forward.  There is genuine political will among us all to tackle and eliminate this practice.  If we can push those countries that are involved in these unethical practices in a certain direction, give us examples of how.</p></speech>

I was attending another briefing.  The disadvantage of speaking third is that the questions one wanted to ask have already been asked.  The witnesses are welcome.  I am just as horrified by this situation now as I was when I read of it previously.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Sullivan asked a question about something that had struck me immediately.  How are these trips to China being organised for people?  Obviously, someone cannot go to a travel agent to book flights and accommodation for this.  Where do people get the information that they need to book all of this?</p> <p>  We have been told that reforms are taking place in China, but what kind of reform is it and is there any evidence of it?  What can we do as a country?  I presume that we can run a campaign educating people who are travelling to China for transplants on where these organs might be coming from and how they were taken from others.  A friend of mine had a kidney transplant and I know how desperate he was to have it done, so I can understand people's desperation.  If they were educated on where the organs were coming from, though, their eyes might be opened.</p> <p>  I am fascinated by the organisation of a trip to China for this purpose.  How does one do that?  There must be a way of stopping it.</p></speech>

There is much misinformation on this globally and this has been something that the Chinese state has encouraged.  There is much talk about organ brokers and the shadowy criminal network operating in this area.  There is one, and it is called the Internet.  It is that simple.  If members do not believe me, they can go onto the Internet, type "help, I need a liver" in Google and within the first 20 response they will find a website which changes constantly, but is always there, and which has a discussion board involving people who have had transplants or are looking to have one.  Very quickly, one will find advice that a person can go to Tianjin central.  That is not surprising because the Chinese were advertising Tianjin central on the web for years.  They only stopped in 2014 because it became such a major issue and it was a huge embarrassment that this advertisement was up there.</p> <p>  We estimate that Tianjin Central hospital does over 5,000 transplants each year.  This is half of what the Chinese claim they do annually, in just one hospital.  They speak English.  Everyone will say that and the message board is one of two sources that one will find this information.  It is that simple.  If one can come up with the money, they can secure the transplant in record time.  In other countries, one can find kidneys because people will sell a single kidney but it is only in China where they can come up with a liver.  It has been documented in around 25 cases that it can be done within four hours.  No one can live without a liver and there is no way to come up with a liver unless one has a living human being, or should I say, a huge stable of living human beings, where they have all been tissue matched, are ready to go and someone can come in and get that organ within several hours.  The warm ischemia time, the time when an organ is being transferred from one person to another, is estimated to be two minutes or zero in most cases of these emergency liver transplants.</p> <p>  This is more evidence of something the committee has heard from Dr. Enver Thohti Bughda, that this is done while people are alive.  There is not a huge mystery about organ tourism; it is an intentional piece of monkey dust which the Chinese have thrown up about this.  I do not doubt that one can go to Egypt and get a kidney.  I do not doubt that there are several countries in the world where one can do that but there are only two countries that harvest political and religious prisoners and they are the People's Republic of China and ISIS.  I do not recommend the hotel facilities in Syria right now.  It is true that there is a bigger problem overall, but this goes beyond it.  We are not merely looking at Falun Gong but Uyghurs, Tibetans, and House Christians.  The Uyghurs may be coming online with DNA testing, which is also tissue matching testing, but it has dual purpose.  It tells us that the Uyghur population, the Muslims of China, are suddenly under great threat when millions of them have been DNA tested.  The Chinese say it is for their health but we cannot believe that.  There may be many purposes, and we can discuss that further, but there is no question that there are still prisoners who are being harvested for their organs.</p> <p>  We do not know the exact percentages but anyone who has been close to the data in the way that myself, David Matas and David Kilgour have, has concluded that they are mainly prisoners of conscience.  They are often arrested without any due process whatever.  They cannot be charged with any capital crimes and in the case of Falun Gong they are absolutely non-violent.  Often, they are people who are not even on the books and are being put to death.  This is where this huge pool of organs is coming from.  I would like to say that this is science fiction but I was here in 2013 and I am afraid that the evidence has become exponentially worse and more explicit since  then and that is why we are starting to see the reaction.</p></speech>

That is why the numbers on the Chinese national organ registration are ridiculously low, so where are these organs coming from?  Human rights organisations are illegal in China but one can see charitable organisations for animal welfare everywhere.  It means human life is worth less than animals.  In asking how it can happen, it is comes down to the party, the CCP, which created the infrastructure and made these atrocities possible.</p></speech>

There has been, both in China and abroad.  Mr. Gutmann mentioned four countries which have enacted legislation, and that is some progress.  There are other signs of progress also.  Within China, legislation has been enacted which made promises, and gave priority to locals.  The trouble is that it has not solved the problem and it has not been comprehensive.  Before there was nothing, and now there is something, but we still have the problem.  Mr. Gutmann answered the question about advertising.  On the role of international organisations on international crime, the Council of Europe has come up with a treaty and the World Health Organisation has stated some principles.  The UN rapporteur on torture and religious intolerance has put questions to China at the UN committee against torture, and asked China to conduct an international investigation.  Generally, when one is dealing with international crime, there is a legal principle of complementarity which means that states should do it locally first.  I do not think that we should be relying entirely on international organisations to deal with this issue.  The first line of defence for international crime should be states rather than international organisations.</p> <p>  On the role of international medical organisations, the transplantation societies developed a couple of good policies, one on China and another on sourcing organs from prisoners, but the first line of defence should be a national transplantation society.  What I see with national transplantation societies is that their ethical systems are underdeveloped to deal with this issue.  They do not deal comprehensively with transplant tourism.  Those need to be developed.</p> <p>  Deputy Crowe's question about the onus is an important one.  The onus should be first on China to explain its source of organs and anyone dealing with China should be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that its source of organs is proper.  That is not now the case, rather there is much wilful blindness, which is a problem.  </p> <p>  On how a ban on travel would work, I am not in favour of putting patients in jail.  What one needs to do is get at the brokers and advertising.  This is a point that Senator McFadden made, that there has to be as much public education as possible.  A number of city councils in Ireland have passed resolutions on this which is very useful in public education.  The health Ministry could be doing more and the foreign Ministry could do more about alerting people about what happens.</p><p>Again, the profession could be alerting people more.  How many doctors tell their patients that if they go to China there is a risk that somebody will be killed for his or her organs?</p><p> On the question of whether the Red Cross visits prisoners in jail, the answer is that they are not allowed to do so.  At one time a Chinese official said they could, but when the Red Cross tried to arrange a visit it was not allowed.  In regard to legal action against a British firm, I am a lawyer so I cannot answer that question.  The problem is that legislation that would prevent something like this happening locally is not extraterritorial in effect.  What Ireland, Britain and other countries need to do is put in place legislation that allows for extraterritorial rights such that they can impact upon things that locals are doing outside of the country.</p></speech>

For instance, the Falun Gong, some of whom are seated here or can be seen on Grafton Street and so on, are normal citizens of society but in Chinese Communist Party propaganda they are vilified, demonised and labelled as enemies.  When doctors previously did the harvesting they did not feel guilty because they were only carrying out a task but nowadays they are paid large sums of money for doing so.  Following the destruction of traditional culture and several political movements, including cultural revolution, the former party leader encouraged everybody to make money.  Nowadays in Chinese people's minds there is nothing left only money.  When people can make money they will do anything and everything for that purpose.</p></speech>

I have polled all the transplant nephrologists in Beaumont Hospital.  To be clear, when this issue arises we would dissuade the patient in the strongest possible terms, based on the source of the organs but also on outcomes for the patients.</p> <p>  Deputy Crowe asked about the situation in Egypt.  I cannot speak knowledgeably about that except to say that I know of a patient of Egyptian origin who returned to Egypt to receive a kidney transplant this year.  The matter of mandatory reporting is complex.  Any legislation around that would need to take into account that there are some circumstances where patients can legitimately return to their country of origin for transplantation.  The usual story we are told is that their brother or other family member is living in Pakistan, Nigeria and so on and they have to return home to have their transplantation.  There is some complexity around this.  It is not possible as a physician to tease that out.  There are also circumstances where patients can legitimately travel to other countries.  We have an organ sharing programme and we have a paired exchange kidney programme which we are currently setting up with Belfast.  Paired exchange arises when a person wishes to donate a kidney to a spouse but cannot do so for immunological reasons and a similar pair exists such that we can swap organs.  For this to function well, we need a large pool of patients to draw from.  We have a memorandum of understanding with Belfast, which is being drafted.  In circumstances where that arises, patients will legitimately travel to receive transplants.  There are important details that need to be factored in rather than an overall issue of a patient not being permitted to travel to receive a transplant.</p></speech>

The Pope, in a statement he made a couple of years ago, said that he wanted to do his best to stamp out people trafficking and, as an aside, organ trafficking.  This is what gave rise to the summit in the Vatican.  With regard to China's role in the summit, it was steeped in controversy in that from the outset there were questions about whether the Chinese should even have been invited to the summit, against the background that China, Egypt, Pakistan and India are countries that are deeply involved in organ trafficking.  There was no controversy around inviting delegates from India and Pakistan but there was a big question about whether the Chinese should have been invited.  Earlier, Mr. Gutmann made the point that the Pope was supposed to address the summit and meet with us all but he pulled out at the last minute because of controversy over the Chinese.  He did not want to be seen to be endorsing the Chinese visit or to be photographed with them.  The Chinese presented their data.  I spoke briefly afterwards with the Deputy Health Minister, Huang Jiefu.  In their statement they admitted that they have been executing prisoners for organs in China.  They would not be drawn on prisoners of conscience, Falun Gong, and so on but they admitted to large-scale execution of prisoners.  The summit was shocked by this, understandably, and people condemned it.  It was the one time in the summit when one could palpably feel the temperature was rising.  People were arguing and questioning the Chinese delegates and they did not really believe what they were saying.  The Chinese said that they have now made it illegal and they are trying to stamp it out but that it is difficult to police with so many hospitals and so on involved.  They were met with a lot of scepticism and condemnation.</p> <p>  With regard to the Egyptian situation, there have been many reports recently about Libya being a hot bed of people trafficking.  Many refugees from Syria travel to Libya to get transport to Europe on inflatable boats, as a result of which thousands of people have died.  In addition, thousands of economic migrants from Sudan, Somalia and Nigeria are congregating in Libya, which right now is a country without a Government.  It is lawless and akin to the wild west.  The people from Syria and the economic refugees from North Africa pay enormous amounts of money to people traffickers to get passage to Europe.  When they arrive in Libya to get on the boats to cross the Mediterranean the people traffickers ask for further payment.  When the refugees point out that they already paid in Syria or Sudan for passage to Italy the traffickers tell them that they cannot get on the boats unless they pay again or, that if they donate a kidney it would pay passage for five people, the refugee and four members of his or her family.  They do not do the organ harvesting in Libya.  It is done in Egypt where there is a better developed health care system.  In Egypt their organs are harvested for local people or paying foreign people.  Interestingly, the European Union has a special prosecutor in Libya, an Irish man named Aonghus Kelly, who is working on this issue.  I told him I was coming here and he is very keen to get involved.  I can pass on his contact details to the committee if it is interested in furthering the Egyptian transplant tourism issue.  The big difference between Egypt, Pakistan and China is that in China this is veiled in secrecy but in Egypt and Pakistan the cases have been uncovered, reported in the press and people have been arrested.  Many of surgeons and physicians have been put in jail in Egypt but in China organ harvesting is veiled in secrecy, the media is suppressed and so it is difficult to know what is going on there. </p></speech>

There are medical councils in each jurisdiction.  It would be important that they would communicate the concerns of the physicians and medical professionals to their relevant health departments and governments.  The representative organisations would have ongoing contact with their relevant government department on a regular basis.  Regardless of the country it is important that medical professionals with the expertise and knowledge would make an issue of it with the relevant health authorities.</p> <p>  Mr. Matas referred to legislation not being extraterritorial.  That is correct but there is a value in the European Convention against Trafficking in Human Organs that was adopted in 2015.  The Irish Department of Health must introduce legislation to transpose those provisions into domestic law.  All member states can transpose the provisions of that convention into domestic legislation.  That is the value of the European convention.</p> <p>  What I said at the outset, and I am sure members will agree, is that we will communicate directly with the Minister for Health following this meeting, stating that we had a formal meeting with the witnesses in regard to the need to bring forward this legislation.  I am sure it would meet with the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  We will ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to raise this issue as a specific item at a meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers.  Obviously, each Minister can table an item for discussion.  We should encourage our Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney, to put this matter down for discussion and try to garner support among other member states as well.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses sincerely for their contributions.  They have exposed extremely frightening and troubling activities which are heinous crimes being committed against vulnerable people.  Let me assure them that they have our support and we will be glad to pursue other ways that we can be of assistance.</p></speech>

My name is Sam Taylor and I am the director of M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, Doctors Without Borders, in Ireland.  I am joined by Dr. Conor Kenny, who has recently returned from one of our vessels in the central Mediterranean.  M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res is an independent, medical, humanitarian organisation that delivers emergency aid to people affected by armed conflict, epidemics, natural disasters and exclusion from health care.  We offer assistance based on need, irrespective of race, religion, ideology or political affiliations and our actions are guided by medical ethics and the principles of neutrality and impartiality.  We are 96% funded by private donors and do not rely on government funds for our activities.  We opened our office in Ireland in 2006 and to date have placed more than 150 Irish staff in MSF projects all around the world, from Afghanistan to Uganda.  We go where we are needed, to where the patients are.  Unfortunately, that now includes the Mediterranean Sea.<br/><br/>MSF started its search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean in April 2015, following the decision of the European Union and Italy to discontinue Mare Nostrum, the joint large-scale search and rescue mission led by the Italian Navy.  At the time, it appeared that Europe was prepared to let many people fleeing war, poverty and oppression die at sea.  We in MSF took the difficult decision that we could not stand back and watch from the shore as thousands of men, women and children drowned while trying to reach Europe.  Death at sea continues at an alarming rate and the numbers of deaths are comparable to what M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res is used to seeing in the war zones in which we operate.<br/><br/>Our work, responding to displacement in Europe over the past two years, has led us to set up projects in the south of the continent as well as along what became known as the Balkan route.  From reception centres to refugee camps, we have established projects to respond to the health and medical needs of people on the move.  While the recent EU-Turkey deal has meant that fewer people are attempting the journey along the Balkan route, the journey has only become more dangerous for people still attempting to cross.  To date, MSF teams in the central Mediterranean have rescued or assisted over 30,000 people in distress on over 200 operations.  In 2017 alone, we have rescued and assisted more than 9,000 individuals.<br/><br/>According to data from the International Organization for Migration, IOM, the number of people who died trying to reach Europe by crossing the Mediterranean has reached an all-time high with over 5,000 reported deaths in 2016.  This year is shaping up to be another deadly year, with more than 2,170 deaths so far, according to the IOM.  However, these figures betray the reality of this crisis as the actual number of deaths is likely to be much worse.  We have no idea how many dinghies overloaded with terrified passengers set sail from Libya in the direction of Italy each day and sink without trace.  This morning, Dr. Conor Kenny, an MSF Ireland field worker who spent three months on board our vessel, the <i>MV Aquarius</i>, in the central Mediterranean, will outline his very difficult and challenging first-hand experiences of providing medical care to those rescued aboard the vessel.<br/><br/>Last week, the Italian Government signalled to the European Commission that it may move to block foreign-flagged vessels from docking in Italian ports due to the strain on their systems coping with the rescues.  Search and rescue is a desperately needed emergency response but our work at sea is just a sticking plaster on a gaping wound.  Our search and rescue operation is not the solution to this ongoing crisis, nor is it the cause, as some have claimed.  After Dr. Kenny&rsquo;s testimony, we will briefly conclude by outlining a number of our key concerns related to search and rescue operations for this committee to take into consideration, before we open the floor to any questions members may have.<br/><br/>Once again, I thank the committee for this timely opportunity and I ask Dr. Kenny to speak.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-06a.1370" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Conor Kenny" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017070600002#L00400"><p>My name is Dr. Conor Kenny and I come from County Sligo.  I have been qualified as a medical doctor for four years with interests mainly in general medicine.  From February to May 2017, I was part of the M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res medical team on board the <i>MV Aquarius</i>, located in international waters, patrolling at 25 nautical miles from the coast of Libya.  I served as the ship&rsquo;s medical doctor, alongside a small medical team comprised of one midwife and two nurses.  I will speak about my work and experience on this MSF assignment, detailing how we conduct rescues in the central Mediterranean, the medical care we provide and the recent developments and areas of concern.<br/><br/>We existed in a world of two extremes aboard the ship.  My team and I would spend days at a time diligently watching the seas and running near-daily medical drills, ensuring that we were fully prepared for the next emergency rescue.  Then, upon receiving instruction from the Italian maritime rescue co-ordination centre, MRCC, we would enter an intense 72-hour period involving rescue, provision of care and safe disembarkation.  I would repeat this process many times during my three and a half month assignment in the central Mediterranean.</p><p>Images of my experience there can be found at the end of the document distributed.  <br/><br/>Typically, as the ship&rsquo;s medic, my initial role in a rescue was that of first response.  That means that I would go with a rigid hull inflatable boat, RHIB, to the vessel in distress.  Next to the boat in distress and from the RHIB, I would survey the scene and prioritise the people we rescue first, focusing on those who are seriously unwell, as well as children and women.  Sadly, the sickest are usually the ones one cannot see, often lying on the floor of the overfilled boat.  Retrieving these people from their boat may often be complicated because they may be panicked, for example, if their boat is sinking.  This may lead to crush situations or even capsizing.  Throughout this process I was in constant contact with the rest of the team aboard the <i>MV Aquarius</i>which allowed us to prepare the necessary medical response back on boat based on their health needs.  This could include a mass casualty response or a multiple casualty response.  From the point of rescue to disembarkation, we responded to whatever medical needs arose from emergency care to outpatient consultations.  As one can imagine, demand was high and we got very little sleep over the usual 72-hour period between rescue and disembarkation.  During this time in the MSF clinic, I treated wounds, broken bones were set, and we provided psychological first aid.  Sometimes babies were born. <br/><br/>The majority of our rescued patients were suffering from hypothermia, dehydration and exhaustion when they reached us and often had been severely burned by the gasoline used to power these boats' engines.  It is important to note that when the fuel powering the engines mixes with the seawater, it turns into a highly corrosive and hazardous substance.  Many of those who ended up in my clinic had been forced to sit in this substance, often resulting in severe burns to their genitalia.  Many had also swallowed and inhaled the toxic liquid mix into their lungs during a drowning process.  One occasion that sticks in my mind is the attempt my team and I made to resuscitate an unconscious young women who had been brought on deck by staff on one of our RHIBs.  As I approached her the toxic smell of the gasoline fumes emerged from the patient as I noticed that the skin on the right side of her face had dissolved in the fuel.  Tragically, resuscitation attempts were unsuccessful and this young woman died.  On closer examination this facial burn extended the length of her thorax to the bottom of her chest.  Clearly she had been face down in the fuel lining the base of the rubber boat she was in.  This is an horrific way to drown. <br/><br/>The other types of medical conditions we were faced with in the medical clinic include respiratory tract disease, gastrointestinal tract disease and trauma.  The greater part of people on board the boat had been subject to, or had witnessed, physical, and in some cases sexual, violence while in Libya and presented with the marks and scars of those abuses.  They often spoke to us about this abuse, which they had suffered at the hands of smugglers, armed groups and private individuals in Libya when they were on the boat.  Here, many told us stories of how they were bought and sold on trade markets as a commodity, working in hellish conditions as labourers without payment.  I have heard testimony from many patients who were duped into working in Libya, seemingly offered good jobs there where they would have the opportunity to send money to their families at home.  However, in reality, Libya is not a functioning state.  With three competing governments and virtually no rule of law, many people whose final destination was to be Libya and not Europe, are rounded up by the state security forces and other armed groups and forced into detention centres and asked to work off unreasonable sums for their freedom.  Some are then forced onto boats and into the sea, while others view it as their only chance of escape from what they told us is a slavery-type situation and the violence they face if they stay in Libya.  <br/><br/>One such story that sticks with me is that of three boys we rescued in April.  Incredibly, once taken on board, two of the boys recognised a medical nurse on the ship who had treated them as small children in the Darfur region back in 2003.  Fourteen years later they told us the harrowing story of how they had ended up in the Mediterranean Sea.  Two of the boys, Samir and Abbas - which is not his real name - had at the age of 17 left the conflict in Darfur to seek out a better life working in the Libyan economy.  They told us about how they had left Darfur with many others, travelling through Sudan and into Libya.  Things began to go wrong when after a number of days on the road, their Libyan driver shot dead a fellow passenger following an argument.  Furthermore, their driver was overheard making numerous phone calls, auctioning them and their fellow travellers to prospective buyers in Libya.  After a number of hours they heard that they were to be sold for &euro;70 each based on their physical attributes such as their height and muscle mass.  After reaching Libya they were sold on to different owners many times in the coming months, enduring regular beatings and abuse at the hands of their captors.  It was when they were auctioned for the third time that they met the third boy, Ahmed.  After 50 days together and again facing severe abuse, the three boys, along with others, found an opportunity to escape from where they were being held.  However, as they made their dash to freedom a neighbour of their captor spotted the attempted escape and fired at them as they fled, hitting Ahmed in the leg.  Samir and Abbas, who had now evaded capture, reached a market in Tripoli.  Adamant that they would not leave Ahmed behind, they found a Sudanese man who helped them by raising enough money within the Sudanese community in Tripoli to buy both the freedom of Ahmed, as well as their escape into the central Mediterranean. <br/><br/>There have been worrying recent developments at sea involving unsafe behaviour of those identified as the Libyan Coast Guard.  On 23 May this year, my colleagues aboard the<i>MV Aquarius</i>reported that while we had a rescue operation under way a boat with men identifying themselves as Libyan Coast Guard approached one the boats in distress we were assisting, intimidating the passengers and firing their guns in the air.  Armed and in uniform, members of the Libyan Coast Guard then proceeded to board one of the rubber boats.  They took phones, money and other belongings from the passengers.  They attached a line to one rubber dinghy and towed it back towards Libyan waters.  The testimony of the survivors of this encounter paints a worrying picture.  According to one of the people on board one of these boats:</p><blockquote>When the Libyans pointed their weapons at us, asking us to give them all our money and cell phones and telling us to jump in the water, we did what they said and many of us jumped in.  I was not afraid.  I preferred to die at sea rather than being repressed and to die in Libya.</blockquote><p>Fortunately many had already received their life jackets from the MSF rescue team before they jumped into the sea out of fear that the Libyan Coast Guard would again fire into the air.  Our teams pulled 67 people from the water.  The behaviour of the Libyan Coast Guard was reckless, if not directly threatening to the people on the boats, and it is a miracle no one drowned or was injured.  We know that predominantly, those returned to Libya by the Libyan Coast Guard are taken to detention centres where they are held in inhumane conditions.  The fact that the Libyan Coast Guard has been in receipt of training and support to build its capacity from the European Union makes the incident all the more disturbing and casts a shadow on the training provided by the European Union.  While countries have a right to have a coast guard and to engage in their missions, we would flag this recent worrying incident that put people in great danger. <br/><br/>From my testimony as outlined this morning, it is clear to see why people are looking to flee Libya.  They need help and safety regardless of where they come from or what took them to Libya in the first place.  It appears to be a place of extreme danger with no rule of law.  We must make every effort to make it clear.  Ireland needs to know that returning people to Libya, within this context and in this way, is simply not an option.  This humanitarian crisis will continue in the central Mediterranean.  There needs to be some solution found, and NGOs and we in MSF are not it.  </p></speech>

MSF is concerned about the humanitarian consequences of some elements of European Union-funded capacity-building initiatives in Libya to which Ireland is contributing, namely, that of the Libyan Coast Guard and conditions within centres.  We suggest that a thorough assessment of the impact of such initiatives, both positive and negative, be conducted by the European Union.</p> <p>  MSF believes that European member states should be focusing on implementing a dedicated search and rescue operation in the central Mediterranean.  We caution against any significant shift that would see the priority move away from a rescue operation to predominantly that of an anti-smuggling one, including Ireland&rsquo;s naval response.  </p> <p>  Finally, MSF calls once again for the urgent establishment of adequate, safe and legal alternatives to the dangerous sea crossings in to prevent more deaths at sea. </p></speech>

Yesterday morning, I listened to the Italian ambassador on the radio.  He spoke about the difficulty facing the Italian people due to the number of refugees coming from Libya directly to Sicily and Italy.  The Italians are threatening to refuse entry to NGO charity boats to ports in Italy.  Will this include the MSF boats and what will that mean for its work?</p> <p>  Italy is rightly angry about the EU countries' lack of solidarity and so forth.  I have mentioned that at other meetings, including at yesterday's meeting of the European affairs committee when this matter arose.  The Italians are saying that some of the charity boats are acting as a pull factor and some of them are going into Libyan waters and so forth.  The witness says that MSF's boat is 25 miles off the coast.  When these boats are seen by people on the Libyan coast, do they act as a type of beacon or attraction?  How do the witnesses respond to the Italian concerns in that regard?  The Italians say that the majority of the people are not coming from areas of conflict but are economic migrants.  In some cases they are not co-operating with other EU countries with regard to moving forward.  What should Ireland be doing about those refugees?  Should we increase the number we are taking?  I believe we took three from Italy last year.  Clearly, the system is flawed and is not working.</p> <p>  Witnesses appeared before the committee earlier to discuss organ transplants.  One of the doctors from Ireland spoke about the link between stealing organs and refugees.  Have the witnesses encountered that in their work?  The doctor said there is a clear link between people from Libya going to Egypt and then being allowed on the boats.  Have the witnesses seen that?</p> <p>  I saw photographs of the so-called detention centres run by the Libyans, basically armed militias.  The witness said there are three disputed powers, but they are effectively armed militias on the ground.  Hundreds of people are crammed into overcrowded centres.  What is MSF's view of the European response of sending people back to Libya?</p> <p>  The witness mentioned the work of the Libyan coastguard.  What is its official role?  Is it its role to bring people back or to stop people leaving the coast?  Part of its role appears to be to rob people.  Members of the coastguard are on very bad pay.  Do the witnesses believe EU member states should be supporting the Libyan coast guard in any way considering its record of abuse?</p> <p>  With regard to the military response, there is talk that EU ships will move away from search and rescue missions to carrying out military missions.  What is the witness's view on that?  I recall David Cameron talking about going in to take out the traffickers, boats and so forth.  How do the witnesses think that will impact on the refugees who are vulnerable?</p> <p>  The witness referred to a legal and safe pathway.  Should that be in Libya or in some of the countries where the refugees come from?</p></speech>

The representatives of the earlier group painted a picture of people arriving after giving all their money to get on the boat and then being asked for more money, and the way they could pay this was through donating a kidney or whatever.  It is opportune, therefore, that MSF is appearing before us now.</p> <p>  I was fortunate to be able to watch the film last night.  I saw in that what the witnesses spoke about today.  The witnesses spoke about the range of injuries.  Obviously, the physical injuries are dealt with on the spot but there are also psychological effects.  There are people who were tortured, sexually violated and raped.  Is MSF able to do follow-up work?  I realise that must be difficult, but it is aware of the people who need the psychological and mental health care afterwards.  It was interesting to see the party after 72 hours and how MSF presented it.  When they had gone through the initial trauma they were able to sing and dance on the boat.  Human resilience is something else.  It appears that these migrants are just left on the boats to drift and that there is nobody in charge of the boats.  That is another extremely dangerous situation.  When the film showed the middle of the boat beginning to sink one can imagine people's terror that they were going to drown.</p> <p>  Perhaps the witnesses would outline their knowledge of the slave markets in Libya.  I raised this as a Topical Issue some time ago.  It is incredible that we are relying on Libya to deal with this when the country is in turmoil.  It does not have basic necessities for its citizens and its economy is in danger of collapse, yet we have turned to it to deal with it.</p> <p>  Another issue is that when Libya was a very rich country a number of people came to that country to work in the oilfields.  We mention them but we need to know more about them.  They are mainly from other African countries but at some point they would have had a quite decent standard of living in Libya.  They are part of the migrant issue now.</p> <p>  I have a general question about co-ordination of services.  The work of M&eacute;dicins San Fronti&egrave;res is amazing, but there are other organisations in place.  Are the organisations coming together on that and on where we go from here?  The awful question must be asked: why are people being rescued?  I have heard some of them say that they would prefer to die by drowning in the Mediterranean than deal with what some of them are going to face.</p> <p>  The Malta Declaration has great sounding principles regarding building capacity and having adequate reception centres, but there is no doubt that it is a complete failure.  To date I have counted &euro;120 million and &euro;90 million going to it and I am sure there is a great deal more, but it is not addressing the needs it should be addressing.  I believe the money could be given to MSF because it would be done in a more humane way.  We wrote to the previous Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade asking that this be raised, as he was attending that foreign affairs Council meeting in Europe.  We do not hear concerns at European level that funding is going into the abuse and torture of people and making life much worse for them.  We know the root causes of many people leaving their countries but they are ending up in a much worse situation.  The coastguards need training but I am also sure there are rogue coastguards who have no interest in training and who are using this situation for themselves.</p></speech>

I congratulate my Sligo colleague, Dr. Conor Kenny, on all the work he has been doing.  He has been involved with MSF for a number of years and has carried out many tours of duty.  Hopefully, he will be returning to it again.</p><p>I wish to put on record the work he has done over the years as a young medical doctor from County Sligo.</p><p> Reference was made to the relationship with the Italian authorities.  The authorities in Italy provide briefings on what they can and cannot do in terms of their work.  Reference was also made to the fact that the organisation does not accept Government funding.  Dr. Kenny has outlined in great detail the work in which he has been involved in recent months.  The Irish Naval Service has a boat working in close proximity with MSF.  Could he provide some details in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-06a.1378" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sam Taylor" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017070600002#O00200"><p>I will start and I will hand over to Dr. Kenny for the eyewitness information.  In response to Deputy Crowe's question about the potential closure of Italian ports, that is obviously very concerning.  We run missions of approximately 72 hours in order to get people back to disembark with them in Italy but if that time is increased it will mean more deaths at sea because we will be spending less time looking for people and picking them up.  As Deputy Crowe said, Italy has been absorbing a huge burden.  We are quite concerned about the discussion in terms of the code of conduct around NGOs.  We have not received any official notification on this matter yet but preventing NGOs from disembarking in the closest safe harbours will increase the danger.<br/><br/>In terms of the other EU countries, we believe very strongly that people should follow Ireland's lead and provide humanitarian maritime assistance, which is what this country has been doing.  It is the only EU country to do so.  We very much respect and admire that, but we are concerned that this activity is moving more towards prevention of people getting into Europe and returning them back to Libya.  The conditions in those detention centres are completely appalling.  As Dr. Kenny outlined, we are seeing victims of torture, trauma and all kinds of things.  At MSF we believe very strongly that what is needed is more search and rescue capacity, not turning people back.  As Dr. Kenny outlined as well, we have seen smugglers firing into the air and stealing from the people that are on their boats so it is an extremely challenging situation.<br/><br/>In terms of NGOs being a pull factor, they are not.  An academic study was done by Goldsmiths college two weeks ago that showed that irrespective of whether there are ships there people are going to go to sea.  In terms of responding to Deputy O'Sullivan's question about why we rescue people, if 5,000 people were dying of Ebola we would feel the need to respond.  That is an unacceptable amount of people to be dying because they want to cross a border, which is not a particularly good reason.  From a humanitarian medical perspective that is why we feel we have to put those three boats into the water there, but we are not the solution.  The solution lies with individual European states.  We do not know what the solution is.  Compared to the weight of the European Union we are a relatively small organisation.  We know that sending people back is not the correct response.  We do not differentiate between whether people are economic migrants or they are fleeing Darfur, Somalia or Eritrea.  People do not get on those boats lightly.  I have Syrian friends who have made the journey.  They know what they are getting into.  They are fully informed of the risks in Libya and on the way.  That is not something we would necessarily differentiate.<br/><br/>In terms of co-ordination of services, all the activities are co-ordinated by the Maritime Security Council, MSC, out of Rome.  We are not cowboys.  We run watches on deck where we look for people but we are told where to go, as is the Irish Naval Service and the other NGO boats.  All the rescues are co-ordinated by Rome.  Dr. Kelly can provide more details about this.  We follow the instructions.<br/><br/>In terms of the distance, on five occasions over the past three years we have entered into Libyan territorial waters up to 1 nautical mile, but that was to save lives.  We could see people drowning in front of us and we felt obliged to save them.  We were told to go there by Rome, so we went.  Just to make it very clear; there is no contact whatsoever between M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res and any smuggler.  All the activities are co-ordinated out of Rome.  We are directed in terms of what to do.<br/><br/>There is a legal obligation on any vessel to go to the aid of another vessel in distress.  That is not something we made up.  What we are doing is adding capacity.  The commercial vessels that were previously taking a lot of the slack on this, after<i>mare nostrum</i>finished, complained to the European Union, saying the volume was too high.  It is not that we are providing an ambulance service or a taxi service.  There is a legal obligation based on the laws of the sea which dictate that vessels in distress must be attended to by other vessels in the area.<br/><br/>In terms of funding, M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res stopped taking European Union funding in June, because of the EU-Turkey deal to which Ireland was a party.  We stopped taking Irish Aid money at the same time.  The boats are another illustration of that, as is sending people back to Libya.  There is a very dangerous movement now to prevent people from seeking asylum.  People have the right to seek asylum, to flee war, to flee persecution and natural disaster.  We believe that putting borders and barriers up, whether they be in Libya or on the Balkan route, is a worrying development of outsourcing European borders.  We understand that Europe has a massive problem with this but we feel that people should have the right to flee Syria and Eritrea.  We feel quite strongly on that.<br/><br/>The work of the Irish Naval Service is something that is very respected both by M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res and by the other people doing this work but we remain concerned that the work should stick, as it has for the past three years, to humanitarian search and rescue, rather than looking to go on border control missions, which we feel sends a very concerning message.</p></speech>

It is very frustrating to work in that environment and for the narrative to be there focusing on the pull factor instead of the fact that people are dying at sea and that has been the case for many years.  We should bear in mind that NGOs only got involved in the water in 2014 and 2015.  There were naval vessels well before that.  The majority of rescues still continue to be done by Government vessels.  NGOs serve to take the burden off merchant navy oil tankers and other people who are ill-equipped to deal with the situation.  It is frustrating to hear that when the narrative should be on the number of deaths at sea.  Regarding organ donation and migration, I have never heard of anything like that and I have not come across it in the medical clinic at all.<br/><br/>In terms of the medical care provided when people reach Italy, the night before disembarkation I draw up my list of people whom I need to refer to the Italian Ministry of health.  The number of people on the list is directly proportional to the poor quality of detention centres from which they have come.  Often, many people suffer from the same infection as a result of horrific sanitation.  I then refer those people to the Italian Ministry of health.  I also refer people whom we could deem to be vulnerable cases.  They may be unaccompanied minors or people who have suffered serious psychological distress after being tortured for many months or witnessing people being killed.  The problem I face is that I could refer everyone on the boat, all 600 or 900, but I cannot.  I have to think of an arbitrary threshold to make the referrals on psycho-social issues people have.  It is very difficult to do that.  There is a strain on what the Italian health care system can do.  One has to be selective in whom one can refer on.  MSF does work in Italy.  It is doing new projects in Sicily to manage the psycho-social issues on land and to help support the Italian health care system that way.<br/><br/>As Mr. Taylor said, the co-ordination of rescues is done through the MRC in Rome.  Very often we work with naval vessels and other NGOs to support them doing a rescue.  We may provide the life jackets and they may take the people on board their boats or <i>vice versa</i>.  If a naval vessel needs to go back to port we disembark people onto the naval vessel or <i>vice versa</i>.</p><p>My experience is that the co-operation has been positive.  The problem is that often there are not enough assets in the water.  More often than not, our boat has been overloaded by almost double its capacity.  Going into port in Catania or Sicily, we have been found to be listing to one side because we were well over double our capacity.  That is an insanely and incredibly dangerous situation but we have no other support.  We do not even have a merchant navy vessel to assist us in rescues.  This is a major issue.</p></speech>

Migration is always on the agenda for the Foreign Affairs Council.  We commend the Deputy on her work and questions on Ireland's participation in the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa and how much money goes into that.  We do not know where that trust fund money is going but we know it is potentially earmarked, as the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, said, for the Horn of Africa region.  We call on committee members to find out exactly where Ireland&rsquo;s contribution is going in that regard.</p> <p>  On the Chairman&rsquo;s question on whether the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade asked whether Ireland brought up conditions in Libyan detention centres at European level, he did raise it at a recent Foreign Affairs Council meeting.  Again, we call upon all members of the committee to raise this issue in their national and European parliamentary parties, let their colleagues know what information they are receiving and continue to push these agendas at European level, namely, at the Foreign Affairs Council, as Ireland can and should.</p></speech>

I was at a meeting with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed.</p> <p>  I welcome the representatives from MSF and I thank them for outlining the experiences the organisation is undergoing with refugees in the Mediterranean.  I compliment MSF on the tremendous work it is doing in this regard.  What is happening there is horrendous.  In 2016, there were 5,000 deaths of migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean and already this year there have been 2,700.  We must do something to tackle this.</p> <p>  What is the average age of migrants trying to reach Europe?  More importantly, how do we stop it?  This cannot continue.  Does MSF feel enough is being done?  What more can be done in these various countries?  The West has much to answer for what it did in Libya.  It deposed the former Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi, and then ran away leaving a lawless state behind.  We did not have an issue with this when Gaddafi was in power.  I do not agree with what he did, but he exercised some sort of control.</p> <p>  These are human beings we are dealing with.  They are the same as ourselves and breathe the same air we breathe.  Some of them are genuine migrants trying to get away from war.  Will MSF outline from what countries most migrants are coming and why?  Some of them are financial migrants coming to better themselves and to travel.  I was in Berlin recently and I saw many of them begging.  I walked up Shop Street in Galway quite late one night recently and noted that the majority of those sleeping rough on the street were non-Irish.  This shows that they are getting to the cities and that many of them are, unfortunately, sleeping rough.</p> <p>  Who are the people providing the service to bring migrants across the Mediterranean?  What are they charging?  Why have they not been taken out?  Money has been given to the Libyan Government to stop this activity at source.  I presume these people are on the take from these guys.  I am sure they are paid on the double by the European Union to stop it and from the other crowd to let the migrants come across.</p> <p>  I compliment our Naval Service on the tremendous work it has done in the Mediterranean.  I have spoken to several sailors who were traumatised by their experiences there.  Some will need counselling.  They pull people on board who can die in their arms.  I compliment Dr. Conor Kenny on the tremendous work he has done, as well as others involved.  Could we do more?  What are other EU countries doing to support MSF in its work?  Are some doing more than others?  Could some others do more?  We have to stop this at source.  I do not know how we do that but I compliment MSF on what it has done.</p></speech>

At this point, the situation is so severe that what is being done is plugging a hole but not answering a question.  How long this can go on just plugging holes is a major issue.  To the best of my knowledge, this issue is not high on the agenda of the European Parliament.  This is a European issue.  In fairness to the Italian authorities, one can understand their difficulties being the drop-off place.  When the Italian economy goes bad, they come under pressure.  That is not solving the problem.</p> <p>  The problem, as I understand it, is the breakdown on the African continent.  Many countries there seem to be in bits on a regular basis.  We have to take this issue to the floor of the European Parliament, to the European Commission and to the Council of Ministers.  We can do our little bit, but it is like a drop in the ocean.  Listening to Dr. Conor Kenny and those risking their lives, it is obvious that the level of frustration they experience must be horrific.  They are picking up people - dragging them out of the sea - bringing them to Italy, going back again to do the same, yet nobody seems to be grasping the major problems.  We have conferences around the world about issues, but this has to be brought to a European level.  Has MSF had the opportunity of addressing Members of the European Parliament?  If not, has it any proposals to do so?  It is unfair to expect MSF to carry a heavy can on behalf of all of us.  The only solution - and in order to feel that we are getting somewhere - is to outline a programme in which we all have to participate and which we all support.</p><p>That is the only question I am asking the deputation.  They are the experts.  They have been on the ground.  We can give money or send our ships, but it is like a drop in the ocean.  I feel so bad about the whole African continent, especially the northern part of it.  I was in Somalia 20 years ago when I was Minister for Defence.  The place is as bad, if not worse, now as it was then.  These places are not making any progress.  It is only when we go there and see with our own eyes the way these people are not even existing that we realise it.  Children were in orphanages and the only things they had were the vests they wore and a bowl of rice per day.  We look around the world and ask how this can go on.  That was 20 years ago but it is still happening.  I am searching the brains of the deputation for opinions on whether we can do something to bring this a step further.  It has to be brought by a co-ordinated European approach whereby all member states have obligations.</p></speech>

Countries like Malta are knowingly, I believe, sending people to these detention centres, which are prison camps to all intents and purposes.  The call should go out that there should be a ban on any country sending migrants to the detention centres while these human rights abuses are going on.</p></speech>

I thank everyone for outlining that this is clearly a complex situation as well.  I know the committee members appreciate that.</p> <p>  We were asked about solutions.  M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res is a humanitarian organisation.  We are in the water to save lives.  That is our agenda.  The solution from an Irish Government point of view is to continue.  The Government has a humanitarian mission there with the Naval Service and it should continue to save lives.  A European dedicated search and rescue response in the area is crucial to stop people dying.</p> <p>  The importance of safe and legal channels is vital, as Mr. Taylor has outlined.  Many people are entitled to asylum but they have to get on these flimsy boats to claim asylum.  Putting them in that situation is reckless.  Is there a possible alternative or more creative way by which these people do not have to fuel the smuggling industry in Libya?  Is there some way they can go through appropriate channels to seek asylum in the appropriate fashion?</p> <p>  I will come back to what I see in the medical clinics.  I do not have the exact number of the average ages but I figure it is around 24 years plus or minus three years.  We were asked where they are from.  It really depends.  We have seen various trends.  Last year, Eritrea would have been one of the countries with the highest numbers.  Now, we probably see more west Africans, for example, people from northern Nigeria, Gambia, Senegal and the Ivory Coast.  We also see a large number of people from south-east Asia, such as Bangladesh.  There is a real mixture of people.  Many of them are fleeing poverty and many are fleeing violence as well.</p> <p>  There was a question about what is being charged to get on these boats.  I can only go on what we hear in the medical clinics and the conversations we have.  People suggest &euro;250, &euro;500 or &euro;1,000 depending on the smuggler and the quality of the boat or even where the person getting on the boat is from.  Again, this is very much hearsay.</p></speech>

We were asked who is providing the services.  It is a mixture of NGOs and different navies, including the Naval Service, contributing services there.</p> <p>  I will repeat what can be done.  We do not have the solution.  Although M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res has been active in this area for several years, we do not have the solution.  We ask ourselves what we would recommend.  The simplest and clearest message we can transmit is that there have to be alternative channels.  There have to be safe and legal channels for this process to happen.  As we have mentioned, the NGOs are not a pull factor.  People would continue to come even if the NGOs were not there and more people would die.  No one takes these risks unaware of what they are, whether they are from Egypt, Syria or Sudan.  People talk to each other through social media.  People know there is a high risk of dying but they are prepared to take it until or unless there are safer and legal channels.</p> <p>  We have mentioned the European Union.  Ireland can do more in raising these issues at European level.  Ireland has leading positions in some of the bodies in Europe.  As a nation that has a deep and admirable humanitarian history, it behoves Ireland to raise these issues in whatever fora are available, as my colleague, Mr. Dunne, said.  All we can do is tell committee members what we are seeing.  All M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res can do is explain what it is our people there are seeing on the ground.  It is the responsibility of policymakers to turn that into policy.  Of course, ending the war in Syria would be great and stabilising Somalia would be fantastic.  However, it is not within our remit to do this.  These are political issues.  The part of M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res is to save lives.  As Dr. Kenny said, we are a sticking plaster on a sucking chest wound.  We will continue to do that work because we believe it is our humanitarian imperative to do so.  Solutions are with politicians.</p></speech>

First and foremost, Ireland should push for a detailed analysis of the EU capacity building measures in Libya for good and bad, in other words, what is working and what is not.  We need an honest assessment of how that procedure is working at the moment.</p> <p>  Mr. Taylor will address Deputy O'Sullivan's question about Libya and the process in respect of those being detained in Libya.</p></speech>

We are eating up time now so I will finish up quickly by saying that M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res has been into more or less every war zone in the past 25 years.  I have witnessed natural disasters, the Ebola outbreak and I have seen conflict with MSF.  Hardened MSF professionals are traumatised by what they are seeing in these Libyan detention centres.</p> <p>  A friend told me one story about a man from Mali who was a painter and decorator.  He had lived in Libya as a migrant with his papers for many years.  He was brought into a detention centre to do painting and decorating.  Once he had finished his work, he was detained by the smugglers and had to ransom his way out of the detention centre.  He ended up on a boat.  He did not want to leave Libya.  He had no intention of leaving Libya.  This is something that I had not appreciated before my colleague came to brief some of the committee members and their assistants on what we are seeing there.  Some people are being forced onto these boats.  The extremely negative and inaccurate narrative that we see in the media is not correct at all.  This is an industry that makes vast sums of money.  It is not regulated in any way, shape or form.  It is too early for us to try to build capacity at the moment.  What we need to do is save lives and stop more people drowning.</p></speech>

The committee secretariat became aware that Dr. Kenny would be back in Dublin.  He mentioned that an opportunity to engage with the committee would be useful in a private capacity.  It was my firm opinion that we should meet in a formal capacity because there may be some chance of people listening or watching these proceedings.  Every effort should be made to get a greater awareness of the ongoing awful tragedy in that refugee route between Libya and Italy and the extraordinary loss of life.</p> <p>  I compliment Dr. Kenny and his colleagues who have been there on working in extremely dangerous and perilous conditions.  They are working with the most deprived people.  Some time ago, we heard from a colleague of theirs.</p><p>She was a midwife who had returned from Syria.  Like today's presentations, hers was very graphic and very useful for getting out the message of the horrors being inflicted on innocent people.  As all my colleagues have said, the response at European and global levels has been inadequate.</p><p> In respect of contact, I am informed that the next EU foreign affairs Council is on 17 July.  We will ensure that the Department and the Minister have the transcript of this meeting well in advance of the Council meeting.  We will specifically refer to the conclusions drawn by Mr. Taylor in his initial contribution.  We will ask the officials and the Minister to take cognisance of all the issues raised today.  We will write formally to the Minister, Deputy Coveney after this meeting asking him to raise them again on 17 July.</p><p> At the outset, Mr. Taylor stated that the deaths at sea are comparable to war zones and that there is only a sticking plaster being applied to a gaping wound.  They are powerful statements of the desperate tragedy afflicting so many innocent people.  We commend all the witnesses' colleagues, those in other non-governmental organisations and everybody who is working to try to ease the plight of those innocent people in very dangerous circumstances.  We wish to record our appreciation of their work.</p></speech>

This is the first meeting of the Estonian Presidency and will be my second Council to attend since my appointment as Minister for Finance, having attended the June Council in Luxembourg.  In light of these developments, I want to discuss quickly the issues that are before finance Ministers at the ECOFIN meeting.  In the committee's invitation, it asked if I would also provide a brief overview of the proceedings of the June ECOFIN meeting, so I will address that first.</p> <p>  The June ECOFIN meeting took place in Luxembourg on 16 June and it was the last under the Maltese Presidency.  The June agenda included discussions relating to the reduced VAT rate for electronically supplied publications, known as ebooks, the general reverse charge mechanism, which I will explain quickly for the benefit of members, strengthening of the banking union and risk reduction measures, and an update on the current financial services legislative proposals.  On the non-legislative part of the meeting there were discussions on non-performing loans, the fight against the financing of terrorism, the capital markets union, the contribution to the June European Council meeting, and the Stability and Growth Pact.  As usual for the final meeting of a Presidency, it was busy.</p> <p>  The first item on the agenda was a proposal to amend the Council directive dealing with a reduced VAT rate for epublications.  At present, the EU VAT directive prevents member states from applying the same VAT rates to epublications as currently applies to physical publications.  The result is a less favourable VAT treatment of epublications in most member states.  The modernisation of VAT on ecommerce proposals published by the Commission on 1 December 2016 includes provision to grant all member states the possibility to apply the same VAT rates to electronically supplied publications as member states currently apply to printed publications.  Furthermore, the proposal also allows all member states to apply a zero or super-reduced VAT rate, which is below 5%, to publications in any format.  Until now, only member states that applied such treatment to physical publications on and since 1 January 1991 could avail of zero or super-reduced rating.  Unfortunately, no agreement was reached on this.</p> <p>  The second item dealt with a proposal to amend the directive on the common system of VAT specifically relating to the temporary application of a generalised reverse charge mechanism relating to supplies of goods and services above a certain threshold.  This item was last discussed at the March ECOFIN meeting.  The current EU VAT directive provides for sectoral reverse charge mechanisms to apply in certain circumstances where known fraud exists.  However, it is proposed to introduce a generalised reverse charge mechanism which extends the reverse charge to all supplies of goods and services in a member state and not just to a specific sector.  Under the reverse charge mechanism, the person liable for payment of VAT to the tax authorities is the consumer and not the supplier.  This is an anti-fraud mechanism.  As with the ebooks proposal, no agreement was reached on this matter either, as they both require unanimity to proceed.</p> <p>  Ministers also discussed a number of legislative proposals that dealt with strengthening the banking union and also dealt with risk reduction measures.  Two of the proposals, namely, a draft directive on the ranking of unsecured debt instruments in insolvency proceedings relating to bank creditor hierarchy and a draft regulation on transitional arrangements to phase in the regulatory capital impact of International Financial Reporting Standard 9, IFRS 9, were agreed by Ministers.  The first general approach seeks to harmonise the ranking of unsecured debt instruments across Europe, that is, to establish a common hierarchy for the repayment of creditors when an institution is resolved.  The second general approach introduces transitional arrangements to phase in the impact on bank capital of IFRS 9, an accounting standard that comes into effect on 1 January 2018, and to phase out the exemption of sovereign bonds from the large exposure rules due to expire at the end of 2017.  This means that the Presidency can commence discussion on these draft proposals with the European Parliament as soon as the Parliament has approved its own negotiating stance.</p> <p>  The Council noted the progress made by working parties on the remaining four draft proposals.  These relate to bank capital requirements, the directive on bank recovery, a regulation on the Single Resolution Mechanism and a regulation establishing a European deposit insurance scheme.  The first three proposals are aimed at reducing risk to the financial sector and are designed to incorporate into EU law standards agreed at the global level by the Basel committee on banking supervision and the financial stability board.  The final proposal sets out to establish an EU-level insurance scheme to strengthen the protection of bank deposits.  Work will now continue at a technical level on these proposals.  We were given an update on non-performing loans in Europe, the mid-term review of the capital markets union action plan and progress made on the implementation of the action plan for strengthening the fight against terrorist financing.  As the Council will return to the first two topics in July, I will say more about them later.</p> <p>  Let me now turn to the remaining two items on the June ECOFIN agenda: the contribution to the European Council meeting to the European semester and the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact.  The EU semester refers to the EU economic governance rules and related monitoring.  This is an annual cycle of economic and budgetary policy guidance which culminates in the adoption of country-specific recommendations.  The Council discussed and approved the recommendations on each member state's country-specific recommendations.  This is a routine part of the annual EU semester process and these recommendations were endorsed by the European Council in June and will be adopted at the July ECOFIN meeting.  We are broadly satisfied with the policy guidance contained in the three country-specific recommendations addressed to Ireland.  Finally, ECOFIN was asked to approve the draft Council decisions to abrogate the excessive deficit procedures of Portugal and Croatia.  Both countries outlined the progress made with respect to their economies and welcomed this.  The Council also agreed to launch a significant deviation procedure for Romania as part of the preventative arm of the Stability and Growth Pact with a view to correcting its significant deviation from the structural adjustment path towards its budgetary objective.</p> <p>  Next week will be the first ECOFIN meeting under the Estonian Presidency and I wish it well.  I remind the committee that this is a draft agenda and there may be changes between now and the meeting.  On the legislative side of the agenda, Ministers will be informed, as usual by the Presidency, of the state of play on the current financial services legislative proposals.  The Commission will make a presentation about its recently published proposal on the mandatory disclosure of tax schemes by tax advisers.  This would require tax advisers to disclose to tax authorities when they market or promote tax planning schemes that meet certain so-called hallmarks.  The disclosures would be shared with all other member states.  The logic for that proposal is that tax authorities would be made aware of arrangements that may constitute tax avoidance and therefore would be able to carry out more detailed audits or introduce legislative changes to close loopholes.  The proposal stems from the recommendation in the OECD base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process.</p> <p>  This is a Commission proposal that has not been contributed to yet by member states.  Ireland and other member states will now examine the proposal in detail and discuss it at Council working parties under the Estonian Presidency.  These technical discussions have not yet begun.  The Presidency has not made this proposal one of its tax priorities but the Commission will be eager for agreement to be reached in the coming months.  Ireland already has mandatory disclosure rules in place and is one of only four member states to have such rules.  A Government decision in September 2016 confirmed Ireland's support in principle for all member states agreeing a directive to introduce similar rules to the extent that they are in line with the BEPS Action 12 report.</p> <p>  Turning to the non-legislative side of the agenda, there are three topics down for consideration.</p><p>The first item will be a presentation on the work programme of the Estonian Presidency which will be made by the Estonian Finance Minister, Mr. Toomas T&otilde;niste, as is usual at the start of a presidential term.  The main overall objectives of the Estonian Presidency are: an open and innovative European economy; a safe and secure Europe; a digital Europe and free movement of data; and an inclusive and sustainable Europe.  The Presidency views an open and innovative European economy as developing a business environment which supports knowledge-based growth and competitiveness.  It is also committed to the principle of better regulation and will examine opportunities for e-solutions.</p><p> The second item will be the topic of the Commission's mid-term review of the capital markets union action plan, on which Ministers will seek to adopt draft Council conclusions which we generally support.  As I mentioned, this item featured on the agenda for the June Council.  The mid-term review which was published on 8 June details the progress made so far and sets out timelines for new actions in the coming months.  Ireland is broadly supportive of the capital markets union project and welcomes the continued efforts of the Commission to implement the action plan, including through the review which shows that significant progress has been made across many measures.  The capital markets union action plan has the potential to increase the sources of finance for Irish businesses and investors.  The creation of larger and deeper capital markets in Europe would also be of benefit to our financial services industry.  The majority of the proposed new measures will help to achieve these objectives.  It is generally the case that the cumulative effect of many measures will have an impact, rather than any single measure being transformative by itself.</p><p> The report of the expert group of the financial services committee subgroup on non-performing loans will be presented to Ministers and followed by an exchange of views.  The Council will also be asked to adopt draft conclusions.  From an Irish perspective, notwithstanding the progress made and the strong pace of reductions in 2014, 2015 and 2016, pressure remains on Irish banks to reduce the value of non-performing loans at a faster pace.  The value of impaired loans in Ireland has fallen by approximately 63%, from a peak of &euro;85 billion at the end of 2013.  In 2016 alone it fell by approximately 25%.  The momentum of this reduction in the value of non-performing loans has continued into 2017.  Ireland is broadly supportive of proposed measures which cover 19 policy proposals across four core areas: supervision; insolvency and legal frameworks; the development of secondary markets; and the restructuring of the banking sector.  The aim of the proposals is to introduce consistent and strong supervision of non-performing loans; improve the legal frameworks and efficiency across the European Union; enhance the consistency of approaches to secondary markets; and assist member states in setting up asset management companies.  However, we do have some concerns about specific elements of the proposals.  For example, we are concerned that restructuring activity will be disincentivised in favour of loan sales, or that possible changes to legal and insolvency frameworks might need to make allowance for the independence of the courts system and our common law framework.  The draft conclusions make it clear that the matter will be reviewed.  Accordingly, we are broadly supportive of the draft Council conclusions.</p><p> I trust that the Chairman and members of the committee have found the summary of last month's meeting and the outline of this month's agenda informative.  I thank them for their attention and will be happy to respond to questions or observations members may have.</p></speech>

It requires annual sanction and I ask him to sanction the process for this year - I have engaged with a number of Ministers of State in the past - in order that officials might engage with me on one particular policy issue.  I ask the Minister to do so without delay, if possible.</p></speech>

I would not expect anything less of him and welcome his clarification on whether officials can engage with members of the Opposition.</p> <p>  I wish to discuss the fiscal rules, the Commission's stance on the budget and banking union.  This will be the Minister's second ECOFIN meeting and the first we have had a chance to discuss with him.  Did he discuss the need for reform of the fiscal rules at the last ECOFIN meeting?  Will he do so at an upcoming meeting?  Did he raise the case for flexibility for Ireland within the rules, particularly in the light of Brexit?</p></speech>

In my opening statement I asked for an opportunity to address colleagues and I did refer to Brexit.  I referred to the pressures Ireland specifically would be under as a result of Brexit and it is my intention at future meetings to continue to raise the matter.  Where it will be of help to us, I will press the case for recognition of the specific needs of the economy.  The following day I participated in a meeting of the governors of the European Investment Bank, at which I pressed the case for investment in Ireland to recognise our circumstances.  I referred, in particular, to Northern Ireland and will continue to do so.  I used, as an example, the investment of the European Investment Bank in Derry and pointed out that by facilitating the building of the peace bridge and other such projects, it had played a role in the economic rejuvenation of a fabulous city, as well as producing a far more important political dividend.  I will continue to raise the matter, particularly with the EIB.</p></speech>

I have raised it with the governor and there is nothing to prevent the bank from continuing to invest in a non-European Union country.  There should be special recognition for the North.  It is now accepted across the board that there is a need for an adjustment to the fiscal rules and I encourage the Minister to put the matter formally on the agenda.</p> <p>  Prior to the Minister's elevation I discussed proposals related to Brexit with officials.  If the Minister has not seen them, I will send them to the Department again.  They concern flexibilities which are possible within the existing fiscal rules and rules on state aid.  They also deal with changes that need to take place to the globalisation fund to alleviate distortion as a result of Brexit.  A number of practical solutions should be considered and I call on the Minister to raise them, with the other things bring raised by the Department.  I ask him to put forward more concrete proposals at ECOFIN meetings.  We saw what the Brits did on fishing rights and time will slip away from us unless we start to make a stronger case on these matters.</p></speech>

Many other countries contend that they face equal trading risks which I have to acknowledge.  Other finance Ministers tell me that a large share of their trade comprises exports to the United Kingdom.  However, Ireland is the only country that shares a land border with the United Kingdom and the disruptive effects, particularly on supply chains, will be particularly acute for us.</p></speech>

Everybody who is tuned in around this table knows there will be changes to the fiscal rules.  There has to be because they are not working.  They could not have worked because of the way they were designed and they are definitely not working.  It has been acknowledged by all sides with regard to the impact they are having on our inability to invest in certain areas.  The Minister's Department officials are scrambling to try to find vehicles that are off-balance sheet so we can invest in social housing and elsewhere.  The reason we have to do it off-balance sheet is because the fiscal rules do not allow us to spend money we may have at our disposal on these matters.  Even in the absence of Brexit, there is a need to raise the issue of the fiscal rules and show a pathway to having those fiscal rules re-examined so we can put our case forward in terms of the impact it is having.</p></speech>

We have to see if they fit the needs of an economy at any point in time, in this case the European economy.  This could be an area in which we have different views but I contend that many of the objectives contained in the fiscal rules are appropriate and necessary for our economy.  To have a deficit below 3% and a debt as a percentage of our national income that is below 60% are sensible choices for our economy.  Even if the fiscal rules were not there, they are good, sensible choices for a small, open economy that has a currency but does not print its own currency.  That being said, we had low debt levels and low deficit levels before the crisis began and all these things unravelled with shocking speed.  I would never say those things on their own provide full insulation in the uncertain waters we are working our way through.  They are an essential part of what insulation and security looks like for an open economy like Ireland.  Although I welcome that for a number of years under the fiscal rules capital expenditure has been treated differently from current expenditure, I have indicated we will continue to look for recognition of the needs of the Irish economy.  The objectives of the fiscal rules are sensible and appropriate for Ireland.  While we have all gone through a very difficult period at huge social cost, we now have a eurozone and eurozone economy that is growing.  At the peak of the difficulties, we had over 20 eurozone member states in the excessive deficit procedure.  We now have around four or five.</p></speech>

At this point in time, I cannot say.  As I have said on a number of occasions recently, our estimate on the so-called fiscal space for next year is broadly unchanged from a number of months ago.  It is a matter that can change at any point during the year.  We will be having an assessment of this matter during the summer and I will be making a final calibration of where we are in advance of the budget.</p></speech>

Due to the openness of our economy and the number of moving parts within it, any form of a change can have an effect on resources that are available next year.  An increase from &euro;5 to &euro;6, for the sake of argument, is not a big percentage change but can have quite an effect on the discussions that I have with colleagues.  I want to ensure that any indication I give of resources that are available next year, which I will finally do after the summer, is as accurate as possible, but I will give the Deputy my current understanding of it.</p></speech>

It seems that the whole plan of the banking union has now untangled.  It has fallen at the first hurdle.  We had this great promise from the European Union that taxpayers' money would not be used in rescuing the banks.  The first challenge to the European Union on that was in Italy and lo and behold, MPS, a bank in Italy, has been sanctioned by the Commission to use public funds in a rescue of that bank.  It sets a new expectation in the markets that other countries may follow suit.</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct when he says Italian taxpayers' money was used in dealing with the situation in Italy.  The Italian Government made that decision in recognition of the fact that the way debt was held in the Italian banks was very different from the European norm.  That was agreed to by the single supervisory mechanism and the European Commission.</p></speech>

There is either a new model or there is not.  If this were to happen in Ireland or Luxembourg next, there would be an expectation in the markets that rather than applying the new "suck it up, folks" model that is supposed to involve the bail-in of junior and senior creditors across the European Union, governments would use public funds to bail out the banks again, just as we did in Ireland in recent years, before European public funds would be drawn on.</p></speech>

If what happened recently in Spain and Italy had had happened in the eurozone a number of years ago, particularly during and in the aftermath of the crisis, we would be dealing with how banks elsewhere in the eurozone were affected, but we are not dealing with such issues.  The fact that this has not happened - we have seen the resolution of two national banking issues without a contagion effect within their national economies or the eurozone - proves that the system has improved significantly in recent years.  Having said that, the single supervisory mechanism is a relatively new institution by European standards.  Of course, there is always a needs for an assessment of how these matters are handled.  I am resolute on two points.  First, we do not want to see this happen in Ireland again.  Second, Ireland is now demonstrating a path to allow taxpayers to get their money back.  This has happened in the case of AIB.  I see the strengthening of banking union as a way for us to mitigate the risk faced by taxpayers and I hope eliminate it at some future point.</p></speech>

I was taken aback when the Commission bluntly recommended that Ireland needed to encourage a more durable reduction in the value of non-performing loans through resolution strategies that involvd write-offs for viable businesses and households, with a special emphasis on resolving the issue of long-term arrears.  Is the Commission telling us, almost a decade after the crash, that we need to get our act together?  Its specific call for a policy of write-offs is unprecedented as we know that we have a Government which is simply not going to insist on it.  What steps will the Minister take to implement that recommendation?</p></speech>

The rate of change has been extraordinary by European standards.  The value of non-performing loans decreased by approximately &euro;10 billion in 2016 alone.  A reduction of &euro;10 billion was achieved in a single year.  The rate of improvement, by comparison with where we were at the peak, is absolutely massive.  I will give some figures to illustrate the point I am making and I am using our own measurements.  The Central Bank provides figures for five covered institutions.  At the depth of our difficulties in 2015, there was &euro;52.3 billion of non-performing loans.  It was a gigantic challenge for families and businesses throughout the State.  At the end of the first quarter of this year, that figure was &euro;36.1 billion.  There was a change of &euro;16 billion in the value of non-performing loans.  Having said that, our rate of non-performing loans is still high by comparison with the European average.  We want to see it come down further and it is steadily.  Services such as Abhaile and the Personal Insolvency Service of Ireland, as well as commercial enterprises and companies all over the country, are engaging with banks to try to restructure loans on terms that would be mutually beneficial.</p></speech>

We will continue our policies if they work.  The evidence on the progress we have made in dealing with non-performing loans is very positive.  We want to keep at it.  I will give the Senator a concrete example.  The Central Bank has noted that since the peak in June 2013, approximately 120,000 private mortgages have been restructured and that 88% of those participating in the restructured mortgages are meeting their commitments, but that is not to deny that there continues to be great difficulty.  I know that, but we have seen successive quarters of improvement in non-performing loans.  In fact, that rate of resolution is now the fastest in Europe.</p></speech>

Businesses have reached agreements with banks that have reduced the nominal value of debts, agreed to the making of repayments over longer periods of time and to the repayment of lower levels of debt in response for being treated better in other ways.  All of this will vary, depending on the bank and the customer.</p></speech>

At the end of June 2016, private equity firms held loans on 10,000 principal dwelling houses in the State.  As there are 740,000 such loans in total, it is clear that private equity firms hold a very small share of the total number of household and private dwelling loans in the country.</p></speech>

I have asked my team to give me the most up-to-date figures available to us.  The figures I have just provided are the most up-to-date available to me.  I mention them because the starting point - the number of loans private equity firms have in the State which relate to units in which people actually live - is much lower than some indicate, but the position might change.  That, however, is a matter for the banks which are coming from a low base.  As the Senator is aware, we introduced legislation two years ago.  Under the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015, if a loan is sold, the rights of the mortgage holder or consumer with regard to the loan are maintained, even though ownership of it has changed.</p></speech>

I am using the phrase "private equity firms".  I will keep a close eye on how these companies and units operate because I want to ensure they are respecting their commitments to people.  The loans to which we are referring are contingent on what happens to people's homes, of which I am always aware.  The majority of the funds are providing for investment in the State to fund commercial construction which we all acknowledge is happening.  That means that Irish banks are not the main source of such credit.  That is an important objective for the economy to realise.</p></speech>

In fact, I said the very opposite.  I indicated that I was keenly aware that somebody's home was the backup for his or her loan.  I understand that.  I have dealt with as many people as the Senator who are in intense mortgage distress or living in a property the ownership of which is changing.  I am as aware as anybody else in the House of the human face of the problem.  I am simply making the point that legislation was introduced in 2015 to ensure that if a loan changed hands, the person who was dependent on the asset with which the loan was related still had the protection he or she needed.  I will keep the matter under review because I want to make sure we will do what we reasonably can to deal with the great social and personal distress people can endure.</p></speech>

We want to do all we reasonably can to ensure people stay in their homes or properties.  The number of repossessions was unchanged in 2014, 2015 and 2016.  Lest there be any risk my comments will be misinterpreted by others, I want to ensure we will do all we reasonably can to help people to stay in their homes, but there are limits.  In 2016, the last full year for which I have figures, there were 847 repossessions.  In the same period there were 1,201 voluntary surrenders.</p> <p>  The question of establishing a particular court to deal with this matter is still under consideration by the Government.  We have the Abhaile mortgage arrears resolution service and I am very pleased to see the advertising and prominence it is being given across the State.  It is trying to make funding available to people in debt and distress who are not approaching the banks to deal with their difficulties.  The State is going to fund and make a significant contribution to helping them to access services and, through the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, procure those services for them.  It is a very new service and it is reasonable to wait a little time to see how it is going to go.  The debt thresholds are a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality in consultation with me.  The Insolvency Service of Ireland was put in place in 2015 and is offering three forms of debt relief.</p></speech>

The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council's chief economist told the Oireachtas Committee on Budgetary Oversight that it was worried that the figures from the Department of Finance were too optimistic, on three grounds, that the model used did not take into account the fact that exports to Britain were more labour intensive than in other export markets; that COSMO could underestimate the shock impact of Brexit and that the model did not take into account the exchange rate changes which had been a feature of the Brexit process to that point.  When he was pushed on the possible implications, he confirmed that the effect could be significant.  That is a significant statement which adds to the argument against cutting the universal social charge.  What action has the Minister taken on foot of it and has he discussed the matter with his officials or the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council or the ESRI that share that analysis?  It is a question of the model being used.</p></speech>

The ESRI is an independent body which offers its views on how the Department, the Government and the economy are performing and I respect them.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council assesses whether our fiscal forecasts are inside a reasonable range of accuracy and whether they reflect the risks.  It has endorsed our mid-term forecasts.  It has acknowledged that the figures are inside parameters it believes are reasonable.  We have assumed that the impact of Brexit, even before it happens, will eliminate approximately 0.5% of the projected growth of the economy and recognised this in the forecasts made.</p> <p>  In respect of the impact on fiscal resources, the ESRI came up with a figure of &euro;600 million over three years.  In those three years we will spend approximately &euro;180 billion and collect approximately the same amount in taxes.  While that is a risk we need to manage, it is one calculated across three years.</p><p>I do not have a Brexit and a non-Brexit part of my day.  It has changed all the work we do in respect of the economy and permeates all discussions I have with my officials on economic matters.</p></speech>

I wish him well in his new combined role.  In the context of the issue of non-performing loans, the Minister indicated that there are some concerns in regard to specific elements of the proposal, such as that restructuring activities will be disincentivised in favour of forced loan sales.  KPMG is currently conducting due diligence on AIB's loan book.  The State, on behalf of Irish citizens, is the principal shareholder in AIB.  The Minister stated that there have been very few forced repossessions, although those that do occur are hugely significant for the individuals concerned.  What is the Minister's view on the proposal regarding non-performing loans that has been put forward by the financial services committee subgroup on non-performing loans in the context of SME, farm, home and buy-to-let loans and what impact that will have on the work-out in respect of AIB and, possibly, those relating to other banks?</p></speech>

It is considering supervisory tools - for example, extending non-profit loan guidance to all European Union banks - the use of insolvency and debt recovery frameworks, such as how there could be better transparency in the context of insolvency outcomes, the development of secondary markets, which goes back to another point on the agenda regarding the development of a single capital market for Europe and what measures need to be taken in the context of restructuring the European banking sector.  Those are the four ways in which the committee is considering the issue.  The Government will engage constructively with what is being proposed.  I have said that certain matters need to be monitored.  We must ensure that the forced loan route is not unnecessarily favoured over the restructuring route.  Both can play a very valuable role, which is the experience we have had in the economy in recent years.  There is a need to be sensible regarding additional powers such as the Single Supervisory Mechanism that are made available to other bodies and we must ensure that any developments in respect of the restructuring directive currently being debated in Europe recognise Ireland's legal framework and, in particular, its common law framework.  Many of the matters that are being debated and that will be the subject of negotiation are constructive in nature but we must ensure that they respect the direction in which Ireland is moving.</p></speech>

I fully accept and recognise that the public flotation of AIB shares was very welcome but many individuals with bank loans - including those with small business, farm and buy-to-let loans and, in particular, home loans - have come to members with concerns.  The public knows extensive work is taking place within AIB.  Many loans that are being dealt with have already been written down to the value of whatever security the bank holds.  What is the timeframe in terms of the European development and its implications for any work-out of loans in Irish institutions?</p></speech>

For the foreseeable future, the framework within which these matters will be dealt is the Irish law constructs I have outlined.  The existing policy will be used to resolve these types of matters.  There is plenty of debate and negotiation ahead in regard to these European issues.  That said, we will engage constructively in that process.  The development of a banking union and a capital market by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will be of benefit to Ireland in the long run.  I am always open to deliverable ideas that make sense in dealing with this kind of issue.  Significant progress has been made in respect of non-performing loans.  The point is being approached where non-performing loans that have been extant for a significant period are being dealt with and some choices for those holding such loans could be difficult.  People with non-performing home loans in particular should consider the role of the Abhaile scheme offered by the MABS because engagement with banks, backed up by professional support, can yield outcomes which, while not always ideal, might be more acceptable to people than if they do not engage with banks.  The Abhaile scheme will be very important in that regard.</p></speech>

The element of uncertainty in terms of banks and the public is where problems arise in the context of discerning exactly what will happen.  That has been seen in other institutions.  I welcome that the Minister is open to exploring various routes to deal with these issues.  Can the Minister indicate whether discussions are taking place at European level in terms of allowing a combination of flexibility and innovation regarding the fiscal rules governing capital investment?</p></speech>

I will give the Senator an example of what I mean by that before we make any further changes regarding the availability of capital.  He knows that my view is that we need to increase capital expenditure in certain areas, but if I look at what we currently have, with no further change, in 2018 we will be spending 47% more in capital expenditure than we spent in 2014.  That would be an increase of &euro;1.7 billion.  In 2019, with no further change in our policy stance, we will spend &euro;800 million more than we were planning to do in 2018.  We have to ensure that as we release and put in investment into our economy, it turns into investment as opposed to what happened in the past, which is that we released large amounts of capital into our economy.  That had two effects.  It drove up the price for projects we wanted to build and it was one of the triggers of the huge difficulties all of us got into.  They are "watch outs" that will be available to me at all times.</p></speech>

I completely agree with the Minister in terms of the delivery of projects, and that is about ensuring that a proper cost-benefit analysis is done upfront, which was not done of many projects in the past.  Capital investment for our country is hugely important, as is achieving a balance between capital and current expenditure, but if projects stand up financially, there are no restrictions on us under the fiscal rules making that additional capital expenditure available.</p></speech>

Fiscal rules or not, that is what I will want to do anyway.  To emphasise the point, I am saying that I also want to look at how we can deliver new forms of capital investment.  All of this comes with a caveat in terms of the direction we are on.  I accept there is a need to examine how we can do more than we are able to do currently, but between 2014 and 2021, we will double capital investment in our country.</p></speech>

By 2021, with no further change, we will be investing &euro;7.3 billion in capital investment in our country.  The highest point we ever got to was &euro;9 billion and look what happened after that.  We need to be very careful about making money available in a way that delivers the investment the Senator is talking about.  I make that point conscious of the fact that it is entirely possible we will get to a point next year where we have an unemployment level well below 6%.  That has major consequences for how we make sure that this money is used within our economy.</p></speech>

I understand the reason the Senator is asking the question.  When I said "consumer", I meant the person who would purchase the good before they would normally sell it on again.

We believe the current way in which we operate our VAT system works.  We believe it is a very sensible safeguard against fraud and that it is well implemented.  However, our colleagues, particularly in the Czech Republic, may well have a different way of collecting VAT from us, and this change makes sense for them.</p></speech>

They were eager to see if there was a new way of collecting VAT versus what they are currently doing.  We believe our system is working well.

That is due to the way the credit worthiness of our country is calculated.  It does not differentiate between a share in a bank and our balance sheet and funding the Government may hold.  The European bodies that calculate the credit worthiness of a country do not see our credit worthiness having changed as a result of this transaction.  What they see is the composition of our balance sheet changing.</p></speech>

It has backed Cairn Homes to buy the RTE site for a huge amount of money.  It was probably bidding against other companies, which may also have been backed by the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund.  In this case, the State could be bumping up the price of homes unbeknownst to itself.  It would be better if State funds were used more directly with developers and builders to build houses rather than to be helping companies such as Cairn Homes, which might have thousands of sites around Dublin and which is quoted on the stock market in London.  That company is, in its own right, capable of getting funding elsewhere rather than from the State's pension fund, which should be helping smaller banks here to fund developers and builders who are building.  The Minister should look at the issue.  The smaller companies seem to be starved of capital.  Any builder I talk to will say that he cannot get money to develop and yet here we are giving &euro;50 million, through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, to a publicly quoted company to buy a site close to the centre of Dublin.</p></speech>

As the Senator knows, one of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund's goals is to provide funding to our pillar banks, which, in turn, allows those banks to lend money at a lower rate than would otherwise be the case.  It does all of that in any event.</p> <p>  The most recent credit report made available by John Trethowan, who runs the office that looks after this, shows that, by and large, companies applying for credit from our banking system receive a satisfactory engagement with the banking system.  However, the demand for credit has decreased in recent quarters.</p> <p>  The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund provided financing to Activate Capital, a private commercial entity.  We do not hold equity in Activate Capital and we are not involved in the management of it.  At any rate, I could not provide information to the Senator about a commercially-sensitive transaction that would take place with another company.  In turn, Activate Capital provided credit to Cairn Homes which facilitated the latter in proceeding with the purchase of land on which, I believe, will 400 homes will be built.  As Minister for Finance, the last thing I want to see is taxpayers taking equity stakes in developers.  We will not go down the path of being involved in co-funding commercial activity on behalf of construction companies, big or small.</p></speech>

That is exactly what the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund is trying to do.  The fund provides credit lines to our pillar banks to allow them to lend for commercial activity.  That is the kind of transaction that has occurred here with Cairn Homes.  That said, I take the Senator's point that we need to ensure that we remove the roadblocks so that credit is made available in a sustainable way to companies of various types that can build more homes to meet the need that exists.

He is the only member of Cabinet who kept his old job and got another job on top of it.  I wish him the best of luck with all his responsibilities.  No doubt we will be seeing plenty of him and his Ministers of State in this committee and in the Seanad.  He has had a good interaction with all of us here this morning, including all the Senators present and Deputy Pearse Doherty.</p> <p>  Many of the points have been covered.  The Minister mentioned at one stage there was a peak in 2015 of &euro;52 billion in non-performing loans.  In his opening contribution, however, he said there was a peak in 2013 of &euro;85 billion and that it is now down by 63%.  Obviously, the best way to resolve an impaired loan is for it to be paid off in full.  Of that 63% reduction from &euro;85 billion, how much of it did we get back in repayments and how much was in write-offs?  How much of it was restructured and moved into a category of unimpaired loans?</p></speech>

Perhaps it was repaid.  I am just looking for that information.</p> <p>  Deputy Noonan, on his final appearance in the Seanad on the day before he retired from his position as Minister for Finance, referred to the State having the second largest debt level per person in the world after Japan.  I ask the Minister to tease out the position in that regard a bit more.  The Minister made the point that some people are suggesting we need to spend much more money.  At the same time, however, there is all this debt.  Sometimes people forget just how much debt we have and sometimes the debt-to-GDP ratio is only falling because the GDP figures are rising.  It is good that GDP is rising, but the debt may not be falling all that rapidly or at all.  I ask the Minister to outline his position on debt and debt reduction.  How does he envisage it in future?</p></speech>

The CSO is working on that and I believe it will offer such an assessment quite soon.  Any call the CSO makes on that is up to it.</p> <p>  The level of debt is broadly in line with the figures I have given the committee.  Depending on the year under consideration it will be between &euro;200 billion and &euro;205 billion.  It is a very high figure, but it is reducing as a percentage of our national income.</p></speech>

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, as our national income grew and the level of debt remained the same, the percentage obviously dramatically improved.  I would like us be able to do both.  I would like our national income to begin to grow in a sustainable way and for us, by running budget surpluses over a reasonable period, to begin to steadily reduce our level of debt.  In addition, one of the most significant ways to reduce the level of debt is what we do regarding our shares in the banking system.</p></speech>

The factor that most quickly leads to debt accumulation is the running of large budget deficits year after year.  We are not going in that direction and our objective for next year, as the committee knows, is to balance the books.  In the years that follow we will run a moderate surplus, just as we have at other points in our history.  This would be the quickest way of incrementally taking down our debt.  I answered a question from Deputy Michael McGrath in the D&aacute;il yesterday about the shares we hold in other Irish banks.  I indicated to him that I have no immediate plans to proceed with any further sales.  In any event, I cannot go any further with AIB because we are in what is known as the lockdown period.  It would be a bit disingenuous of me to say these are the sales that are going to reduce our debt immediately given that I said yesterday that I would not do that.</p></speech>

I accept that there needs to be unanimity but there may be pressure in other ways to get us to adapt our position.  We have a very significant reliance on a small number of foreign multinationals, with approximately 40% of our corporation tax returns coming from about ten of them.  Approximately 80% of the corporation tax comes, by and large, from American FDI more generally.  We welcome the fact they are here and the tax is, as we all acknowledge, very welcome.  As a State, however, we are very dependent on a relatively small number of large businesses.  What is the Minister's take on this and how can it best be managed?  If anything were to happen to the tax formulae or if any of these companies were to decide to move around and locate elsewhere, we are very vulnerable. I would like to hear Deputy Donohoe's thoughts on this as the new Minister for Finance.</p></speech>

We will engage constructively in any action from the European Commission on matters like this.  We will not, however, agree to any proposal that might undermine our competitiveness as a country.  We need to be very clear here about corporation tax.  Many other countries have made choices around how they want to deliver a competitive edge for their citizens.  Due to our size, location and relatively small population, it is entirely appropriate that we have a corporation tax policy that reduces the kind of costs and risks faced by a small, open, island economy as it tries to do business.  Like every other recent Minister for Finance, I too will maintain that approach.</p> <p>  The Senator's second question concerned the role of corporation tax and its effects on our tax base.  The first point I would make is that many other countries face the same challenge, but that does not mean that we should not do something about it here in Ireland.  In the coming years we are going to see a change in how our dependence on corporate tax take is driven by a certain number of companies.  The simple reason for this is that as the rest of our domestic economy grows, as our banks begin to recover profitability, for example, all these developments will change the composition of our corporate tax base.  To answer the question as to how I want to deal with this matter in the coming while, the first thing is to continue to support a change in our economic prospects that means that more companies of different kinds and, it is hoped, more investors will pay corporation tax here in Ireland.  That is change number one.  The second change is simply to make other decisions on other forms of personal tax, meaning that we do not end up being over-reliant on corporation tax in the future.</p></speech>

He is obviously also still the Minister for Public Expenditure and this joint committee is as much concerned with public expenditure as it is with finance.  On the spending elements, the population is growing and people are living longer, which is welcome.  Population growth in itself, however, puts a lot of pressure on things like school places and the Minister and his Departments will have to spend a lot more money just to stand still.  When it comes to the projections and requirements heading into next year and the year after, how much extra money will be needed just to stand still?  Has this been calculated in this way?</p></speech>

More teachers will be hired simply because there are more pupils.</p></speech>

It still involves hiring many more teachers, however, and many more people to work in our social services.  I will outline what share of that figure is driven by the demographic opportunities the Senator refers to when we publish the summer economic statement and the follow-on expenditure papers.</p></speech>

I also know that the high level of premia is a really big issue for people in terms of their day-to-day cost of living.  Insurance is also a big challenge for companies, particularly small companies.</p> <p>  The Chairman did not ask me to comment but I will not comment on what happened last Monday.  Yesterday morning, the Cabinet agreed to begin drafting the heads of a Bill to consider how we can deal with the consequences of the Setanta ruling and what it means for the level of capital that insurance companies based in Ireland need to hold.  I have been informed by the Irish insurance industry that the level of capital holding and how high it has been in the past has, in turn, contributed to increased premia.  As we put in place measures to address these issues, I want to see this play a role in reducing premia in the long run.  I cannot force that to happen because neither I nor the State owns the insurance companies.  If we put in place measures that address issues that the industry has, I expect to see that reflected, in the long run, in the level of premia that people pay.</p></speech>

My Minister of State, Deputy Michael D'Arcy, also has a particular responsibility for the area.</p> <p>  In terms of what we are doing about the matter, it is not a case that we will take an initiative in the future because we have already done so.  The cost of insurance working group's report has made 71 recommendations that should be implemented by the end of 2018.  We are going to deliver 45 of the recommendations by the end of this year.  </p> <p>  The figure that is available to me from the Central Statistics Office is an average macro figure.  I always understand that there will be people whose day-to-day experience differs from the figure that I will outline.  The figure indicates that the overall cost of motor insurance has stabilised.  In fact, there was a decrease of 8.5% in May 2017 versus May 2016.  I knew as I made that point that every member of this committee probably has examples that do not reflect a decrease.</p></speech>

The Central Bank produces quarterly reports.  I am sure that if a risk manager reports one matter, it is deemed a breach of legislation and, therefore, must be acted upon.  Has a breach been reported over the past number of years?  The Central Bank, in its report, noted a concern that the current banks were reverting back to their irresponsible activities of the past but I will not go into the matter now.</p></speech>

I know what the role is and how important it is.  I am sure the Central Bank would take it very seriously if the legal requirements were not met.  We are a few weeks in and I have not been informed of such a breach.  If there is an issue in terms of this matter, I am happy to update the Chairman at my next hearing.  In any event, I will meet officials from the Central Bank in the next few days.</p></speech>

He gave a submission to this committee and highlighted a breach of regulations, which was absolutely substantial.  The Central Bank has replied to Mr. Sugarman's evidence but took no action.  Either the rules have been breached or they have not.  I do not expect the Minister to know the detail of it now but I ask him to raise the matter with the Governor of the Central Bank.</p> <p>  There is unease about the manner in which the Central Bank offers consumer protection as it is not extensive.  The Central Bank's response to the tracker mortgage issue has been pathetic.  and it must do more to protect consumers.  The committee hears complaints about the Central Bank on a regular basis.  I have expressed my opinion and I ask the Minister to raise the matter with the Central Bank.   </p> <p>  On a more important issue to me, the National Housing Co-operative Bill 2017 was discussed in the Seanad last week with the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy D'Arcy.  A Bill to establish a co-operative is part of an overall approach.  The legislation was not voted on and the debate will resume, but the Minister of State spoke against the Bill.  The main Opposition party contributed to the debate but only hinted at the real situation, did not offer much of a solution and avoided the issue.  I think the issue should be taken up.  In line with what Deputy Pearse Doherty asked earlier, is it possible for Department officials to engage with the people who wrote the Bill, including the Master of the High Court, Mr. Ed Honohan?  The latter has expressed an interest in meeting the Minister.  Liaising would be worthwhile as the legislation could be developed into a Bill that offers solutions.  In the past week or so, the legislation has been cleared with the Ceann Comhairle, with an amendment.  It is not a money Bill and I hope, in the same spirit as what Deputy Doherty asked earlier, we could discuss this legislation with Department officials.</p><p>The committee has received a submission and we have had a good debate with those who are putting the Bill forward.  It has been constructive.  This has been debated to a limited degree in the Seanad.  We heard the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Michael D'Arcy.  A further meeting with the Department, as soon as possible, would be of assistance.</p></speech>

The Chairman will know the concerns we have about the Bill are genuine.  It is not clear to us how this entity would be funded.  It appears it would need to issue some form of bond to pay for the financial commitment.  We do not understand how that would happen.  Furthermore, we are not at all clear how such a unit would be kept off the balance sheet of the country.  I acknowledge the committee has heard this from the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy.  I, or my officials, would be happy to meet members to tease these issues out further.</p></speech>

In the most recent budget, it was mentioned that in the context of our Stability and Growth Pact target of 60%, we will try to reach 45% by 2020 or thereabouts.  Has that target changed given the backdrop of our infrastructural needs?</p> <p>  With regard to our total economic debt, an economist made the point that approximately 75% of our debt is associated with financing budgetary deficits for almost a decade.  Does the Minister have any detail on that?  What percentage of our debt is related to financing our banking sector, and what percentage is associated with financing our budget deficits?</p></speech>

The rest is the accumulated cost of running deficits.  This is why, when Senator Horkan asked me about this point, I said the best way we can begin to get our debt soon is related to what we do in terms of our need to borrow every year.  The level of debt in the economy is between &euro;200 billion and &euro;205 billion, which is a very high figure.  The percentage of Government tax revenue absorbed to service that debt is high by comparison with the norm.  It puts us among the countries that have a debt issue requiring management.  That said, I am optimistic that we will be able to do it through what we will be able to do with surpluses in the future and through what I believe is the right thing to do with our shares in the banking system.</p><p>With regard to debt <i>per capita</i>in the country overall, there has been some confusion over these matters in that the level of private debt that is added on top of the public debt often includes the private debt associated with financial institutions based here in Ireland and the corporate debt of big companies located in Ireland.  That is not the way debt<i>per capita </i>should be calculated for our country because we are so open and have such a high degree of foreign direct investment.  It means that the debt per head for our country would be calculated as far higher than for a country with a low level of foreign direct investment, for example.</p></speech>

I warmly welcome the Senators, witnesses and the visitors in the Gallery to this, the second day of the Seanad Public Consultation Committee's public hearings on children's mental health services in Ireland.  This public consultation on children's mental health services in Ireland is providing us with a unique opportunity to consider and hear from all facets in the debate on the provision of mental health services for children and adolescents.  As I said last week, through sharing their experiences the witnesses will set out the reality of those in need of mental health services and those providing these services.  We will also hear from policy makers.  Following our two public hearings, a draft report will be prepared for the committee by our rapporteur, Senator Joan Freeman.  The committee will review the draft report and publish its final report as soon as possible thereafter.</p> <p>  Today's meeting will consist of two sessions.  In this morning's session we will hear from representatives of professional bodies and clinicians as well as from a children's law specialist.  In the afternoon session we will hear from representatives of State and other bodies.</p> <p>  On behalf of the committee I would like to welcome the following witnesses to this morning's session, Dr. Elisabetta Petitbon, forgive me-----</p></speech>

I also welcome Professor Brendan Kelly, Professor Fiona McNicholas, and Dr. Bl&aacute;naid Gavin.  I welcome Dr. Brendan O'Shea and Dr. John O'Brien from the Irish College of General Practitioners as well as Mr. Paul Gilligan and Ms Orla Gogarty from St. Patrick's Mental Health Services.  I welcome Dr. Brendan Doody and the representatives from the College of Psychiatrists in Ireland, Dr. John Hillery, president and Dr. Maeve Doyle.  I also welcome Dr. Yvonne Begley, Dr. Eddie Murphy and Mr. Gareth Noble.  They are all most welcome.  We thank all the witnesses for engaging with the committee in its consideration of this most important and sensitive topic.</p><p>Before we begin, I must draw witnesses' attention to the following procedural matters.  I advise them that by virtue of 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009 witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Any opening statements that have been submitted to the committee will be published on its website after the meeting.</p><p>To commence proceedings, I invite Senator Joan Freeman to make a few introductory remarks.  I will then invite each witness to make a short presentation to the committee.  They may share their time with a colleague if they wish.  Witnesses should indicate this to the Chair when they are invited to speak.  As there is a large number of witnesses in this session I ask that presenters keep their opening statements as brief and to the point as possible.  I suggest they limit their remarks to five minutes.  When the presentations have finished there will be time for questions and comments from the Senators and responses from the witnesses.</p></speech>

I am sure many of the witnesses, most of whom I have met at some stage during my previous life, would agree.  I will give a very brief summary of what we are trying to do.  We are trying to paint a picture of truth, a picture of what our mental health services for children are really and truly like.  That truth is so important, because if we do not tell the truth we cannot fix what is wrong.  Last week we had a very harrowing day.  We heard witnesses including parents who gave testimony about their children and what they have experienced so far.  Some of the stories were very reflective of what is really going on in this country, but not once did the witnesses point the finger at any particular person or at the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, CAMHS, or at any of the agencies.  They were pointing the finger, as am I, at a system.  It is a system that is broken.  This in nobody's fault, but I need the witnesses to tell the truth today so that we can see the true reality of what is happening to this country.</p> <p>  Our mental health services are dying.  There is no two ways about it.  I need witnesses not only to tell the truth, but also to come up with the most amazing ways of fixing that service, which I know they will.  The next thing we have to do is to listen to that.  Last week Dr. Geoffrey Shannon talked about outrage.  Our country is very good at outrage, but after outrage comes action and that is where we are now.  We are on the point of action starting today.</p></speech>

It is important.  It is an honour and a privilege to be here.  Over the last ten years of working in primary care in Ireland as a clinical psychologist and psychotherapist in private practice, there is one thing which I have consistently seen.  It seems that we are not able to listen to our clients.  Our clients come to us but we are not able to listen.  That means that we are unable to provide an adequate service according to the needs of our population.  I am saying that because I am trying to be brief.  I want to get straight to the point and to the reason I am here today.</p> <p>  I am here today not really as a clinical psychologist but as a psychotherapist.  Psychotherapy is a profession which I think is not looked upon and considered properly here in Ireland.  Psychotherapists make up a fantastic workforce which is being overlooked.  We have the resources.  We have the people to employ as psychotherapists but it seems that we do not consider it as a good enough profession for the HSE to employ.  In my experience working in primary care in Ireland, the things that I could see include a very long waiting list and that CAMHS works only on an emergency basis.</p><p>They are not able to provide treatment.</p><p> Families go away with CAMHS with a label but they have absolutely no idea what to do with that, as after there is no support.  There is no social inclusion or education in the school.  Primary care has a model with six sessions.  In six sessions it is very rare to address the issue or the problems of families that come to us.  When we speak about children, we talk about families and children in those families.  We must provide a service for the children and families.  Another issue is a lack of clarity.  Working in primary care as a clinical psychologist, sometimes I do not know who I can refer and for what reason.  There is not general clarity in Ireland for all services, such as CAMHS and primary care.  It changes according to regions.  That leads to much confusion for GPs, the population, social workers and everybody who works in the health service.</p><p> I am going to try to go straight to the point.  There is one thing for we have the resources, which is to try to better address the needs of our population and listen to what they need.  An idea could be to create a walk-in clinic, as we do not have a 24/7 service for mental health emergencies.  We do not provide prevention or social inclusion like many countries have done in the past ten years.  They are trying to ensure people are involved with prevention and education when it comes to mental health issues.  If I am not mistaken, a couple of years ago the Health Service Executive, HSE, produced a very catchy advertisement stating that if a person had any issue, he or she should speak with somebody.  We did not follow up on that.  Adolescents may be in quite a difficult time in their lives and emotions may go to the roof and back down.  If they want to speak with somebody, there is a very long waiting list.</p><p> I want to bring an example to the committee's attention today relating to the resources we have.  It is the Luxembourg example.  It is a very small country and of course it is different from Ireland.  Between 2000 and 2004, Luxembourg, had a very difficult time with abuse of drugs and alcohol and the rate of suicide was 15 per 100,000 people.  They injected much money into the health service, so much so that in 2016, it was ranked as the best European health service.  They created many resources for mental health, including services that started to employ psychotherapists.  Psychotherapy is a long-term treatment and it is cost-effective.  This is not just my opinion and there is much research, especially lately, proving that if we want to stop the abuse of psychoactive drugs or self-medication, such as alcohol, abuse, one must provide psychotherapy.  It is exactly what they did in Luxembourg, providing psychotherapy everywhere, so much so that in 2013, a new report indicates that the suicide rate was 7.3 per 100,000 people, or half of what it had been.  That is amazing.</p><p> Why am I using the Luxembourg example?  With mental health, the only action it took was to provide psychotherapy and ensure that psychiatrists and psychologists, a fantastic work force for the public, worked together and agreed a template of what services would provide.  That is exactly what Ireland can do.  We have the Irish Council of Psychotherapy, which is the body guaranteeing a high standard for all the five modalities included in psychotherapy.  We are not looking at that.  In the HSE, unless the head of department has a special interest in psychotherapy, there are only clinical psychologists on staff.  Some issues can be addressed with psychologists and screening but also with a trained psychotherapist.</p><p> I want Senators to remember one point.  We are not looking at other professions that could be very useful for the population.  One of those is psychotherapy.</p></speech>

I am a general adult psychiatrist, not a child and adolescent psychiatrist.  I will speak a little about some of the knock-on effects of the state of the child and adolescent mental health service in Ireland.  I will start with a fairly typical case I might see in a hospital emergency department.  For example, it is not uncommon to see a 16-year-old or 17-year-old boy or girl who has self-harmed and is in need of some kind of crisis intervention.  Very often, admission to a facility may be helpful in the sort term.  As an adult psychiatrist, I try very hard to meet the need of a person and family.  For the most part, there is no admission bed available in the child and adolescent mental health service so it is very common for us to spend many hours on the telephone looking for a child and adolescent bed while trying to put in place a plan.  Often I would have a very distraught and desperate family seeking a solution when it is the first time they would have encountered this kind of issue.  They will need something.  Those are the circumstances in which, occasionally, a child is admitted to an adult psychiatry unit.  The point I make is that this is not something that is ever undertaken lightly but rather it is done in extreme and exceptional circumstances because there are many down sides to it.  Very often it is done at the request of a very distressed family.</p> <p>  This is a very high-risk group, particularly adolescents.  For Ireland as a whole, the rate of suicide has fallen over the past six years by approximately 19%, which is a very significant national reduction.  There is an exception, particularly in young males aged between 15 and 24, where the rate has actually gone up.  There is a counter-trend going on and this is a very high-risk group.  We also know children and adolescents account for approximately 25% of the population, and as far back as 2005, the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland pointed out that the mental health budget for children and adolescents is approximately 5% of the mental health budget.  There is a disproportionate distribution of budget in this respect.</p> <p>  I am keen to focus on solutions and I share very much many of the points made by the previous speaker about the availability of psychological therapy and particularly psychotherapists.  When we encourage people to speak, there should be someone for them to speak to.  Many of these people come from settings where there may not be people to speak to and it is very important that is provided.</p> <p>  In terms of mental health policy, the long-term goal should be to implement A Vision for Change, the 2006 policy, which must be altered slightly and upscaled.  We now have a population of 4.7 million people.  The policy is quite good and with some tweaking it will be good for some time longer.  However, we need a short-term solution as well because the situation is exceptionally difficult now, particularly with the recent closure of some of the child and adolescent inpatient beds owing to staffing problems.  This must be addressed.  The admission of children and adolescents to adult psychiatry units should cease, and there is no doubt about that.  The question is how can this be achieved in a safe, sustainable fashion and how quickly can it be done.</p><p>Some adolescents, such as 17 year olds, might present with the problems of adults.  Some of them can be as large as adults and present with mental health problems like adults and admission to an adult unit might be indicated.  Even then, however, an adolescent unit that examined their educational and broader needs would be preferable.</p><p> The key at present is retention of staff, in particular nursing and medical staff, as well as expansion to other disciplines.  There must be a programme of meaningful incentives for staff to be recruited and, even more importantly, retained.  Experienced staff are leaving the service owing to difficulties with retention.  The incentives must be tailored and meaningful.  This is not always or even chiefly about money for medical or nursing staff.  It is to do with conditions of work and, in particular, career progression and an assurance about a career progression pathway.  In the short term, a comprehensive staff recruitment and, especially, retention programme is required to try to operate the resource we already have.  In the long term the implementation of the A Vision for Change recommendations is required, slightly changed and increased to account for a population of 4.7 million people.</p><p> The importance of this cannot be overstated, in particular the very acute plight of adolescents who end up in emergency departments following episodes of self-harm or other types of disturbance.  As an adult psychiatrist I never admit such a person to an adult psychiatry unit unless all other options have been comprehensively examined and we have a person unable to go home and a family unable to deal with an outpatient option.  However, there are times when it is necessary, given the circumstances.  I urge that both a short-term and long-term approach be taken.  That is all I recommend to the committee.</p></speech>

I will add to what the committee has heard about the effects of the chronic and ongoing under-resourcing of child psychiatry services by giving it an example from my perspective as a paediatric liaison psychiatrist.  That is a sub-specialty of child psychiatry that provides treatment and assessment of children with co-morbid medical illness, for example, a child with leukaemia who develops psychosis as a result of the medication they are on or a severely medically compromised anorexic.</p> <p>  With the cessation of the on-call child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and the ongoing CAMHS difficulty in accessing inpatient beds there has been an increasing number of presentations over the years to the emergency department.  There has been a six-fold increase since 2006.  Last year, there were 333 presentations in Temple Street and in Crumlin there were 105 acute mental health presentations and admissions to the hospital, on average staying about four days.  Those bed numbers are not counted anywhere and are not collected.  The Mental Health Commission does not look at them.  I propose that they might also be as inappropriate as adult admissions in the absence of adequate resourcing of the liaison department staffing and also adequate training of the paediatric staff who are providing that care.  Compared to our colleagues in the UK where the liaison departments see approximately 24% of urgent psychiatry cases, in Crumlin alone 60% of the liaison time is delivered to acute psychiatry, at the consequence of not being able to give care to the paediatric psychiatry complications.  Many years of advocacy for services in Crumlin have not led to any improvements.  I sincerely hope that Senator Freeman's initiative with this committee will address that.</p> <p>  To conclude, treatment of mental health disorders for children exists and is evidence based.  Children can have and can look forward to good quality of care.  In fact, over 400 parents and children surveyed attest to the value of and satisfaction with services once they access them.  From the Government to ourselves, we all have a collective responsibility to continue to prioritise child mental health services so there is parity of esteem between those with medical conditions and those with mental health conditions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-06a.1587" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Bl&aacute;naid Gavin" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2017070600002#C00400"><p>I am a consultant child psychiatrist and I will pick up on the points made by my colleagues.  Service provision in CAMHS is of grave concern to all those working in it.  One of the fundamental issues that arises regularly, and has a direct impact in terms of the retention issues which have been mentioned already, is the fact it is a very harrowing experience to be placed in a position where children are presenting with acute mental health conditions where there are treatable evidence-based interventions yet the practitioners are not in a position to provide those interventions in a timely way.  It is an incredibly helpless and harrowing position.</p> <p>  Much of the discourse that occurs about CAMHS has a quality that appears to be personalised in regard to the CAMHS system and does not reflect the fact that those working within the system can only work within the system as it is currently established.  There are many issues of contention within that system.  Clearly, CAMHS does not and should operate as a silo and is dependent on an array of additional services.  However, within the current standard operating procedures there is an assumption of multiple layers of care and availability that quite simply do not exist.  This adds to the significant barriers to access that parents experience on an ongoing basis, and also squeezes the available resources and expertise within CAMHS that should be targeting the severe end of the mental health spectrum.</p> <p>  There was a request at the outset for truth.  The essence of truth is obviously the availability of facts, which are dependent on data.  Unfortunately, there is no data available in regard to what is happening in CAMHS.  To speak the truth we must have information and data that tell us what are the quality outcomes and what are the differences that the services make, so we can look at how good a service we are providing, where we need to input efficiencies and where we need to become more effective.  This has a dual purpose.  It has the purpose of recognising and rightfully commending the excellent work that is ongoing in CAMHS, and the effectiveness of the multiple evidence based treatments that are available and from which children benefit.  If the message is consistently about the negatives, it disempowers people in terms of access and makes people more helpless in terms of the conditions with which they are dealing and struggling daily.  In addition, in the absence of data that specifically seeks to find out what the services are doing we run the risk of continuing to provide a lottery both in access to services and in the nature and quality of the service that is provided.  In many cases, people liken service provision currently to the roll of a dice.  While there are known effective treatments available in line with any standard medical interventions, it is not clear where and how they are accessible and how many children benefit from their input.  It is a cornerstone of any quality service internationally or nationally that there is a drive to establish the practice exactly.  There is no oversight of any of that.</p> <p>  Much of the focus to date has been on the idea of throughput and driving increased numbers without looking at a system-wide change and the quality of service provision.  Key to quality is the integration of the voice of the service user and parent, which must inform the changes and the system-wide overhaul that is necessary.  This requires not just tweaking but a root and branch change, with international expertise being brought to bear.</p><p>They are changes that require the most thorough oversight of the available international evidence to ensure that we have a service fit for purpose for the generations to come.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-06a.1590" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. John O'Brien" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2017070600002#D00300"><p>My colleague, Dr. Brendan O'Shea, and I are general practitioners.  We are here at the behest of the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, whose remit is educational training standards and research in Irish general practice.  General practice provides a comprehensive, holistic and an ongoing care of individuals and families over prolonged periods of time, often extending over many generations of a family.  It does not simply look at diseases, although it does that also, it addresses the physical, psychological, social and existential problems patients present with.  It is a service that is available 24-7, 365 days of the year.  GPs know their patients and the context within which they live their lives and, accordingly, they address their problems in that context.  It is generally the point of first care and it is also the last resort when other services are insufficient or inaccessible.  If the problem cannot be mended, it will eventually end up back in general practice.</p> <p>  Some 75% of the presentations to the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, are referred from general practice, with the remainder coming from a multiplicity of other sources such as social workers, schools, paediatricians and many others.  The national audit of waiting times for CAMHS done in 2012-2013 showed that 50% of people were seen within a month and that 70% were seen within three months, but these figures, while sub-optimal in themselves, mask another problem in that they do not demonstrate the variability between one area and another.  Furthermore, these figures do not accord with recent reports from GPs of their experience of waiting times, most especially in areas of deprivation.</p> <p>  The distribution of CAMHS is population-based - one team per 50,000 of the population.  This crude allocation of resources takes no account of the greater need for mental health services in areas of deprivation.  The Deep End Ireland group of GPs has conservatively estimated that the need is twice that of less deprived areas.  This is yet another example of the inverse care law where those with greatest need are least likely to have it met.  </p> <p>  The composition of the CAMHS is a psychiatrist along with a multidisciplinary team of nurses, psychologists, social workers, occupational therapists and junior doctors.  These teams have been missing key staff to varying degrees in different areas.  The net effect of this is that these teams are not able to do their work.  The case load increases and more staff members leave the team because they are not able to work in a manner which is consistent with their own professional values.  In Dublin 15, for example, we had a period where we had no child psychiatrist and this was followed by a further period of repeated changes of psychiatrists.  This was not a service in any meaningful sense since lack of continuity is very disruptive.  In recent years, CAMHS has defined the limits of what it does and has formalised this in its standard operating procedure.  Regrettably, this was done without meaningful reference to its main source of referrals, general practice, and the result has been a cumbersome and fragmented referral structure.  A GP must decide at the initial consultation if the child presenting has a leaning disability problem, an autism spectrum disorder, a severe mental health problem or a more minor one.  Depending on the evaluation, the child will be referred to the assessment of need service, primary care psychology or CAMHS.  Often, this is well within the clinical competence of the GP.  However, since the initial presenting story is often complex and poorly defined at the front end, and also since the child's condition often changes while on the waiting list, the referral can very easily be misdirected, thus extending the waiting time even further.  A more unified referral structure is badly needed and there needs to be an end to children being referred back to GP with their problems unaddressed, a not uncommon experience for GPs and their patients.</p> <p>  There are 1.15 million people under the age of 18 years in Ireland.  It is estimated that 115,000 have a mental health illness, causing some impairment, and 23,000 have severe and disabling mental health problems.  Some 5% of the budget is spent on CAMHS.  I am not sure if that is 5% of the national budget or the mental health budget, but with that allocation there is still a struggle to provide sufficiently for the need.  GPs provide 25 million consultations every year but they are even more poorly resourced at 3% of the national budget.</p> <p>  The cheapest way to deal with childhood mental health is to intervene with resources as early as possible in the evolution of an illness in the domain where it is least expensive.  GPs struggle to provide the care needed as they have little and often no resources to assist them.  The ready provision of child psychology, family therapy, outreach workers and counselling psychotherapy is often insufficient, patchy or absent.  If CAMHS is very expensive, and clearly it is, then the best solution is to properly support GP care where interventions are at their earliest and cheapest.  Most importantly, this would save children and their families a great deal of unnecessary pain and distress.</p> <p>  The care of those with an autism spectrum disorder is also fragmented with service schemes for younger and for older children.  CAMHS specifically excludes these children from their standard operating procedure, except where acute short-lived mental problems arise.  The mental health intellectual disability service for children and adolescents is meant to look after that.  This repeated fragmentation of care makes it nigh on impossible for the GP to make sense of what is going on.</p> <p>  The transition from a childhood mental service to adult care is not working.  The GPs are being left to care as best they can with the meagre resources at their disposal.  The lack of a timely user-friendly mental health service for younger people is undoubtedly a cause of great concern.  The unaddressed mental health issues these children suffer now will continue into adulthood and, along with the great distress suffered by them and their families, it is extremely wasteful.  The neglect at this early juncture inevitably leads on to greater cost of ensuing grave mental health problems, addictions and criminality.  GPs who think in terms of decades and generations can see this unfolding from the perspective of their community-focused clinics.  I will now pass over to Dr. Brendan O'Shea.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-06a.1591" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brendan O'Shea" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2017070600002#D00400"><p>In preparing for this presentation, we consulted our colleagues within the ICGP and, in particular colleagues in the Deep End group.  Some of their feedback, when asked about their experience in this area of care, was that they were actually pretty good at working through the problems with these families when they come in but that they are eaten alive for time, that if they spend 40 minutes with an adolescent, the man with the prostate cancer, arthritis or dementia or the lady with diabetes and hypertension in the waiting room, gets left out, that their practice nurse is deadly with these kids, especially the girls, but that she is hopelessly backed up and that it is a real pity because children and teenagers know them and even though adolescents find any interaction with adults challenging, most get on well with them when they make and sustain contact.</p> <p>  We have seven recommendations for consideration.  Briefly, we recommend that a review of the referral structure for all childhood mental health problems, with an emphasis on the needs of children as they present in general practice, is undertaken and this should be informed with a formal input form families and as far as practically possible children and adolescents themselves.  We also recommend that an out-of-hours CAMHS is put in place to cater for acute presentations in the out-of-hours setting and we recommend that close consideration should be given to integrating this with GP co-operatives.  Those co-operatives are one of the few parts of the health system that stay switched on after 5 p.m.  They are muscular organisations.  They field 1 million consultations in the out-of-hours setting and a strand of CAMHS integrated into this would be well worthwhile considering.  We recommend that as general practice is the principal referring agency and also the service to which these children and family will be referred back, far tighter liaison where the GP team is enabled to participate in an effective multidisciplinary process is essential.</p><p>At present, we have major manpower problems in general practice.  We need more general practitioners and we need many more practice nurses.  Having more general practitioners and more practice nurses will allow people to engage in the process at the lower end of the pyramid before problems become more neglected, delayed, complex and severe.</p><p> We observe that general practice is the only part of the health system with electronic medical records and we recommend that child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and the rest of the health care system should, in 2017, be using electronic medical records.  It is inexplicable that this is not already the case in this State.</p><p> Regardless of configuration, all mental health services for children must be sufficiently staffed to carry out work in a timely manner and we should not have children and their families waiting and disimproving over months.  The distribution of teams and resources must not be solely on the basis of population, but must have a deprivation weighting to account for greater need in such areas.  Saying a certain amount of resources in Bray will do the same in Clondalkin or parts of Newbridge simply does not work out.</p><p> Rather than creating a stand-alone psychology service, psychologists, counsellors and family therapists should be allocated to specific general practitioner, GP, practices or groups of practices.  We know that the majority of general practice is delivered by two, three and four doctor teams.  Any of these teams, particularly in areas of deprivation, would be well able to and would benefit from having family therapy, counselling and child psychology located in the practices, where most of the children and families live in close proximity.</p><p> Community-based services should be sufficiently resourced to get in earlier into the lives of these vulnerable children, adolescents and their families.</p><p> I thank the committee for requesting input from the Irish College of General Practitioners.  We strongly recommend this focus, which is pragmatic and centred on the needs of the families and children and not on the considerations of the health care professions.  We also see that there is a bigger question for society.  Why is the rate of suicide among adolescent males increasing?  What is society putting in place for younger families and for children?  We certainly have some of the answers in the health care professions, but society has other answers to provide as well.</p></speech>

In particular, I thank Senator Joan Freeman for her tireless efforts in bringing a spotlight to this very important and serious issue in our society.  I am a director at St. Patrick's Mental Health Services, which is Ireland's largest independent, not-for-profit mental health service provider.  It is committed to the provision of the highest quality mental health care, the promotion of mental health, advocacy and the protection of rights and integrity of those experiencing mental health difficulties.  These principles are central to how we deliver care.  Willow Grove Adolescent Unit, an approved centre for our organisation, provides inpatient care and community care through our Dean Clinic in Lucan for children between 12 and 18 years of age.  It is the only child and adolescent mental health service in the country to provide service users with a dedicated advocacy service for young people to support them to assert their rights and entitlements while being treated for their mental health difficulties as an inpatient.</p> <p>  I wanted to state that, having looked at some of the submissions from last Thursday, much of what we have to say has the themes of resourcing, integration and systematic integration of how we approach this problem.  There are a number of points we want to emphasise in our submission.  A report on the implementation of A Vision for Change, produced by Mental Health Reform in 2015, outlines that progress continues to be hindered by shortfalls in staffing and the lack of a clear, integrated implementation plan.  According to this report, the development of all areas of specialist mental health care delivery has been weaker than anticipated and, indeed, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon referenced there being much vision and less change.</p> <p>  This is especially true of child and adolescent mental health services.  The fifth and most recent HSE child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, report, published in 2014, indicates that more than 100 children are admitted to adult inpatient units annually.  The HSE performance report for October to December 2016 indicates that in excess of 1,250 children and adolescents waited for longer than three months for a first appointment, and that more than 200 waited for longer than a year.  The report indicates that in 2016, of the children and adolescents admitted to inpatient units, only 69.2% were admitted to dedicated child and adolescent inpatient units, despite this being considered a priority issue.</p> <p>  The Mental Health Reform report on the progress of implementation of A Vision for Change outlines that there are no CAMHS-specific quality standards and guidelines and no quality and outcome monitoring system for CAMHS in Ireland.  The report identifies that in March 2015, the operational capacity of the child and adolescent acute inpatient units was 58, out of a total existing bed complement of 66, and we know the trajectory in recent months has moved downwards again.  A Vision for Change recommended 118 child and adolescent inpatient beds, based on the 2011 census population data.  Dr. Brendan Kelly has spoken about the need to revise the proportionality of bed provision with regard to population growth.</p> <p>  The report further identifies a number of specific gaps in specialist services for children and young people, and a lack of capacity in primary care services - which we just heard about - to detect effectively, treat and refer appropriately child and adolescent mental health difficulties.  In addition, a number of children are sent annually by the HSE to the UK, the USA and Canada for highly specialised inpatient treatments which are not available in Ireland.  Apart from the HSE, independent service providers in Ireland, like ourselves, also provide inpatient services.  St. Patrick's Mental Health Services also provides a community-based mental health care clinic, our Dean Clinic.  Waiting times for admission to independently run inpatient services is short when compared with statutory services.</p> <p>  I will let our CEO, Mr. Paul Gilligan, speak.</p></speech>

Specifically, we welcome the opportunity because we are in the independent sector, which has a very important role to play in trying to resolve what we believe is a crisis in the child and adolescent mental health services.  We have kept our submission specific and tried not to be repetitive, but it is worth saying that the solution to the difficulties is a long-term solution.  We were asked for honesty and it is important to state that, over a number of years, there has been a lack of investment and a lack of forward planning in child and adolescent mental health services.  That is not to criticise everyone.  It is impossible to provide a comprehensive service with the sort of budgets that are being allocated.  The result is that we have an understaffed service.  It is very hard to keep or attract staff.  We do not have any 24-7 services, and therefore the bulk of issues arising at weekends and evenings present at general hospitals, to GPs or to those services that are 24-7.</p> <p>  We believe a long-term plan must be put in place that will tackle this issue, specifically the issue of resourcing child and adolescent mental health services.  It is at crisis point.  We have heard from others about the angst and trauma of having to deal with a child who cannot get a service.  We deal with that all the time in the independent sector.  Distressed families ring who do not have health insurance and cannot access to independent services or get a service anywhere.  We try to help those families to find appropriate services.</p> <p>  Specifically, we believe that a key thing that could be done in the short term would be to establish emergency inpatient assessment units.  We believe that it is not ideal to ask families to travel from Waterford to Cork, but given that the bulk of admissions to adult units happens as a result of a lack of services available on a 24-7 basis, unless we can deliver CAMHS 24-7, which will be a medium-term solution, emergency inpatient units would go some way to addressing that specific issue.</p><p>We believe that in the medium to long term we need a proper strategy around child and adolescent mental health services.  We are signatories to the UN convention.  If we do not provide children and adolescents with adequate and timely mental health services, we are not recognising their rights under that convention.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to speak further to the submission I made on behalf of the consultant child and adolescent psychiatrists who work in the four HSE inpatient facilities.  I will address the demands placed on inpatient services and will reflect on the goal set out in A Vision for Change that all young people under the age of 18 should be treated within age-appropriate facilities.</p> <p>  It is important to remember that prior to A Vision for Change, child and adolescent mental health services were organised primarily for children under 16.  A Vision for Change set a challenge in extending the age threshold to 18.  As we were starting from quite a low base to begin with, this was placing an additional demand on services.  A significant investment in child and adolescent mental health services was thus needed at both community and inpatient levels.  The recommendations for inpatient services, referred to earlier, called for a total of about 108 inpatient beds.  It was also recommended that a proportion of those 108 beds be dedicated to the more specialist provision of a secure inpatient facility and the development of a dedicated inpatient eating disorder service.  In 2007, there were just 12 inpatient beds available for the admission and treatment of young people under 18.  Although there has been great progress over recent years, we are still not at the recommended level as set out in A Vision for Change.</p> <p>  The purpose of inpatient admission is the assessment and treatment of young people with the most severe mental health disorders through the provision of specific evidence-based treatment plans.  There is a goal of achieving the earliest possible discharge in order that the young person is an inpatient for the shortest time possible.  There must be an adequate number of beds available for access to be provided in a timely fashion.  However, that is very difficult when the demand for inpatient admission exceeds the availability of inpatient services.  The number of beds within the public system has now increased to a total of 76.  However, not all the beds have been operational due to staffing challenges in respect of nurses and consultant psychiatrists.</p> <p>  I can speak to this matter as clinical director of the Linn Dara unit where it has been necessary to close a number of beds temporarily because of nursing staff shortages.  That was a very difficult decision to have to make, and it was made when it was not possible to continue to have the beds open.  As a service, it is our priority to ensure they are reopened as soon as possible.  I very much concur with previous speakers on the reasons for staffing difficulties.  They have to do with a range of issues including pay, career progression and, particularly in certain parts of Dublin, the cost of living and accommodation.  Within our service, most of our nursing staff travel quite a distance to work.  When posts become available closer to where they live, it is not surprising that they take up those positions.  As we increase and develop community services, we often draw staff from other existing services.</p> <p>  Over the past ten years approximately, a number of developments have taken place in respect of inpatient services.  Since 2010, there has been a 40% increase in referrals to community child and adolescent mental health services.  This is mirrored by the increase in admissions of young people under the age of 18 to inpatient beds.  In 2007, there were 364 admissions and by 2015, the figure had increased to 503.  The number of young people admitted to HSE and HSE-funded units over that time increased from 78 to 312 in 2016.  While the number of children accessing beds in age-appropriate inpatient settings is increasing, so is demand.  If we are to achieve the goal of having the minimum number of children requiring to be admitted to adult facilities, we have to adopt what I would describe as a whole-systems approach.  It is about ensuring we have adequate resourcing of services at primary care level, adequately resourced teams in community services, and the option of intensive day services as an alternative to admission.</p> <p>  As the units are regional, often the young person may be admitted to a unit quite a significant distance from where he or she lives.  If we have well-resourced services in the community, this may reduce the need for admission but, more importantly, it will also facilitate earlier discharge.  When there is admission, there is obviously a very intensive treatment and support programme available to parents.  Families find the step down to community services to be quite steep.  Really it is sometimes very difficult for very stretched community services to meet the needs of these families, a factor which may prolong admission unnecessarily.  Children who are admitted to inpatient settings may also have complex needs.  Some delayed discharges may be influenced by deficiencies in other services, for example, community child and family services or the specialist disability services we discussed earlier.  There is a need to address resourcing within community services and to build up capacity at all levels.  Then we need to look at the inpatient setting.</p> <p>  We must address the problem of beds that have been provided not being fully operational and available.  The reasons for this clearly come down to issues of staffing.  We also need to undertake a needs analysis in respect of the number of inpatient beds that are required.  The Vision for Change report recommended that a review take place in this regard.  Comparison of bed numbers is often made only with the United Kingdom.</p><p>To make a comparison with other countries with populations equivalent to the population of Ireland, Norway has a slightly larger population than Ireland but has more than 300 inpatient beds.  Interestingly, its workforce in child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, numbers more than 3,000, whereas the total workforce in specialist child and adolescent mental health services in Ireland is 800.  In addition, Finland, Germany, Denmark and New Zealand recommend inpatient bed provision significantly above what is currently provided here.</p><p> A review must be undertaken to determine the need for inpatient beds.  We know secure inpatient facilities will come on stream and specialist inpatient beds are being developed as part of the new paediatric hospital.  Having been involved in building and commissioning an inpatient unit, I know that a long lead-in time is needed to bring inpatient services online because the facilities must be commissioned and built and staff need to be recruited.  We face challenges recruiting staff for the new unit in the new paediatric hospital. </p><p> To be able to provide the best inpatient service, we must be able to provide the best possible service at all levels.  The key must be that children access a service at a level that is most appropriate to their needs and do not have to attend specialist or inpatient services where this would have been unnecessary if the appropriate intervention had been available at another level. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-06a.1600" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. John Hillery" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2017070600002#G00300"><p>I thank all members of the Seanad committee for shining a light on a neglected area in the health service.  I am the president of the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland, the body statutorily responsible for training all psychiatrists in Ireland and ensuring the ongoing training and professional development of fully trained psychiatrists up to retirement and beyond if they are working in some way after they practise.</p> <p>  As doctors, all psychiatrists have undergone six years of medical training.  After this, they do at least four years of basic specialist training followed by four years of higher specialist training.  They may do several more years of training before they are entitled to apply for specialist recognition and, subsequently, for consultant posts.  They are, therefore, a group of highly trained individuals.</p> <p>  As previous speakers noted, psychiatrists are not applying for jobs in the Irish health service.  The first question we must ask is what employer running a business would have vacant posts which highly trained persons, whom the employer will have often trained, do not want to take up.  We must also ask whether the employer is asking why this is happening and I am not sure employers are asking those questions.  I am aware, however, that representatives of the Health Service Executive will appear later.  </p> <p>  The College of Psychiatrists of Ireland places a few regular messages in the public domain with varying degrees of resonance.  The first is the total lack of funding for mental health services in general.  Ireland falls far behind the countries to which Dr. Doody referred in this regard.  Approximately 6% of the national health budget goes to mental health services in general, compared with figures of between 10% and 14% in some of the countries mentioned by Dr. Doody.  The college has long called for the national budget given to mental health services to be increased progressively to 12%.  My colleague from the Irish College of General Practitioners asked about the 5% figure.  As I said to Dr. Doody, I am sure he would love to have 5% of the national health budget.  Unfortunately, he probably has less than 5% of the 6% of the national health budget that is allocated to mental health.  This is, as we keep saying, a scandal and I hope that message will go out from today's meeting.  Child mental health services need much more funding, as do mental health services in general. </p> <p>  Recruitment and retention has been a major issue since I have been involved with the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland.  The college has a manpower document, which lays out the needs for mental health services as regards consultant employment in 2020.  The issue, however, is not only one of having somebody in post.  I am the only person available in my current job, which means that if I want to take time off, there is a risk that the service will have to be closed down, which is not really possible, or we have to trawl around looking for someone to cover for me for a few days.  That is not an uncommon scenario.  Those of us in attendance who are in clinical practice are also stretching our time and our colleagues' patience because there would not be enough people in the system, even if every post were filled. </p> <p> The College of Psychiatrists has stated there should be 180 child and adolescent psychiatrists in post by 2020 to allow people to do their clinical work, take the leave they are allowed, attend forums such as this to inform people as to what needs to be done, take part in personal professional development and train other psychiatrists.  At the moment, we probably have between 80 and 90 posts and, as members will have heard, many of these are unfilled.  One of the reasons is that people who train in the system see what happens to people like me who are losing our hair and getting wrinkles and decide there is a better world than this, one where they can practise as a psychiatrist in a team with other health professionals.  They see their boss working alone without access to psychology and occupational therapy services and unable to take leave days when needed.  They know there is a better environment elsewhere because they will have heard from friends in Australia and Canada about the systems there.  This does not seem to be recognised.  I was told recently, for example, that the HSE considers the time a consultant should have for non-clinical work, by which is meant activities such as supervising a junior doctor, is two hours per week.  I have three junior doctors and I am meant to give them one hour of one-to-one supervision per week in addition to my supervision at clinics.  I am already well ahead of what the HSE considers allowable and my attendance at this meeting is pushing me into unknown territory.  We need people to act on the advice of the experts and we need to have more specialists in place. </p> <p>  There are simple issues around retention, some of which members will have heard.  One of the basic issues I have raised recently is that I have junior doctors who are not paid at times because they have not been registered by their employer to pay them.  Simple things are occurring in the public sector that no employer in the private sector would tolerate.</p> <p>  We heard also about waiting lists.  The college has pointed out regularly that there are children with very serious mental health issues on waiting lists with children who need educational assessments, assessments for anxiety and, as my colleague from general practice stated, assessments for the autistic spectrum.  These children do not need to be on waiting lists for psychiatry; they need primary care assessments.  Those who need secondary or tertiary care should then be allowed through the system to get this care. </p> <p>  I will conclude and ask Dr. Doyle, a former chairperson of our faculty of child an adolescent psychiatry, to continue.  As a practising psychiatrist in a rural area, Dr. Doyle will be able to give many examples of what is taking place.

I am here assisting Dr. John Hillery, president of the College of Psychiatry of Ireland, in my role as an executive member of the child and adolescent faculty of the college.  As Dr. Hillery stated, I am a former chair of the child and adolescent faculty.  I also served on the Mental Health Commission for a five-year period finishing in spring of 2017.  I am currently the secretary of the board of the European Society of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and, perhaps more important, I have been a practising child psychiatrist for the past 17 years in a rural catchment area.</p> <p>  Child psychiatry is a very young speciality in this country, with the first child psychiatry service established in 1963.  I echo the concerns already outlined regarding the percentage of the health budget designated for mental health.</p><p>A 6% spend on mental health as a proportion of the total health budget is scandalously low compared with other countries.  For example, in the UK 12% of the budget is allocated to mental health services.  In addition, A Vision for Change, the blueprint document published in 2006 in regard to the provision and development of all mental health services, advocated that 25% of the mental health budget should be designated to CAMHS.  As stated earlier, 25% of the population are under the age of 18.  The chronic underfunding and under-recognition of the importance of development of CAMHS is critical.</p><p> The most recent census of the Irish population indicated that there are 4.7 million people in this country, one quarter of whom are under the age of 18.  It should be borne in mind that the recommendation of A Vision for Change, which is more than ten years old, was based on a population of 3.6 million.  Briefly, what was advocated in A Vision for Change was that there would be 99 multidisciplinary CAMHS teams, headed by a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist.  Each team would be allocated 11 clinical whole-time equivalents for a population of 50,000.  Currently, there are only 64 multidisciplinary teams for CAMHS throughout Ireland and, on average, only 50% of the multidisciplinary staff are in place.  </p><p> In regard to the provision of appropriate child and adolescent inpatient psychiatric beds, the working groups emanating from A Vision for Change advocated between 106 and 116 beds for the population of 3.6 million.  Although there has been progress in this area, it is insufficient.  Currently, there is designation of 76 beds nationally but as of today only 48 of these are operational.  The public inpatient beds are located in Cork, which can currently only operate 12 beds; Merlin Park in Galway, which can only operate 20 beds and in Linn Dara, Cherry Orchard, which has two units of 11 beds each, one of which, unfortunately, from 1 June had to be closed due to lack of staffing, meaning its capacity is reduced to 11 beds.  There is another adolescent unit, St. Joseph&rsquo;s Fairview, which is currently operating at a capacity of six beds rather than 12 due to a consultant departing and another consultant job-sharing.  I refer to both St. Joseph's Fairview and Linn Dara and therefore, my ability to secure a bed for a person over or under 16 years of age has reduced considerably in the last couple of months.  </p><p> It is obvious that the capacity of the system to provide assessment, diagnosis and treatment and to manage the risk of severely ill, mentally unwell young people is not adequate.  It appears as though many people are not aware that mental health problems can and do present in our population of children and adolescents aged under 18.  The types of problems seen by the child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, anxiety disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorder, school refusal, generalised anxiety disorder, mood disorders such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorders, psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, and eating disorders.  The consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist is a professional who has completed medical training and has gone on to specialise in psychiatry and further sub-specialise in child psychiatry.  He or she has the knowledge and expertise by virtue of their knowledge of physical conditions in childhood, developmental issues in children, psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents and psycho-pharmacology, as well as the clinical risk assessment, to be the clinical heads and leads of multidisciplinary teams.  The complexity of the nature of some of the presentations to CAMHS, together with the risk inherent with many of these conditions, warrants leadership by a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist. </p><p> The college is aware that there should not be a reliance on the admission of children to adult psychiatric units.  A number of points need to made in this regard.  As outlined by many speakers, there is an inadequate number of child and adolescent beds for the population in need of them.  This means that in some cases a child or adolescent will have to be admitted to an adult unit because of the severity of his or her mental condition and the risk he or she poses.  In general, these admissions are for short periods, with the aim of transferring to an appropriate adolescent unit.  In some cases, capacity will delay this transfer.  In other cases, particularly in the case of older adolescents, parents will want them treated in their geographical locality.  I do not believe that people appreciate that often children and adolescents have to travel, on average, 100 miles to Dublin and back, to receive inpatient treatment whereas adults have a service in their local areas.  In some cases, for example, a 17.5 year old with acute paranoid schizophrenia and co-morbid substance abuse who believes all of the staff on a unit are trying to kill him or her, the staff of an acute adult unit may be far more appropriately trained to manage this young man or woman's complex needs and the risk that he or she poses to himself or herself and others.  In addition, he or she is likely to transition to adult services because of the nature of his or her psychopathology.</p><p> In regard to the issue of waiting lists for CAMHS, it would appear that the development of a single track of referrals needs to be dealt with as a matter of urgency.  Many children and adolescents are placed on waiting lists for CAMHS inappropriately due to the lack of development of primary care services and disability services.  For example, in my own area the number of primary care psychologists has declined from four when I started up my practice 17 years ago to only one.  Although it is outlined in their brief that they can deal with children with mild anxiety by providing a brief number of sessions, by virtue of the fact that the waiting list to see a primary care psychology is 18 months, the problems of these children and adolescents will have escalated to the extent that they then present with severe anxiety problems that need to be addressed by CAMHS.  A similar situation pertains in many areas around the county with regard to services for autism and autistic spectrum disorder.  In some cases, including in my area, there are waiting lists of up to four years for this population.  Many of these children are complex and will also have co-morbid psychiatric conditions and so they will be referred to CAMHS while their underlying condition, the autism, or ASD, will not be assessed or addressed. </p><p> A Vision for Change outlined a tiered approach to the complex needs of children, with primary care practitioners, such as GPs and public health nurses being the first port of call for identifying psychological difficulties in children.  Referral should then be to well-resourced primary care psychology services, which unfortunately have been seriously under-resourced.  If intervention occurred at this juncture, some patients would be referred on to the more specialist tertiary services of CAMHS but others would remain in primary care.  Another major deficit in service provision is for those children who present with emotional and behavioural difficulties due to learning problems.  The roll-out of the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, has been disappointing in terms of people being inappropriately referred to CAMHS. </p><p> I cannot emphasise enough the issue of recruitment and retention in CAMHS that already has been addressed.  A number of factors contribute to the ongoing crisis in this area, salaries being one, but as part of their contract, consultant psychiatrists are meant to assist with the development and progression of their services.</p><p>In many areas governance structures do not permit the voice of child psychiatry to be heard.  There is a lack of understanding of the clinical expertise, professionalism and training necessary to be a child psychiatrist, as well as a belief others can hold the risk and have this expertise.  The lack of respect for the professionalism and expertise of child psychiatrists has led to a decrease in interest in this career.  The lack of visibility of child and adolescent psychiatrists is clearly demonstrated in the disappointing fact that none was present on the expert group in the review of the Mental Health Act, despite many representations being made by the College of Psychiatrists.  The college has advocated for distinct and separate mental health legislation for children, compliant with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, the Mental Health Act 2001 and the Child Care Acts.</p><p> It is also disappointing that the new Mental Health Commission has no member from the profession of child psychiatry.  Given that children and adolescents constitute almost one quarter of the population, one wonders if it is reflective of a lack of concern for young people.  Once again, nominations from the College of Psychiatrists were sought and the president of the college wrote expressing concern that no child psychiatrist was a member of the Mental Health Commission.  The body is charged with inspecting, visiting and addressing quality issues in approved mental health centres and community services.</p><p> I thank the representatives of the Seanad Public Consultation Committee for providing the College of Psychiatry with the opportunity to address members on the current state of child and adolescent psychiatry services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-06a.1604" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Yvonne Begley" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2017070600002#J00200"><p>I thank the Seanad Public Consultation Committee for the invitation to attend.</p> <p>  In 1998 I was fortunate to get my dream job as a child and adolescent psychiatrist with CAMHS, child and adolescent mental health services, in Limerick, having trained in London and spent eight years as a general practitioner in Hackney.  When I arrived in Limerick in 1998, there were ten staff; now we have 66.</p> <p>  Fifteen years ago I set up a child and adolescent emergency system based on two simple principles.  First, a young person and his or her family, teacher or GP who needs to access our service should be able to do so on the same day.  The second principle involved continuity of care.  If a young person comes to the service in crisis and speaks to somebody about being suicidal, he or she continues to see that person who is his or her key worker until he or she recovers and is discharged from the service.  He or she does not have to tell three or four people his or her innermost thoughts and feelings.  He or she does not have to keep repeating his or her story.  They are the two principles that underlie our emergency system which is accessible between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday to Friday.  Out of hours, there are excellent crisis psychiatric nurses who will also see children and adolescents in Limerick University Hospital, as well as a 24/7, all-year-round consultant child and psychiatric on-call rota to ensure consultant expertise is available.</p> <p>  From my position as a psychiatrist in the mid-west for 18 years, if Senator Joan Freeman&rsquo;s legislative proposal that children no longer be admitted to adult beds is passed, my job will become a nightmare.  The last time I had a patient on the adult ward in Limerick, Ward 5B, was in April.  She was admitted, having lacerated herself with a Stanley knife and required 74 stiches.  She told me that if she went home, she would hang herself.  She was refused access to the usual inpatient admission unit we use in Galway, as well as units in Dublin and St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hospital.  Like every other patient I have admitted to the adult ward in the past 18 years, with the full consent of her parents and family, I admitted her to the ward until a more suitable alternative was found.  The nurses on the ward are wonderful.  They are kind, caring and human.  They actually cleared the gym and a little garden to allow the patient in question to have access without being bothered by any of the other patients.</p> <p>  What has not been talked about is the agony of seeing a member of one&rsquo;s family lose his or her mind.  The only reason a person is admitted is he or she is beyond reason.  Speaking as a mother, if one of my children was beyond reason and suicidal, I would be glad if the Ward 5B nurses helped me to detain them until they saw sense again.  I would not be complaining as they would still be alive.</p> <p>  People have spoken about the lack of money for our services.  It would be a way of improving the services we provide.  Another item of which we are short is managerial time and attention.  The current management body in the mid-west has no child psychiatrist on it.  The people whom I look after are in no position to talk about what is happening to them and their backs are to the wall.  They need advocates who can speak for them.  Child psychiatrists around the country need a voice in management circles.  I would like 25% of managerial time to be given to my service.  Limerick was the only place which did not receive an inpatient unit as recommended in A Vision for Change.  If someone would like to help us build one, we would be happy enough.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-06a.1605" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Eddie Murphy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2017070600002#J00300"><p>I am making this submission as a concerned citizen, the parent of two boys, Ois&iacute;n and Darragh, and a practising clinical psychologist, with over 20 years&rsquo; experience in health care.  I see and understand the negative impact of the lack of services and vision for children and adults with mental health difficulties, autism and disabilities, as well as their families and communities.  Mental health services are now where cardiac and cancer services were in the 1970s, namely, neglected, underfunded and tokenistic.  As the cancer services launch their third national cancer strategy, we are waiting for a first national strategy focusing specifically on children&rsquo;s mental health.</p> <p>  Having recently experienced the youth mental health task force, although well meaning, it was essentially tinkering at the edges of a broken system, akin to putting an engine on a paddle boat when what was needed was an aeroplane.  It underwhelmed, as well as lacking measurement, accountability, resources and, most of all, a vision.</p> <p>  Children&rsquo;s mental health needs to be seen beyond health care, a task that involves all of us.  It is a societal issue covering the areas of justice, health and education.  Garda&iacute;, dedicated teachers, youth services, statutory, voluntary and charity partners all play vital roles.  It is an equality issue, with vulnerable children at the brunt of social, educational and health inequalities and, particularly, the two great inequality challenges of 21st century society - health and housing.  It is about more than the absence of mental illness.  It is about services which offer positive well-being through vision, passion and authenticity to advocate for rapid access, quality-driven, compassionate and evidenced-based therapies which promote hope, optimism, mental fitness and resilience.  Effectively, services must be needs-led for children and their families.</p> <p>  I propose a vision which centres on three pillars, namely, children&rsquo;s centres of excellence with a one-stop shop and single point of entry; a needs-led step-care model and getting real about youth suicide prevention.  The current system is broken.  The dual track of CAMHS secondary care. on the one hand, and primary care, on the other, does not work.  Children, families and carers are overwhelmed in having to navigate fragmented health care systems and bounced around local services, creating delays and causing further distress.  Many times they fall through the cracks in service provision.  CAMHS is a secondary service.  It is the absence of appropriate primary care services, as well as school and community-based services, which exacerbates needs in CAMHS.  GPs are totally frustrated by the system of referrals for children and refer simultaneously to important, underfunded and understaffed CAMHS secondary care services and primary care psychologists, where they exist.  There are only 110 primary care psychologists.  Medical classification models which use the diagnostic and statistical manual, DSM-5, or the international classification of diseases, ICD-10, as the sole criteria for acceptance into CAMHS are too narrow.  They are not child or family-friendly or needs focused.</p><p> Children continually fall between the cracks.  Recently, Mary, a 15 year old child with depression and self-harming whose name I have changed, was deemed not unwell enough for a CAMHS service.  John, whose name I have changed also, who is on the spectrum with ASD and anxiety based issues, was not accepted in CAMHS and referred to a non-existing disability services where parents are overwhelmed and clamouring already in disability services for scarce resources and over the absence of intervention services.  I see this on a daily basis.  This is replicated right throughout the system.  The system is broken.</p><p> A radical rethink on how services are provided is needed for children and families.  We need to focus.  It is better to light a candle than shout at the darkness.</p><p> We need one stop, single point of entry children's centres of excellence with appropriate staff governed through a broader psycho-social model - not a medical model - to deliver child and family centred care services.  It would include psychologists, family support workers, child care workers, youth workers, play therapists, psycho-therapists, social care workers, medical staff such as GP, child psychiatrists, paediatricians and AMOs,  audiologists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, social workers, speech and language therapists.  If we want to build a secondary school in the morning, we have a model and we can go out and build it and deliver that within a year to 18 months.  We can deliver these appropriate centres if we have vision.  All the care needs - the physical, sensory, emotional, disabilities and mental health - need to be seen from these sites.  Significant strategic investment needs to ensure that these centres have family spaces, cr&egrave;ches, playgrounds, etc.</p><p> We need a single, open point of referral.  Currently, there is no seamless single open point.  If one asks any GP in the country, he or she is totally frustrated with the existing system.  GPs cannot get children into the non-existing primary care services or CAMHS services.  The CAMHS have raised the entry requirement so high, it is very difficult to get them in.  I note my GP colleagues nodding here.  They know it.  They are at the front line.  They see it every day.  We see it every day and we see families in distress every day.</p><p> If we are serious about children's mental health, we need to be serious about funding and resources.  Functioning and staffed children's centres of excellence needs funding and resources.  Currently 6% of health funding goes to overall mental health.  The corresponding figure is almost 13% in advanced economies.  This is why I am saying mental health is neglected, underfunded and tokenistic.</p><p> The next thing we need is a needs-led stepped care model.  That is what people are talking about.  A needs-led model would start by being population based.  Then it would be school based, with school guidance services.  If one can imagine it like a pyramid, the top of the pyramid is the inpatient unit or day hospital, the next layer under that would be a CAMHS service but we need to look at making it broader.  We need to look at the school based services, youth services, GP services and then primary care centres of excellence that encapsulate all of this.</p><p> With that stepped care model, one has a graded level of intervention appropriate to the needs of the child so that it is developmentally appropriate.  It delivers rapid access initial assessments to prevent the escalation of presenting difficulties and the subsequent requirement for specialist health care services.  We need to ensure that there is effective gate-keeping for specialist health care services and that way we will increase their capacity to see the most ill children.  It would improve continuity of care for service users via co-ordinating shared care activities with specialist services.  It would provide early intervention focusing on at-risk groups.  My presentation includes some other bits in that regard but I want to talk about getting real about youth suicide.</p><p> Rapid access to primary care services serve an important suicide prevention function.  For example, evidence indicates that many of those who complete suicide have prior contact with primary care staff.  It is critical that those individuals in distress can rapidly access primary care mental staff who can reliably evaluate risk and organise care to meet their needs.</p><p> We need increased access to psychological therapies.  Families are increasingly requesting more evidence based talk therapies.  We need to promote recovery focused partnerships.  A recovery focus for children needs to be adopted across children's mental health services, as in adult services where we ensure we are getting recovery focus.</p><p> It is important that we provide care in appropriate settings and provide emotional and mental health care outside of physical care environments, such as accident and emergency, on a 24-7 365 days-a-year basis once the person has been medically assessed.  We need to increase access.  People typically engage, and by increasing next day access, we will achieve greater traction  and a faster turnaround for individuals.  Important quick actions would include the need for a focus on well-being, early intervention and prevention, enhanced well-being and mental health.  We need to progress with passing the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015 because alcohol and gambling impact significantly on Irish society.</p><p> We need to address the issue of children and families who are in direct provision, which is Ireland's new industrial schools outrage.  We need to support families by prioritising affordable and quality child care services.  We need to get a helicopter view on this and to get away from the issue of beds.  We need to look at how we are delivering mental health care and wellness and well-being for our children.</p><p> We need to prioritise disability, autism and emotional support.  There is nothing new there.  There are children waiting two years or four years haphazard around the country.  It is important that children with disabilities get supported.  Otherwise, they or their families are impacted with significant mental health needs.  In education, we need a full restoration of guidance counsellors and to deploy more counsellors to secondary schools, and provide life skills for primary and secondary school teachers.</p><p> Finally, there is the issue of legacy.  I encourage the committee to think strategically and highlight the need for new thinking for 21st century services for children and families.  The 1916 Proclamation refers to cherishing all the children of the nation equally but a line often forgotten is that the Republic declares its resolve to pursue the happiness of all its citizens.  Let us have children's centres of excellences based in communities, appropriately funded and staffed, with partnerships with parents and children so that our children get the best physical, sensory, emotional, mental and psychological care where and when they need it.  That is the measure of a society and the legacy I want for my children and all children in society.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-06a.1608" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gareth Noble" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2017070600002#K00300"><p>I thank Senator Freeman for the invitation to address the committee as part of this ground-breaking initiative in identifying the challenges children and young people confront in accessing appropriate mental health services.</p> <p>  This day and period ahead is long overdue for families throughout our great Republic who have been affected by the challenges arising from a mental health crisis within their homes and communities.  It has been too late for some but is an opportunity to assist so many others.</p> <p>  I address the committee as a solicitor who acts for children and young people and their families in a range of welfare cases.  Through my work over ten years, I have witnessed at first hand the challenges families face in accessing mental health services at times of trauma and crisis.  I have spoken to and advocated for many children directly who struggle with their mental health and well-being.  I have collaborated closely with front-line staff employed by the HSE, Tusla and other public bodies which recognise and share many of the frustrations families and young people experience.  Those committed people working within depleted services and dwindling budgets are in many individual cases heroic in their endeavours but they are also burnt out and the recruitment and retention of such talented committed and caring people is now also at crisis point.  There has developed a culture within many parts of our mental health services of fire-fighting, but the fire has started by the time most children are seen and its often beyond the point of recovery by the time the problem has been identified and addressed.</p> <p>  The seminal document in reforming Ireland's mental health strategy published in 2006, the year I qualified as a solicitor, was entitled A Vision for Change.  The strategy aimed to modernise our system and ensure better co-ordination and improved practices.  As I reported to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs last week, I regret to say that this vision has not progressed at a rate that meets the demands and challenges placed upon services.  The recent suspension of 11 beds from Linn Dara in west Dublin for inpatient care for children was accompanied almost with a resigned and collective shrug of the shoulder rather than with the urgent intervention at the highest levels that was required.</p> <p>  The Ireland of 2017 is one where 2,419 children and their families are currently awaiting a CAMHS appointment.  Some 218 of these are waiting more than a year and 762 more than six months.  This is a country where 15 of our counties remain without an out-of-hours and a weekend crisis service.  Those of us who do provide a 24 hour service know only too well that most incidents occur after 5 p.m. and during weekend periods.</p><p>This is a modern progressive western democracy and yet 67 children were admitted to inappropriate adult wards in 2016.  I strongly welcome and support the publication of a Bill by Senator Freeman in December 2016 to provide that no child under the age of 18 years is placed in an adult psychiatric unit.  As far back as November 2006, the Mental Health Commission issued a code of practice relating to such admissions.  This code was intended as a transitionary model of care pending the ending of such a practice by 2011.  The year 2011 came and went, as did the following years and now we are in 2017.  It is my view that such a continuing practice is a potential breach of many legal rights instruments, including Article 24 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and indeed our own Constitution, in respect personal rights guaranteed by Article 40.3. Article 43 and most recently by Article 42A.  At an European level, the practice of detaining children in certain adult wards could well constitute a breach of Article 3 of the European Convention of Human Rights, which<i>inter alia</i>prohibits degrading treatment.  Article 8 of the same convention promotes and provides a right to respect of one's private and family life.  There are serious legal issues which arise out of this continuing practice.  Our nearest neighbour in the United Kingdom has moved beyond us in providing a legislative basis for discontinuing such a model in line with best practice.<br/><br/>Adult psychiatric facilities are challenging and difficult environments, populated by very vulnerable individuals who often present with a range of mental health concerns.  Some exhibit huge levels of distress and on occasion can be physically threatening.  Such situations are difficult to manage and deal with for all concerned.  Yet we are demanding that dozens of our most vulnerable teenagers each year cope with these placements and recover in them.  I have seen many examples of young people returning home, having been exposed to such environments and being lost for ever.  Effective recovery can only happen within the confines of a dedicated, safe and appropriate facility.  The refrain from some who should and do know better is this: some bed is better than no bed.  Are we so lacking in ambition, resolve and a rights-based approach that this is the best we can do?<br/><br/>I have spoken to many families and young people who talk about the sense of loneliness, rejection, fear and isolation in adult psychiatric facilities, often far from home.  In contrast I visited adolescent facilities, including the service provided by Mr. Gilligan.  In those contexts and in those care situations I have seen at first hand how young people supporting one another do so within a context where their care is managed by appropriate specialists in adolescent care, and where that sense of fear and isolation can be massively mitigated.  We have a moral, political and legal duty to these children and this Bill is a crucial first step in achieving outcomes for children in situations of crisis.<br/><br/>This Bill may ultimately involve some timetabling and a need for staggered commencement orders to ensure staffing levels, protocols and facilities are available.  Those timeframes need to be identified and they need to be short.  They need to be driven by the same thirst for delivery as is present on the ground and in what this Bill sets out to achieve.  Let the passage of the Bill proceed on those child-centred values, rather than on the pre-manufactured and restrictive concepts of ifs, buts, savers, exceptions, derogations etc.<br/><br/>Aside from the scandalously long waiting times for appointments for CAMHS there is also the lack of further CAMHS operating reports since 2014.  This is a cause of massive concern and is despite the fact that annual reports were envisaged by A Vision for Change.  Many CAMHS teams are excluding many young people from their services because they do not fit within the increasingly strict confines of their criteria and we find an increasing lack of flexibility in relation to same.  Children with a dual diagnosis who experience mental health concerns but are also on the autism spectrum, for example, are not being provided for in a manner that has due regard to their needs.  This non-inclusive approach to children with autism who experience mental health difficulties is something to which meaningful recognition must be given in any proposed national autism strategy.<br/><br/>Children between the ages of 16 and 18 years are often referred to as being in the Cinderella age in accessing mental health services, too old to avail of adolescent care and too young many other services.  While children at the age of 16 years can often provide consent for general health services and procedures, it remains a grey area in respect of psychiatric care and interventions.  Paediatric emergency departments are often accessible to children under 16 years, therefore the emergency presentation of children between 16 and 18 years occurs at adult hospitals, most if not all of which have woefully inadequate child psychiatry cover.  Officially CAMHS refers to services being provided for young people until they reach adulthood.  On the ground, however, referrals being accepted for children beyond their 16th birthday are virtually non-existent.  Given that in 2010, 16 and 17 year olds constituted 68% of inpatient hospital admissions, the provision of care for this age group remains woefully inadequate.  A full review of CAMHS services and priorities for this particularly vulnerable age group is required as a matter of priority.<br/><br/>The Government must lead in clearly identifying the terms of reference and areas of responsibility for each part of our mental health service, resource it and demand reporting mechanisms and protocols for accountable delivery.  It can no longer be left to the HSE to dictate the rules of engagement.  Such an approach since 2006 has demonstrably failed our children in crisis.  Notwithstanding these many great instances of hardship, doors being closed, never-ending battles and burgeoning waiting lists, I have great hope and reason to be optimistic that the tide is turning in our endeavours to deliver for children.  I am genuinely excited by the efforts by so many that are ongoing and are leading to real change.  In 2012 I was asked by a small group of parents from across Ireland who had come together through the medium of Facebook to provide legal advice, advocacy and support.  The DCA Warriors group was created as an online forum to lobby for change on behalf of parents and families who had children with additional needs, a disability or a specific life challenge.  When I was approached by that group in March 2012, they numbered just over 200.  As of yesterday evening, the number has grown to 14,152 and they are growing.  Many of their stories relay shocking instances of State neglect in assisting parents as carers.  I am seeing increasing numbers of cases where the mental health needs of children are deteriorating sharply and a rapid response to those presentations from State supports are simply not there.  Those brave warriors are not going anywhere.  Their bravery, resilience and fortitude should inspire us all.  I could spend the rest of today highlighting examples of their successes in reversing adverse decisions made in respect of their children.<br/><br/>I met a grandmother from the south of the country recently.  She took her hands in mine and she very quietly told me that the greatest challenge her family faces is ensuring that their very vulnerable teenage family member makes it through each day alive.  When we as a country strive to assist those who get up early in the morning, let us also strive to ensure this approach includes those who do not get to bed at all at times of crisis.  I refer to those who seek to secure the life and welfare of their children without appropriate support, respite or service provision, those families who remain on high alert and maintain a vigil, sometimes on shifts with other family members, sometimes carrying that burden alone to carry on fighting for their loved one, caring for them and willing they survive, never mind thrive.  It is an intolerable position for so many.  It is so far removed from child-centred approaches to policy making and policy delivery that it beggars belief.  <br/><br/>This committee has demonstrated in its support for the public consultation process a proactive approach to leading a conversation on the specific requirements of a modern mental health service from the perspective of a child.  Statutory obligations regarding children refer to the rights and needs of the child being of paramount consideration.  Using this as our guiding principle, we need to develop policies and services that truly do put children first.<br/><br/>The Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2016 is a vital first step in progressing the rights of children.  It requires cross-party, cross-departmental collaboration in ensuring its safe passage and subsequent implementation into law.  Families and children across Ireland will look back on this period with great regard and great pride if we all work together to prioritise children's mental health and if we walk that walk together.</p></speech>

I have three very brief questions, but beforehand I would like to address Dr. Begley.  The Bill is also inclusive of exceptional circumstances.  Her patient sounded like an exceptional circumstance but may I add that I am a little bit concerned with what she had to listen to when she approached two or three units and they said that they did not want to take the patient.</p></speech>

My second question is to Mr. Gilligan.  I have visited mental health services all over the country and there seems to be a disconnect between public and private, or independent, services.  Why is there a disconnect and what does Mr Gilligan suggest we might do to improve the situation?  My third question is to Professor McNicholas.  I am stunned to hear that the beds she mentioned are not included in the emergency beds for children out of hours.  To be honest, it frightens me.  Could she elaborate a little on that, particularly as I am not sure that everyone understands the importance of her remarks?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-06a.1617" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1430" speakername="Colette Kelleher" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2017070600002#M00200"><p>I thank all of the 14 witnesses for their different perspectives.  The bit of conflict is also helpful.  We are not all in agreement and there are different ways of addressing child mental health.</p> <p>  I was struck by Dr. O'Shea's and Dr. O'Brien's presentation, which drew our attention to the structural and societal reasons driving child mental ill health.  They referenced the work of the Deep End group in particular.  There is more mental ill health among poor children.  The 2,700 children living in emergency accommodation have not had a good start in the context of their mental health journeys.  The 1,200 children to whom Dr. Murphy referred who live in direct provision and the children who live on halting sites without access to basic services, such as running water in some cases, have not had a brilliant start in life in the context of their health and well-being.  There was a young person from a LGBT background who spoke of the particular challenges they face and how those challenges manifest.  Then there are people with disabilities and there are people with autism who do not fit into disability supports.  I like the idea of a deprivation index and was shocked to hear that in Finglas in Dublin 15, where I started my life as community worker, there is not a child psychiatrist.  That seems both shocking and amazing.</p> <p>  On a more positive note, there was synergy between Dr. Murphy's and Dr. Petitbon's presentations regarding a one-stop shop, based at a particular level.  I was involved in something similar when I worked on the Sure Start programme in England.  When I walk around London now, I see children's centres so I do not think that what Dr. Murphy is suggesting is a pipe dream.</p> <p>  I have two questions.  I agree with the recovery model to which Dr. Hillery referred.  In the absence of this kind of walk-in service for primary care and the lack of services in CAMHS, is the use of medication discussed?  There are many doctors in the room.  Is medication something that is used in the absence of anything else?  What are the witnesses' views on medication for children and those under 18 years in general?  I have particular views but I would like to hear those of the witnesses, as doctors.  We want the radical rethink about which Dr. Murphy spoke.  If there was one thing that witnesses could insert in the report, they might let me know.  However, I am most interested in their views on medication.</p></speech>

This is the Seanad at its best; it is the people's Parliament.  The witnesses represent the people, as do we.  They come from a different perspective, however,.  It is critical that all of us here can be proud of how this Parliament - the people's Parliament - is addressing an issue of such importance.  I also acknowledge the professional values which are clearly enunciated by the witnesses, as professional people at the coalface.  I do not intend to ask too many questions, although I do have one or two.  I acknowledge the work done by Senator Freeman, the rapporteur, in co-ordinating this.  She started this morning by saying that we want to have the truth and to have a truthful conversation.  We have had that in buckets.  I acknowledge that and thank her for it.</p> <p>  The witnesses have an advocacy role, as do we.  I looked at A Vision for Change when preparing for today's meeting.  I paid particular attention to the foreword, which was written by a former colleague of mine and then Minister of State with responsibility for mental health, Tim O'Malley, who is based in Limerick, and thought about how little has been done since 2006.  On behalf of the then Government, the former Minister of State set out a clear policy in a clear document.  How little of that has come to fruition.</p> <p>  Today, we have heard witnesses outline a litany of problems and huge challenges for the sector, for politicians and policymakers.  The practitioners here clearly have a thirst for change and its delivery.  I have three questions for them.  While the witnesses engage with us, it is important that we engage with them in order to ensure that the process is meaningful.  Can someone explain why we have seen a continued increase in suicide among young males?  That is important.  A number of people spoke about the recruitment and retention of staff.  Can they provide an example of how that can be improved and how we can incentives the services to retain very capable and important staff?</p> <p>  Someone observed that 16 and 17 year olds seem to be overlooked in this service.  Do the witnesses feel that we need a stand-alone service for 16 to 24 year olds and would it alleviate the pressure?  Finally, there was a proposal for a national mental health service directorate.  What are the witnesses views on this?  Is there a need for specialist national mental health service directed with authority and accountability and controls which would be resourced.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for once again shining a light on this very important issue.</p></speech>

Some of them indicated a long time ago but we are only getting there now, so I ask them to bear with me.  I will take two others and return to the witnesses.  Senator M&aacute;ire Devine is next.</p></speech>

It is our second full day of hearings and our eyes have been opened.  I have spent a lifetime as a psychiatric nurse and I know the ins and outs and intricacies of it all.  As my colleague observed, recruitment and retention are important.  I would say to Dr. Doody that the events relating to Linn Dara highlight the shambles - in its entirety -that is our child and adolescent mental health services.  Every day, I plead with the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, to place the response to this matter on an emergency footing.  There are solutions available.  There are solutions in respect of recruitment and retention, including fast-tracking and putting in place acting clinical nurse specialists.  I say that as someone who comes from a nursing background.  These are imaginative solutions, as are those relating to education support and housing.  The closure of 11 beds at Linn Dara should never have happened.  As a result of the closure, there are now only 48 beds available for children and adolescents.  This is the cause of so much sadness for parents and children who are waiting for access to those services.  We have the capacity to place the response to this matter on an emergency footing.  That is what we should have done; we should not have waited.</p> <p>  Can Professor Kelly say what a typical Friday night in Tallaght hospital is like when there are no inpatient beds available and when it is necessary to admit a child to an adult unit?  Can he speak of the admission process and what he has to do?</p> <p>  My alma mater is St. James's primary school, where I have been involved in listening to the input of people from St. Patrick's Mental Health Services, the Department of Education and Skills and other organisations into a programme called Mission Impossible.  The programme starts in junior infants and the proposal is to give 600 hours of well-being to children from first to sixth class.  I want to ask the witnesses from St. Patrick's Mental Health Services for their perspective on a programme that seems to be achieving great results.  The programme relates to the education aspect of this issue, as well as to matters involving housing and health.</p> <p>  On the review of the Mental Health Act and the emphasis on children in their own right, will the representatives from the College of Psychiatrists in Ireland say how we might begin this as soon as possible in order to help and enable our children?</p> <p>  Finally, I commend Dr. Murphy.  He spoke from the heart and gave us the step programme for children's and adolescents' mental health.  I commend him on doing so and I am delighted that he used my phrase, which was used by the leaders in 1916, about the pursuit of our happiness.</p><p>Happiness is a central element of childhood.  When we think of that, we think of children jumping, laughing, screaming, crying and fighting.  All of that is childhood.  It is so finite; we do not have it for long.  I commend the witnesses and I believe they make great sense.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaibh.</p></speech>

D&eacute;anfaidh m&eacute; i mB&eacute;arla &eacute;.  I thank Senator Freeman, in particular.  This has been hugely important and is way overdue.  It is the first time anything like this has happened in these Houses, as my colleague, Senator Victor Boyhan, has said.  I have a couple of quick questions.  I made a lot of notes on what the witnesses said.  I will ask for their general opinions and views to help us draft the document that will be led by my colleague, Senator Freeman.  I also have two specific questions.</p> <p>  First, I noticed a huge amount of frustration and despair as well as the witnesses' willingness and desire to do their job professionally.  I also noticed that the witnesses are under serious stress in trying to do their job and are really struggling to get their job done for a couple of reasons.  One of those reasons is the blockage with regard to access.  There is no joined-up thinking.  There are huge issues with regard to staff.  Dr. Hillery, in particular, highlighted that.  He has to find the time today to fill up the gap of work he has to do, which still does not fill up his week's tasks.  Other issues include the out-of-hours CAMHS and the lack of electronic medical records.</p> <p>  With regard to solutions, I want to check with the witnesses to see if I have this correct.  This came up during the session last week as well.  Primary care teams and primary care centres seem to be critical to this.  I would concur with what Senator Devine said to Dr. Eddie Murphy about that triangle.  I did a triangle out and at the bottom of it is community.  I want to get the views of the other experts on that.  Community has got to do with primary care and schools.  It is not good enough putting an ad on television costing &euro;200,000 or &euro;300,000 that tells people to talk to somebody.  That is absolute rubbish and slightly disingenuous to say the least, as well as a waste of good money.  The second part is about inpatient facilities.  The third part of it is about emergency care.  The triangle is turned upside down.  Do the witnesses agree with that?  I would like to hear their views on how we can influence Government to turn the triangle and have it working the right way up in the short, medium and long term.  In regard to the long term, the witnesses mentioned A Vision for Change.  That is more than ten years old.  The witnesses are fighting a fire that is growing bigger and bigger.  I believe the witnesses and their colleagues are getting seriously burnt in that fire.</p> <p>  I have two questions for Dr. Brendan Doody.  The generic inpatient units cannot meet the needs of a fraction of young people.  How does the witness see a way to change that?  What is his short, medium and long term recommended strategy for that?  He mentioned the admission to an adult unit takes place where there is a clear clinical imperative and that many factors contribute to this.  What about the lack of qualified staff?  That seems to me to be priority number one.  The first thing I thought of is that if we do what we always-----</p></speech>

Senator Freeman asked about changes from the perspective of general practice and what would we do if we had a magic wand.  We are looking at this as a clinical pyramid.  Much of the conversation is focused at the top end of the pyramid.  Extreme cases involve suicidality and the suicide of young male adolescents.  These are really important aspects of it.  If we want to impact the health of the community and the nation, we will target resources into the middle and the bottom part of the pyramid into the less severe spectrum and at an earlier stage in the process of complex histories.  If we had a magic wand in general practice, we would have some more general practitioners in the system and a lot more practiced nurses in the system.  These are the health care professionals who are the most accessible for children, adolescents and their stressed parents.  These are the health care professionals who live in closest proximity to the community.  We think we are very skilled in terms of generalisms and provide generalist care.  We are confident, based on best international research, in particular from the United States, Canada and the Commonwealth countries, that investment in primary care and community medicine pays huge dividends in the long term.  There are analogies in education.  Every &euro;1 spent on children under five years of age gives a &euro;15 or &euro;20 return in the long term.  If that &euro;1 is spent on children between ten and 15 years of age, we get less of a return.  We need to put the resources into the communities.</p> <p>  A second observation in response to Senator Freeman's question is that, again, when we are looking at resources based on small area research, whether secondary care, primary care or CAMHS, we need deprivation weighting.  We know that our colleagues in the HSE have an expertise in small area health research.  We would recommend that this is reflected in whatever it is decided to do.  We also recommend the onset of smart medicine.  It is a curious society we live in.  Adolescents are perfectly at home with electronic media.  Health care professionals, the health services and, in particular, secondary care services are seriously uncomfortable with it.  All over our society we do very clever things with smart media, social media and so on.  We need electronic medical records and better interfaces with the demographic we are trying to serve.  This is not now expensive.  It has become far more reliable and has become accepted in more advanced health care systems than our own.</p> <p>  Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh asked about primary care teams and centres.  The ICGP has a very well thought out position on this.  We have been talking about them since 2001 when Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin launched the health strategy.  Our colleagues in the HSE have a perspective on it and the ICGP has a different perspective on it.  It is a fact that the composition of the primary care team has no mental health professional on it.  That is incredible.  The ICGP regards primary care teams with some degree of hope, but they are not functional.  We have similar feelings towards primary care centres.  In effect, in the whole body of general practitioners, we have not been able to effectively engage with primary care centres.  We will go back to the drawing board in the interest of the well-being of this demographic.  In the interest of all our patients, we will talk until the cows come home.  They are not working.  That is the message of the ICGP on primary care teams and centres.  We reiterate some of our other recommendations that a strand of child and adolescent mental health services should be integrated into GP co-operatives.  I will stop now because we are well into injury time.</p></speech>

It should be embarked on with caution.  It is not any sort of solution for adequate talk therapies, whether that is family therapy, counsellors or psychologists, who should be located in general practices.  If the primary care centres are working, they should be located there.  They should not be located 20, 30 or 100 miles away.</p></speech>

Would he like to make a brief comment or answer the question?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-06a.1643" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Brendan Kelly" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2017070600002#N02300"><p>The point about anti-depressants is an interesting one.  Generally speaking, Ireland is a low-medication society.  We are on the EU average for anti-depressants in adults.  In children, the rate of prescribing anti-depressants was 4.7 per 1,000 in 2002.  That fell over subsequent years to 2.6 per 1,000.  It is important that medication is only used when appropriate and, when indicated, always as part of a broader treatment plan.</p><p> With regard to Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh's comment, I support the idea of the pyramid very strongly, and our comments focused on the top of that pyramid.  That is the part that one is involved in professionally, and as a citizen and as a parent one is aware of the need for intervention in schools and of the sociological awareness that deprivation is a huge driver of distress at population level.</p><p> With regard to a Friday night in an emergency department in a hospital, as a general adult psychiatrist on call, I have been in all the major hospitals.  One would commonly see a 16 year old or 17 year old child who presents with a very distressed family, possibly following self-harm or an overdose.  His or her medical needs are attended to by the emergency department staff but then comes the difficult part, which is dealing with the underpinnings of what brought that child to this point.  The emergency departments in our hospitals are busy and noisy places.  I have always been impressed by the way the staff try their best to accommodate the emotional and psychological needs of children and families, but they can only do so much.  I see the person, or the junior doctor might see the person, and if the child or young adult requires inpatient care, we embark on the search for a bed.  It is not always the case that they need inpatient care as the vast majority do not.  We seek a bed in a child and adolescent unit.  When a child might need to be admitted to an adult unit, we need to fill out a statutory Mental Health Commission form detailing the efforts we made to find a bed in an adolescent unit.  We try to phone every single one in the country during the middle of the night.  I might be in at 2 a.m. and spend three or four hours on the telephone trying to see if there is a bed but knowing in my heart that if I am in Dublin and I do identify a bed in Cork, it is very unlikely that it is the right move for the patient or the family.  It can be very difficult at night to do that anyway, and it is under that kind of circumstance where there is no other alternative that a child is admitted to an adult unit.</p><p> I share the experience of my colleague, Dr. Begley, in that I have been impressed by the adult psychiatry staff's efforts to make special bespoke arrangements for any admitted child, but it is a fact that most of the admissions do not meet the requirements in terms of educational provision for children or separate occupational therapy for children.  We do it in the circumstances described and it has always been with the support, as it were, of parents or guardians who appreciate that this bad option is the best of the bad options.</p></speech>

The first is the law.  The college has asked that there would be a specific law relating to children because they are different from adults and also the current Mental Health Act does not have a human rights approach to children in that they do not have the same protections as adults under the law.  We feel that should change.  My colleague already said how we did not have an opportunity to give direct feedback into the development of the recommendations for a new law.  We hope we will get more of a chance in the future.</p> <p>  As regards recruitment for medicine, the MacCraith report which came out in 2014 gives very clear and practical guidelines on how to ensure the doctors we train here stay here and how the doctors we employ here continue to practise here rather than leaving the country.  We have called on many occasions for the HSE to implement the report, which is a very good report, in several stages.  It was recently backed up by the report of Professor Frank Keane and his group looking at recruitment and retention of the medical workforce in Ireland.</p> <p>  As my colleague, Professor Kelly, has said, medication has its place.  We do not support its use when it should not be used.  I could add to that though that we do see patients presenting with a need for medication because they did not get intervention at an earlier stage of the course of their illness, which might have prevented them reaching that stage.</p> <p>  As regards suicidality, we could have a whole week on that here.  Obviously, people who are experiencing suicidal ideation and suicidal intent need appropriate psychiatric assessments, but we also know that for young people there is the issue of societal exclusion and how we deal with that.  There are simple things that could be done through the Oireachtas to improve inclusion of young people.  We have a lot of national organisations that are working very hard to do this.  Some of them are subject to taxes, which take some of their money away.  I speak of sporting organisations, for instance, and it should be quite simple for the Oireachtas to take steps to ensure our community organisations are not penalised financially for the work they are doing, often done by volunteers but they are still having to pay rates and other things for buildings where they try to bring young people and get them involved in things.  The big issue, other than mental illness, is exclusion from society.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-06a.1646" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Gilligan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2017070600002#O00300"><p>I would like first to deal with the question asked by Senator Devine.  One of the things that the independent sector can do that perhaps the statutory sector cannot is engage in different projects and fund things that may be difficult to fund.  One of the biggest issues for young people is stigma.  Presenting to a mental health service is very difficult.  It is something we have not talked about today.  There are many initiatives but St. Patrick's Mental Health Services has been able to develop initiatives, some directly focused on anti-stigma, one called Walk In My Shoes and another called #MindYourSelfie, all appealing to the technology savvy generation.  The Senator spoke a little bit about Mission Possible, which is a school-based initiative that has been very successful.  It is very important to acknowledge that if we can deal with stigma and address awareness, we will increase the number of people who seek help earlier.</p> <p>  The second question was asked by Senator Freeman.  Historically, there has been a disconnect between the independent private sector and the statutory sector.  A Vision for Change did not envisage a role for the independent sector.  While that has changed significantly in the past ten years, there is much more work to be done on that.  At the moment there are many examples of co-operative work and working together, but it is not strategically planned and it tends to be demand-led.  We would like to see a shift in that.  If there is one thing I wish to emphasise it is that in the report it would be important to write in a role for and place an obligation on the independent private sector because we are up for this.  We believe we must all work together - the voluntary sector, the independent sector and the statutory sector - to address what is a very serious problem.</p> <p>  I will finish by asking my colleague, Ms Gogarty to just give one example.  It will be very brief.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-06a.1647" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Orla Gogarty" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2017070600002#O00400"><p>I wish to cite an example of how we can work in a very functional and progressive way with our colleagues in the Health Service Executive.  It is probably not a known fact that as an independently governed organisation, we probably have some more freedoms that, as Mr. Gilligan mentioned, statutory services do not have.</p> <p>  In my role as director of development over the past two years, I have had numerous approaches by local CAMHS services, very challenged and stressed business managers and executive clinical directors, who are struggling with critical gaps in resources, in particular the roles of consultant psychiatrists in CAMHS.  I wish to cite one example where we worked towards a very functional arrangement that is still in place with CAMHS in the Sligo-Leitrim area where we provide a triage, which is often one of the first issues.  If we can triage the services and get people to the right area, then we do not have them languishing on waiting lists that do not need to be there.  They could be pointed to the appropriate primary and community services.  We provided assessments in 2015, 2016 and 2017.  We provide follow-up care through our consultant psychiatrist and psychotherapy services.  We helped the service manage a waiting list that was causing it, families and communities incredible distress and concern.</p></speech>

I will be brief.  It comes as no surprise to me that only 3% of the health budget is spent on general practice, which facilitates 25 million consultations per year with a satisfaction rating of greater than 95%.  It also comes as no surprise to me but it saddens me that for the first time ever in the history of the State, GP training posts this year are unfilled.  There are just 171 GP trainees embarking on a career in general practice.  The training programme will take four years.  I do not know how many of them will qualify or how many of them will stay in Ireland but what I do know is that 900 GPs will retire over the next five years.  That will have a direct impact on the provision of mental health services in this country.  General practitioners are excellent at diagnosing mental health problems in adults and young people.  They are the first port of call.  They are the foot soldiers in the community.  That is why I believe the lack of GP trainees will have a direct impact on the provision of mental health services.  The Minister and the HSE need to address the elephant in the room and to resource the sector adequately.</p></speech>

It would be a good idea to have one psychologist shared among three or four practices.  Sometimes there is an overemphasis on the bricks and mortar of primary care centres rather than on the activity within those centres, and this needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  I call on the Minister to facilitate a rapid access 24-hour CAMHS referral service for general practitioners.  We heard stories from parents last week and the common theme was that every parent ended up in an emergency department with their child.  That is improper.  A 24-hour rapid access referral service to a CAMHS team would prevent children attending emergency departments unnecessarily.  It would not be abused.</p></speech>

The biggest challenge facing society is the adverse consequences for the welfare of many children posed by alcohol.  Drug and alcohol abuse are key features in this report and they have a damaging effect on children.  The failure by society to address alcohol as a fundamental problem places insurmountable problems on the child protection system.  It is not just about Tusla and garda&iacute; but society and our ambivalence to alcohol and substance abuse.  One in four deaths of men aged between 15 and 39 in Ireland is due to alcohol and it is a factor in half of all suicides in Ireland and over one third of deliberate self harm cases, peaking at weekends and public holidays.  What are the answers to this issue?  It plays a huge role and there is very little talk around it.  The witnesses gave great presentations and I would like Dr. Eddie Murphy to talk a bit about this.  Perhaps some of the GPs could also respond.</p> <p>  I work in this area with families impacted by alcohol.  When one parent lives with another who is an alcoholic the stress, anxiety and mental health issues are off the Richter scale.  They cannot be present to their children and their children end up looking after the other children in the family.  It is devastating.</p></speech>

I appreciate what Senator Freeman has done in this area.  I want to try to be present in these families where there is a disintegration of hope and I acknowledge the frustrations of staff working in the services.  We are dealing with a crisis but we have to set up supports for people's health and well-being which are more than just health services.  They must involve a community environment for children and young people.  Tomorrow week the Government will launch a national disability strategy implementation plan to move forward the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and this includes mental health.  It will be interesting to see how well or otherwise it deals with this topic.  I have seen many children and young people with chronic health issues and life-threatening and life-limiting conditions.  Co-morbidity, mental health and well-being issues come down like a cloud on top of children and their families.</p></speech>

The Government does not wake up in the morning and decide to make people's lives miserable by cutting the budget for mental health services.  We are coming out of a very severe recession and these discussions are about seeing how we can go forward as a group, rather than giving out about budgets.  I regularly speak in the House on mental health issues and the rights of people with disabilities and I have regularly spoken on the need for CAMHS services in the midlands.  I have a 21 year old with mental health issues who was sent to hospital in an ambulance and sent home again in a taxi 12 hours later, at 10 p.m., so I know what everybody else knows.</p> <p>  My father used to talk about there being too many chiefs and not enough Indians and there seems to be an awful lot of managers.  There seems to be an enormous lack of procedure and of joined-up thinking in the services, which would have led to the 21 year old child of whom I spoke being sent home in a taxi.  There are not enough front-line staff nor enough psychologists or primary care teams.</p> <p>  Dr. Hillery spoke about retention and salaries.  Can he tell me how the salaries of a psychiatrist and a psychologist compare?  What about psychiatrists here and their counterparts in the UK?  Can he also tell me what the figures are for retention in the UK as compared to here?   </p></speech>

Let me give my opinion because I wish to put my frustration on record.  In 2011, I made my maiden speech to the D&aacute;il on the issue of suicide.</p><p>I lost six close friends over many years for different reasons.  While some of them may never have been saved, the questions I want to ask today concern access to service.  When somebody confides in a community leader, whether it is a chairperson of a GAA club or a For&oacute;ige leader, to where do those people turn to give that young person access to the supports and the services he or she so badly needs?  I do not see it.  I am very frustrated.  I know that a large amount of money is being spent on mental health services but we are not using it efficiently.  </p><p> I want to focus on primary care.  The general practitioner's practice is already a very busy environment and it can be hard to get an appointment.  How can a resource be put into primary care to support the GPs and the practice nurses when a patient presents?  If a local volunteer is struggling to deal with a young person with suicidal ideation, possibly over the weekend, how do such people access the service or refer someone?  How can we specifically put a resource in there to assist those people?  These are the resources and the supports we need.  We can talk all day and all night but how can it be put in place at the coalface in order that people can access the services the witnesses provide and then try to link in and cross-cut the various Departments and supports?  </p></speech>

I mentioned only one hospital but there are three in Dublin.  Liaison psychiatry provision is not mentioned in the recent national mental health document.  Child psychiatry services in paediatric hospitals are not funded by the mental health division but from the acute hospital budget.  They are piggybacking on other services.  If I was cynical I would say that perhaps they are best left hidden.</p> <p>  There is a broader picture about collecting data on mental health cases in general.  My colleague alluded to the idea that if we do not have the right facts we are not going to be able to find the solutions.  Numbers are counted in respect of how many go through but no effort is made to look at complexity, the clinical treatment offered or the outcome.  My larger concern is that the difficulty in understanding what is done by CAMHS is mirrored by the committee's concern about GP practices and other infrastructure and the need to provide more resources for those.  All of that definitely needs to happen but we are talking about community services including alcohol use, societal issues and housing problems, which are indicative of the primary interventions that are needed to optimise mental health and well-being in order that the small number who actually have psychiatric illness and who require very specialist services will actually get them.  Our understanding was that today the committee's focus was to be on the issue at the top of the pyramid.  We would, of course, like both to be resourced and consequently it is new and separate funding that should be considered by the Government.</p></speech>

To echo what Professor McNicholas said, what we are dealing with is mental illness.  When I became a doctor I wanted to answer the questions of why people get ill, why people get cancer, why one person might catch a cold and another does not.  The fact is that illness exists.  I am a doctor and I treat people who are ill, and some of the people who complete suicide are ill and need to see a doctor or access a medical service.  If I asked a consultant surgeon to look after children with appendicitis and I would not give them an anaesthetist, an operating theatre or any theatre nurses but a room in the hospital somewhere in which to provide care for their patient he or she would resign on the spot.  If we take away what little access to beds we have when we are on call - many of my colleagues will not cover the on-call rota any more because they will be left looking after someone who is ill - to answer that question, there is no way to treat them and no resources.  I agree with Professor McNicholas that everybody in the country knows how to do my job better than I do.  Everybody talks about what is required to stop people getting mentally ill.  I was a general practitioner and was looking for an inoculation that stopped people from getting mental illness.  After 25 years as a psychiatrist I actually take my hat off to mental illness.  It exists, it is real and it needs treatment.  It does not need counselling or play therapy.  Those things are very important for other kinds of problems.  Mental illness needs medical treatment and psychiatric treatment in the right place with the correct staff and the correct resources.</p></speech>

The number has dropped with the Linn Dara unit having to reduce its capacity.  The number of currently available beds is less than 50.  On the issue of staffing and being obliged to close beds, I want to reassure the committee that everything that could possibly have been done within the service to ensure that those beds were kept open was done.  They were kept open for as long as it was feasible to do so, and it is hoped that the closure will be for the shortest time possible.  It is hoped the beds will reopen in October.  While the unit was operational after it opened on schedule in December 2015, its bed occupancy was between 90% and 100%.  That is also the current rate of occupancy.</p> <p>  I was asked about the range of inpatient services.  All the 76 beds that are currently available are what would be called generic or open units.  Inpatient services require not just those units, but also low and medium-secure units.  This was acknowledged within A Vision for Change.  A specialist eating disorder unit is also required.  Those units are in development.  The eating disorder unit will be part of the new paediatrics hospital and it will be a number of years before that will be available.  The hospital will also have an eight bedded generic inpatient unit.  There will be 20 additional beds on stream with the completion of the new national paediatric hospital.  In the interim, a particular challenge has been that we are seeing increasing numbers of children with eating disorders being admitted into the generic units.  On average, one third of our beds in our unit are occupied by young people with very severe eating disorders at any time. </p> <p>  I was asked what are the consequences of the absence of these units.  It means that some young people have to access medium-secure psychiatric services or specialist inpatient eating disorder services outside of the State.  That number is lower but it will remain the case until those services are available.  A secure inpatient facility is being developed in Portrane as part of the redevelopment of the national forensic services.  There is a ten-bed adolescent secure unit to be developed.  We are looking at a timeline of about three years before that unit is open.  There are plans to develop these units.  </p> <p>  To increase the capacity to support children with eating disorders, a clinical treatment programme was recently launched with a plan to roll out specialist community eating disorder services, which will be quite intensive and will have both outpatient and intensive day-patient components.  That is what is happening in the interim but the absence of secure beds also means that some young people will be admitted or remain in adult units.  One must remember that to admit a young person onto an open unit we must bear in mind the therapeutic milieu of the unit.  We may have young people on that unit who are 13 and 14 with anxiety disorders and eating disorders.  We have to remember the impact of admitting a very unwell, disturbed young person onto that and we have to think about the impact on other young people.  Other young people on the unit may feel quite threatened by that and feel unsafe, which might have an impact on their own treatment programme.  When we are looking at admitting, the whole issue of placements must be considered.  </p></speech>

In fact, our clients ask for it.  In particular, when working with children we cannot not use such therapies.  There are alternatives such as art therapy or pet therapy which are completely non-existent here in Ireland.  To answer Senator Kelleher's question, when she asks what one thing should be reported in the document, I would say that if psychiatrists feel that they are not being heard by the State, and psychologists less so, psychotherapists feel they are completely non-existent.  Therefore, please include our voice.</p></speech>

It is important that there is a requirement for one-to-one and day-hospital visits in the step-care model; children do get mentally ill, but there is also a focus on those services in primary care.  I support the provision of psychology services in primary care and not at the network level service.</p> <p>  Approximately 70 psychologists, from the three branches of clinical, educational and counselling psychology, are trained in this country every year.  It takes approximately eight years to be trained as a clinical psychologist.  That is three years of undergraduate study, two years of master's study and then a three year professional doctorate programme.  One of the ways to look at the provision of psychology services is in primary care or at children's centres of excellence, which include all our other colleagues such as physiotherapists and occupational therapists, where we can capture children with disabilities, autism spectrum disorder etc. coming through as well as those with mental health issues.</p> <p>  There has been a creeping casualisation of the alcohol culture in Ireland over the past 20 to 30 years, and it has a significant impact on youth suicide, self-harm and mental health.  Some specific proposals on this would concern advertising, purchase price and having specific areas for its purchase that would nudge people rather than it being in their faces when they are in shopping centres.  For example, a person can buy alcohol when getting fuel for the car now.  This casualisation is really inappropriate and I support the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.</p></speech>

First, I reiterate what was just said about alcohol.  It is clear that we have a national psychopathology around alcohol.  If I say that when I was a medical student I drank Lough Erne and that I met my wife in a pub with a whole load of pints on me, everyone would smile indulgently.  However, that needs to stop.  We need to stop smiling indulgently.  We have to get to grips with this because it is an avenue to mental health that is staring us in the face, and it is most particularly the case with vulnerable people in vulnerable communities.  It is one of the great scandals that we have not addressed as a community.</p> <p>  Another speaker asked what They a GP needs at the point of presentations.  need time.  The usual GP consultation takes ten to 15 minutes.  More often, in poorer areas, it is ten minutes.  What does anyone think  a GP could address in ten minutes?  It is very little.  A specific time needs to be aside.  People do this.  There are heroic efforts to which they go to provide the time to people.  As Mi Angelo used to say, people will forget what you said.  People will forget what you did.  But no one will ever forget how you made them feel.  This is the essence and the kernel of a good general practice service.   We need more GPs, practice nurses and psychologists.</p> <p>  Another speaker asked what GPs need at the point of presentations.  They need time.  The usual GP consultation takes ten to 15 minutes.  In poorer areas it is more often ten minutes.  What does anyone think could be addressed in ten minutes?  It is very little.  A specific time needs to be set aside, and people do this.  The efforts to which some people go to provide the time to people are heroic.  As Maya Angelou said, "...people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but no one will forget how you made them feel".  This is the essence and the kernel of a good general practice service.  For that, we need more GPs, practice nurses and psychologists. </p> <p>  There is one last point that I need to make.  It concerns entry to general practice and the disappointment voiced at the fact that we did fill our quota of GP training places this year.  The ICGP is in charge of the interview process for it.  We interviewed more than the allotted numbers and we offered more places than the allotted numbers but the acceptances were less than the allotted numbers.</p></speech>

I tell Senator Black that the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland, like the College of General Practitioners, welcomes the Taoiseach's statement that the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill will be passed by the end of the year.  That would be a major step forward from the point of view of mental health.</p> <p>  As regards Senator McFadden's question, the NHS has the same problems as we have about recruiting consultants.  What is happening here and in the NHS is that agency staff are being used to fill long-term gaps, and agency staff get paid more than the consultant salary.  I really cannot speak to how psychologists negotiate their pay.  That is totally separate from my remit.

In the afternoon session, we will hear from representatives of State and official bodies.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome from the Office of the Ombudsman for Children Dr. Niall Muldoon, Ombudsman, and Ms Naomi Kennan, policy adviser.  From the Department of Health, we have the recently appointed Minister of State with special responsibility for mental health and older people, Deputy Jim Daly.  From the HSE's mental health division, we have Mr. Jim Ryan, acting national director, and Dr. Philip Dodd, national clinical adviser and clinical programmes group lead on mental health.  From the Mental Health Commission, we have Ms Patricia Gilheaney, chief executive, and Dr. Susan Finnerty, inspector of mental health services.  From the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, we have Dr. Matthew Sadlier, consultant psychiatrist, and Mr. Cian O'Dowd, policy and international affairs officer.  From Tusla, we have Mr. Jim Gibson, the chief operations officer who is present in his capacity as acting chief executive in place of Mr. Fred McBride, who is on leave, and Ms Patricia Finlay, service director for Dublin and mid-Leinster.  We also have Professor Joyce O'Connor, chairperson of the expert group on mental health policy, which produced the policy A Vision for Change.  The witnesses are most welcome and I thank them for engaging with the committee in its consideration of this important and sensitive topic.</p><p>Before we begin, I must draw witnesses' attention to the following procedural matters.  This is housekeeping, so to speak.  I advise witnesses that, by virtue of 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also advise the witnesses that the opening statements that they have submitted to the committee will be published on its website after the meeting.</p><p>To commence proceedings, I invite Senator Freeman to make a few introductory remarks.  I will then invite each witness to make a short presentation to the committee.  Witnesses may share their time with a colleague if they so wish.  They should please indicate this when they are invited to speak.  Given the large number of witnesses attending this session, I ask that presenters keep their opening statements as brief as possible.  I suggest five minutes.  When the presentations have finished, there will be time for questions and comments from the Senators and responses from the witnesses.</p></speech>

I hope that he comes to this position with fresh ears and that he will not listen to all of the previous arguments that have been plied to questions on mental health services for children.</p> <p>  I also wish to say "hello" to Mr. Jim Ryan, whom I have met several times.  I admire his dedication and hard work and that he is committed to working in this area.  Last week and this week, however, we have tried to paint a picture of the reality of what mental health services for children are like.  The only analogy that I could come up with was to describe the people present - the Ombudsman, the CEO from the Mental Health Commission, the parents who are in the Public Gallery and those who provide our services - as a body and the HSE as the doctor.  We are dying.  It is not that this does not matter to the HSE witnesses on a personal level, but they do not seem to hear us.  Mental health services are dying.  Until the HSE witnesses and everyone else who is present today can tell the truth, then we cannot fix the problem facing us.  This morning, I asked for truth.  I am asking for the same this afternoon.  Then we can work together.  There is no need for anyone to be defensive.  We are all trying to make this work.  I am asking the witnesses to help us by telling the truth about what the services, the HSE and the Department of Health can and cannot do.</p></speech>

I wish to start by acknowledging the moving contributions made last week by parents and young people, including Ms Arianna Gallagher, who are clearly struggling with their mental health issues and the impact of them.  What it clearly showed to me was how we are failing these families and children who are in so much pain.  The first principle of medicine is to make sure one does no harm, and I wonder whether we are doing harm even with the services we are providing.  We know, as a community, that we really need to take stock when we are allowing more than 60 of our children, our adolescents, to go into adult units in the psychiatric services.  Anyone visiting these units would know there is an environment and an atmosphere in them that can be tense and incline towards violence and which is just uncomfortable for anyone.  For children already at their wits' end and suffering from serious illness, it is not a good place to be.  The average stay is about four weeks, which is a long time for a person in the wrong place, and we really need to start moving on from that.</p> <p>  I commend Senator Freeman on the introduction of her Mental Health (Amendment) Bill.  We very much welcome it and look forward to its passage through the Houses.  We must acknowledge that it will not be the cure to all our problems but we will certainly support it.  The conversation Members started last week in the Seanad and earlier today is very much needed, and I am very hopeful it will lead to real and significant change for children and their best interests.</p> <p>  We have made a submission to the committee on the key areas we feel need attention and we will not go back over them today but we want to highlight a few key issues.  When we got together to prepare this presentation, we felt that our recommendations all rolled into one key recommendation: if we can put the child at the centre of children's services and, every time a decision is made, base that decision on such an approach, we will improve our system no end.  The services provided for children need to go to the children who need them when they are needed and in the way in which they need them.  This is not what is happening at present.  At present, the child must take what the system can offer him or her and make do with what is available.  This all depends on where the child lives, the primary care support systems available and whether there is a psychiatrist in the area and it can depend on a range of other factors.  However, the last thing it depends on is the child's needs, and this is where we have gone wrong and what we need to get back to.  The child is doing all the adapting and all the compromising, the family is driving hither and thither and it is just not working.  We need to change it as quickly as possible.  Children should not have to wait until they reach breaking point, self-harm or suicide attempts, generating physical manifestations of their mental ill health, before they get some kind of help.  That is just cruel.</p> <p>  As a nation, we committed to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child 25 years ago to promote and protect children's rights and we followed this up with a very strong statement when we put children's rights into the Constitution in 2012.  This means that the vindication of these rights is not just something we would like to do, but also something we are obliged to do as a State.  Children's rights and children's perspectives should have been protected much more when the economic crisis hit.  That is what children's rights mean.  The Government, when the economic recovery came about, should have protected and raised children's services much more quickly than it did, and the fact that it did not do so is to its eternal shame.  Children have not been prioritised in a way that would lead one to believe that children's rights are at the heart of Government decision-making.</p> <p>  As I have already mentioned, putting children at the centre of mental health services is vital.  We need to talk to them, consult with them and get their views.  This is a basic, fundamental change that needs to come about in any new legislation that derives from this work.  When one hears a child in the mental health services, one is doing more than just hearing the child's views; one is also promoting them at a time when they feel at a low ebb and feel no one is listening to them or hearing what they are going through.  One is giving them an opportunity to feed into their service and change the service.  In this regard, we recommend, as part of the review of the A Vision for Change policy, the creation of a new A Vision for Change for children alone.  We need it to be more than chapter 10 of a large work; we need it to be a stand-alone piece of work in order that it has a specific timeframe and a specific implementation plan.</p> <p>  The role of consent is an issue we have come across regularly in our office.  Even last week, we saw that professionals at the national youth task force consultation were not able to agree as to whether consent from one parent or two parents is needed when a child is under the age of 16.  The interpretation of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act also needs to be clarified because there is still uncertainty as to whether a child of 16 or 17 can consent to treatment.  Some will allow this; some will not.  Again, it is clarity that is needed, and these are crucial matters, especially for children with eating disorders or children who may have to get care outside of the State.  The issue of consent is crucial in these areas.</p> <p>  The issue of children with mental health issues has been a strategic objective for my office since I entered my position.  I spend much of my time going around the country meeting children, whether going to Pieta House events or Cycle Against Suicide events, children's well-being weeks in schools or mental health weeks.  I am passionate about raising awareness of mental health and supporting young people to come forward when they need help.  I think we are getting there.  As a society, we are talking about mental health more, encouraging our children more and getting further down the line in allowing them to open up.  However, we are also in danger of calling them out of the shadows only to leave them exposed in the sunlight because we do not provide the services they need.</p> <p>  As a psychologist, I am acutely aware of the positive work that can come with early intervention and with work with children in even the darkest places as a result of mental health.  I have worked with children who have suffered serious damage and am always inspired by the power of the human spirit to flourish and heal from even the greatest traumas once children are supported correctly.  It is even more amazing to behold a child or young person who begins to blossom and emerge from a deep darkness caused by damage to his or her mental health.  We very much need early detection and intervention to improve our children's service.  I suggest we need universal, accessible, evidence-based prevention and early intervention services, and they need to be provided at primary care level and across all communities in order that there is no inequality depending on the area in which one finds oneself living.</p> <p>  Communication and collaboration is another issue we have had, and I will give the committee examples of this.  We have had numerous complaints about CAMHS teams refusing to take referrals from other CAMHS teams when a child moves house.  This is a systems issue.  We have had numerous complaints about children being referred by one psychiatrist to an adolescent bed in a residential unit and being sent back because there is a disagreement over the diagnosis.  This is a systems issue.  We have had numerous complaints to the effect that children are attending one accident and emergency unit and spending a number of hours there only to be told they are too young to be there.  The committee heard about this last week.  They are told they are too old in one hospital and told they are too young in another.  This is a systems issue.  This is a matter of adults worried about their criteria, diagnoses and rules, and the child is forgotten about.  This can be changed immediately.  It does not need money but a cultural change.  Individual areas, regions and units often have separate priorities and guard their patch with little or no thought to the child affected.  I suggest that putting the child front and centre in the decision-making would not lead to any cost increases in many cases but would be more a cultural change and put respect for the child in a paramount position.  I believe that the majority of energy and resources should go into primary care services to help children as early as possible.  However, CAMHS is still a vital part of the solution and needs to work much better.</p> <p>  I met with the previous Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people, Deputy McEntee, and we discussed this issue.  She highlighted to me that there are 15 so called "unfillable" psychiatrist posts around the country, some of which have been vacant for over five years or are hard to fill on an ongoing basis.  Any proposed legislation or policy ideas must take on this issue, must find a new way of doing things and must be creative.  Some of the questions I would ask are as follows.  Is it only about pay and conditions?  Is it about involving other professionals earlier in the process?  If we cannot recruit child psychiatrists to these "unfillable posts", should we consider having other professionals lead the teams?  In other countries, some categories of nurses and psychologists have prescription rights.  Could this assist us in building up our teams?  Could paediatricians stand in for psychiatrists on occasion, perhaps to cover accident and emergency situations or during leave?  We should not need our young people to be at breaking point before they can access help.</p> <p>  We know from all the statistics the committee has heard that we have a huge job of work to do, and this consultation could not be more timely.  Nelson Mandela said: "There can be no keener revelation of a society's soul than the way in which it treats its children."  This should be our mantra in all the work we do for these children.  These are some of the most vulnerable children, the most vulnerable people, in society.  How they are treated and the experiences they have now will have massive implications for their future and, consequently, massive implications for our society.  They will become our teachers, politicians and policymakers.  They have much to offer our society and how we treat them now is vital.</p> <p>  I again commend those parents and young people who came forward last week bravely to tell their stories.  I hope they will be be vindicated by decisive action on behalf of the Government to make real changes in this area.</p><p> I commend Senator Freeman and the committee on tackling this extremely important issue.  Please be aware that the Ombudsman for Children and the Office of the Ombudsman for Children are totally committed to supporting the committee in any way we can.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important public consultation.  We all share a common desire to have the best possible mental health policies and services for children and adolescents nationally, while taking account at the same time of the practical realities involved to effect further improvements.</p><p>There is no doubt that mental health remains a priority for the parties, organisations and individuals that have participated in this consultation process.  I understand that advances to mental health care in recent years as well as improvements still called for have been highlighted in the presentations and discussions of the committee.  I fully appreciate the genuinely held concerns raised here.  I assure those present that their considered views will be heard and that I, the Department of Health and the HSE will take heed of the outcome of the work of the committee.</p><p>A cornerstone of this Government's overall health policy is to enhance all aspects of mental health care.  This is reflected in the programme for Government and is high on my agenda as Minister of State.  I wish to take this opportunity to acknowledge the progressive roles played by my various predecessors and, notwithstanding the obvious challenges remaining, to build upon their achievements.  Despite severe pressures on our public finances over recent years, steady and measurable progress has been made to develop mental health services.  Significant investment has been undertaken thereby allowing a fundamental shift away from a static institutionalised and hidden care system to realising a modern and responsive service.  Change is taking place spanning all fronts and across all age groups from enhanced community based care to forensic mental health for children to psychiatry of old age.</p><p>A core difficulty we now face is not funding availability <i>per se</i>but, rather, wider issues surrounding the recruitment and retention of mental health professionals.  This can lead to the temporary closure of children and adult mental health services beds, such as occurred recently at Linn Dara in Dublin, especially given the need in such circumstances to balance safety and quality issues against staff availability.</p><p>Overcoming staff retention difficulties is obviously core to improving care and access to care.  We also need to clearly plan and deliver services in a better way to meet evolving demands and circumstances.  This includes better prevention, early intervention and inter-agency approaches in future, thus ensuring the best use of either specialist or wider care resources.  We cannot take advances for granted and, therefore, we need to refine policies, legislation and services.</p><p>Since 2012, approximately &euro;140 million has been added to the HSE mental health budget, which, this year, totals close to &euro;853 million.  This is a significant funding commitment by any standard and the Government intends to increase the mental health budget annually as wider circumstances allow.  Core to implementing A Vision for Change has been the approval of over 1,500 new posts since 2012, including those approved for CAMHS.  A balance has been struck between acute and community-based care and the pace of change has gradually gathered momentum at local level.  In particular, all efforts have been made to ensure that new posts are of the type required to transform our mental health system in the light of increasing and future demands.</p><p>The mental health priorities for 2017, as agreed in the HSE service plan, spans much-needed improvement across counselling services, enhanced community mental health teams and improved 24-7 response and liaison services.  Work is also ongoing in the areas such as psychiatry of later life, perinatal mental health, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults and children and dual diagnosis of those with mental illness and substances misuse.  Again, this reflects many of the issues raised with the committee.  The HSE is also addressing other key issues highlighted, such as age-appropriate placements, reducing waiting lists and a more standardised approach to service delivery nationally.</p><p>It should be noted that the placement of those under 18 years of age in adult units has reduced considerably over recent years.  Where this arises various factors such as geographic location, expected length of stay and age and wishes of the young person and their families all play a role.  In addition, the HSE takes special measures to ensure the safety of the young person in such placements.</p><p>Other developments designed to relieve system pressures include 60 additional student psychiatric nurse places coming on stream during the period 2016-2017, along with a further 70 to follow in 2017-2018.  In addition, the HSE is offering all graduating nurses permanent contracts.  In line with a Government commitment to develop early intervention mental health services for those aged under 18 years, approximately &euro;5 million has been allocated to HSE primary care, of which &euro;3.4 million will fund 114 new assistant psychologists.  This will enhance response at that level and help to address CAMHS pressures overall.</p><p>A significant development in the mental health sphere is the recent commencement of construction by the HSE on the new multimillion national forensic health service capital project at Portrane to replace the Central Mental Hospital at Dundrum.  This long-overdue initiative comprises a 130-bed new main hospital along with a new ten-bed forensic CAMHS unit and a new 30-bed intensive care rehabilitation unit.  The main development includes ten beds specifically catering for mental health intellectual disability.  The new modern complex will greatly transform our forensic mental health services when it opens in early 2020.  A new intensive care rehabilitation in particular will be key to alleviating pressure across the wider mental health and judicial care systems.</p><p>A priority for me is to progress the work of the national task force on youth mental health established by my predecessor as Minister of State, Deputy McEntee.  This is focused on changes to improve communities working together at a local level and services working together at national level.  It has been designed to draw on the experience of many quarters to enhance supports for young people and to otherwise promote resilience and emotional well-being.  The task force has undertaken a recently completed series of youth consultations and a national consultative forum has convened in June.  Many of the participants who have come before the committee had an input in some way to the task force reflecting at least some of the issues raised here.  Above all I want the outcome of the task force to be realistically based resulting in real improvements.</p><p>Mental health services are obviously shaped by factors beyond pure funding, including prevailing legislation and policy.  The recent strategic direction in Ireland has been underpinned by A Vision for Change, complemented on the suicide front by Connecting for Life.  I am progressing the context we are focused on today, that is, a review of A Vision for Change, in tandem with changes to the Mental Health Act 2001.</p><p>While fundamental principles and approaches will broadly remain unchanged, various aspects of legislation policy and services arguably need to be re-nuanced in light of experience and identified future challenges.  In refining policies and services I will advocate strongly for better prevention and early intervention, improved access, more person-centred care and recovery orientation.</p><p>Senator Freeman recently introduced the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2016, the aim of which is to limit the admissions of children to adult psychiatry units by allowing them to take place only in emergency circumstances.  As I said when I spoke on Second Stage of the Bill in the Seanad, the issue is not about whether we need to reduce these admissions but rather about how we go about the change to best effect.  A change in legislation certainly has a role to play in this regard and I look forward to working with Senator Freeman and others on exactly how we should frame the terms of such amending legislation.  Deputy James Browne has introduced a Bill in the D&aacute;il that seeks to improve the circumstances for children who require inpatient psychiatric treatment.  While it is not ideal to amend the same legislation in two Bills at the same time I hope that, with goodwill on all sides, we can reach an accommodation that we can all live with.  It is clear that collectively we still face many challenges irrespective of our political grouping or individual view and notwithstanding recent significant progress realised over a relatively short time.</p><p>In the interests of one of the most vulnerable groups in our society, the work of this committee is a valuable contribution to the immediate and longer-term priorities required to improve mental health care for young people.  As I indicated already, I will give full consideration to the outcome of this process such that we can minimise differences, maximise progress and continue in a responsible and effective way to achieve what needs to be done.</p></speech>

The division acknowledges that a broad range of services support the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents.  The term "CAMHS" - or "child and adolescent mental health services" - is applied specifically to services that provide specialist mental health treatment and care to young people up to 18 years of age through an approach involving multidisciplinary teams treating moderate to severe mental health disorders.</p><p>CAMHS is only one part of a larger health system that addresses the mental health and well-being of young people.  The system includes services at primary, secondary and tertiary care levels.  As a specialist service, CAMHS sits within the secondary and tertiary care levels.  The mental health division is committed to working with its partners and stakeholders, in primary care and social care in particular, to develop a comprehensive range of services to support the mental health of children and adolescents.  Actions in this regard include the continued investment in and development of Jigsaw Youth Mental Health Services across the country; the HSE mental health division has allocated resources at primary care level to recruit 120 assistant psychologists to develop early intervention services for young people, with the likely impact of reducing inappropriate CAMHS referrals; working collaboratively with the SpunOut youth website to improve information on understanding and accessing CAMHS; joint working protocols between key HSE services are being developed to assist teams in collaboratively supporting young people with complex needs who require an input from a variety of specialist teams across mental health, primary care and social care services, as well as services for people with disabilities; and contributing positively to the national task force on youth mental health in readiness to implement the HSE's mental health division's specific final recommendations</p><p> It is generally accepted that, although A Vision for Change made clear recommendations for the provision of resources for CAMHS, they have not yet been fully realised and current capacity falls short of what is required.  Despite a net increase in CAMHS staffing, from 622 in 2010 to 842 in 2015, most community CAMHS teams across the country are operating at 50% of the level recommended in A Vision for Change, this despite significant investment in CAMHS in recent years and intensive staff recruitment efforts.  Mirroring the position across the health service in general, staff recruitment is a significant challenge, in particular nursing and medical recruitment.  Attracting consultant psychiatrists to work in CAMHS is especially challenging, with many citing pay and conditions as a reason for seeking employment in other speciality areas or jurisdictions.  The underdevelopment of CAMHS teams and staff recruitment problems together significantly contribute to the development of long waiting lists for assessment, inadequate out-of-hours CAMHS services and inappropriate use of acute admission services.  This is in the context of significantly increased referral rates.  Between 2010 and 2016, referral rates to CAMHS increased by 63%, while the referrals accepted by CAMHS also increased by 66%.  </p><p> On the availability of CAMHS out-of-hours services varies across the country, currently they are available in about 73% of the country.  This is a service improvement priority for the division.  There is inadequate provision of CAMHS acute admission services.  A Vision for Change recommends a total of 106 in-patient CAMHS beds, with ten secure beds and eight beds to support the treatment of patients with eating disorders.  There are four CAMHS acute admission services in Ireland, with a maximum capacity of 76 beds available.  If beds provided by private health care providers are included, there is a national provision of 102 beds.  However, within the public system there are currently 48 beds operational.  The remaining 28 are closed due to staff shortages.  There is a specific staff recruitment campaign under way to address this particular staffing issue, with improved service availability expected by September 2017.</p><p> On service development, plans are in place to provide an additional 30 beds, including secure beds and beds to provide specialist eating disorder treatment, but they are not due to be online until 2021.  Even within the service development plan, there remains a lack of further specialist CAMHS acute admission services such as for the specialist treatment of children with an intellectual disability and a significant mental health problem.  As a result, the existing generic CAMHS acute admission services are sometimes tasked with providing highly specialist care in a generic service setting which can result in further service pressure associated with potentially delayed discharges.</p><p> A direct consequence of these challenges is children being admitted to adult acute admission units.  The decision to admit a young person to an adult unit is not taken lightly and it is always done as an absolute last resort when no other option is available.  In making the decision to admit, the safety of the young person is paramount and the decision follows a clinical risk assessment of the young person concerned.  There can be a number of factors that influence the decision, including an acute illness and failed attempts to secure a bed in a CAMHS acute admissions centre.  A decision to admit a young person to an adult unit must be notified to the Mental Health Commission and be in accordance with its code of practice.  In addition, the HSE mental health division is also notified of all such admissions in order to assist in expediting a transfer or discharge from the adult unit as soon as practicable.  </p><p> On admission, the young person concerned is allocated a qualified mental health nurse on a one-to-one basis whose sole responsibility is to support the young person during his or her admission.  Where possible, he or she is supported in a quiet area of the adult ward away from other patients.  The priority of the treating team on the adult unit is to support him or her in having access to the appropriate CAMHS team as soon as possible in order that an appropriate care plan can be developed, possibly involving transfer to appropriate CAMHS or children&rsquo;s services.  </p><p> On the characteristics of these admissions, the numbers are falling; admissions are becoming shorter and mainly made up of young adolescents.  In 2010 there were 163 admissions of young people to adult units, compared to 68 in 2016.  Of the admissions in 2016, 88% were of young people aged 16 or 17 years, while 62% of all young people admitted to adult units were discharged within three days of admission.  This compares to a figure of 41% in 2015 and 34% in 2014.  </p><p> While the HSE mental health division is tasked with developing and providing CAMHS in a difficult operating environment, as I have outlined, it remains committed to supporting the development of high quality integrated mental health services for young people in a spirit of partnership with key stakeholders and as part of a whole system approach to supporting young people&rsquo;s mental health and well-being.  Specifically, the division is committed to achieving a further reduction in the number of admissions of young people to adult acute admission units, although it acknowledges that, in exceptional circumstances, the practice may be required to continue in the absence of appropriate CAMHS acute admission capacity and in the context of less than optimal CAMHS provision.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-06a.1706" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Patricia Gilheaney" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2017070600002#CC00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and committee members for their kind invitation.  The Mental Health Commission welcomes the spotlight the committee is placing on children&rsquo;s mental health.  I am joined by my colleague, Dr. Susan Finnerty, Inspector of Mental Health Services.  We intend to share the time available to us.  I intend to address the submission from the Mental Health Commission to the committee on the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2016.  However, I do not intend to detain the committee by going through the detail of some of our technical suggestions.</p> <p>  The Mental Health Commission is an independent statutory body established pursuant to the Mental Health Act 2001.  Its principal functions are to promote, encourage and foster the establishment and maintenance of high standards and good practices in the delivery of mental health services and take all reasonable steps to protect the interest of persons detained in approved centres.  The commission regulates the provision of inpatient mental health services through inspections carried out by the Inspector of Mental Health Services and her team and registration, ongoing monitoring and enforcement.</p> <p>  Since its establishment, the commission has been unwavering in its view that children should be admitted to age-appropriate facilities.  Certain provisions of the 2001 Act apply to children and it is in that context that the commission welcomes the invitation to comment on the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2016.  The principles underpinning the Act are enshrined in section 4 which refers to a person and, as such, is applicable to a child.  Section 4 relates to the making of a decision under the Act concerning care and treatment.  Section 4(1) states the best interests of the person shall be the principal consideration, with due regard being had to the interests of other persons who may be at risk of serious harm if a decision is not made.  Section 4(2) provides for the statutory duty in relation to any proposal to administer treatment to a person to properly notify such person of that proposal and take due account of his or her representations before making any decision in that regard.  Section 4(3) further states that in making a decision concerning care and treatment of a patient, due regard shall be had to the need to respect the right of the person concerned to dignity, bodily integrity, privacy and autonomy.</p><p>Section 23 of the Act makes provision for the detention of a child who is a voluntary patient in an approved centre but whose parents, or those acting <i>in loco parentis</i>, indicate a wish to remove the child but the child is still suffering from a mental disorder.<br/><br/>The sole section of the Act that relates exclusively to children is section 25, which makes provision for the involuntary admission in certain circumstances of children suffering from a mental disorder.  Involuntary admission of a child is only possible by way of a District Court order pursuant to section 25 of the 2001 Act.  Section 25(14) of the Act refers to provisions of the Child Care Act 1991 that apply to proceedings under section 25 of the Act.  Such sections relate to procedural matters that are taken into consideration when an application under section 25 of the Act is made to the District Court.<br/><br/>Section 26 relates to the granting of leave and section 27 provides for the voluntary admission of a person, including a child, to an approved centre.  In summary, the sections of the 2001 Act that relate to the admission of a child are sections 23(2), 23(3), 23(4), 25, 26, 27 and 29.<br/><br/>The commission actively engaged in the review of the Mental Health Act 2001.  It was represented on the steering group established in August 2012.  In addition, members of the commission&rsquo;s legislation committee met the chair of the expert group.  Following publication of the expert group report, the commission submitted its views.  The report contains 165 recommendations.  Recommendations 111 to 123, inclusive, relate specifically to children and are as follows.<br/><br/>Provisions relating to children should be included in a stand-alone part of the Act and any provisions of the Child Care Act which apply should be expressly included rather than cross-referenced.  A child should be defined as a person under 18 and thus brought into line with the Children Act 2001.  A dedicated children's part of the Act should stipulate the following guiding principles that every child should have access to health services that aim to deliver the highest attainable standard of child mental health; the autonomy and self-determination of the child should be respected in so far as practicable in conjunction with parents or persons as required acting <i>in loco parentis</i>; and there must be consultation with the child at each and every stage of diagnosis and treatment with due weight given to his or her views consistent with his or her age, evolving capacity and maturity and with due regard to his or her will and preferences.  Services should be provided in an age-appropriate environment, and services should be provided in close proximity to family and-or carers wherever possible.  The child must receive the least intrusive treatment possible in the least restrictive environment possible.<br/><br/>Where there is an intervention on behalf of the child, his or her best interests must be taken into account, and &quot;best interests&quot; must be defined in a way that is informed by the views of the child, bearing in mind that those views should be given due weight in accordance with his or her age, evolving capacity and maturity, and with due regard to his or her will and preferences.  Children aged 16 or 17 should be presumed to have capacity to consent or refuse treatment.  For admission of a 16 or 17 year old to proceed on a voluntary basis, the child must also consent or at least must not object to his or her voluntary admission.  Where a 16 or 17 year old objects, the case should be referred to a child-friendly family district law court which can determine whether the child has the necessary maturity or capacity to make an informed decision.  The group acknowledges that there should be no automatic presumption of capacity for children under the age of 16.  However, in such cases, the views of the child must be heard and service providers must give them due consideration and weight.<br/><br/>The commission, in its submission on the report to the Department of Health, indicated its support of the recommendations relating to children, many of which place the child or young person in a more central position in the process of admission, care and treatment.  However, the commission also stated that further attention needs to be paid in revised mental health legislation to the human rights of children.<br/><br/>It also made reference to the response of the Committee for the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which, in its response to Ireland in its report in February 2016, referred to the following: the lack of comprehensive legislation on children&rsquo;s consent to and refusal of medical treatment, in particular mental health care services; children being admitted to adult psychiatric wards owing to inadequate availability of mental health care facilities for children and long waiting lists for access to mental health support and insufficient out-of-hours services for children and adolescents with mental health needs, in particular eating disorders; and the lack of a child-focused advocacy and information service for children with mental health difficulties.<br/><br/>The committee recommended that Ireland must enact legislation that explicitly and comprehensively provides for children&rsquo;s consent to and refusal of medical treatment, and ensure that this legislation is in line with the objectives of the convention and encompass clear recognition of children&rsquo;s evolving capacities.  It also recommended that Ireland undertake measures to improve the capacity and quality of its mental health services for children and adolescents.  In doing so, Ireland should prioritise strengthening the capacity of its mental health services for inpatient treatment, out-of-hours facilities and facilities for treating eating disorders.  It also recommended that Ireland consider establishing a mental health advocacy and information service that is specifically for children, and accordingly accessible and child friendly.<br/><br/>The Mental Health Commission is of the view that while improving the capacity and delivery of mental health services is appropriately placed in revised national mental health policy, it is clear that an opportunity is presented in the drafting of revised mental health legislation to incorporate the points raised by the commission.  The commission notes that the Title introducing the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2016 states: &ldquo;Bill entitled an Act to provide that all children must be admitted to child appropriate inpatient psychiatric units and providing that no child shall be admitted to an adult psychiatric inpatient unit (voluntarily or involuntarily) save in exceptional circumstances where such admission is in the child&rsquo;s best interests.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The commission welcomes the policy intent of the Bill as it places in primary legislation the commission&rsquo;s view as specified in the code of practice relating to the admission of children that was issued pursuant to section 33(3)(e) of the 2001 Act in 2009.  Section 2.5 of the aforementioned code of practice specifies provisions that should be in place if approved centres for adults are used of necessity in exceptional circumstances.  It is suggested that provisions akin to those specified in the code should be considered for elevation to primary legislation. <br/><br/>Sections 4.3 to 4.7 of the commission's submission are technical in nature and I will not detain the committee with those at this time.  I will now pass over to my colleague, Dr. Finnerty.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-06a.1708" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Susan Finnerty" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2017070600002#DD00200"><p>I thank the committee for inviting us.  As inspectors of mental health services, my team and I inspect approved centres under regulations, rules and codes of practice.  This includes both adult and child approved centres.  I will give some feedback on the 2016 inspections regarding children.</p> <p>  In 2016, there were 509 admissions of children to approved centres.  A total of 441 of these were to CAMHS units and 68 were to adult approved centres.  There are four HSE CAMHS approved centres, one in Galway, one in Cork and two in Dublin.  In total, these were registered in 2016 to accommodate 76 beds.  However, at the end of 2016, there were only 66 operational HSE beds in CAMHS units.  There are also 26 independent beds in St. Patrick's Hospital and in St John of God Hospital.  As of the 31 May 2017, there were 59 HSE-registered beds and 51 of these are operational.</p> <p>  As stated previously, there were 68 admissions of children to adult approved centres in 2016, which represents one in seven of all admissions of children.  This had decreased from 96 in 2015.  However, the number of preliminary notifications received by the Mental Health Commission of admissions of children to adult units from 1 January 2017 to 31 May 2017 was 44, an increase of eight compared with the same period in 2016, when there were 36 admissions of children to adult units.</p> <p>  In 2016, there were 19 adult approved centres admitting children.  The age range of children admitted to adult approved centres was between 13 and 17.  Some 66% were 17, some 23% were 16 years of age and 12% were 15 or under.  The average length of stay was six days and 35% of children admitted to adult units were moved to a CAMHS unit.</p><p>Two of those admissions to adult units were detained under section 25 of the Mental Health Act.</p><p> We inspect approved centres under the code of practice relating to the admission of children.  Section 2.5 of the code of practice states that if adult approved centres are used for the admission of children, the following should apply: policies and protocols are in place for admission, family liaison, parental consent and confidentiality; age appropriate facilities; age appropriate therapeutic programmes; child protection provisions; training for staff relating to the care of children; age appropriate advocacy; advice from the CAMHS.  HSE policy is that the child has a single room and one-to-one nursing observation and this was noted to be in place.  All adult units that admit children were non-compliant with section 2.5 of the code of practice, leading to the conclusion that adult approved centres are not suitable for the admission of children.</p><p> With regard to CAMHS teams, A Vision for Change recommends that there should be two fully staffed CAMHS teams for a population of 100,000.  During 2016, I met with the area management teams in each of the nine CHOs.  There were a total of 58 CAMHS teams nationally at the end of 2016.  No CHO had the required two teams per 100,000.  Four CHOs did not have an out-of-hours service at the end of 2016.  Children who present to the emergency department out of hours with a mental health difficulty are assessed and treated by non-specialist non-consultant hospital doctors and consultant psychiatrists in the emergency department and it appears that they have no other option but to admit children because of their risk and due to the lack of appropriate services and beds.</p></speech>

I am here to represent the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, and to set out the views of doctors in Ireland on the problems facing child and adolescent mental health services.  The IMO is the representative body and trade union for the medical profession and represents all doctors across all grades.</p> <p>  Through written submissions made to the committee and those made to it during last week&rsquo;s hearing, the committee will be aware that mental health services for children and adolescents in Ireland fall far short of what is needed and that we are failing young people and their families.  In many ways mental health awareness has never had a higher profile, with sufferers encouraged to seek help.  However, while as a society we might encourage our young people to access the help they need, at present we have neither the capacity nor the staffing in place to adequately respond to those requests.</p> <p>  Funding for mental health care in Ireland remains low.  In the HSE's service plan for 2017, funding for mental health services made up just 6.1% of the HSE's total operational budget.  This is a far cry from the 8.24% of total health fund spending that should be directed to mental health services, as set out in A Vision for Change in 2006.  We have seen the percentage of total health budget for mental health decrease from 13% in 1984 to 7.3% in 2004 and to the current 6.1%.  By way of contrast, many other western European health systems, such as those in France, Germany and the United Kingdom, spend approximately 10% to 11% of their health budgets on mental health services.  This chronic underfunding has manifested in a failure of State agencies to build the necessary capacity to provide adequate mental health services to children and adolescents.</p> <p>  The IMO recognises that good patient outcomes are most likely if patients have timely access to advice, assessment and treatment, but the latest figures available show that CAMHS are still far below the level of capacity recommended.  Just 67 child and adolescent mental health teams are in existence out of the 95 teams recommended in A Vision for Change for the population of the country.  This means that each team is forced to serve a larger population, creating additional pressures on staff and, inevitably, longer waiting lists.  Just 66 CAMHS inpatient beds are in place, which is far less than the 100 beds which were required in 2006.  Since 2006, there has been a population increase of approximately 216,000 in the age group of less than 18 years of age.  This is a rise of 21%, so the need for beds is even greater than it was in 2006.</p> <p>  Furthermore, inpatient beds are available only in the major urban centres of Cork, Dublin and Galway, often placing treatment options far from the homes of patients in other areas of the country.  For example, no inpatient beds exist in the country's north west, south west or midlands, nor are there beds in the country's third most populated city, Limerick.  Where referrals are required for patients in these regions, they travel to Dublin, Cork or Galway, which puts additional strain on both patients and families.  Our membership has reported that facilities are often unsuitable for the provision of care to children and adolescents.</p> <p>  The IMO has identified deficiencies in service provision nationwide, with specific problems identified in the CAMHS teams in Mayo, Roscommon and Wexford.  Pronounced staffing difficulties also severely hamper service provision.  According to A National Model of Care for Paediatric Healthcare Services in Ireland, currently CAMHS teams in Ireland have approximately 50% of the staffing recommended by A Vision for Change.  This limits severely the number and range of therapeutic interventions that each team can provide.  Many CAMHS teams operate with as little as one third of the complement of staff required under A Vision for Change.  Often teams nationwide share staff members, thereby rendering the full extent of under-staffing ambiguous as the same individual may be reported as being a member of more than one team.  This is creating a virtual postcode lottery, whereby the range of services is dependent on a patient&rsquo;s address rather than on need.</p> <p>  In the absence of adequate primary care teams with allied mental health professionals, such as psychologists and speech and language therapists, general practitioners, GPs, often have no option but to refer patients to secondary specialist services instead of being able to manage some patients in the community setting.  Chronic under-staffing and a lack of capacity, despite the recommendations of the Mental Health Commission, have resulted in 68 children being admitted to adult psychiatric units in 2016, representing approximately 18% of all child admissions.  At the end of March 2017, some 51% of referrals to CAMHS were waiting over three months for an appointment, demonstrating the inability of the existing staff to treat patients in a timely manner.</p> <p>  Mental health services, indeed most health services in Ireland, encounter major difficulties when attempting to recruit personnel, leaving many health services in Ireland critically under-staffed.  Recently, the IMO has heard complaints from doctors being forced to work hours far above legal limits, due to severe under-staffing.  This problem has been particularly identified in the CAHMS in north Cork, where three non-consultant hospital doctors have been forced to provide 16 hours each of on-call cover each week day and 24 hours of on-call cover each weekend on top of their 39 hours of weekly commitment.  In responding to calls from the IMO that this practice cease and that correct staffing levels be attained, the HSE stated that it did not believe it would be possible to alter the current work practices within the service.  It referred to "significant difficulties recruiting suitably trained personnel, at local and international level, which is having a significant impact on the quality and timeliness of service provision".</p> <p>  Problems such as these are not restricted to services in Cork, however.  Waterford, for example, has funding for three child and adolescent consultant psychiatrists but has only been able to fill one and a half of these posts.  In north Tipperary and west Limerick there are no non-consultant hospital doctors and no consultants in training on the CAMHS teams.  It is little wonder that the health services in Ireland experience pronounced difficulties recruiting and retaining medical staff when both remuneration and working conditions lag significantly behind those available elsewhere in the English-speaking world, with which we largely compete for medical staffing.  Independent research on the emigration of health professionals from Ireland has found that "much recent emigration has been driven by dissatisfaction with working conditions in the health system and uncertain career progression opportunities, aggravated by austerity-related staff reductions, salary reductions and taxation increases".  This research has also indicated that the overwhelming majority of those who leave do not plan to return to Ireland and experience superior working conditions, training and professional opportunities abroad.  Simply put, no solution can be found to the staffing issues within the mental health services unless action is taken to resolve the current recruitment and retention crisis among health professionals.</p> <p>  Additionally, structural issues must be addressed.  Sufficient CAMHS inpatient bed capacity must be provided, in appropriate locations, to ensure that all children who require such care can receive it and thus end the practice of the inappropriate admission of children to adult psychiatric units.  General practitioners must also be provided with the necessary resources in their primary care teams to manage patients presenting with mental health problems, without recourse to secondary care.  Finally, the confusion regarding discrepancies in the definition of a child between physical and mental health services, which leads to the confusion we have heard about today, should be resolved.  The IMO calls on the committee to recognise these issues as central to remedying the problems facing child and adolescent mental health services and to recommend that immediate remedial action is taken to address these issues.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for its time this afternoon and both Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd and I will be happy to answer any questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-06a.1711" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Gibson" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2017070600002#FF00100"><p>Tusla welcomes the opportunity to make a submission on this.  In many ways, as chief operations officer I can empathise very clearly with parents whose children have mental illness episodes.  I am a corporate parent for over 6,300 children in State care.  Last year, we lost five children to suicide.  That causes me great grief as a public servant.  I listened to all the submissions today.  We made a written submission.  I would prefer to talk about some of the key points about which we need to be mindful.</p> <p>  A child and adolescent mental health service of very high calibre makes an extremely good impression and makes a difference to the well-being of a child or young person who accesses it.  We strive, as a State agency, to have good working relationships with other State agencies.  We recently signed off on a joint protocol for children in care to have priority access to disability services and mental health services.  Having said that, as a State agency we receive over 43,000 referrals per annum.  Many of the young people who present at our service do so with mental illness episodes.  It is very difficult, when they have access to a child and adolescent psychiatrist, to obtain a diagnosis.  I am talking about adolescents heading into adulthood.  Our experience on following the affected children and young people is that when they enter young adulthood and engage with adult mental health services, they seem to get a diagnosis quite quickly and, therefore, get a medical treatment plan and medication to resolve their issues.  In the case of personality disorder, for example, the diagnosis seems to come quickly in adulthood.  I am not a medic and acknowledge there may be very good reasons diagnosis is not as quick for adolescents.  This is a theme we see regularly.  When those affected receive a diagnosis and treatment plan from a mental health perspective, their behaviours de-escalate in all walks of life in the community.  That is an important point.</p> <p>  What parents and staff in Tusla require when young people or children present with mental health difficulties is an accessible and immediate service.  I am very much aware that CAMHS operates at the acute end of the spectrum and that many times when we do have access to that service, it reaffirms the professional's assessment of the child's needs.  Therefore, it reduces much of the anxiety experienced by other professionals in trying to manage children and adolescents who present with mental health issues.  Interagency collaboration is easy to talk about but much harder to make happen.  There are developments within Tusla in this regard.  The Government has invested heavily in the children and young people services committees.  Many of those committees have sub-groups for children and adolescent mental health and they do very good work on awareness, early support and family support across all agencies and within the non-Government sector.  I ask the committee to consider this model a vehicle of investment to ensure we have good programmes on information-sharing, early intervention and supports for children or adolescents experiencing mental health difficulties and their families.  The committees have been running for several years and their meetings are well attended by an interagency forum and well supported.  They are a good vehicle.  A good example is in Kerry, where there was a serious rate of youth suicide.  The committee got together and put together very good programmes with information on accessing immediate support.  It works well.  With the acute service, it is a matter of accessibility and timeliness.</p> <p>  May I use a case example to show how we were able, along with other agencies, to provide an immediate, assessable support to a family with a single mother?  Coming up to Christmas, her daughter experienced suicidal ideation and had carried out many attempts on her life.  The mother found her daughter hanging in the landing one night and was able to rescue her.  She was admitted to the general hospital.  The out-of-hours CAMHS assessed her.  In the professional opinion of the assessors, she required an inpatient bed in a child and adolescent psychiatry setting.  That young person remained in the general hospital for three weeks.  Tusla was contacted at an early stage on the grounds of there being a child protection issue.  We responded to that and made our assessment, namely, that it was not a child protection issue but a mental health issue.  The mother was a good mother, a very concerned mother who loved her daughter but felt she could not manage to ensure her daughter's safety.  Therefore, the young person remained in hospital.  Unfortunately, the adult psychiatrist attached to the hospital reassessed the child and made a professional decision that she was fit for discharge.  The hospital telephoned us and said the matter was for Tusla.  We said we would be part of an overall plan of intervention and support but we asked it not to expect Tusla to have the capacity to look after the matter on its own.</p> <p>  The immediate response from a social work perspective was that we needed a residential service.  As a manager, and with a management team, we disagreed.  We said we need to put a service in the family home of the mother and daughter if they are willing to accept that.  We put a social care team in with the mother's consent because her main concern was that she could not ensure her daughter's safety at night.  We said we could remedy that and that we could, with her consent, put a team into the family home for a period of three months.  One social care worker in that team was given a brief to develop a relationship with the young person that would remain on an ongoing basis thereafter.  That young person is well and safe and living at home in her community with her family.  She does have mental illness episodes but they are well managed.  The point for us was that CAMHS was very agreeable to being involved in the integrated response, which was immediate, timely and proportionate to the need of the young person and her mother.  If there is anything we can do as a State agency today, it is to state the need for an integrated, timely response characterised by togetherness, true collaboration and working together to ensure the well-being of children and young people.</p></speech>

I have a written submission but will not read it.  I just want to make one proposal, which is on addressing excessive and unacceptable waiting lists.  Before I make it, I must congratulate Senator Joan Freeman and her colleagues on putting a spotlight on the issue of mental health.  It is very much needed.  All the submissions have very clearly defined what the problems are.  What comes across to me is the determination of Senator Freeman, the Minister, the HSE representatives and all the others who presented in positing the high priority of children.  They have defined the issues very clearly.  In the spirit of Mr. Gibson, I ask that the case study he gave on a particular child be used in drawing attention to the immediate priority of addressing waiting lists.  Through Senator Freeman, I ask the Minister to establish, through his office, a national task force to address this issue as a matter of priority.</p> <p>  Waiting lists create enormous problems for parents.</p><p>Last week, I was very moved when I heard what parents had to say and the issues they addressed.  We know that the longer young people and adolescents wait to be assessed, the greater their problems and the more difficulties are created for families.  </p><p> The acting national director of mental health services, Mr. Jim Ryan, is here today.  He could give leadership and organise a response.  He could do exactly what Mr. Jim Gibson and the Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Muldoon, talked about and adopt a child centred approach and respond in an integrated and co-ordinated manner.  How can it be done?  A structure already exists because there are nine community health care organisations that lead in mental health.  We should avail of all of the services that are available.  Myriad services are available and not only ones that are statutory to the HSE.  We also have the Jigsaw and Spun Out organisations in the voluntary sector.  A whole range of services is available but I will not list them.  There is also the independent sector of which the Dean Clinics are an example.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund should be used to address this issue, if necessary.  I ask that all of these resources are brought together in a way that will address the issues created by waiting lists.</p><p> I do not underestimate the funding, recruitment and staff retention issues as they have been well documented.  They are issues for the future.  They will not be solved immediately and will take a long time to be resolved.  As Dr. Muldoon has said, there are cultural issues involved.  We need to know how the services work and not just focus on additional resources.  We also need to know the process of referral, triage, assessment and intervention.</p><p> It is important to note, and for Senator Freeman and her committee to see, that there is a suitable model available for review and possible modification.  I hate to say it but the Gordan Lynch and Elma Hedderman study was conducted as long ago as 2006.  It clearly showed that more streamlined triage practices can significantly speed up triage and assessment, and reduce waiting times from a year to just a few weeks.  As suggested earlier, triage can be undertaken by nurse practitioners and other experienced members of a multidisciplinary team.  As we know, mental health issues cover a wide span and triage is a very good way to address the issues quickly. </p><p> Other researchers called Aisling N&iacute; Shiothch&aacute;in and Michael Byrne carried out a review on best practice and analysed waiting list management and initiatives in 2009.  They have produced a 14-point plan on how to do so and they would say, as I would, that managing the waiting list is key.  Waiting lists are unacceptable.  Young people and their families are suffering on a daily basis and their situation can deteriorate.  Early intervention could help alleviate the problem.  We know that early intervention is important in so many areas, particularly young people's potential in their future lives.</p><p> I suggest that we address the problem in an immediate fashion.  The Minister of State may be shocked to hear that this issue could be resolved by Christmas if we adopted a focused approach.  I believe we can do it because there is a structure already in place, we have limited resources in the community, we have community care organisations that operate under the director of mental health services, we have evidence-based research in how to address the problem through referral, triage and interventions, and we have a 14-point plan.  I sense here today, and having heard the submissions this morning and watched proceedings last week, that people want this issue to be resolved.  We have the belief but in this case we need the focus, we need the use of evidence-based practice and we need good leadership.  I think we should celebrate this and give a plan to the HSE to see how this can be done in the future in a cost-effective manner but, more importantly, in a way that addresses the needs of young children, adolescents and their families.</p></speech>

I have heard the presentation that Mr. Dodd has made a dozen times.  The first time was by the previous Minister of State who was responsible for the mental health brief, the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee.  The current Minister of State has said something similar and I have heard the same from the mental health division many times.  At best the presentation can be described as defensive and at worst it is fantasy.  It has been said that when a child is put into a mental health unit that he or she has one-to-one support but, in contrast, Dr. Finnerty said that not one of the units were compliant.  Where did Mr. Dodd get his information from?</p> <p>  There seems to be a shrugging attitude about the recruitment and retention of staff.  There is an attitude of it is not our fault, we just cannot get the staff.  As Dr. John Hillery said this morning, any major company would ask itself why do people not want to work with us and why can we not retain staff.  Has the HSE ever asked itself those questions?  The staff in the HSE have changed.  If the HSE cannot retain staff or they choose to move around all of time then how can there be continuity when it comes to dealing with the issues that affect this country?</p> <p>  A task force are the worst two words in our language.  A task force sounds good but in reality it is just kicking the can down the road.  As many as 12,000 reports have been written on our services and 12,000 tonnes of dust have accumulated.  What is the point of these reports?  Today, I had great hope until I heard Mr. Dodd's presentation.  I had hope because I had listened to the men and women who work so hard in this country to make good services available to the children of our nation but then I heard the HSE utter the same platitudes again.  Unfortunately, nothing had changed.  When will the HSE change its tone?</p></speech>

I also welcome back Ms Lauren Keogh and Ms Sin&eacute;ad McGee who were part of a group of mothers who gave powerful testimonies of their lived experiences.  It is great that both of them are here again today.  It is great that they keep us on track when it comes to asking the right questions.</p> <p>  I have questions for the Minister of State, the HSE, Tusla, the Ombudsman and everyone else.  The Minister of State is newly appointed.</p><p>I would be interested to know how the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, rates the child mental health services in Ireland, his priorities for his first 100 days in office, if he believes his budget is big enough and, if not, what he would like it to be and what percentage of that budget he would like to be spent on child mental health.  I would be interested in also hearing the Minister of State's response to Professor O'Connor's suggestion on how to tackle the waiting lists, which is very interesting.  We can do many things, including host the Rugby World Cup.  We could do this if we put our minds to it. <br/><br/>My question to the HSE is when will the 24 hour cover for child mental health be in place?  I would like to read into the record the testimony of a mother, named Louise, to the committee last week, in which she describes her son's breakdown following the death of his father.  She states:</p><blockquote>We went to accident and emergency that night when the ambulance came.  My son, a fit and healthy 17-year old who was supposed to line out and play a hurling match the following day was brought in on a stretcher and wheeled catatonic into accident and emergency from an ambulance that night but he was alive.  We spent that night in accident and emergency.  I sat in the waiting room watching all the ads, such as &quot;It's ok not to be ok&quot;, &quot;Ask for help&quot; and &quot;Tell someone&quot;.  That is absolute rubbish.  There was nothing there for us when we went looking for it.  It is a complete and utter contradiction and it is hypocritical.  There was nothing there.  We had been everywhere looking for help.</blockquote><p>Following on from that, what is the HSE reaction to public health campaigns that have great messages but no substance in terms of back-up?  <br/><br/>Dr. Geoffrey Shannon gave powerful testimony to the committee about the importance of inter-agency work.  I was glad to hear Mr. Gibson speak so well about that work.  What is the HSE view on it?  Dr. Shannon, who produced an audit and reviewed several models of inter-agency co-operation, pointed out that he has emphasised throughout the audit report that notification is not communication.  In other words, it is not good enough to send on a letter.  What is important is communication and working around the child.  There is a tendency among State agencies to accept that if they fill in a form and push an issue the problem is solved.  It does not work that way for the child.  I would be interested if the HSE and Tusla could rate out of ten the inter-agency work.  I understand the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, is a former teacher and so I would also be interested to hear his rating of the service.<br/><br/>My final question is to Dr. Muldoon.  What innovative proposals does he have to fulfil the unfillable posts?  As he raised that as an issue I would be interested in hearing his views on it..  I would also like if Ms Gilheaney could reiterate her proposals on strengthening consent for the under 18s in terms of treatment, including detention, involuntary detention and medication.  Children have fewer protections than adults and I would like if Ms Gilheaney could remind us of the position in this regard.</p></speech>

I do not accept that this is the best we can do on behalf of the children that are availing of these services.  I am familiar with these services as a parent and a public representative, and as a Minister I have an added responsibility for these services.  I do not rate them fit for purpose or as the best we can do.  We must do better.  </p></speech>

Following on from the contribution of Professor O'Connor I am hopeful that there is something we can do in this area.  I do not know yet how much I can do but I will give it my all.  My first priority is to get my ahead around the issue.  My second priority will be to give my all to address of the issue and third, to make progress.  I am determined to do that and I will work with all involved and do all that is possible to that end.  </p> <p>  In regard to Senator Kelleher's question regarding Professor O'Connor's suggestion, I am willing take it on board.  I look forward to having a conversation with the professor to tease out further what she is proposing.  Notwithstanding the Senator's allergy to the words "task force" that is what Professor O'Connor has proposed.  We already have a task force on youth mental health, the final meeting of which I will chair next Tuesday in Dublin.  I look forward to receiving the report of the task force to see what tangible steps we can from it.  As a task force, it did not run too long.  During my first week as Minister of State I attended a task force consultation in Farmleigh.  I hope that this task force will guide some of the steps I will take in my time as Minister.  I would not be allergic to any task force in respect of which a time limit is put in place.  A task force is effectively a group of people with expertise in a certain field.  We all have views and opinions but we need experts to feed into areas in order to arrive at solutions.  I appreciate Professor O'Connor's style.  I support solution-led politics.  We can talk all day today and tomorrow about what is wrong and we can continue to list all that is wrong in eloquent style but what I want to hear are solutions and I will welcome solutions from all contributors.  I am particularly enthused by Professor O'Connor's solution-led submission today.</p> <p>  In regard to whether my budget is big enough, budgets are never big enough.  The budget for this area is approximately &euro;1 billion.  I am more interested in what can be done, how we do that with what we have and in ensuring we get value for money.  Perpetually looking for more resources and money to be thrown at the problem is not the solution.  That is not the politics I subscribe to.  How we do what we do must be held up to close scrutiny, which is tough.  It is easy as a politician to look for more money and resources but it is a lot more difficult to scrutinise how we do what we do and that is what I will be championing during my tenure as Minister in this area, however long that will be.  I hope I have answered the Senators' questions.  I also thank Senator Freeman for the hospital pass to allow me some time to settle into my role.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-06a.1731" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Ryan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2017070600002#HH01100"><p>There were two issues raised in regard to 24/7 cover.  As mentioned earlier by Dr. Dodd, 73% of our services provide 24/7 cover.  Where that cover is not available, the issue is staff recruitment and retention, which has been well rehearsed over the last two days.  It is not the case that the HSE is not trying to recruit staff or that it does not have the resources to recruit staff rather it is that between nursing and consultants cover in particular it is proving extremely difficult to recruit in some parts of the country and in some of the roles.  We have done recruitment internationally and a group will shortly go to Geneva for a conference on recruitment.  We will work everybody and anybody on this issue.  We have engaged with a number of different international recruitment companies.  The problem is often that as staff numbers decrease, teams feel disempowered and disengaged and it becomes difficult to recruit.  Our job, as part of the leadership that has been spoken about, is to rectify this.  As mentioned earlier, there have been increases in the number of staff and likewise the number of referrals over the last five or six years.  We are dealing with an increasing population, an increasing number of referrals and there are times when we have to try to ensure that the services we are delivering are being provided in a robust way 9 to 5, 7 over 7 and 24/7.  In regard to a young person arriving at an accident and emergency department in the early hours of the morning, we accept that this is not ideal from the point of view of any young person's mental health.</p><p>We do try immediately to have an assessment done by a CAMHS team to ensure the appropriate treatment is provided as quickly as possible.  The committee has seen from the figures that the numbers admitted to adult units have been reduced.  There was an increase in the month of January of which we were aware.  There was a particular reason for that.  Some of the cases involved were quite difficult to manage and we and our colleagues in Tusla were working hard to try to provide solutions which were appropriate to the young person's needs.</p><p> Dr. Dodd may wish to address a number of the points that were raised.  I would like to address the issue of the waiting lists.  Two years ago, we had in excess of 400 young people on a waiting list for more than 12 months.  A colleague and I literally went down through each of the 400 and identified whether he or she was appropriate to mental health, primary care, social care, or potentially the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, in education.  As a result of that exercise and through the redeployment of some our staff who are in current CAMHS positions, we reduced the number to less than 200.  Unfortunately, we have lost certain key posts and as a result those numbers have gone up again.</p><p> In respect of legislation, the Mental Health Act provides that each young person attending a child and adolescent mental health service has to have a named consultant psychiatrist.  That is in the Act.  It is different from other jurisdictions where they have what is called an accountable clinician, who can be someone other than a consultant psychiatrist.  That has implications for the ability of other professionals to see, assess and treat young people.  If the young person has to have a named psychiatrist, then in fairness that psychiatrist has to have an overview of the case.  It is simply a fact.  We have to work within the legislation.</p><p> On admissions to adult units, we have already gone through the protocols that have to be put in place.  A point was raised about the acute units not being in compliance.  When a young person is admitted to an adult unit, the unit is not in compliance.  However, this does not mean the protocol we have in place for the occasions on which a young person is admitted are not followed.  They are followed.</p></speech>

It certainly is not in that situation.  When a young person is admitted, however, I get a fax immediately into my office that says a young person has been admitted to an adult unit.  A similar fax goes to the Mental Health Commission.  We know every day how many young people are admitted.  We have a weekly bed meeting at which all the referrals that are being made in that week are assessed clinically by our four CAMHS services.  They do not work in isolation but in tandem to ensure we can provide a service.  I accept there is a distance involved but I have to work within the service we are funded for to try to be able to provide the best service we can.</p> <p>  On retention and recruitment, we have looked at many different ways of going about things.  Part of it is about terms and conditions, which were mentioned earlier.  Much of it has to do with trying to create a modern service.  The last question put to me concerned what is new.  Part of this is about sticking at what we are doing and trying to do it better.  That is what we are fully focused on and I am fully committed to it in my role today and in my role as head of operations.</p></speech>

Within the HSE, that means mental health, social care and primary care.  We were aware that there were some young people who could fall between the various bureaucratic cracks.  Trying to put the young person at the centre of decision-making can sometimes be difficult because of different legislative requirements.  I take the point on board, however.  We have to put the young person at the centre of the decision-making.</p></speech>

One has been completed with Tusla.  The second is not fully complete.  It addresses those children with complex needs who potentially have needs across disability services, social care, mental health services and Tusla.  What is proposed in this protocol is adjudication at a central agreed point whereby the needs of the child are placed at the centre of the decision as to what agency should take a lead, given the child's presentation.  That protocol is near to completion.  I am a member of the protocol working group.  My experience currently is that there is a significant level of enthusiasm to try to get that agreed way of working across agencies in place as soon as possible.</p></speech>

I see two issues.  One, which the Minister of State touched on, is how we do what we do.  We have heard a number of relevant examples, including some in my presentation.  Even when a child gets into CAMHS there is sometimes no sense that it is a safe place to be.  When we have psychiatrists differing over a diagnosis and children not being admitted into residential units as a result, that is not safe.  Those things can be sorted out as they are systems issues.  We need to take things in hand and make sure there is some level of consistency.  We have had complaints about this.  A child who has been diagnosed as needing a residential bed by a properly trained child psychiatrist is sent off and referred, and then the residential unit says no, it is different, changes the diagnosis and sends the child back.  That is not safe.  We need to produce a safe situation for the people working there and for the children who get into the system.</p> <p>  Mr. Ryan spoke about legislation allowing for an accountable person.  Have we thought about the need to change the legislation if that helps us?  As far as I am concerned, the child has no care for who the boss is.  It does not matter as long as the child gets the service that is necessary.  Is there a possibility of making exemptions in certain situations?  Could other people lead teams if necessary?  I do not mind who they are and, most importantly, neither does the child.  We can be imaginative and creative.  The Senator asked one of the psychiatrists last week if there was any possibility of changing teams and the answer was that it is tradition.  That tradition has always been there but we are trying to look forward.  We are trying to be imaginative with waiting list priorities and changing things around.  Can we do that?  What Mr. Gibson highlighted was imaginative in that it involved things that have not been done before and are different and new.  People will be discombobulated by that but let it be the professionals, not the children.  I think we can move forward in that way.</p></speech>

It is an issue about which the Mental Health Commission is quite concerned and has been for some time, as expressed in its views in respect of the expert group review.  As it stands, the majority of children requiring care and treatment from a mental health service will do so on an outpatient basis.  When inpatient care is required, the majority of children will receive that care and treatment in the approved centre with the consent of their parents.  The legal status of the child is that he or she is a voluntary patient.  Under the Act, a child is anyone under the age of 18 unless they have been married.  We have the situation where we have a young person up to and including the age of 17 who can be a voluntary patient in an inpatient mental health facility if their parent provides consent.  The young person's view as to whether he or she should be there is to some degree irrelevant.<br/><br/>It is the commission's view that there needs to be clarity in this regard.  There are provisions under section 23 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, which provide for the consent of a 16 and 17 year old in respect of medical and surgical treatment.  However, it is unclear as to whether that is pertinent to mental health care and treatment.  Clarity in that regard certainly would be very welcome.  It would be protective of the child's interests.  Obviously, in respect of children under the age of 16, the commission is strongly of the view that their views should also be heard and taken into consideration in respect of any intervention that would be taken on their behalf.<br/><br/>The second question concerned equivalence of protections for children and adults.  A key provision for adults detained under the Mental Health Act 2001 is that they have an automatic right to have an advocate appointed.  Under the Act it is a legal advocate.  The commission endeavours on receipt of notification of such admissions to ensure an advocate is appointed within two working days.  There is no similar provision in section 25 of the Act in respect of children.  While under section 25(14) there is a provision for the District Court to take into consideration section 26 of the Child Care Act 1991 for the provision of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, that is a discretionary power of the court and is not mandatory.</p><p>It is the commission's view that the child should have access to an advocate.  Particularly in the case of a very young child, a guardian <i>ad litem</i>might be the most appropriate advocate.  For an older child, the appropriate advocate may be a legal representative.</p></speech>

There was some reference to Dr. Shannon's report which was on a totally different area.  It was also a look back at 2014.  This is 2017.  I would like to make that distinction.  Notifications which were referred to in the report were about An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We have agreed with the recommendations of that report.</p> <p>  With regard to our collaborative approach, I would like to speak from an evidence-based position and outline some things which Tusla has established and which have gathered momentum.  In every county in Ireland there is a children and young people's services committee.  Area managers within Tusla are the chairpersons of these committees and Tusla pushed for their establishment.  They are multidisciplinary and interagency by their very nature.  They have worked up plans for each county which have been submitted to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  These plans are worked on proactively.  These committees connect with the local authorities and they plan to assist local authorities in submitting their local development and community plans to Government.  We are very much involved.</p> <p>  More importantly, when we were established we said very clearly that there was a dearth of early intervention and family support initiatives throughout Ireland.  From day one we have proactively bought into very strategic relationships with Atlantic Philanthropies and the National University of Ireland, Galway to build our prevention, partnership and family support.  People would have heard of the Meitheal programme around Ireland.  That is an excellent example of collaboration and interagency working because there are representatives from every discipline and every agency involved in the programme.  The Meitheal programme is about a team around the child.  I will give another example.  There was a young boy whose uncle-----</p></speech>

It demonstrates the collaboration and the commitment to interagency working.  There was a young boy whose uncle died of suicide and shortly afterwards his father died of suicide.  That young boy retreated into his bedroom.  The school was very concerned about him and it made a referral to our agency.  We used the prevention, partnership and family support, not the child protection system, to offer assistance to that family.  We engaged with his mother.  Collaboration with parents, children and young people is also very important in respect of what they see as their needs and what services should be developed for them.  That young person got a team around him.  He went back to school and was supported by a variety of professionals from, not only from statutory agencies but also from sporting agencies, youth clubs and so forth.  That makes a big difference.</p> <p>  Where would I rate Tusla?  Not ten out of ten, but we are halfway there.  We have a lot of work to do but we will get there.</p></speech>

The key term for me was "child-centred".  Dr. Muldoon mentioned the child-centred approach.  How dysfunctional are we in terms of achieving a child-centred approach?  To me there seems to be a big chasm or gap there.  We are not there at all.  We are not fit for purpose by a long shot, to use Dr. Muldoon's terminology.  I would like to hear how Mr. Muldoon could see us making our system child-centred.</p> <p>  I am sure the witnesses are all good people of integrity.  I do not doubt that.  However, I do not know how many of them, if any, were here last week to listen to the parents and I will not ask the question.  I do not know how many of them were here this morning listening to the practitioners.  I do not know how often they do it but I plead with them to start because they are the people at the coalface.  They are the people who make it happen.</p> <p>  Do the Minister of State and Mr. Ryan accept that we have failed?  It is only when we accept that we have failed that we can decide to start afresh and do something new.  I said that last week.  I said that both Houses have failed young people.</p></speech>

I am with Senator Freeman.  I have a problem with having great numbers of committees.  We have to be a bit more business-like.  Last week, Ms Lauren Keogh twice mentioned something critically important.  She mentioned lean methodology.  I do not know if the witnesses know what lean methodology is.  It is fundamental in business.  It is not a matter of throwing money at something.  It is about how that money is spent.  We are dysfunctional and disjointed.

I welcome the Minister of State.  I echo what my colleague, Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh, said because I heard the Minister of State on radio twice in the past week.  I pulled my car in when he was speaking on "Morning Ireland".  I thought that this was a man who was full of conviction and enthusiasm.  I sincerely wish him well.  He is in the right place and he is the right man for the job.  That is clearly something which the Taoiseach recognised in him.  That is why he was appointed and it was a good appointment.</p> <p>  To ask a few questions, we heard about resources in today's session and last week's.  We heard about the people who experience mental health issues trying to access resources.  The mental health situation and services in this country are in crisis.  One might as well be talking to two groups of people.  Practitioners, and administrators in particular, in the health service say one thing and come up with various excuses.  Another group of people experience something very different on the ground.  These groups must be connected.  This morning we had very professional people who believed and had professional values before the committee.  Those values were clear from every one of them who spoke and shared with us today in what is a listening Parliament and a listening exercise.</p> <p>  I will direct all my questions to the Minister of State.  He will not get a honeymoon period from me because I believe he can answer my questions and I would be delighted if he did.  I believe in the suggestion that we should have a task force.  Let us hear from one.  We do not want an open task force, and I believe the Minister of State made that point, but what is his view on that issue?  How are we going to address the waiting lists?  How are we going to have early intervention, because that is the crisis?  The time for excuses is over.  The time for blaming resources, other people, the administrators, the HSE or Tusla is over.  People are sick of it.  The people outside this bubble called Leinster House are fed up with it.  They are sick of it and they want answers.</p> <p>  Will the Minister of State clearly set out how he is going to address the issue of retention and recruitment of staff into the mental health services?  How will he go about minimising the length of waiting times?  Will the Minister of State give this body a categorical assurance that not one single designated bed will close this summer?  If there are any closed today, will he commit to reopening them?  These are designated beds for child psychiatry.  I do not want any excuses about staff or other beds.  No child should be in an adult psychiatric service.  I want the Minister of State to assure us today that if there are any closed, we will reopen them.  I want him to give another undertaking that summer holidays will not be used as an excuse, because mental health issues do not stop when the sun shines.</p><p>That is the message. </p></speech>

I am sorry but on most days in the Chamber I start by saying two words; "Linn Dara".  We talk about it every day, day in and day out.  It is indicative of the mental health services for our children in Ireland that, in the face of an emergency, we went and closed 11 beds, half of the unit.  It just does not make any sense.  Along with Senator Boyhan, I call for those beds in Linn Dara to be reopened as soon as possible.  This is in the gift of the Minister for State, Deputy Jim Daly.  It is not rocket science.  It seems that most of the difficulty is around retention and recruitment of staff.  I like Professor O'Connor's idea that it must be community led and come from within and be of our communities.  Perhaps I will not be popular for saying this but maybe we should begin to de-professionalise a lot of what we offer to our children within our communities.  This is where we are born and, hopefully, where we will die.  Last month the Children's Rights Alliance gave us a "D".  Heartbroken parents appeared before the committee last week and told us what is happening in their world.  We need to respect them and I wonder whether the HSE is taking into account the independent survey of parents' views that came out two days ago.  It is fairly mind-blowing and it tells us what we need to give to them.  The cost of mental health problems to the economy is &euro;3 billion, which is 2% of GNP, according to the 2011 Mental Health Commission report, The Human Cost.  It shows that it is a growing problem.  As the population grows, the number of referrals grows.  As the elders, legislators and policy makers, what have we done that we have so wrecked our children's lives? That is a big question and I do not expect any answers.  There are ideas on it but we must take responsibility and we must act.</p></speech>

They are difficult to answer.  Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh asked me about specific cases.  I do not know enough in that regard.  I was one week in the job last Thursday and I am ashamed to say that I was not aware of what was going on here and the significance and import of it.  Being appointed on a Tuesday, trying to find my feet and catch up, I was genuinely not aware that I was invited to be here last week.  I explained this to Senator Freeman yesterday.  It happens when one goes into an incredibly busy Department.  I was just playing catch-up and it was a timing issue that caught up with me last Thursday.  I assure the committee that it was not from any disrespect, lack of regard or lack of interest towards the families who presented to the committee.  I will catch up and read all the blacks of the reports and presentations to and by the families.  My officials have told me about some of them and I have met with people in the corridors of Leinster House who have told me of the powerful testimonies that were given here.  I have not physically had the time to read them prior to coming to the Chamber today but I can assure the committee that I will read them and take on board the presentations.  I thank people for their honesty in sharing such difficult stories on their part.</p> <p>  Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh asked me to specifically comment on one case.  I would prefer not to, with the indulgence of the committee, because I do not believe it would be fair to do so unless I had heard the testimony in full myself.  I thank the Senator for his kind comments.  He also asked some specific questions about a task force.  I shall look forward to speaking to the professor after the meeting.  After this meeting I am rushing to another meeting with the Secretary General, but I will request the Professor's mobile phone number before I leave.  I will pursue the issue of a task force.  I believe it is a good way to go, provided that it is clearly driven and clearly defined with a clear end.  If it is sharply focused then it is the right way to go.  I do not have the kind of wisdom required.  There is a lot of expectation of a Minister of State but he or she has only so many qualities and so many qualifications to bring to any role.   We do need to rely on the experts.  They need to be brought around the table.  One needs to keep the number as small as one can and to get everybody contributing to be engaged in solution-led politics and to be as effective as possible.</p> <p>  I am trying to read my own writing.  On recruitment and retention of staff, I do not have the magic solution to this matter.  It is clearly an issue of which all of us are aware.  I honestly do not know how we are going to get around that.  It is a big issue and I am informed by the HSE that it is not just a problem in Ireland; it is an issue also in Europe.  The retention aspect worries me just as much as the recruitment, if not more.  Why are we not retaining the staff we need in the services? I do not have a solution for the Senator, other than a commitment to doing my best to find a solution for it.  I do not have that just yet.</p></speech>

I can work as hard as I can with the HSE to ensure beds do not close and to make sure adequate funding is there but as addressed by Senators, including Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh, it is not all about funding.  There also are other issues.  I am particularly interested in how we do what we do.  It would be disingenuous of me to give a commitment because it is not in my gift to give a commitment that no bed will close under my watch as the Minister of State.  I sincerely hope that it will not close-----</p></speech>

I am talking about trying to do the very best we can.  The Senator asked me about what is new and I am trying to do what we can in order to do that.  This morning I had a report about the recruitment process being in place for new graduates, for those who are coming from a graduate programme, and people who we recruit internationally.  We are doing everything we can to try to reopen the 11 beds that are currently closed in Linn Dara.  Six beds are closed at the moment in St. Vincent's Psychiatric Hospital in Fairview.  We have consultants starting there in the next weeks, which we expect will bring the number of beds back up to 12.  We are recruiting non-consultant hospital doctors for the Aislinn centre in Cork, which we would hope will bring the beds available from 12 to 18.  All those efforts are being made.  It is not through lack of effort; it is simply that it takes time.  That is all I can say.</p></speech>

Based on the testimony I heard last week from those individual cases - I read and followed some of the proceedings - the HSE did fail those young people.  The HSE cannot justify that.  The lived experience of some aspects of CAMHS is not acceptable.  I accept this but to suggest that all staff members working in CAMHS need to hear and live such a negative narrative about the services they try to deliver is not a positive suggestion.  We are trying to develop a recovery-oriented mental health service for children and adults in Ireland.  This is a difficult job to do given all the constraints I have outlined.  It is not accurate to suggest that senior management in the HSE is somehow so disconnected from the front line.  I am on the senior management team of the mental health division.  I work part time as a consultant psychiatrist.  I try to support adults who have an intellectual disability and a mental health problem.  I am absolutely familiar with the lived experience of trying to access better services.  I am new to the mental health division in the HSE and since I have joined the senior management team, I see a group of people who are trying to their best to come up with solutions and to remain as positive as possible in coming up with the best outcomes for our service users as they access our services.</p></speech>

I missed most of the contributions due to other commitments.  I have a brief question for the witnesses from Tusla and, perhaps, some of the medical professionals present.  Dr. Geoffrey Shannon's report is very topical at the moment, and I note Mr. Jim Gibson's comments that the sections 12 and 13 aspect of the report is not necessarily relevant to this.  I believe there is a relevancy.  I am interested in knowing what is recommended from a psychological-psychiatric point of view for children who are in section 12 and section 13 situations where there is a mental health issue.  Is it sufficient that they get that type of help after the event and once they have met a social care worker or a social worker?</p><p>What is the current position on the extra workers throughout the country and the out of hours service, and what is required from the point of view of a medical professional?  I know there is a review going on.  In respect of our interagency conversation, it may not be relevant, but does the protocol apply to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as well?  I have been looking into this lately in respect of sections 12 and 13, which are quite topical.</p></speech>

I am told there are many temporary and locum staff in the HSE.  Would the Minister of State consider making them permanent, which would at least stop the rot?  If he could commit to making every effort to ensure this takes place, we will have done a good day's work.</p></speech>

I presume Mr. Ryan works in the administrative part of the HSE.  He mentioned going through 400 cases.  How was he able to determine who should be seen and who should not and who should go where?  There seems to be a good relationship between Tusla and the HSE, which has not always been the case.  Tusla is fully behind the Bill that I am proposing, yet the HSE is not.  Where is the disconnect?  The previous Minister of State, the HSE and the Government keep talking about the wonderful budget of &euro;850 million, or whatever the figure is, but only 6% of that is for children, that is, &euro;50 million to provide the services for children, or maybe my mathematics are very bad.</p> <p>  Dr. Dodd said he is in that world of mental health services but he is an adult psychiatrist, not a child psychiatrist, which is a very different world.  This is not a criticism of the Mental Health Commission but there is no child psychiatrist on its board.  How do we get the true picture if there are not people who represent the front line talking about our children on these issues?</p></speech>

Each team told me where its issues were.  I did not take a bureaucratic view.  The clinicians told me.  That is how I understood that.  In respect of the Bill, the HSE and Tusla can work with each other but that does not mean we always agree with each other.  In respect of CAMHS, 6% would be closer to &euro;50 million.</p></speech>

We allocate the budget according to what is allocated yearly.  Each year over recent years CAMHS has been prioritised for additional resources.  Most of the time the difficulty is not about getting the budgets but about being able to spend it appropriately when we cannot recruit some of the staff we require.</p></speech>

Consultant psychiatrists have the best rate of full approval, from the point of budgetary sanction to advertisement for the post on the Public Appointments Service website, than anyone in other areas of the health service.  We are doing our absolute best through the rapid recruitment of consultants for that to be achieved.<br/><br/>The health budget of 6% for mental health, by international standards, is low in general.  A paper considering the national spend on mental health services in several countries was published this week in the <i>British Journal of Psychiatry</i>.  It shows, as we would expect, that the percentage investment in mental health services links directly to health and well-being.  Do we need literature to prove that?  Maybe not, but we now have a very robust study that would suggest that investment in mental health results in good outcomes for members of our population.<br/><br/>With regard to child psychiatry representation, I am an adult psychiatrist and work with people with intellectual disability.  I trained in child psychiatry as well.  I am not on the specialist register for child psychiatry but several consultant child psychiatrists work with me.  I am absolutely familiar with the challenges in CAMHS.  I regularly link with clinical directors in children's services throughout the country.  I spoke to Dr. Doody this morning.</p></speech>

Dr. Dodd said there is a percentage coverage of 73% or 75%, but that does not seem to reach people.  The GPs this morning put forward a very good solution to build the 24-hour cover around the GP co-ops, for example, South Doc in Cork.  Will the HSE and the Minister of State consider that?  We are trying to come up with answers.  The GPs' seven point plan was well worth considering.  They also spoke about the deprivation weighting, but one would not need to be a psychiatrist to work out that in poorer communities there are higher levels of mental ill health.  Will Dr. Dodd consider the proposals for that?  I do not think he answered the question about the 24-hour cover, which is an important issue that has come up in the course of this consultation with families, young people and their mothers.</p></speech>

The first thing I want to say is we were invited here today to represent a State agency and to speak about mental health issues.  I am quite happy to meet any representative about the current out-of-hours service in Ireland from the Child and Family Agency.  I do not want to get into the Dr. Shannon thing at all.  I am here to speak about mental health, which is the real issue.  If a child or young person presents to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na out of hours and Tusla out-of-hours services are involved, we respond.  Ms Finlay, service director, can outline what happens.  I hope that will go some way to answering the question.</p></speech>

I emphasise very much that the majority of our social workers have five years of training to prepare for these events in supporting children and their parents for the trauma, separation and loss being brought to any child.  It is an extremely delicate balancing act and, unfortunately, we must make those difficult decisions every day and work closely with garda&iacute; on that.  There was a question on protocol.  The specific protocol we spoke about today relates to one that exists between the HSE and Tusla.  We work very closely with the HSE on those cases.  Does it need to be better?  Perhaps we need more formal structures and this protocol will support such structures.</p> <p>  With regard to the Garda, Tusla has almost completed a protocol on working with garda&iacute;.  It is there.  We have mentioned the children and young people services committee a number of times.  Under the prevention, partnership and family support programme that Tusla has, the principle is to have everyone around the table.  The practice of working is described as meitheal.  It is not for child protection cases but rather where a family and child are in need.  As people know, meitheal means bringing people together to bring home the harvest.  That is really what meitheal is about.  It is a team around the child to support that child and the parents.  It is really important as central to that is the young person and child is asked to be at the meeting and it is conducted in a way that is child-centred.  We cannot even have a meeting unless parents are part of the process.  That is the ethos and approach we are taking in Tusla of very much having children and parents participating in the plan.</p></speech>

I alluded earlier that my next meeting is with the Secretary General of the Department and the staffing issue is top of my list of matters to discuss with him in any event.  I will specifically include that topic and revert to the committee with a comprehensive response.  Priorities were mentioned earlier.  The top priority for me is the waiting lists relating to CAMHS.  The staffing matter is a central kernel to it, and it is the reason given to us time and again for the delays.  We need to deal with the staffing issue.  The ombudsman spoke about changing legislation and we will consider whether that is the solution.  I have discussed tentatively with the HSE about putting somebody else at the head of the team with CAMHS.  There are so many protocols and systems in place, it is not straightforward.  We are examining this already.</p> <p>  I will give people an assurance from a political perspective.  We are all politicians and there is so much we can do, although we cannot do everything.  I have been in the job for two weeks and to be fair to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, there has been a priority for them for some time to get a special committee on mental health up and running.  I hope to bring it to the D&aacute;il tomorrow.  The terms of reference have been agreed and they are gone today to the officials.  I hope we can get it to the D&aacute;il and it can be passed there before coming through this House so we can get the committee up and running without delay.  There is a timeline for ending around June next year and it will be dedicated to mental health.  It should be solutions-led and politics should be cohesive and collective.  I hope we will make good progress on the committee and I look forward to working on it.</p> <p>  Mental health issues are a top priority and today's meeting is another example of it, with the Seanad devoting energy, time and effort to the issue.  It is further confirmation that politics will continue to work on this as a top priority.  That is one assurance I can give to the people present today.  There is not much more for me to say other than to thank everybody for their contributions.  I thank the organisers of this initiative.  We look forward to further engagements and I hope to make progress in this vital area.</p></speech>

We are not so far from it within the service.  We can start here.  We can bring in children and young people.  We heard from parents last week.  We could have a closed session here.  I am delighted to hear the Minister of State will set up a new committee.  I have heard from children and young people on numerous occasions, including those going to paediatric wards and not just the adult unit.  I listened to a young girl who self-harmed - under her bedclothes - while she was in a ward .  These are real stories and how we would become child-centred.  We would get the benefit of their experience in trying to improve the service.  These are small contributions and not about big matters such as protocols; they are about how it can be improved for individual service users.  We need to get child-centred.  The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is very clear on what can be done as well.</p></speech>

At a basic level, we must ground it in the general principles of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  Article 2 deals with non-discrimination so are we providing equity of access to services in reality?  This is irrespective of the location of the child, particular medical needs or whether it is part of an especially vulnerable group, which needs additional measures in order to be able to access services equally, along with other children or young people.  Article 3 asks if the best interests of all children and young people are at the centre of every decision and action taken on their behalf or are we getting bogged down with administrative issues, resources, procedures and policies?  Article 6 deals with right to life, survival and development, so are we meeting that standard or are delays preventing children access to services they need in order to enjoy that right?  As the ombudsman noted, in terms of Article 12, dealing with children's participation, are we treating them as co-partners in the development of this process and services and having views about decisions taken that affect them?  Are we making those decisions without hearing from children?  From the evidence being presented here, which is followed closely by our team, we have a very long way to go.</p></speech>

From working with him before, I believe he can achieve the goal of handling this.</p><p> To the other people present I say they have probably served on numerous task forces or committees and have had their hopes raised so high, thinking that we would do something positive.  I am sorry those hopes have been dashed most of the time.  However, I promise them that after today, I and the committee will ensure that whatever the report, which will be ready by autumn, shows, we will ensure it is considered, adhered to and will not gather dust.</p></speech>

I believe it has been very informative and productive and I think we have learned much from their insight and observations.  Full account will be taken of today's discussions when a draft report has been prepared, and copies of the final report will be sent to all.  As this is our final public hearing on this topic, I wish to put on record my gratitude to all members of the committee - that is, all our Senators - for their hard work over recent months.  In particular, I thank Senator Freeman, who proposed this topic for discussion and who has worked extremely hard in the background in preparation for these hearings.  I also thank sincerely all those who sent in submissions to the committee and the witnesses who appeared before the committee.  I particularly wish to thank the parents for telling us about their experiences, which can be most distressing and difficult for the families, of seeking mental health services.  Last week, the committee heard some powerful and moving accounts from parents of their experiences of youth mental health services in Ireland today.  To that end, I acknowledge the presence in the Public Gallery today of Lauren Keogh and Sin&eacute;ad McGee, both of whom presented at one of last week's sessions.  I also express my gratitude to the secretariat of the Seanad office, particularly Bridget Doody, who, so to speak, has been my right arm, and the Library and Research Service for its valuable input into this public consultation.</p></speech>
