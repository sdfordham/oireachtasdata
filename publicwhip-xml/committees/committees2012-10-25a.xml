I thank the committee for the opportunity to explore the payment of allowances to staff of the Department and the Irish Prison Service.  Those staff who are in receipt of allowances are, in the main, on the front line of the fight against crime, be that in the context of operating and managing our prisons and places of detention or in support services such as providing an expert forensic science service to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or a pathology service.</p><p>  Members will be aware that expenditure on two separate Votes is being discussed here today, namely, Vote 24 - Office of the Minister and Vote 21 - Prisons.  The fight against crime is a 24-7 resource-intensive effort as borne out in any analysis of expenditure in the Votes for the Department and Irish Prison Service.  The requirement for staff to be in attendance on duty at all times is reflected in the levels of pay specific to attendance on weekends, public holidays and at night and in the staffing levels required to give constant round the clock cover.  On the prisons side, for example, the overall staffing stands at 3,429 personnel, which includes those deployed across the 14 places of detention, staff in ancillary services and also central administration staff located at the Irish Prison Service headquarters in Longford.</p><p>  The committee will have heard from previous evidence that the use of the term &quot;allowance&quot; covers a<i></i>multitude of different types of payments.  This is certainly the case in the Prison Service where all payments outside of the basic payscale, whether for undertaking certain additional work or duties, working extra hours or in recompense for expenses incurred, all come under the general heading of allowances.  Also in the Irish Prison Service, the requirement of the pay system for a separate allowance name for each variation in payment has created a large number of differently named allowances, most of which actually form part of the core pay for the majority of prison staff.  Gross expenditure in the Prisons Vote in 2011 was some &euro;348 million.  Payroll costs came to approximately &euro;243 million, of which more than &euro;85 million was spent on allowances, namely, approximately 35% of the overall pay expenditure.</p><p>  I would like to sketch briefly the range of payments that arise by way of allowance in the Irish Prison Service.  As set out above, the overall expenditure on allowances comes to over &euro;85 million.  Of this amount, approximately &euro;57.5 million is in respect of extra attendance and attendance for unsocial hours outside of normal work patterns.  It is worth mentioning at this point that the Irish Prison Service operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and that there is no time when staff are not required to attend for duty.  In addition to this amount paid in respect of extra attendance, some &euro;10.5 million is paid in respect of an agreement reached after arbitration in 2005, which made fundamental changes to the Irish Prison Service attendance patterns and resulted in ongoing savings of approximately &euro;30 million annually in overtime payments.</p><p>  Under the public service Croke Park agreement, an intensive transformation and reform programme is being undertaken in the Irish Prison Service.  This programme, which is being undertaken in conjunction with the staff representatives, comprises a complete review of all tasks being carried out by staff in the Irish Prison Service with a view to driving efficiencies and meeting all the targets set out in the agreement.  In addition to cost savings, the programme of reform will deliver improved services both to prisoners and the community, in line with an ambitious three year strategic plan.</p><p>  A significant aspect of the Croke Park agreement for the Irish Prison Service is a review of allowances to align these to the core duties of the service and to direct interaction with prisoners.  This review is ongoing in the context of the prison task reviews and at the prisons sectoral group under the Croke Park implementation body.  In addition, following the publication by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform of the results of the review of allowances across the public sector, preliminary negotiations have taken place with the staff associations, both on the allowances proposed to be restricted for new beneficiaries and on those contained in the priority list circulated by that Department.  These negotiations will also take place within the scope of the Croke Park agreement.</p></speech>

I call on Mr. Clinton, general secretary of the Prison Officers Association, to make his opening statement.  Is it in order to publish his statement?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-25a.25" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Clinton" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012102500005#D00300"><p>Yes.  I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for extending the invitation to the Prison Officers Association to outline its position on the allowances paid to members of the association.  The association currently represents 3,221 grades in the Irish Prison Service ranging from the grade of recruit prison officer up to and including the grade of deputy governor.  It was established in 1947 as a staff association and received full trade union recognition in May 1988 under section 10 of the Trade Union Act 1941 authorising it to carry on negotiations on the fixing of wages or other conditions of employment.  It is an affiliate member of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and, as a Civil Service trade union, operates through the agreed Civil Service conciliation and arbitration scheme.</p><p>  A number of allowances are paid to members of the Irish Prison Service and all such allowances currently paid had to go through the agreed procedures set down in the Civil Service conciliation and arbitration scheme before sanction for payment was granted.  The majority of allowances payable are in the nature of pay and pensionable and, therefore, are core pay.</p><p>  The Prison Officers Association and its members have delivered significant reform in the Irish Prison Service in recent years and staff have received numerous awards, including the Taoiseach's Award.  A major change programme was rolled out from July 2005 following lengthy negotiations facilitated by the Labour Relations Commission between management and staff and on foot of a report issued by the Civil Service Arbitration Board.  Such was the magnitude of the change that the board commended both the Prison Officers Association and the Irish Prison Service for their participation in what no doubt had been long and difficult negotiations on the proposals for change.  In reviewing this massive initiative at the 2006 Prison Officers Association annual conference the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform noted that both he and the union had come through a long and sometimes torturous process in our efforts to agree a better way forward for the Irish Prison Service.  He also stated there could be little doubt that industrial relations in the service were in a better state, with management and staff using a partnership approach to overcome their difficulties.</p><p>  This process of co-operation with a problem solving approach is continuing through our involvement with the Croke Park agreement.  There has been ongoing intensive engagement between the parties on our commitment to the public service agreement and the specific measures set down to secure payroll savings of &euro;21 million.  A full in-depth review of all tasks has been undertaken at all prisons and places of detention, the building services division, the prison service escorting corps and the operational support group.  These joint reviews have been carried out by a team comprising both management and staff representatives and arising from them, transformation reports have been completed and implemented at a number of locations.  New rosters are being constructed and implemented at all locations and a 17% reduction has been achieved at senior manager level with, among other things, the introduction of campus working arrangements at three locations.  An incentivised enhanced privilege scheme for prisoners is being implemented across the entire prison network which is based on best international practice.  There has been the introduction of 140 prison administration and support officers through redeployment from the Civil Service, thus allowing fully trained prison officers to return to front-line duties.  Agreement has been reached on a number of important policy documents, including the standard prison day, prisoner property, internal escorts, communications, etc.  There has been the opening of new prison accommodation using a significantly reduced staffing model, for example, at Wheatfield Prison.  There has been greater use of automation to allow the redeployment of officers to front-line duties.  The Irish Prison Service has been operating at or below its emergency control figure for some time, that is, with 338 fewer staff as per the last sectoral report.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-25a.26" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Clinton" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012102500005#D00500"><p>There has been significant progress to date in the Irish Prison Service under the terms of the agreement against a background of an increasing prisoner population and a decrease in staff numbers.  Furthermore, to date, there has been no requirement to utilise any of the third party mechanisms provided for under the terms of the agreement in the case of the service.  The Prison Officers Association and its members have delivered everything asked of them under the terms of the agreement.  All progress reports to date from the sectoral group to the implementation body verify this.  This has had a significant impact on the running of the service, for example, the opening of a new accommodation block at Wheatfield Prison was made possible owing to the implementation of new regimes brought about by the public service agreement.</p><p>  The public service agreement also provides that pay will not be cut in exchange for co­operation with the modernisation and change agenda which is being delivered in the Irish Prison Service.  Therefore, pay should not be cut and that includes allowances.  No distinction should be made regarding allowances that are part of basic or core pay.  That is especially the case, given the particular circumstances that apply to allowances in the service and the way they have evolved historically to restrict knock-on pay claims.  Furthermore, the service and the Prison Officers Association agreed, as part of the modernisation and change programme for the service, that we would conduct a review of all allowances on a cost neutral basis with a view to aligning the payment of allowances with the strategic priorities of the service.  Many of the allowances come under the same heading and are paid for carrying out different tasks.  For example, the assistant industrial supervisor, AIS, allowance, an allowance payable in the industrial area, can be paid to a person for their carpentry, catering or metal work skills, while the class 2 allowance is paid to officers who work in areas such as at the main gate of a prison or the prison tuck shop.</p><p>  The allowances paid in the Irish Prison Service fall mainly within the following categories.  The pensionable operational allowance forms part of the basic pay of prison staff.  It is 8% of basic pay payable to all grades.  This was the amount awarded by the Civil Service Arbitration Board set out in the July 2005 proposal for organisational change agreement.  This agreement introduced immediate efficiencies into the operation of the service, with major changes to work practices and working conditions which have been responsible for an annual saving since 2005 of more than &euro;30 million achieved through the elimination of overtime working.  Additional hours bands have operated in the service since the introduction of the proposal for organisational change agreement in July 2005 which eliminated the need for overtime working.  There are three additional hours bands - 112, 240 and 360 hours.  On attendances allowances, payments made in the service under this heading are not allowances but payments made for attendance in respect of core hours of duty.  The service operates on a 24 hour, seven day a week basis and some level of staffing is required at night and on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays.  </p></speech>

All of the agreements and departmental council documentation going back to 1961 and 1980 talk about this allowance as part of core pay, which is pensionable.  In common with the other sectors which have rent allowance, there is a broader issue in regard to how that allowance can be managed.  It is clear that maybe that allowance could be brought into core pay in the future.</p></speech>

The range of allowances means each prison officer receives an average of approximately 14 allowances.  As the Deputy said, the documentation shows that the maximum number of allowances received is 18.  The majority of allowances - all but &euro;6 million - are paid in respect of different types of attendance.   Everything else relates to attendance during contractual hours.  Members will be aware that the basic working week for a prison officer is 39 hours, but they are contracted to come in to work for an additional eight hours on top of this.  Many of these payments fall into that category.</p></speech>

Other than the rent allowance - Mr. Donnellan has explained that it dates back to 1961 - have other allowances been borrowed from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and adopted by the Irish Prison Service over time?  Have other allowances that were standard within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na been incorporated into the Irish Prison Service?</p></speech>

That allowance is payable in hospitals and to nurses, garda&iacute; and other grades for night duty and work on days like Saturday, Sunday and Christmas Day.  That is in common with the others.  Specific allowances such as the operational allowance were driven out of an agreement in 2005.  The other main allowance is the additional attendance allowance which is paid when people have to turn up and actually do the work.  The people mentioned by the Deputy who receive a large number of allowances and, therefore, have a high level of pay had to work to get all of it.  The majority of it is paid for physically being in a prison and looking after prisoners.</p></speech>

Each prison operates over four quarters.  Resources and money are allocated to a prison for each quarter.  We have to depend on the prison to operate these hours in the most efficient way, taking account of all the pressures it will encounter.  I will give an example.  If a prisoner is in hospital for an operation, nine officers will be required over a 24 hour cycle.  This draws significantly from that budget.  At any one time four or five prisoners in the Dublin region could be in hospital for dialysis, for example, or following a heart attack.  It is challenging for governors to manage this.  We are facing that challenge in a much more realistic way by budgeting across the quarter in order that we manage to get to the end of the quarter.  We are running the prisons and our services in a safe way.  However, it is not a perfect system.  Clearly, it is structured in a way that allows everybody to know how it works.</p></speech>

Is the Department of Finance contacted to figure out whether something should be pensionable?  Do the officials understand where I am coming from?  If the Department is contacted by a trade union about something that has come up, do officials get around a table with their counterparts in the Department of Finance to figure out whether it should be pensionable?  How does the system work?</p></speech>

Those negotiations would also have covered whether they were pensionable.  At the time, that was done in conjunction with the Department of Finance.  That issue would now be raised with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></speech>

When one goes through the different Departments, one can see that Department gets more allowances than any other.  The allowances come to about &euro;600 million and in some cases, they are for particular VECs.  It seems that people would sometimes contact the trade unions and then the Departments.  They would sit around a table and create an allowance just to keep people happy in some cases.  These then evolved into pensionable allowances.  What is the formula within the Department of Justice and Equality when it comes to the creation of an allowance and then a pensionable allowance?</p></speech>

For example, the rent allowance has been there almost from the foundation of the Irish Prison Service in the early days of the State.  Mr. Donnellan covered that.  That was paid out because at one stage, staff in both the Irish Prison Service and the Garda were required to live close to the prison.  Those types of allowance stretch back right to the foundation of the Irish Prison Service.  Other allowances would certainly have come about in much more recent times.  We could give the Deputy the exact breakdown.  Some of those figures may have been given in respect of the dates they came in on.  The figures we sent to the committee list when the various allowances came into payment.  They would have come into payment following consideration through the various mechanisms that were there.  Claims would have been made by the staff side and would have been discussed, for example, at the general council, and decisions would then have been taken either to award claims or not to award them.</p><p>  Other allowances, such as the proposal for organisational change, which Mr. Donnellan described and which came about in 2005, were introduced following a lengthy consultation and negotiation process.  As Mr. Donnellan indicated, that was brought in for a specific purpose, namely, to eliminate the payment of overtime in the Irish Prison Service.  The allowances came about in a variety of ways down through the years.  At the moment, most claims travel through the conciliation and arbitration scheme.</p></speech>

Nobody else does that kind of work so there are very few relativities.  However, the rent and unsocial hours allowances are generic allowances that have been around for years, whereas our attendance and operational allowances were born in 2005, as the Secretary General noted, and were related to a complete reform of our structure.  They are our four main allowances which make up the vast bulk of the amount concerned.  The rest is &euro;6 million.</p></speech>

I do not know this, but if I went to a different jurisdiction, I doubt I would find the plethora of allowances that exist in the Department and the Irish Prison Service.  We have evolved a system that would probably not be built in the same way if we had to do it all over again.  In the case of some Departments, it seems allowances were created just to keep people happy and give them an easy life.  In the private sector no company would adopt a system like this.  Frankly, they would go to the wall if they did.  It could not be tolerated and would not be successful.  It is a public sector solution.</p></speech>

One relates to the nature of the work or requirements for attendance outside normal hours.  The second relates to specific skills required for a particular duty.  The third category is, in general terms, expenses incurred in the context of the job.  As the Deputy noted, the way the system operated down through the years was of a patchwork nature.  In other countries, there might have been more straightforward mechanisms for dealing with particular claims that would be applicable only to one sector and would be awarded on that basis.</p></speech>

There were a number of closures last year.  The Commissioner will submit his policing plan, which will cover the particular issue raised by the Deputy, towards the end of this month.  The reality is that, out of approximately 700 Garda stations, 39 were closed last year, eight of which were previously closed stations which were not reopened.  It is part of an ongoing rationalisation of the structure of policing in the State.  As those stations were there since the foundation of the State, they would have been there when the British were here and there was a requirement for different reasons to have a widespread network of police stations.  The evolution of policing since then means that the same number of stations is not needed.  Effectively, what the Commissioner is doing is to try to deploy resources to the best effect to deliver what might be loosely described as smart policing.  Advances in technology facilitate that.  The Garda Commissioner and the Minister are acutely aware of the views of local communities if a Garda station is closed.  The intention is that, rather than have a Garda sitting in a rural Garda station dealing, perhaps, with the stamping of passport forms, the resources can be deployed in a more active way in that area.  Without getting into details, there are many ways of dealing with the gap left following the closure of a one-man Garda station, which can result in a more visible Garda presence in an area.</p><p>  An issue that is being examined in the context of the stations that have closed - in conjunction with the Office of Public Works, which has responsibility for the buildings - is whether those buildings could be made available to local communities and in turn-----</p></speech>

We have had discussions on the matter.  The Chairman of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality made a good suggestion on this matter, which is being examined.  The availability of those buildings would then facilitate a requirement for a Garda presence on an occasional basis.  There are other ways of dealing with the issue.  The Garda has vehicles that could be used to give an indication of a visible Garda presence even in areas in which Garda stations have closed.  The point I am trying to make is that the deployment of resources is an operational matter for the Commissioner.

At a time when we are closing banks and post offices and abolishing town councils, particularly in rural areas, the closure of Garda stations is significant for communities that have lost a great deal in the past year.  The Department needs to present this carefully as more effective and better policing and reassure the public that the changes will allow for and result in better policing.  When people hear that the Garda station is closing they think of one thing - no police.  The issue needs to be carefully presented and explained to the people.  Sometimes the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not great at explaining those issues.  It is quite focused, and the Department does have a role.</p></speech>

Therefore, one could be made work up to 60, 70 or 80 hours per week if the prison or the institution where one worked needed one.  We took a case in this regard to the High Court in the early 1980s, which went to the Supreme Court.  The case involved a female prison officer in Limerick Prison who was pregnant at the time and the State ruled that the governor of the prison had the authority to compel any prison officer to work overtime.  That is still the case today.  We now do it by a different mechanism, known as additional hours, which evolved from the 2005 agreement.  There is not the same recourse to compulsory overtime now that we had in those days.</p></speech>

If one examines the IBEC booklet on the idea behind annualised hours and their introduction, one will observe that in places where the use of overtime was endemic and people were working very long hours, there was a high sick leave record.  When annualised hours programmes are introduced, we tend to see a drop in sick leave taken because people do not work as much.  They have more time off and get used to the system.  If we went out to our members today and asked them to return to an overtime system, they would not want to reverse the clock at all.</p></speech>

We went to conciliation to design a new work system.  We never got involved in the negotiations on what the outcome of the payment would be.  We decided at an early stage that both parties, management and ourselves, would design a system and that we would then go before the Civil Service Arbitration Board which decided on the payments.  The reason for taking this approach -  Deputy Deasy referred to this when trying to get to the explanation of how the system of industrial relations evolved - is that during that time we could not have put in a pay claim through the normal conciliation and arbitration scheme in operation because we were precluded from doing so by the national wage agreements which only allowed workers to enter a claim through their conciliation and arbitration scheme on what would be considered a minor change.  The agreement on a new work system was considered to be a huge productivity agreement and, as such, a major change.  Therefore, we had to deal with it in the fashion we did.  We went through a period of approximately 14 months of conciliation to come up with wide-ranging new work practices.  Then, everything to do with the pay elements was put before the Civil Service Arbitration Board which decided on the payments arising from the process.</p></speech>

A fairly common scenario would have been where there was tension in a particular section of a prison which would have required the deployment of additional staff.  The only way in which a governor could have provided for that increased deployment, outside the normal core attendance hours, was by way of having staff do overtime.  The system encouraged that arrangement.  As Mr. Clinton pointed out, in any front-line service where staff are working a seven day week, 24 hour system, there tend to be gaps in attendance which must be filled in some way.  The annualised hours system enabled the prison service to manage that need for flexibility and ensure every eventuality was covered.</p><p>  As I said, the overtime bill, after growing incrementally over a period, had reached &euro;65 million by 2005.  The new system enabled the delivery of services within a much reduced budget.  One could say any reform one seeks to introduce in the public sector, particularly in more recent years, must have as a condition that it will not impact on the delivery of services.  In fact, under the Croke Park agreement, there is a requirement to deliver improved services with reduced cost levels.  The proposal for organisational change was a very good example of how, with co-operation and pragmatic engagement, it was possible to deliver significant savings.  By any standard, knocking &euro;30 million per annum off a bill of &euro;65 million is a very significant achievement.  This was not achieved easily but only after a long, drawn-out process of negotiation and its implementation, as with any new system, brought its own difficulties.</p></speech>

Overtime was discretionary in the sense that if there was a need for additional officers to be in place in a particular prison at a particular time, a call had to be made.  It is not an easy operational call to make.  A governor might be informed, for example, that growing tension on a particular wing is pointing to the likelihood of a heave or other disciplinary incident.  I do not need to explain the risk involved in such a scenario, where the governor must decide whether the need to bring in additional staff outweighs the corresponding increase in the overtime bill.  In a normal public service setting a shortfall in staffing might lead to a temporary delay in the processing of applications or something like that.  On the other hand, if something goes wrong in a prison setting, it can go very wrong.  Difficult calls have to be made in these circumstances.</p></speech>

This review formed the basis of the negotiations that followed with the staff association.  What enabled the delivery of the service was an agreed change in the structures and levels of staffing required to run a prison.  That is what facilitated the delivery of the same service without the equivalent level of overtime and at a saving of &euro;30 million per annum.</p><p>  In many ways, this agreement was the forerunner of the Irish Prison Service's engagement with the Croke Park agreement.  One of the benefits of having gone through that process, difficult as it was, is that it gave the service a template for future efficiency improvements.  That mechanism or engagement has been adopted by the service in its consultations and negotiations with the Prison Officers Association in respect of the savings required to be made under the Croke Park agreement.  It is one of the reasons the service has been very much to the forefront in meeting these requirements</p></speech>

However, one explanation is that there are 13 separate allowances that would apply in some instances under the additional hours system.  The pay-off in the introduction of the additional hours system was the ongoing saving of &euro;30 million plus each year.  Perhaps the downside is that administratively, it is difficult.  I referred to the difficult negotiating process and the difficulties in implementing the new agreement.  One downside in this regard is that one has this plethora of allowances that all fall under the additional hours heading.  However, the upside and pay-off are the ongoing saving of &euro;30 million a year.  I assure the Deputy that were it possible to deliver the same or an enhanced level of service with these levels of percentage savings, the administrative inconvenience of being obliged to do it this way, about which the Deputy is absolutely right, is a price we would willingly pay to deliver such reforms and highly significant savings.</p></speech>

It is the most effective and efficient payroll system in the public service.  However, on the point made by the Deputy as to whether one could bundle them all up and include them as core pay, there is one issue associated with doing something like this.  If I am correct, the additional allowances are not pensionable, whereas core pay is.  Consequently, there are issues one must consider in that context.</p></speech>

If one looks at the figures, the centre must deal with approximately 13,500 garda&iacute;, 3,500 Irish Prison Service staff and the Department's staff of just under 2,000.  There are another four payrolls for other Departments, although I acknowledge all of them involve much smaller numbers.</p></speech>

As we were saying earlier, many of the allowances would have evolved over a long period.  They would have been there going right back to the British days.  A review is nearing completion that will address the issue of allowances.  It is being done in consultation with the court presidents and the Association of Judges.  It is looking at streamlining some of the more convoluted elements of the allowance system.</p></speech>

The Deputy probably saw in newspaper reports in recent days that new judges' attire is being introduced, which will reduce the cost substantially.  Our Minister introduced legislation which meant that judges did not have to wear wigs.  Indeed, I think that some of them would not have done it voluntarily.</p></speech>

One is for whatever circumstances or additional hours are over and above the norm.  Another covers special skills, and the last is for expenses necessarily incurred in carrying out duties.  If judges had to wear particular attire in those circumstances it is justifiable to say that those would be permitted as allowances.</p></speech>

I was probably being a bit frivolous about the wig allowance.  However, I am seriously concerned about some of the allowances judges get, which people do not seem to know anything about.

I thank them also for the amount of work they have prepared and the information that is available for this session.</p><p>  I will begin with two points.  All of the business cases for the allowances were shared with us.  The business cases I have received so far from the Department of Justice and Equality are of the highest quality of any I have seen.  That applies to the details and the quality of the rationale for why some things are needed.  It certainly brought to light the role that some of the allowances play.  The State Pathologist's call-out allowance is an example.  In the business case, a point was made that in the last competition to recruit a forensic pathologist, which was run twice by the Department, in neither case was it successful in recruiting a single qualified pathologist.  It certainly puts this issue in an interesting light.  I will come in a moment to whether an allowance is the right way to deal with that, but I want to acknowledge that the quality of business case here is very strong.</p><p>  The second, more general, point is that a week ago I spent a morning in St. Patrick's juvenile detention centre.  I went in completely oblivious to the fact that a report was coming out the following week.  I genuinely did not know, but it sharply illustrated the kind of work that people do in an environment like that.  The work is really difficult, as are the challenges people face.  I did not get a chance to say it in the D&aacute;il, so I will take the opportunity to do so now.  I met the new governor and deputy governor, as well as many staff who all said they wanted to rise to the challenge of the report that was coming out.  They really impressed me.  I found it a very informative and quite searing experience.  When we are having this discussion about allowances it helps me to understand the kind of work that is going on.  I wanted to record that.</p> <p> Regarding Vote 21 for the Irish Prison Service, will Mr. Purcell explain how the annualised hours system arose and the subsequent savings delivered to the taxpayer?  He stated in reply to a question from Deputy Shane Ross that there were 13 allowances under the annualised hours umbrella.  Will he explain what they comprise?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-25a.264" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Purcell" time="12:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012102500014#N00200"><p>There are 12 separate allowances that refer to different aspects of night duty.  Typically, an officer could be in receipt of six separate allowances which add up to the normal night duty payment.  There are 13 allowances that are part of normal remuneration.  They include the allowances for additional hours, bonus hours and pooled hours and the operational allowance.  There are various sub-divisions of pooled hours and bonus hours.  When an officer is unable to attend for an additional hours shift, he or she loses pay and the hours are pooled, that is, they are kept available for another officer to work within that quarter.  Regarding bonus hours, the minimum length of a shift for additional hours is eight hours.  If an officer has less than eight hours remaining, he or she will be paid for those hours, although they cannot be actually worked.  There are also allowances for retro hours and back payments for hours not included in staff pay for the relevant pay period.  Other allowances are simply explained such as extra payments for attendance on a Saturday and Sunday, unsocial hours, night-time duties, Christmas and public holidays.</p></speech>

As the minimum length of a shift is eight hours under the additional hours system, if an officer works all of his or her hours except for four, he or she will receive a credit for it.  With escalating overtime costs, it was decided to examine rostering arrangements in 2001.  Annualised hours systems were examined in several private sector companies.  One of the advantages of this system is that it encourages smart working.  An employee is paid within the band he or she works.  If one is in a 360 hour band, one is paid for 360 hours and it is supposed to encourage people to work smart.  It was one of the underpinning planks of the system.  However, we have had to cope with a massive increase in the numbers in custody with a 10% reduction in prison staff.  This has put a great strain on the additional hours system.  The reality is that every officer has to work his or her full amount of hours.</p></speech>

In the Defence Forces there are 63.  One view the Department of Defence put to us was that the Defence Forces was in its own mini-world in that it had its own surgeons, engineers and so forth, meaning it had a high number of allowances to cover this.  There are more people in the Irish Prison Service in receipt of more allowances than we have seen in other case studies.  For example, 1,476 prison officers are in receipt of more than one allowance, 1,390 are in receipt of more than eight allowances and 1,000 are in receipt of 12 allowances.  What the committee has seen so far is that even if there are many allowances, many may not be claiming them.  This is different in the Irish Prison Service where there are many allowances and most prison officers claim them.  Is this caused by the additional hours system?</p></speech>

There are 13 separate allowances under the additional hours system which accounts for a significant number of the allowances.  It depends on what band a prison officer is in and what way he or she is rostered within it.  That is the main reason so many are on a high number of allowances.</p></speech>

This goes back to the reform to deal with the cost of overtime we discussed.  Would Mr. Purcell be able to produce a table that stripped out the additional hours in order that we could see the lay-down of additional pensionable allowances?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-25a.270" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Purcell" time="12:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012102500015#O00100"><p>We could do that.  In addition to that, the other main ones are the rent allowance, the operational allowance, the Saturday and Sunday payments and the nights allowance because staff are rostered on nights as well.  The additional hours allowance and these allowances comprise the bulk of the allowances.  Other allowances are there but the Deputy will see from the figures and the business case we have provided that relatively small numbers are on the other allowances.  The bulk of staff are covered by additional hours and the five or six I mentioned.  We can give the Deputy something.</p></speech>

The way Mr. Purcell has helped us to understand this allowance is that it was brought in to deal with the overtime issue.  It saved &euro;30 million and it is not pensionable.  It is a payment that ties into additional work that is being done.  It would be helpful to understand when something such as this is stripped out what it looks like.</p></speech>

We have covered off the first issue, which is more people are in receipt of more allowances and Mr. Purcell has given an explanation for that.  The further one goes up the income ladder, the lower the percentage of allowances is as a percentage of the total compensation.  As I go further up the income tier, staff are claiming fewer allowances and they are worth less, which is what the committee has seen elsewhere.  However, this graph is striking because that trend does not emerge as clearly.  For example, 32.45% of the deputy governor's total compensation is still allowance related.  It is 41% for assistant chief officers and 40% for prison officers.  There is not the change that we see elsewhere.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-25a.274" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Purcell" time="12:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012102500015#O00500"><p>One of the explanations, which does not cover it totally, is that all the ranks up to chief officer are rostered.  It is not on exactly the same basis as the basic rate prison officers but they are on rosters.  Some of the allowances paid to the deputy governor and assistant governor are a result of them working a five day roster, which includes attendance at weekends.  The prisons operate on a 24 hour, seven day week basis.  That would partly explain why the Deputy cannot see the tapering off that he expects but all the staff right up to chief officer are rostered.  For example, assistant chief officers are on a seven day roster.</p></speech>

We deal with the Garda Vote next week and rostering plays a prominent role in its activities.  It will be interesting if I see a similar trend emerging.</p></speech>

The allowances tend to fall within three categories: first, the nature of the work or the unsocial hours aspect; second, additional duties; and third, expenses necessarily incurred.  Sometimes that element can be reflected in the levels they are paid as well.</p></speech>

We saw a good example when one tries to look at the 13 different elements of the additional hours payment.  It is an example of when one has a plethora of different allowances for different purposes covering broadly those three core areas I mentioned.  I can understand how difficult it can be for an outsider and it can be difficult for an insider sometimes to grasp completely what it is.  That is one of the reasons, in providing the briefing material, we tried to make it as comprehensive as possible.  I very much appreciate the Deputy's compliment to the people who prepared the briefing material but it was done in that context.  It is a complex area and we tried to give as much information while, at the same time, not making it too confusing.  I hope we have partially got that balance right.</p></speech>

It is about presentation.  I would like to hear Mr. Clinton's input on this as well.

I speak only in terms of the sectors covered by the justice family.  It also leads to a situation where, because of the nature of the work, the elements of the public service that would be delivering front-line services, and some of them on a 24-7 basis, get much more in terms of allowances, both numerically and as a percentage of their pay, than perhaps the majority of public servants.  I agree with Deputy O'Donnell that, essentially, perhaps one is seeing an unfair focus on the very groups which provide the front-line services.  From that point of view, Deputy O'Donnell is probably right that it would be better if there were a much more compact remuneration structure where there was not this plethora of allowances.  Even an insider would look at them and scratch his head trying to work out exactly what way the payments are made, who gets them, who is entitled to get them, why someone would get them now and then would not get them, and the complexities that go with it.  I think Deputy O'Donnell is right.</p></speech>

The central agreement was agreed between the public services committee, in the public service context, of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Department of Finance and nobody was allowed to get a pay claim outside of that.  When we went into the negotiations in relation to bringing in the annualised hours package, we were restricted in the methodology in how we could do it and, therefore, we were only able to seek at the arbitration board an allowance in the nature of pay rather than a pay increase.</p></speech>

If one goes into the 24-7 type work that 80% to 90% of our members do, one is automatically attracting allowances for what is core pay.  One of the good aspects of having gone through the 2005 agreement was that when we entered into the Croke Park negotiations, we had agreed with the employer that we would sit down and do a cost neutral review of all allowances paid in the Irish Prison Service and match them then to the Irish Prison Service strategic objectives.  That was agreed prior to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform looking into these with its review of allowances.  We had agreed that in the Croke Park agreement.</p></speech>

I will pick up on that point made by Deputy Donohoe.  In terms of the business cases that we have received from Departments, those of the Departments of Justice and Equality and Social Protection are excellent compared with the rest.  They contain a great deal of detail and one can really get into it and understand the rationale for the particular allowance whatever it may be.</p><p>  Of the review of the 88 priority allowances taking place that the Minister, Deputy Howlin, has asked for, how many are in the Irish Prison Service?</p></speech>

At the moment, we must look at which allowances are being paid and where that is going to go.  I suppose there are a number of issues relating to that.  The first challenge is to determine how these allowances, among those that have been abolished for the new beneficiaries but still apply to current beneficiaries, can be dealt with.  The second would be to look at the ones that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has stated would remain in payment yet would be subject to modification as to what exactly those modifications would be.  Overlapping or covering all of that is doing that in consultation, given the fact that the exercise has to be carried out within the parameters of the Croke Park agreement.  If there is to be any agreement on that, it will have to be done on that particular basis.</p></speech>

That task review delivered a structure that enabled the prison system to run with a reduced level.  It enabled the system to run with the total number of additional hours based on four bands raising from a zero band right up to 360.  I think it was roughly a zero band, 110 hours, 240, 360, or something like that.  So the review of the tasks within the prison delivered a structure that enabled the prisons to run with those additional hours so that one was not in a position where one had to rely on overtime to cover the shortfalls.</p></speech>

I know the point the Deputy is making and on a very basic level if one has X number of staff and Y budget, X plus 100 staff reduces the overall costs if one gets them in that way.  What one has in these circumstances is that one ends up with additional staff.  To be honest, given the nature of the work within the prison system and the fact that it is 24-7, there are advantages in having facilities to cover particular peaks and valleys.  One has a more flexible system.  if one goes down the route of getting in additional staff, one loses some of the flexibilities that are required.  The reality is in the circumstances we find ourselves in, one certainly would not be looking at recruiting extra staff.</p></speech>

It would have been argued that it would have been cheaper to hire staff than continuing to pay more than 10% of the salary budget just to cover the additional hours.  Somebody must have suggested it would have been cheaper to get more people into the system.</p></speech>

I cannot remember the exact nature of the discussions.  A lot of the original consideration of this would have dated back.  They first started examining this particular issue in the mid-1990s and an awful lot of consideration and negotiation actually went in.  I think the actual period of negotiation probably lasted about three or four years.</p></speech>

However, we had to replace it with a system that would deliver the service required to run our prisons.  Again, this was done through negotiation and agreement.  If one simply makes an unilateral announcement that certain changes are being made, there might well be a fallout in terms of industrial action, including, in this case, strikes within prisons.  In order to move in the direction in which we wanted to go, we could only proceed by agreement.</p></speech>

As I said, additional hours and those types of arrangements are very effective over time in terms of dealing with the peaks and troughs of demand in particular areas.  Simply appointing additional staff will not necessarily provide the flexibility necessary to respond to an institution's particular needs.  In a 24-7 operation, one will never get to a point where service delivery is covered simply by having staff employed on a basic level of provision.</p></speech>

However, when the cost of overtime is such a large figure and such a large percentage of the basic pay bill, one would assume that bringing in additional staff would be a significant component of reform which would significantly reduce the demand for additional hours on the service.  In addition to flexibility in assigning some level of additional hours to existing staff, appointing additional personnel would surely see a reduction in the number of additional hours being paid.</p></speech>

It was undertaken by an internal review team, with some external consultancy assistance.  Essentially, however, it was an internal staffing review, the findings of which formed the basis for the negotiations that underpinned the eventual agreement.</p></speech>

I am trying to get an idea of exactly how personnel are deployed.  Nobody becomes a prison officer with the expectation that he or she will be working 9 to 5.  It is not that type of job.</p></speech>

This would be the case, for instance, for the officer in charge of the school, which is open five days per week in the same manner as regular schools.  We want to align rosters with role requirements so that, for example, an officer whose tasks are most beneficially performed from Monday to Thursday, inclusive, say, is rostered accordingly.  In the case of other tasks, such as the more basic disciplinary tasks, there is not the same specific rostering requirement.  For officers working on the landings, at the gates or performing escort duties, for instance, the normal shift pattern which applies to the bulk of staff is suitable.</p></speech>

Additional payments over and above the amount allocated for the additional hours have been completely eliminated.  That is where the annual saving of &euro;30 million comes from.  As I said earlier, a 50% reduction in a payment of that type is a fairly good outcome in terms of any reorganisation.</p></speech>

The average pay in this State is higher than in some jurisdictions and perhaps not as high as in others.  By and large, however, prison officers in Ireland are well paid.  This is a reflection of the nature of the job they do.  It is not a job that everybody would want to do or could do.</p></speech>

It is a very important job and this must be reflected in the pay and conditions of employment.

We need to make sure pay is fair not just here but in every area of the public sector so that one does not find media or public commentary that people are getting paid too much or too little, and we will actually know and be confident in the figures we are paying out.  A salary of &euro;62,000 is a good one and is more than a pilot makes.  Pilots must work incredibly irregular hours and the job is stressful with a huge amount of responsibility.  The lives of people on every flight one takes are at stake and one needs a huge amount of very expensive training that takes a number of years.  When I compare those two salaries it seems excessive, but we have nothing against which to benchmark it properly.  It is important we do that job rigorously and thoroughly across the public sector in order that we can stand over these payments.  Does the figure stand up when one takes into account allowances that clearly should be core pay, as was identified here, taking them on top of core pay and calculating what that actually gives one?  That work should be done, but I will leave it on that note.</p></speech>

In respect of comparisons across the public sector, we earn &euro;92,000 as Deputies, so if one takes it on that simple calculation, &euro;62,000 is a good wage.  It would not strike me as excessive and I do not know if I am alone in remembering the saga around the introduction of annualised hours.  I remember there was huge and legitimate concern about endemic overtime and the kinds of practice it encouraged within the service.  I acknowledge that all of the stakeholders stepped up to the plate and signed off on an agreement which unquestionably returned big savings for the State and, hopefully, a return in respect of quality of working life for individual officers within the service.</p><p>  I calculated that a 24-7 operation works out as almost 9,000 hours per annum.  If one calculates that across each place of detention, one is looking at a huge number of woman or man hours dedicated within the system.  Looking at the list of allowances, I can see that the Department has managed to consolidate the payments system to deal with the issue of overtime and to introduce the flexibility required by the system.  However, running in parallel with it is this oddity which extends even to the naming of different allowances.  I understand how that does not sit all that comfortably in the minds of the public.  The public could ask why these additional payments are being made to officers and so on.  The challenge is to consolidate it even more and recognise those elements that are core pay as such.  It is as much a presentational point as one concerning pounds, shillings and pence.</p><p>  I note from looking at the list that the service does not have some of the more exotic allowances that some other sectors have, although I am curious to learn who the laundress is.  There is one recipient of the laundress allowance, which is &euro;8.</p></speech>

If one looks at the grades listed, such as trades officers, clerks and even chief officers, one can see nobody whose salary level jumps out until one gets to governor and prison campus governor level.  Then one starts to see what would be considered very generous salaries.  We can investigate whether those are merited but, going across those middle and final entries, nothing jumps out at me.

It is a cost containment exercise on the part of the State.  The Minister has indicated he recognises that many of the allowances form part of what is called core pay.  He has conceded the system is ragged at the edges and not terribly coherent.  On several occasions he stated the longer-term view is towards a new system of payment in the public sector.  I am not trying to trip Mr. Purcell up, I am just trying to get a sense of whether the issue has been raised.</p></speech>

Existing allowances will remain for current beneficiaries but they will be examined in the review.  As I stated, initial discussions have commenced on this.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is examining modifying elements of certain allowances which it has been decided will remain but will be reviewed.  We are engaging on this basis and if this is the question Deputy is asking, then the initial steps have been taken on this.</p></speech>

When the new pension arrangements were introduced for the public service, new entrants were put on a different footing to those in service.  We now see a similar gap opening up between serving officers and new entrants with regard to allowances.  What is Mr. Clinton's view on this?  In a practical day-to-day sense, especially in a workplace with annualised hours and a particular methodology in place, what effect is this likely to have on the operation of the service?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-25a.447" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Clinton" time="13:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012102500020#T01500"><p>If people are on completely different pay scales, which is what will happen if some of the allowances we have will not be given to new entrants, it will create a morale problem from the start.  We are very concerned about the new pension scheme mentioned by Deputy McDonald because it appears to us that the fast accrual grades will take a much bigger hit.  At present the multiplier used means the new pension scheme will cause someone working in the prison service for 40 years to get less than someone in a general Civil Service grade because the person in the prison service pays in 1% more.  This is a huge anomaly.</p><p>  With regard to the wider question the Deputy asked the Secretary General, we have not been asked by ICTU's public services committee to discuss these issues with the employer.  We see this as something being done centrally through the public services committee.  Allowances that are not unique to us, such as the rent and attendance allowances, would have to be discussed with other public service unions and, in turn, with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></speech>

Some of our new recruits who started in recent years have had a 10% pay cut and it is something they speak about.  It is the reality of where the country is and we simply must deal with it.  To meet our pay bill costs, there will have to be reductions.  We must cope with it and deal with it.  We must be brave and face it.  The salary scales which exist cannot be sustained.</p></speech>

This is to relieve prison officers from administrative duties in order that they can be on the front line.  We have been very innovative in trying to introduce this grade, which will allow some scope by creating a clear differential for front-line workers.  Our front-line workers are those who are on the landings every day.  They are the people we need to protect and who should draw the majority of the allowances.  Over time, the more one moves away from prisoners, the more one can attract allowances, which does not seem right.  We have been innovative in introducing other grades at almost half the pay of a standard prison officer to release that prison officer for front-line duties.</p></speech>

I ask Mr. Donnellan to talk me through them.  These include clerk to the suicide review forum and clerk to the security committee in Portlaoise, and I think I saw on the screen an allowance for clerk to the prison visiting committees.  The savings involved are extremely modest and amount to hundreds of euro.</p></speech>

Previously we had prison officer clerk grades who serviced the committees.  In future these committees will be serviced by the new administrative grade which will not receive any allowances.  We are trying to develop a system whereby the committees will administer themselves.  Therefore, all of these allowances will be gone when the administrative grade is fully introduced.</p></speech>

Rather, they have been knocked on the head, as it were.  We went through the common Civil Service allowances with the Department recently.  In Mr. Purcell's letter to the clerk of the committee, Mr. McEnery, Mr. Purcell noted that Vote 24's allowances in respect of staff at children's detention schools had not been included in the attached lists and so on because the functions had been transferred to the new Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p></speech>

Mr. Purcell discussed reform within the system, annualised hours and so forth.  In the Department of Justice and Equality, the Irish Prison Service and so on, much of the discussion of allowances is on cost containment, not reform.  We need a useful discussion on reform of the delivery of services, among other things.</p></speech>

Under the terms of the Croke Park agreement, Mr. Donnellan, his team, Mr. Clinton and the people from the Prison Officers Association, POA, are examining ways to deliver new regimes within the Irish Prison Service that will facilitate a better delivery of services to prisoners in a more effective and efficient way from the perspective of the taxpayer and management.  Mr. Donnellan described the introduction of campus arrangements and the ensuing efficiencies, for example, the civilianisation of office administration.  A task review has been carried out.  The work done under the proposal on organisational change set a template on how to proceed.  Tasks are being examined in the context of providing better regimes to prisoners.  A core element of this is an incentivised regime system that will facilitate the better delivery of services by staff across the 14 prisons and increased efficiencies in terms of staffing arrangements.  It will also provide a better working environment for the staff and a better living environment for the prisoners.</p><p>  The work being done by Mr. Donnellan and his team in consultation and negotiation with the POA is delivering real change.  It is not just a question of money, although that is a significant element.  We are delivering significant savings, but we are also in the process of delivering a much reformed system.</p></speech>

The task is considerable.  The expectation is that the anomalies within the pay system will be ironed out so that the public understands what is being paid for and the service staff are not undermined by the perception that they are getting money for old rope.  Although this is important, the broader reform tag is a world away from anything as banal as the payment of allowances.  One wants a result for the taxpayer at many levels, including value for money, rehabilitation of serial offenders, and so forth.  The people running the service know this better than anyone else.</p></speech>

We are trying for a balance between achieving significant cash savings and efficiencies and delivering a better service.  As the Deputy rightly stated, this work must be placed in the context of an ever-increasing number of committals into custody.  There are two sets of figures.  Since 2008, the number has increased by 28%.  In the same period, the number actually in custody has increased by 25% and the number in the system has increased by 30%, by which I mean people who are in custody or on temporary or reviewable release.</p><p>  If the three elements - efficiencies, delivery of savings and improved and reformed services - were occurring on a level playing field, they would comprise a significant achievement.  However, undertaking this process at a time when committal and custody numbers are going through the roof puts it in a different context.</p></speech>

We are here to ensure value for money and fair play.  The additional hours payments are a fundamental part of core pay.  Having examined the chart detailing additional hours, it seems it is almost the only category that is not pensionable.  Why is this?  Everybody has indicated that, essentially, all of these allowances are part of core pay, but because of the social partnership agreement they had to be negotiated outside it.  They had to be called allowances because there could be no pay increases.  Why are they not pensionable?</p></speech>

The purpose of the meeting is to consider the 2013 allocation for the Estimate of Vote 30 - Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine.  I remind Members and witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery to switch off their mobile telephones.  I remind Members of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  </p><p>  Members will be aware that in December 2011 the Government published its comprehensive expenditure report.  That report sets out the Government's decision on expenditure ceilings of each Department for each of the years 2012 to 2014.  It indicates specific measures to be introduced by Departments to achieve necessary savings and to remain within their ceilings for 2012 and 2013.  This is a first for all of us.  I invite the Minister to make his opening comments following which I will open the meeting to Members to tease out some of the issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-25a.566" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012102500003#D00300"><p>I welcome the opportunity to appear before the committee and hope we can have a constructive dialogue.  It is not possible for me to outline the budget for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine today, which will be presented in six weeks time.  That would be an unreasonable ask.  What we are trying to do is to have more active discussion in the build up to the budget in order that we can have constructive discussion rather than political point scoring but Members have to decide what they want to do with this today.  I will be as open as I can.  For a start I cannot give the decisions that will be made in six weeks time because most of those decisions have not yet been made.  However, I hope that some of the output today will help to inform those decisions.  I want to put the context clearly on the table in order that everybody is aware of the challenges in terms of the expenditure ceilings within which we are operating and the priorities in terms of how we spend money and get best value for it.</p><p>  We had this problem last year.  One of the real difficulties we face is that every Department has expenditure ceilings set for it, essentially by outsiders.  If we spend over those ceilings we do not get the money.  It is important that people understand that.  Certainly those who had been in government before this Government will understand that.  It is not a place where anybody enjoys being but it is reality.  The expenditure ceilings for this year have been outlined in information provided but essentially those ceilings, in terms of capital expenditure, are &euro;168 million, and in terms of current expenditure are &euro;1.057 billion.  We have two choices - to operate within those ceilings or to get a ceiling increase from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which means other Departments have to take a lowering of their ceiling.  The overall expenditure programme and expenditure ceiling for Government is fixed.  People need to understand that.  When people say it has been a very difficult year for farming and, therefore, one cannot touch any of the schemes, the way I am able to respond to that request is in the context of having rigid expenditure ceilings that can only be changed by the Minister for Finance or Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform agreeing to take money from another Department to spend in our Department.  It is important that we have a real conversation rather than one based on emotion or anything else.  </p><p>  It has been a difficult year.  It is a more difficult environment in which to put a budget together than this time last year when there had been a combination of good weather, good yields and good prices in most sectors, with the exception of pigs and potatoes.  As farmers made more from the marketplace last year than they would normally make it was a little easier to find ways of reducing expenditure.  My priorities last year in the build up to the budget were clear, to protect farm incomes while targeting resources towards active farmers, to support productivity and upskilling of farmers, where possible, to ensure the continued development of the agrifood sector through investment in research and development, food safety, animal welfare and enterprise development in line with the Food Harvest 2020 strategy which, as pointed out regularly by Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and others, was a strategy of the previous Government.  I acknowledge it is a good strategy and we are trying to implement it.  </p><p>  I have the twin priority of trying to ensure farmers can be as profitable as possible from the marketplace while recognising the reality that there are many farmers who do not have the capacity to make a good deal of money from the marketplace and who are heavily reliant on the schemes and the single farm payment for their income.  It is my job to get the best possible deal within expenditure ceilings and within the CAP reform process which we are negotiating to keep that income stream as strong as possible.  We have been around the country talking to farmers about how we are planning to do that in terms of setting priorities.  Both of those approaches, in terms of fulfilling the potential of Food Harvest 2020 and the income potential for farmers as well as supporting people on the land who do not have the potential to benefit from Food Harvest 2020, are equally important in drawing up a budget.</p><p>  What are the expenditure ceilings for this year?  I have given the figures but they only become real when compared with last year's figures.  Essentially we are being asked to make savings on the current side of &euro;87 million and on the capital side of &euro;27 million, that is, &euro;114 million which will not be easily found.  As the committee asked we have included some areas where there will be savings if we do nothing from a policy point of view given that certain schemes are less expensive next year than this year, such as REPS, suckler cow welfare scheme and other savings to be made through driving efficiencies in the Department and in its agencies.  The efficiencies that have happened since 2009 which have been driven within the Department regardless of who has been Minister, are impressive.  Since 2009 we have made savings in the cost of running the Department of about &euro;70 million.  We have reduced staff numbers by approximately 900.  In respect of the 58 district veterinary offices around the country we are in the process of reducing the number to 17 while maintaining the same standard and quality of services that farmers expect.  In fact, we are improving the service.  Payments in respect of disadvantaged areas scheme, REPS, agri-environment options scheme, single farm payments have issued ahead of any previous year.  We are trying to do our best to make savings, to reduce the cost of delivery of services, through everything from salaries to overtime, to staff numbers, offices, capital infrastructure to getting a better deal in respect of tendering and contracts as regards outsourcing some services.</p></speech>

It does not take the IMF to tell me that one cannot forever spend more on voted expenditure than one is taking in tax.  I do not need any outsider to tell me that.  The only people who maintain that one can keep spending more on current expenditure than is being collected in revenue are those living in cloud cuckoo land.  The IMF is not dictating this.  It is common sense that one cannot live beyond one's means.  We were engaged in cuts long before the IMF was here and we were trying to explain to the Opposition at the time that one cannot spend more than one is earning.  Even if the bank debt was wiped away tomorrow, in total we are still spending more than we are earning.  We need to decide how those cuts will be implemented and where.  For the committee to have a meaningful input we need a good deal more information that we have received to date and I am seeking that information.  I hope the Minister will come back within one or two weeks to go through it again with the information on which we need to give a considered opinion.</p></speech>

This is a new process.  It has never happened before.  We are trying to be as open as we can and to get input from people who have experience and knowledge but who are not necessarily in government and therefore not directly inputting through the Department.  To be fair, my record is one of being as open as I can, whether in debates in the D&aacute;il or Seanad or in conversations in the committee.  I will continue in that vein but I will not expose myself to people who seek to abuse the process for political reasons.  The more constructive the conversation here, the more open I will be.

Are there any unexpected savings or has any extra expenditure cropped up during the course of 2012 that will have an impact on the sums of &euro;87 million and &euro;27 million?</p></speech>

I was unaware of it before my appointment to the Department but one such area is called EU disallowances.  Every year each country gets assessed by the Commission in terms of how they are implementing schemes and single farm payments and so on.  The Commission then makes a decision on the amount of receipts they will not return to member states and we must find that money elsewhere.  For example, the Netherlands had a disallowance figure of &euro;120 million because it did not implement a scheme in a way the Commission deemed acceptable.  We have disallowance bills as well and they vary depending on the scheme and the year and so on.  It is something of an unknown but I am pleased to say that we are performing well in respect of disallowances at the moment.  It is a potential unknown which could hit us next year.  We have managed to negotiate multiannual repayments of disallowances and this helps to ease the blow.  However, if one is looking for bills that appear out of left field, that is probably the most likely area, barring some disease outbreak or crisis in agriculture like the dioxin scare, which cost the Government more than &euro;100 million in payments.  One must budget for dealing with crises but one cannot budget for a crisis on that scale.</p><p>  I have taken some criticism for underpayment last year, which will not happen this year, but there is good reason for much of it and it relates to demand-led schemes and more successful disease control programmes than anticipated.  Significant savings were made for these reasons and we can go through the detail if people wish.  Ultimately, the best thing we can do today is focus on the budget in six weeks time.  If Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is serious about inputting into the process I will be serious about facilitating it.  This is a new process and it has the potential to be abused but I will try to work through it as we go along.</p></speech>

I now understand the great effort that has been made to present the information in this format.  If I am correct the Minister is scenario building <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> what are the possibilities in the budget in light of the executive function of Cabinet and the decision he will make as Minister when it comes to the budget.  I have an understanding of where we are.</p><p>  With respect to constructive proposals I call on the Minister to examine intensively certain areas, including the agencies, where savings could be secured with respect to direct costs to the Department.  In particular I am aware of an arrangement in Galway whereby the Department rents at a cost of approximately &euro;800,000 per annum a Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine building in Galway city while there is significant capacity in Teagasc in Athenry.  I am prepared to drill down and to help, support and back my Minister in terms of identifying where savings can be made if it means that we can open up opportunities, especially in the area of the suckler cow welfare scheme.  I would be alarmed if the Minister suggested that he was building a scenario whereby there could be a &euro;12 million saving next year based on the fact that it is possible that he could opt not to continue it.</p><p>  However, there is an economic argument for discussing the continuation of the scheme.  If my figures are correct, last year we exported almost 115,000 animals abroad under live export.  In terms of the cost of that scheme over a five year reference period, is it correct to state that it was a &euro;26 million scheme?  Let us suppose the average revenue secured for the cost of an animal was &euro;1,000.  That represents almost &euro;115 million to the local economy in terms of the potential spend <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the cost of the scheme.  There is a solid economic argument we should consider in this area.</p><p>  It is difficult not to play politics with this process.</p></speech>

There are specific areas for discussion within the Vote, dealing both with big ticket items and smaller ones.  I presume the Minister and his officials are examining each of these intensely with a view to identifying how savings can be made with the minimal impact.  That is what any Minister in any Government would seek to do.  We have ascertained that there is very little by way of extra savings accruing from 2012 to carry over into 2013.  The figures are &euro;87 million and &euro;27 million, with one scenario, which is to do nothing, allow the schemes to wind up and achieve savings in the order of &euro;48 million, which leaves some &euro;39 million.  I understand these savings are nearly all on the current expenditure side.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-25a.599" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012102500006#G00300"><p>With the Chairman's permission, I wish to explain why there is a specific structural problem on the capital side.  It is important that members understand why the expenditure ceiling is so rigid.  We started last year with a ceiling for capital expenditure of &euro;150 million.  Forestry alone accounts for &euro;110 million, which includes all forestry premia, at as cost of between &euro;70 and &euro;80 million, as well as afforestation and other grants.  All of that is deemed capital expenditure.  Taking out that &euro;110 million left us with only &euro;40 million to spend in all of our capital expenditure across fishing, targeted agricultural modernisation schemes and so on.  This posed a fundamental structural problem in terms of meeting our obligations and liabilities.  That is why we renegotiated an increase in the capital ceiling to &euro;168 million last year.  This will be retained in the coming years, notwithstanding the previous proposal that it be reduced.  The reason there is a 27% cut is that last year we managed to carry over savings from the previous year of &euro;27 million on the capital side, which pushed the capital envelope up to &euro;195 million, which is where we need to be.  Unfortunately, however, that carryover is not available this year because we have been much tighter in our allocations.</p><p>  As I said, it is important to have a clear understanding of this structural problem on the capital side.  While it is possible to transfer savings between current and capital budgets, we certainly do not want a situation where the entirety of our &euro;114 million of savings comes from the current side.  I am trying to deal with the structural problem on the capital side whereby the budget of &euro;168 million is simply not adequate, but it is very difficult to secure an increase in that ceiling at the Cabinet table.  The current expenditure ceiling is just over &euro;1 billion, which does not include the single farm payment of &euro;1.2 billion.  We cannot allow that sector to bear all the cost of the savings we have to make.  Attempts to address the structural problem in regard to capital will have a kick-on effect in other areas of expenditure.</p><p>  Does the Chairman propose that I answer members' questions individually as they are put to me?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-25a.600" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012102500006#G00400"><p>Chairman, I propose that we proceed in a more structured way.  It makes little sense to begin by discussing an individual saving of &euro;800,000, &euro;200,000 or whatever - that is like focusing on &euro;1 within a household budget.  We need to look at the big picture in a structured way.  I propose, through the Chair, that we lay out a programme of work under which we would look first at 2012, anticipating savings and so on for this year, before moving onto 2013.</p><p>  In that regard, I would like, before proceeding any further, to put a specific question to the Minister.  I accept there must be cuts in expenditure, but it is important that they are equitable across Departments.  In that context, will the Minister indicate the proposed percentage cut for his Vote as between 2012 and 2013 and how that compares with other Departments?  In other words, is agriculture taking a larger hit than other Departments in terms of the distribution of Exchequer funding?  Before getting into detail on particular spending programmes, we must consider the broader question of whether cutbacks have been spread equitably across the big spending Departments.</p></speech>

One can twist and turn these figures whatever way one wants.  In terms of the savings we are being asked to make versus other Departments next year, our figure is 8.5%.  My colleague is calculating the savings in respect of some other Departments and I will give the members those figures.  My job is to minimise the amount of cuts we have to make in our Department, first and foremost, around the Cabinet table and, second, to spend the money as constructively as we can.</p><p>  For the purposes of this meeting, the idea that we will able to make a decision on the amount of money we will spend next year is, with respect, a bit of a waste of time because that is an argument I have to win around the Cabinet table.  If we have to make savings what we could do here, and the members will find me to be constructive on this, is discuss how we might make and structure them.  For example, is the approach I took to DAS last year better than an approach of taking money off the top and, if we are taking money off the top, should we target the area for which farmers can apply in order that we prioritise smaller rather than bigger farmers?  Should we examine trying to differentiate between farmers in disadvantaged areas in terms of levels of disadvantage?  These are the kinds of difficult discussions into which the members could make an interesting input and to which I will listen and that will influence policy, but it is up to the members as to whether they want to be involved in that process.</p></speech>

In a follow-on to my initial question, the Minister might outline the mechanism in respect of European money, match funding and how that is calculated between the current and capital sides.  Second, on the suckler cow welfare scheme, I understand the Minister's point that for that scheme to operate next year, it would be necessary to introduce a new scheme.  The Minister should provide members with the anticipated cost of such a measure, as they would then know how much it would be necessary to find from another area were that option to be taken.  Obviously, it would then be necessary to make choices, as were one to operate such a scheme, it would be necessary to cut something else.</p></speech>

I am unsure whether I agree with my colleague, Deputy Keaveney, on the link between live exports and the suckler cow premium.  Nevertheless, there is a necessity to keep open the live exports channel.  While the great majority of live exports of calves are not from suckler cow herds but from dairy herds at present, it is necessary to keep open that channel to ensure the factories do not have a monopoly.  What can the Department do in this economic climate to ensure that?</p><p>  Second, I am not being politically disingenuous, as I realise this decision primarily will be made by my Labour Party colleague, Deputy Quinn, but does the Minister agree with the differentiation between productive and non-productive assets?  It is a budgetary decision, albeit not in agriculture, to differentiate between productive and non-productive assets in respect of third level grants.</p><p>  Finally, everything the Government does and every measure the Government takes in cutting expenditure must be considered in the context of the effect it will have on job creation.  One issue the Government has been pressing is food and whether incentives might be put in place.  Again, this may be an issue that is more for the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and my Labour Party colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, and I am not being disingenuous in this regard.  However, can measures be put in place to incentivise investment in secondary and tertiary production in the food sector and in plants to that effect?</p></speech>

First, as I note we did not finalise the manner in which the meeting was to work, I wish to establish there is no material impact on the 2013 budget as a result of either unexpected cost savings or additional expenditure from the 2012 allocation.  I seek clarity in respect of the 2013 figure.</p></speech>

He has said that the DAS savings will be &euro;15 million less than anticipated.  Does that mean he will have to hold back &euro;15 million of DAS payments from this year into next year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-25a.637" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012102500009#K00400"><p>Let me explain that.  On that question first, if we do not make the savings we had hoped to make on DAS, we will be paying out everything that we would have been paying out on DAS but we will have to make those savings from other areas this year.  We have had to re-jig our figures through the year, as we saw those savings or non-savings materialising.  We have had to factor that in.  In other words, if we save &euro;15 million rather than &euro;30 million this year on DAS we can deal with that in this year's budget.  All the payments that should and will be happening will be on schedule.  In fact, we are ahead of schedule on DAS payments.</p><p>  However, it has an implication for next year.  If one were to reduce the cost of DAS from &euro;200 million to &euro;190 million, which was the plan, and if one has only made &euro;15 million in savings rather than &euro;30 million, instead of it being &euro;90 million it is &euro;105 million next year.  Therefore, the starting point is higher which puts one under more pressure in terms of calculating knock-on savings from a smaller scheme.  That makes the budget arithmetic a bit more difficult.  It also means that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will be saying, and is saying to me: "Look, you said you were going to downsize this scheme to &euro;190 million rather than &euro;230 million; now you have to go ahead and fulfil that commitment." There are knock-on consequences of the decisions we made to try to be more surgical in making savings and being as fair as we possibly can to farmers.</p><p>  There are pros and cons in trying to do that differently.  It is easy to make a calculation on DAS if one just takes 5% off the top from everybody.  Maybe that is something we can discuss in more detail if we come back again.  We can specifically focus on DAS if members so wish, but that is the current position.  </p><p>  I wish to answer some of the other questions to try to be fair to everybody.  A number of committee members have talked about the pros and cons of live cattle exports.  My preference is to produce, raise and kill all the animals that we can in Ireland.  The jobs are in Irish factories, along with the added value.  That is where we control the Irish brand in terms of beef - which is a growing brand at the moment - quality and new markets.</p><p>  It is important to have the option of live cattle exports as a release valve.  As people keep saying, we have had a difficult year.  If we have a wet week an awful lot of farmers cannot afford to hold on to their animals.  They do not have space inside and they are forced to take animals to the factory.  They are vulnerable as regards the price they may have to accept for their animals, so we need an alternative.  That is why we are working hard on trying to get a boat to Libya or Egypt before the end of the year.  I need to impose acceptable and high veterinary standards on any such boat.  I have spoken to a number of potential live cattle exporters, some of whom have successfully done this in the past.  People are now actively looking at chartering a ship to take shipments of live cattle from Waterford and Cork.  They are hoping to do it in the next six weeks, if they can put the whole package together.  The Department has worked hard to put veterinary certificates in place with Libya most recently, but also with Egypt, to provide for that market if someone can put the business plan together to make it happen.  Farmers would really like that to happen because it would give them an outlet, particularly for the lower quality beef coming from the dairy herd where markets in the factory might not be as strong as they were previously.</p><p>  I wanted to let the committee know that that is happening and it is a positive story.  It is not something that we want a lot of but we do want it as an alternative option for farmers to ensure they get the value for their animals that they deserve in the market place.</p><p>  As regards productive assets, I do not want to be overly political but if one understands farming one will understand that a lot of farmers across the country are asset rich but cash poor.  The average farming income is approximately &euro;24,000 per year.  It is a lot higher for full-time farmers but many farmers do other things as well.  The idea that one could accurately measure a farmer's capacity to deal with the cost of sending sons and daughters to college by calculating that capacity to pay on the back of land assets and agriculture is not realistic.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, is doing what everyone expects him to do, which is to look at ways of making savings and ensuring that the money he has to spend on third-level grants goes to those who need it most.  Therefore, we need to go through that process.  My view, as it relates to farming, agriculture and small businesses generally is that one needs to be careful how one manages a family's ability to pay for the cost of third-level education.  Including assets in that mix is not an easy thing to do, so we need to be careful of it.  We are being careful of it, which is why there has not been any announcement to date.  I have spoken to the Minister, Deputy Quinn, about this on numerous occasions and he clearly understands my view on it.</p><p>  As regards the co-funding issue and ceilings, many people ask me why does money from Europe count against the country's expenditure ceilings.  It is a fair question.  When payments are 100% paid from the EU, like the single farm payment, they are not factored into ceilings.  However, all the co-funded schemes - even if they were 95% funded by the EU in terms of rebates - would still be counted as 100% against our ceiling.  That is the deal, I am afraid.  Essentially, the troika programme is about trying to reduce the size and scale of Government expenditure across the board, so that is why the ceiling applies to co-funded schemes as much as to schemes that are 100% funded by the State.  Of course, we need to be clever about how we manage that.  Obviously it makes sense for us to try to increase the co-funding element of schemes for the general Exchequer.  If I can do that it helps me to argue for an increase in ceilings, which is what we are trying to do.  </p><p>  While some people might say it is easy, in terms of expenditure ceilings, to introduce a new agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, because 70% of the money comes from Europe, it is not.  It is 100% of the cost but we have had that discussion in this committee before.  </p><p>  If we were to continue the suckler cow welfare scheme, the cost is about &euro;25 million annually.  If we do not reintroduce the new scheme, we will still be spending &euro;12 million next year.  That is because calves being born at the moment that are eligible for payments will be getting those payments next year.  That is the way it works.  Even if there was no suckler cow welfare scheme next year, nearly half the money we would normally be paying would still be paid out.  There are strategic aspects of the suckler cow welfare scheme which have been beneficial for Irish agriculture, yet were not anticipated at the start, such as data collection on breeding, how animals respond to feed conversion efficiency and age.  A whole series of others things also help us to make commercial strategic decisions that can help farmers make more money from their business.  The suckler cow welfare scheme has made a significant contribution to that type of strategic thinking due to the data it provides into the system.  We simply would not get those data from farmers if they were not in this scheme.  We need to weigh up how we can hold on to what has been really important for the scheme. </p></speech>

There have been some crazy refusals.  I had three cases last weekend of elderly farmers who had applied for derogations on medical grounds but were refused.

To cut to the chase, the Department gets a month-by-month expenditure list against profile and knows its expected outturn.</p></speech>

We could request all of this information under freedom of information.  However, it would be handier if we were just given it.</p><p>  I would like to get a breakdown of the various grades of staff in the Department and agencies under its aegis.  For example, in the case of Teagasc I want to know how many staff are researchers and how many are administration.  It is important we do not cut research staff at that agency.  If we could get this breakdown, we could make informed decisions about savings in administration.  I believe we must put the knife in and insist under the Croke Park agreement that much more efficient methods are brought into departmental administrative systems.  The Minister often speaks about the legacy Fianna F&aacute;il left.  In my view that agreement was a good legacy.  There were difficulties in getting new technology accepted in Departments to allow for faster methods of doing things.  If we are going to engage in this process, it is important we get those figures.</p><p>  The Minister decided to cut payments in the DAS using stocking levels as the basis.  However, farms in mountain areas have low stocking levels due to land use.  Now the Minister finds he has to give a derogation in cases involving small mountain farms.  There are also different rates of payment in each of the three categories: less favoured areas, LFAs, get &euro;80, very disadvantaged get &euro;90 and it is a mixture on the mountains between &euro;90 and &euro;100.  The basis of the DAS is that one gets paid for the amount of disadvantage associated with the land quality in one&rsquo;s region.  There are parts of the country that do not get DAS because they are deemed to be good land.  Will the Minister give us the relative productivity of farms in good land areas, LFAs and the mountain areas?  If we knew that, then we could decide on the relative support to balance the DAS.</p></speech>

Historical data are available and, therefore, I am asking about the three categories as before, with three relative rates of pay, and the need to investigate whether those rates reflect the overall quality of the land on which they are based.  We are entitled to that information and if I cannot get it this way I will get it through a freedom of information request.</p></speech>

We considered making decisions on cuts last year on the basis of levels of disadvantage in respect of making savings in the disadvantaged areas scheme.  We can do that again this year.  We made a decision on that very issue.  In my view farms that are split between disadvantaged areas and non-disadvantaged areas are not as disadvantaged in their disadvantaged segment as farms that are fully in disadvantaged areas.  If 70% of a farm is non-disadvantaged, the farmer should not get the same level of payment on the remaining 30% as someone whose entire farm is in a disadvantaged area.  We changed that part of the scheme.  Farmers whose lands are partially in disadvantaged areas will only get a proportion of disadvantaged payment relative to the overall amount of land that is in the disadvantaged area.</p></speech>

We first need to have a detailed discussion on how much can be taken out of the administrative budget.  That is why I want to differentiate between staff in research and those in administration and so on.</p><p> My gut feeling is that, as the Minister has eloquently outlined, the suckler cow scheme improves the product we put on the markets.  The other schemes are often income supports and, therefore, even though it means making other savings elsewhere in the budget, we should examine the retention of the suckler cow scheme before squaring the circle and finding the &euro;12 million needed.  This scheme is of huge benefit to Ireland Inc. because it relates, as the Minister said, to the quality of the cattle we produce.  It has, I understand, had a demonstrable effect on the quality of the national herd.  I am interested in research on that.</p><p> These are the big decisions we have to make clear.  We are hanging ourselves by doing this because we are not playing the normal game but I welcome that members are being given an opportunity to have an input into the thought processes.  We will do so responsibly.  We might not all agree with the Minister's decisions but we have to face the fact that there must be cuts and we can have an argument about the percentage.  Governments have a nasty habit - ours was no different and this one does not appear to be any different - of making disproportionately high cuts in the budgets of small Departments, such as the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  I used to spend in a week in the Department of Social Protection what I spent in a year in the old Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  The insistence was on taking a significant percentage cut out of small Departments, but there was no cash in it.  A 10% cut in the budget in the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs equated to &euro;40 million, but I spent &euro;100 million a day in the Department of Social Protection.  There is a habit of taking a big cut out of the budgets of small Departments and not facing up to the fact that we will not sort out our fiscal problems unless we tackle the big ticket items of pay and pensions and social protection.</p></speech>

They clearly outlined that the suckler cow welfare scheme is critical to meeting Food Harvest 2020 targets and to bringing the beef sector up to the same standard as the dairy sector.  For this, if for no other reason, the scheme should be protected.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned the State agencies - Teagasc, Bord Bia, the Marine Institute, Bord Iascaigh Mhara - and the food aid development programme.  The allocation to these under programme A amounts to &euro;192 million.  We need to closely examine how that is broken down and whether savings can be made.</p></speech>

In case any member thinks this is an easy win, if we do not pay that, the funding stream is transferred to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  This is part of our Government commitment to development aid.  It is not money that could be transferred to, for example, the suckler cow welfare scheme.</p></speech>

I hope everybody appreciates this has been a finding-our-feet exercise.  I welcome members' attempts to engage constructively and I accept there will be political differences, but there are big ticket numbers.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill highlighted one allocation and the DAS is another.  There are also smaller allocations.  The &euro;1 millions add up as well as the &euro;10 millions and the &euro;5 millions.  We should examine them all to see if we can make constructive suggestions.  If we want to factor in the retention of the suckler cow welfare scheme, we know the permutations for the overall budget reduction.  The Minister has indicated he is willing to appear before the committee again to engage with us.  If the members stay for five minutes, we will have a quick discussion about that.</p></speech>

If members are genuinely serious about engaging in helping me to put a better budget together, I will actively participate in that discussion.  It would be great if mine was the first Department to do that successfully though the committee system.  However, if members start abusing this, I will pull the shutters down because I have to protect my Department and the Government politically as well.  Members will find that I am open and constructive, I hope, in taking suggestions on board.  If they are serious about trying to find ways to save money that we cannot avoid saving and we get to the point of agreeing that, then we could have a fruitful discussion.  If the next time we meet we have a specific planned discussion on, for example, the DAS, that would be helpful, because otherwise I could bluff along and get through these meetings with members trying to land punches in the usual way.  We can try to get under the skin of this and have a serious discussion, which I am willing to have, and I am willing to provide information if members want to do that.</p></speech>

If the committee is of the opinion that we should continue with the suckler cow welfare scheme while accepting there is an AEOS with a &euro;15 million allocation, we have tangible figures that we can work with.

Everything is predicated on no policy change.  We need the information we requested, including what has happened so far this year, what is the likely outturn, where are the savings and overruns and so on, and the detail of that staff breakdown.  I do not doubt the Minister noted our requests.  If that could be provided, we could then have a meeting and come back with a better focus on where savings could be made and how they might be achieved.</p></speech>

It may be useful to have a private meeting in this room to discuss some of these issues.  If members are being watched by journalists who are looking for headlines and so on, it makes it more difficult in some ways for me to be open and it also makes it more difficult for Opposition members to talk about the issues on which we have to make decisions.

I remind members and those in the visitors' gallery to ensure their mobile phones are switched off for the duration of the meeting as they have an impact on the recording of the meeting.  To be fair to the staff and those watching the proceedings at home, mobile phones should be turned off.</p><p>  Our meeting today will be in two parts.  The first part will be a discussion with the Health Insurance Authority represented by Mr. Liam Sloyan, chief executive, and Mr. Jim Joyce, chairperson.  In the second part of our meeting we will hear from the health insurers.  I propose, with the members' agreement, that this segment of the meeting will conclude by 10.45 a.m., following which we will have the second session with the health insurers.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  I welcome Mr. Sloyan and Mr. Joyce to the meeting.  As members and those watching the proceedings at home will be aware, the Health Insurance Authority is a statutory regulator of the private health insurance market.  The authority was established in 2001 under the Health Insurance Act.  The authority is independent in the exercise of its function and the principal functions of the authority are laid out in the Health Insurance Act.  I will not detail its different functions.</p><p>  Before we commence I remind our witnesses that witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person, persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice and ruling of the Chairman to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I call Mr. Joyce to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-25a.706" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Joyce" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2012102500003#B00300"><p>We are grateful to the committee and to the Chairman for inviting us to appear before it.  I have been chairman of the Health Insurance Authority since 2006 and I am accompanied by Mr. Sloyan, who is the chief executive.  The committee has asked for a brief presentation and I propose to be brief.</p><p>  The functions of the authority can be briefly described as falling into three categories.  We have some consumer related functions to do with assisting and informing consumers; statutory functions under the Act which mainly relate to risk equalisation; and a general remit to monitor the market and advise the Minister for Health on health insurance policy issues generally.</p><p>  Members will be aware that for many years the public policy on private health insurance in Ireland, as in many other countries, has been based on community rating.  This means that a health insurance product, subject to some conditions, should be available at the same price without regard to age, gender or health status.  Compared with the normal insurance market this is quite a distortion because the premium paid on a normal insurance policy would vary according to risk.  For a community rated market to be viable, therefore, it must be supported in a number of respects.  We must have open enrolment, which allows anyone to purchase a health insurance contract, and lifetime cover to ensure people have an automatic right to renew.</p><p>  Another key support is risk sharing, which recognises that where we have community rating a risk-sharing arrangement is required to deal with the different risk profiles of insurers because they are precluded from dealing with the risk profile by varying the level of premium they charge.  This is not particular to Ireland. It applies in general to countries that have community rated markets.</p><p>  Regarding the current state of the market, we would not be able to say that it is in a sufficiently stable or sustainable position, essentially because of the delay in implementing arrangements for risk sharing.  There are many reasons for that.  As members may be aware, the Supreme Court struck down the originally proposed risk equalisation scheme and the Minster decided, on the authority's recommendation following that, to implement a risk equalisation scheme in January after the scheme had been set aside by the Supreme Court in 2008.  It was not until 2009 that we had some risk sharing, with the introduction of the tax credit levy arrangement.  Those measures were introduced as an interim arrangement and were to apply for three years pending the establishment of a more effective risk equalisation system.  It is not useful to go into the detail of the way the tax credits and so on are worked out, but essentially they are designed to compensate for the higher claims costs for older age groups.  When the tax credit has been determined for the different age groups a rate of levy per insured person is then determined such that the system as a whole is revenue neutral.  It follows, therefore, that for the market as a whole there is no reason the tax credit levy system should raise premiums on average.  There are various other reasons premiums may increase but, as a whole, since the tax credit levy system is designed to be revenue neutral, it should have a neutral effect on average premiums.</p><p>  The current arrangements represented an important advance, in the view of the Health Insurance Authority, but because there is only part compensation for risk differences between insurers it remains very profitable for an individual insurer to recruit younger, healthier consumers and avoid older and less healthy ones.  At the same time, however, the claims rate rises rapidly with age, and this position has resulted in segmentation of the market.  The first type of segmentation is between insurers in that the majority of older insured people are insured with VHI.  The second type of segmentation is between products within insurers, whereby through marketing, product design and other means older people are frequently sold different products from those sold to younger people.  The result is that in the current market older people still pay more on average for health insurance than younger people.  The lack of sufficient risk sharing also means that the main commercial incentives in the market for insurers are to manage their risk profile through selection and segmentation rather than, for example, to manage claims and be more efficient.  That is not intended as a criticism of insurers.  It would be unreasonable to expect commercial bodies to do other than respond to the incentives and so on that face them in the market.</p><p>  The recently published Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2012 contains a number of provisions to strengthen the risk equalisation system and put it on a permanent footing.  If enacted, the system would take account not only of age, which is the current position, but also gender, the level of cover provided by a health insurance policy and the level of hospital utilisation.  These measures would be an important and necessary support to the operation of community rating, as would be the continued strengthening of the risk equalisation system as things change.  What we have found in discussions with people in other countries where risk equalisation applies is that there is no such thing as a perfect system that we can sit back and allow to operate.  We must be constantly aware of the need to adjust it to reflect what is happening in the market.</p><p>  Another feature of the current market to which we wish to draw attention is the rate of premium inflation, which is being driven mainly by increasing claim payments.</p></speech>

Some key issues have to be addressed here.  There is the immediate issue of the shorter and longer term policy decisions of the Government on universal health insurance and the potential difficulties that could arise in trying to implement that.</p><p>  In terms of risk equalisation, intergenerational solidarity, community rating and all that is required to ensure we have a market that is not distorted by the fact that older people are more expensive and create a bigger liability on insurers, the inevitable cherry-picking of younger, healthier people is evident in the statistics of the various insurers but the most alarming aspect recently is the number of people who are dropping their health insurance cover and downgrading their plans.  Mr. Joyce mentioned an annual 2% drop since 2008.  The concern of insurers, and most policy makers, is the number of young people who are not taking up insurance.  That is the key issue we must address to ensure we have a reasonably sustainable health insurance market in the short to medium term.</p><p>   There are many reasons people drop out of health insurance cover.  Affordability is the most obvious one in terms of the downturn in the economy, loss of jobs and so on but coupled with that is the massive health inflation.  Will the witnesses indicate what are the main drivers in health inflation and what is the knock-on effect of that on premiums?  Is it the policy decisions of Governments, the marketplace, consultant contracts or the charging of private insurers for the full cost of public beds?  What is the breakdown in that regard?  As someone who is involved in policy discussions I believe we can never find out that information.  Insurers will tell us one thing, the Health Insurance Authority will tell us another and the Minister will tell us something else but we would like a breakdown as to the major contributory factors in the cost of premium increases.  Is risk equalisation and community rating a factor?  If so, that must be discussed.  </p><p>  We are in favour of risk equalisation, community rating and intergenerational solidarity but the difficulty is if people cannot afford to take out health insurance because this policy may be having an impact, it defeats the purpose because we have a law of diminishing return.  We must get some detail on what is contributing to that in percentage terms or the sliding scale of priority downwards.  The VHI, for example, has an older demographic.  That is a simple fact of legacy, and it is confronted with difficulties on a daily basis.  We are told that insurers from other countries coming here cherry-pick initially and hope that something happens in the future in terms of their clients' profile.  That would be one of the key issues to be addressed.</p><p>  On the broader issue of universal health insurance and the policies the Government is pursuing in that area, will Mr. Sloyan or Mr. Joyce outline the model that is working around the world that the committee, other policy and I should be advised to examine to try to identify a model that would fit into the policies the Government is pursuing?  We are waiting for a White Paper on universal health insurance but I am not sure if anybody knows what they are meant to be doing in terms of identifying the model that will fit this country.  We have four health insurers.  There is one big player of the four.  To have universal health insurance we must have quality competition in the marketplace but with a population of over 4 million people and the difficulties in the broader economy, I wonder if any more people will come into this marketplace to progress the universal health insurance idea the Minister is proposing.</p></speech>

We in Sinn F&eacute;in want universal health care based on equal access for all and on the basis of need.  We want that to be State-provided, funded by fair and general taxation and free at the point of delivery.  That will require an increased contribution from the highest earners, as we have articulated time after time.  We do not favour the insurance-based model of funding but if health insurance is to be the basis for funding, it is our contention that it should be a State insurance scheme.  We base our views on the fact that the existing system is made up of a number of competing insurance entities, most if not all of whom are represented before this committee today, and that the competing private health insurance market satisfies itself regarding profitability and the interests of shareholders.  We believe the State model provision will be focused on best patient care.</p><p>  There are, as was said in Mr. Joyce's contribution and by the previous speaker, decreasing numbers of people with health insurance.  We have rising premiums and more pressure on the public system.  That has been referred to here in the past, and the Minister has also referred to it here in committee.  Looking at the pillars of the Health Insurance Authority's responsibility under the Acts, I wonder if it has any function regarding the failure on the part of some of the competing private insurers to meet members' billings in a more expeditious way.</p></speech>

That is not our preference by any means but if it is to present, we will engage at the appropriate time in whatever legislation is brought forward.</p></speech>

We will have much more engagement on this issue because it is a growing one, so to speak.  Since 2009, health insurance premia here have doubled.  Yesterday's newspapers reported that individuals and families are facing an additional &euro;300 cost from January.  If we examine the issue of risk equalisation in the Health Insurance Authority's study purely from a gender and age point of view, that would be a loading of approximately &euro;1,100 just on the equalisation aspect.  In addition, the cost of the insurance premia, which does not include the new provision in the legislation on hospital utilisation, will put further pressure on many young families.  Furthermore, because of the policy decision made by Government property taxes will be introduced.  It seems that further pressure is being put on many families.</p><p>  Does the HIA examine the issue of the levy from an equalisation point of view to ensure everyone pays the same premium or does it consider the issue of affordability?  The reality for the majority of families is that if health insurance increases by &euro;300 and if an additional levy is brought in, it will push health insurance beyond their reach.  The issue of affordability must be taken into account because if it is not, the entire system could collapse.</p><p>  In his opening statement Mr. Joyce made the point that there has been a greater increase in premium inflation at the higher end of the packages and for older people.  Is it not the case traditionally that the better health insurance policies are usually taken out either by wealthy people or by older people?  Under the legislation being proposed they would pay the highest level of risk equalisation levy into the fund.  Does that not mean that affordability of those packages will be pushed even further out of the reach of older people?  I thought the idea behind risk equalisation was to try to make it affordable for everyone.</p><p>  Mr. Joyce made the point also that health insurance is now more expensive for older people but how does he square the circle in that the numbers of older people covered by insurance is increasing?  The proportion of people in the older age category with insurance is increasing yet premiums appear to be increasing at a greater rate in respect of those people.  Is it because they are opting for the more expensive policies?  Naturally, they would be far more concerned about the demand for health services because of their age but at the same time younger people are haemorrhaging out of the system.  A total of 80,000 people will no longer be in the private health insurance system this year.  What incentives exist to grow the market?  We must grow the market because if we do not the entire system here will collapse, which will put further pressure on our public health system.  It will make it more expensive for employers who provide health insurance cover to employ people.  That is very much the case regarding foreign direct investment coming here.  Also, it will make the introduction of universal health insurance a mountain to be overcome if large numbers have left the system.  I ask Mr. Joyce to outline the way the HIA intends to square that circle.</p></speech>

Regarding universal health insurance, as the Chairman will appreciate, it is not possible for me to say very much but one can make some general comments.  First, the main difference between universal health insurance and the private health insurance arrangements we have currently is that everyone would be automatically covered and therefore it would deal with the situation of younger subscribers.  The point about universal health insurance is that it covers everyone.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked about the model that would be appropriate.  There are various models.  The Minister has spoken about most of them.  There is a great deal of talk about the Dutch model, and it is undoubtedly true that one of the main issues is how we ensure there is a competitive marketplace in a much smaller country, but that is about as much as one can say about it.  It is a generic comment.</p></speech>

It is a matter for the Government as to when the White Paper is issued and the sequence of events in that regard but one can say that in the case of the Dutch system it took a very long time to introduce and it would be unrealistic to expect the various steps that are necessary in preparation for it to be completed quickly.</p></speech>

In recent years the premium inflation has been driven by claims inflation and the claims inflation market has largely been driven by an increase in hospital utilisation.</p><p>  The other key aspect we like to talk about in terms of premium inflation is that the rate of inflation has been very different across different sectors of the market.  Plans that have been around for a long time and that are mostly held by older people have increased greatly in price whereas many younger, price conscious people have switched to similar plans offering very similar benefits but at much lower costs.</p></speech>

It is important to state that the purpose of risk equalisation is to equalise premiums.  The point of the arrangement is that younger people will pay more in order that older people will pay less.  In the new Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill we would make a distinction between different levels of product in the calculation of the levy.  Clearly, that would be a new differentiation.  The purpose of that is to ensure that in terms of the lower value products a disproportionate levy does not have to be paid.</p></speech>

Insurers receive money from tax credits as well and if we look only at the impact the levy is having on premiums and ignore the impact of the credits paid in respect of insurers policyholders, one is looking at only half the story.  The credits in some cases more than cancel out the impact of the levy.  In other cases where there is a predominantly younger population they less than cancel out the impact of the levy.  The impact of both must be examined and when that is done one will see that the statements on the impact of the levy on the price of premiums, even for products with predominantly younger populations, are hugely overstated.</p></speech>

Deputy Naughten mentioned that in the context of growing the market, especially among young people.  The Health Insurance Authority's newsletter issued last summer stated that 61,000 had left the system in the past year.  Do we have a breakdown of that figure because we are seeing an accelerated exodus and we must try to grow the market?</p></speech>

The age group that has seen a significantly larger decline in membership is the 18 to 29 years age group.  The Central Statistics Office results show there has been a significant decrease in the number of people in the country in that age group.  That is part of it, but that age group has shown the most significant decline.  There has been a decline in all age groups under the age of 50 and the numbers over the age of 60 in the health insurance market have increased.</p></speech>

People buy it in their late 30s when they are starting a family or in some cases at a younger age when they get a job.  They hold on to it once they reach a certain age.  People are loath to cancel it and as those people get older, the numbers in those age groups get older.  We do not see any evidence of an increase in people purchasing health insurance late in life.</p></speech>

Effectively, a 60 year old person who took out health insurance at 25 pays the same as a 25 year old but a 60 year old who took out health insurance at 55 would pay more to allow for the fact that he or she did not make the contributions when he or she was younger.</p></speech>

What is the reason for that?</p><p>  To develop a point Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in raised, figures I received from the Health Service Executive on outstanding amounts among private health insurance companies for treatment provided to private patents are in the order of &euro;204 million.  Of that &euro;204 million, &euro;100 million relates to claims under preparation in hospitals, something this committee has discussed previously.  However, there is &euro;104 million outstanding relating to claims submitted to insurers that are either being processed or are pending.  The witnesses said in response to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in that it is a matter between the health care providers and the companies but as a health insurance authority, if the witnesses believe there is a practice whereby health insurance companies are withholding payment at the expense of the public purse, what can the HIA do to ensure that that substantial amount of money, based on the figures I received from the HSE, is paid?  What action, if any, will the HIA take to address that?</p></speech>

On the one hand, if the number of beds is increased, the level of competition increases, which could assist in reducing price.  On the other hand, if the number of beds is increased, we are then creating a cashflow problem for the insurers in the sense that the more services provided, the more demand is placed on those services.  It is about getting a balance.  I raise that because I am aware of a company which was trying to provide extra facilities at a cheaper rate but it could not get cover from a particular insurance company.</p></speech>

A no-claims bonus would effectively be a benefit to healthier people but in the health insurance market the principle is that everybody pays the same, regardless of state of health or age.  As it is structured that way, normal practices in insurance markets would not apply.  With regard to the number of pending claims, our role relates to health insurance consumers and not arrangements between hospitals and insurers.  It is a matter for the HSE and hospitals to ensure they get prompt payment with claims in accordance with rules.</p></speech>

It was considered for quite a while and the Health Insurance Authority made proposals to the Department on appropriate regulations.

That is not to say that if lifetime community rating had been introduced some years ago, it would not have been a help, as that is certainly the case.  I am explaining why if we are looking to the introduction of universal health insurance, it might not be in tune with the idea to introduce lifetime community rating at this point.</p></speech>

Many of the people on the website would have been looking at products for more than one person, so they are a significant proportion of private health insurance consumers.</p></speech>

It has mentioned that two of the main supports of health insurance are open enrolment and lifetime cover.  That is fine if health insurance is affordable.  It was also mentioned that every year since 2008, 50,000 people cannot afford health insurance and leave the system.  Health insurance costs are on the rise and employees are taking cuts.  Every family feels it needs health insurance at affordable prices, as it is an essential safety blanket for many families.  I keep mentioning the word "affordable".</p><p>  Health insurance has helped many families through difficult times in knowing that medical bills will be paid.  I have experience of that.  I fully support the Minister's actions and it is very important that universal health insurance comes into effect as soon as possible at an affordable price.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-25a.765" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1147" speakername="John Crown" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2012102500007#F02100"><p>I add my words of welcome.  For the benefit of other members of the committee, the debate on the introduction of universal health insurance is frequently misunderstood.  People keep referring to the Dutch model.  What emerged from the synthesised programme for Government for the two coalition parties would more correctly be called the Deutsch model rather than the Dutch model.  It involves a mixture of public, not-for-profit insurance entities - something like the VHI - in a market where there is competition with private insurance companies and various other types of insurance instrument.  That is what exists in Germany, where the system is very successful.  Of the large western countries, the Germans have by far the best health system, and it is far superior in all manner of outcomes to those working on the opposite principle of fixed general taxation and centralised command and control of administration.</p><p>  The system, if introduced, would also involve the notion of a fixed percentage premium.  The questions about cherry-picking would go.</p></speech>

The issue must be examined.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-25a.769" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1004" speakername="Mary Mitchell O'Connor" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2012102500008#G00400"><p>While I am not sure if my question is more appropriate to the following group, I cannot stay at this meeting because I must go to the Chamber.  I have been a member of an insurance company, from which I received seven booklets.  Looking at them and trying to go through them, they seem to be much the same but the plans seem to be getting more expensive as one moves to platinum and gold care.  I could not see much of a difference.  The insurers say it is fair but when one tell them one belongs to a body such as the INTO, one gets a much better price.  Anecdotally, one gets the corporate rate if one asks for it on the telephone and if one plays hardball.</p><p>  I worry about another other aspect.  I took out medical insurance at a certain price.  After two or three years, it had doubled.  I cannot remember if I received a letter and I probably did but I would like the insurance companies to clear up whether they write to customers to explain the percentage increase.  For the client, prices seem to be increasing and, unless one checks it year on year and compares the companies' prices, one may not be getting the best deal.  I would like the companies to focus their replies on the customer trying to get a good price.</p></speech>

I am sorry for not being present for the earlier part of the presentation but I heard some of it, but not all, on the monitor.  I am not sure if my questions have been addressed.  The cost of renewing a health insurance premium for my young son increased by hundreds, if not thousands, of euro.  With the contracting market of proportionately older members, what does the HIA think should be done to stop market contraction?  What should be done to make health insurance more relevant and more affordable for younger members?  Does the HIA take affordability of the market into account when trying to set levy amounts or should it merely seek to equalise differences for older and sicker members?</p></speech>

They were not dealt with and I wonder whether the witnesses could refer to my questions on competition within the health care sector.</p></speech>

The witnesses said that the person starting an insurance life in the early 20s pays much less by the time they get to 55 or 60 years than the person who enters the insurance market at 55 or 60 years of age.  How much less?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-25a.773" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Joyce" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2012102500008#G00800"><p>In addressing the final point, that is not quite what Mr. Sloyan said.  If one has the lifetime community rating arrangement, someone entering the market at the age of 25 would be paying a premium at the age of 60 based on the fact that they had entered the market at 25 years of age.  If one enters the market at the age of 50, one would pay a higher premium because of the delayed entry.  That arrangement does not yet apply here.  Mr. Sloyan was only speculating as to how the situation may apply.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-25a.774" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1075" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2012102500008#G00900"><p>I am ignorant with regard to some of these matters but when I started my insurance at 21 or 22 years of age, I was of the view that by the time I got to 55 for 60 years, when people get ill, my premium would be reduced.  For those leaving health insurance by the tens of thousand what benefit is there to them staying with their insurance cover?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-25a.775" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Sloyan" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2012102500008#G01000"><p>The benefits include the cover one has at the time.  Anyone who wishes to leave the market must bear in mind that waiting periods arise on re-entry if one leaves for a certain amount of time.  It is a case for each individual to decide whether to remain in the market and whether the premium is worth the cover.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-25a.776" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Joyce" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2012102500008#G01100"><p>It is worth saying that, in respect of the size of the market, we have an unusual situation in this country.  We have a free public health system, as it were, while 50% of the population has private health insurance.  When the original Health Insurance Act was introduced, between 30% and 35% of the population had private health insurance.  We used to speculate about the maximum but we did not expect 50%.  The market increased substantially over a long period before it started to reduce over recent years.  The fact that such a high percentage of people have private health insurance, when there is a free public health service, is extraordinary.</p></speech>

We must be conscious of the importance of the insurer making sure an appropriate level of service is being provided.  The insurer must manage the level of service being provided.  In the health insurance market, there is a concept called supplier-induced demand, which occurs where suppliers are incentivised to provide services.  In some cases, the level of service provided increases, reflecting the commercial incentives.  It is up to insurers to manage the level of services being provided to make sure they are appropriate.  If more services are being provided, it will affect the price level of premiums.</p></speech>

I refer to people at home and people like Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, who raised her issue.  Have we any good news for the consumer because all the consumer has seen is a spike in premiums?  New technologies and facilities in and the modernisation of hospitals were mentioned.  The costs are going up.  Senator Coghlan was worried about his son.  People at home have seen their premiums increase and we see from the authority's figures today and from its newsletter that there has been an exodus from private health insurance.  I accept that regarding a segment of the market but people at home have had no good news.</p></speech>

Most of those who have suffered very large price increases can actually save significant amounts of money, as Deputy Mitchell O'Connor said, by moving to certain plans.  The important thing to note is that they have a right to move to those plans and can get the information about those products on our website or by telephoning us.  We will be able to help them save that money.</p></speech>

The consumer is entitled by law to buy that product.  If he or she goes on to our website, he or she will be able to make the saving.</p></speech>

I suppose the message is to look for the cheapest price and the corporate or the group rate.  Senator Coghlan could check it out and see if he can get a cheaper rate for his son.</p></speech>

It should not be a treasure hunt.  The insurance companies should make the information readily available, and we will ask them about that later.  I also appreciate the volume of people in contact with the authority.  To be fair to health insurers, when one contacts them, they respond but the concern I have is that the  spike in premiums has forced an exodus from the private health insurance market which is a source of worry to the person at home who is balancing budgets.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-25a.790" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1177" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2012102500009#H00800"><p>On that point, Mr. Sloyan made the point that older people face greater premium increases because they are reluctant to switch and they are carrying a bigger burden.  Is that not an admission that the authority has singularly failed to encourage people to switch from one policy to another?  It is the authority's responsibility to encourage people to do that.  That is the authority's main role in regard to the public.  What specifically is the authority doing to try to address that issue among the older cohort of people?</p><p>  Mr. Sloyan said claims were the biggest part of the increase in the cost of premiums but the VHI report stated that claims inflation is at 15%.  Premiums have gone up 60%, so there is a gaping hole in that argument.  Will Mr. Sloyan explain that?  </p><p>  The question I asked earlier, and which every member asked, is what incentives are there to grow the market and to try to keep young people in the market?  Mr. Sloyan failed to give any answer.  The only solution is to introduce lifetime community rating but it is pointless introducing that because we are moving to universal health insurance.  The authority has no solutions to the haemorrhaging of people from the private health insurance system which will increase the cost significantly for older people who will not be able to afford to pay premiums if they keep raising.  </p></speech>

That is to be expected because if one thinks one is going to use one's health insurance, it is a natural reaction to be more risk averse about switching it.  That will be the case.  We do what we can to provide people with information and to advertise our services but we will always face a situation where older people switch less frequently than younger people.  I do not think we will be able to override that.</p><p>  The other reason older people do not switch is that insurers do not want their business.  If they follow the commercial incentives and if they sell insurance to an older person, they will lose money.  If the seller of the product does not want to sell the product to a group for commercial reasons, it is natural that group will not be targeted or encouraged to switch by the insurers.</p></speech>

It was ridiculous that the Minister and everybody seemed powerless to deal with the issue.  A health care provider was offering to provide health care at a lower cost than the dominant player.  Unless we have competition among health care providers, we cannot have competition among health insurers.  It is as simple as that.</p></speech>

I will not go through the names of all those in attendance.  I hope members have received the comprehensive presentations that the health insurers furnished to the joint committee.  They have been circulated.  I ask the various groups to confine their presentations to five or six minutes.  That will ensure there is time for questions at the end.  We have to conclude at a certain time.</p><p>  This is an important meeting in the context of this country's health insurance system.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in has had to leave to go to another meeting.  The health insurers will have observed the opening part of this meeting, during which representatives of the Health Insurance Authority confirmed that 2.1 million people, or 47% of the population, were covered by health insurance at the end of June 2012 and that there has been a reduction of almost 61,000 in the number of people with health insurance in the last year.  The witnesses will have listened to the questions we asked about the many people who are struggling to keep up with their payments, abandoning their policies, cancelling some of their cover or shopping around to amend their policies.  It is easy for us to understand how people are struggling to make payments.  According to the Health Insurance Authority website, which was mentioned earlier in the meeting, ten statements announcing price increases in certain policies offered by health insurers have been issued in the last two months.  In the last year and a half, each of the players in the health insurance market has announced at least three across-the-board price increases.  As Deputy Naughten said earlier, reports in this morning's newspapers suggest that a further increase may be sanctioned in the future.  Such measures are of concern to politicians and to people with health insurance who are struggling to maintain their policies.</p><p>  Price is obviously the primary concern of the health insurance industry.  We understand the industry faces a number of challenges.  The health insurance market is underpinned by the principles of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover.  The system is designed to ensure the premium a person pays is not determined by his or her age or health.  The risk equalisation element of these principles will be rolled out over the next few months in a policy document and a Bill.  We are interested to learn about the impact this will have on competition, price and profitability.  The programme for Government provides for a move towards universal health insurance that is underpinned by the principles of social solidarity.  I hope this morning's meeting will give us an opportunity to engage in a calm and balanced way.  We look forward to hearing the views of the representatives of the health insurers.  We hope they interact with the members of the committee.</p><p>  I would like to remind the witnesses of the position on privilege.  They are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary ruling and practice of the Chair to the effect that they should not criticise, comment on or make charges against a person or persons outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I ask the representatives of the VHI, Mr. Declan Moran, who is the director of marketing and business development, Mr. John O'Dwyer, who is the chief executive, and Dr. Bernadette Carr, to make their opening remarks.</p></speech>

We fully support universal health insurance, which probably represents the single biggest change in the area of health in this country in decades.  We are committed to playing our part in the successful implementation.  We sent the committee a letter with slides giving more detail.  I will pick a few key points from those slides.</p><p>  We believe the key objective of universal health insurance is to get away from the two-tier system and have a one-tier system with equal access to our health care system for all citizens.  We need to have an efficient high quality health care system that rewards good outcomes.  For universal health insurance to work many things must be in place and I will highlight three.  The annual budget concept that takes place in many of our public hospitals must stop.  The Minister has mentioned many times that the money must follow the patient.  Patient activity and the outcomes for those patients must define where the money goes.</p><p>  There must be competition between providers.  Clearly we believe there must be very tight rules in the marketplace to ensure there are no incentives for risk selection.  We all believe in community rating; it is Government policy.  For community rating to work we must have good goalkeepers and good policing, which means a very comprehensive risk-equalisation scheme.</p><p>  I joined the VHI a few months ago and----- </p></speech>

I do not know any business which would gain if their longest serving loyal customers left.  I find it a challenge.  With universal health insurance, clearly there must be funds and there has to be a system.</p><p>  Prior to joining the VHI, I was very lucky to work for the largest health insurer in Holland, Achmea.  I worked for it in a few different countries.  The Dutch model is one we could consider.  I do not say it is perfect.  There are three forms of funding as follows: taxpayers pay a percentage of their income into a fund; people who can afford it have mandatory private health insurance and they pay this into a fund; and where people cannot afford it - in Holland they give it free for children - this money is also put into a fund.  This fund is then allocated on very strict criteria.  The criteria include age and health status.  I will give a real-life example from Holland.  The allocation for a 30 year old healthy male was &euro;400.  However, the allocation for a 32 year old suffering from diabetes with some complications was &euro;12,500.  That gives a sense of the distortion of two young people in their 30s, one healthy and one not healthy.  There is a multiple difference in the treatment costs for these people.</p><p>  Clearly, there must be good competition and all incentives must be aligned.  A core philosophy for universal health insurance is that nobody should be allowed to make money by cherry-picking or managing risk.  People should be allowed to make money if they deliver better deals with hospitals and consultants.  They should be allowed to make money if they look after the health care needs of their customers and they deliver excellent customer service for their members.  Clearly health insurers need to be free to contract with public and private providers.</p><p>  There are a number of critical enablers.  While clearly for all major initiatives such as this many things are needed, information and technology systems will play a key part.  We see a key role for VHI in this and the authorisation of VHI is crucial.  VHI can play a key part in the successful implementation of universal health insurance.  We have the experience.  We have nearly 1.2 million customers with 57% of the market share while paying 80% of the claims in the market.  Some years ago we took many initiatives to manage the health care of our members, including the screening of 30,000 of them, many of them for diabetes.  We have also started home care to try to reduce the cost of having people in hospital care.  This year alone we will save 12,000 bed days with this initiative.  We believe VHI has the experience and wherewithal to help implement this universal health insurance.</p><p>  All incentives for providers, insurers and policymakers must be aligned to ensure we have cover for all people and that we reward good health care outcomes.  A good start has been made here.  One of the key enablers of universal health insurance is a good risk equalisation system.  A draft Bill has been published and we believe this is a key foundation for universal health insurance and it must ensure there is no incentive for risk selection in the market.  The insurers should be primarily focused on driving down health care costs and delivering excellent customer services.  We believe the VHI is very capable of supporting these objectives.</p><p>  In recent years the VHI has had a very comprehensive cost containment programme.  I am very pleased with what I have seen and there have been many improvements.  We can all throw out percentages, but sometimes some figures are worth highlighting.  A few years ago a cataract operation cost &euro;1,600 and today it costs &euro;1,000.  Stents, which represent a key part of any procedure, used to cost approximately &euro;1,100 and today cost &euro;200.  A few years an MRI scan was quite unique and cost &euro;600 on average.  Today it costs &euro;180.  I understand we are the cheapest in Europe, with the possible exception of Bulgaria.</p><p>  The VHI is very supportive of the Government's objective of universal health insurance and we believe we are well positioned and capable of supporting its implementation. </p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague, Ms Teresa Kelly Oroz, our legal and regulatory director.</p><p>  Government policy is to implement a system of universal health insurance.  For a transition to universal health insurance to work, the current health insurance market must be kept affordable and competitive.  However, over the past four years, health insurance has become less affordable and, as a result, the market has reduced in size, with more than 174,000 previously insured people now dependent on the public health system. </p><p>  Members of this committee know more about people's fears and concerns than anyone on this side of the table.  At weekly clinics they meet constituents who cannot pay mortgages, struggle with bills, have reduced earnings and are worried about the health and welfare of their families.  However, today the committee has the opportunity to do something for the 2.1 million people who have health insurance, for those who are dependent on the over-burdened health system and for the 6,000 people per month who have had to or have been forced to give up their health insurance.  They are giving it up, not because they want to cease cover but because they cannot afford it.</p><p>  Health insurance has become unaffordable for many because of a failed policy relating to the implementation of the health insurance levy.  Through its work today, this committee can shine a light on this failed policy.  This policy may have been sustainable in the Celtic tiger years, when the health insurance market was growing year on year, but it is certainly the wrong policy for the recession-hit Ireland of today.  This failed policy is driving consumers away from private health insurance and risks creating a vicious circle where, in the end, health insurance will be unaffordable for everybody.</p><p>  GloHealth firmly supports the concept of community rating and intergenerational solidarity.  Community rating can only work if it is sustainable, and it can only be sustainable if private health insurance is affordable.  The facts do not lie.  The health insurance levy has increased by almost 80% in just three years.  In 2012, the levy adds &euro;760 to the annual health insurance cost of a family of two adults and two children.  In many cases, the levy accounts for approximately 40% of the cost of health insurance.</p> <p>Let us be honest - the Government levy is a stealth tax on health insurance customers.  In recent years it has driven a vicious circle of rising premiums, leading to more than 174,000 cancellations by young families and individuals who are impacted on most by the recession.  According to the Health Insurance Authority, there has been a 12% reduction in the number of policies which include children.  As the pool of younger, healthier members gets smaller, the cost of insurance for those remaining inevitably increases.  Moreover, fewer patients with health insurance leads to greater pressure on the public health system which is under huge strain and over budget.  The committee is dealing with the consequences of that strain on a weekly basis.  It is critical for the economic well-being of the country that we maintain our competitiveness.  Health insurance is viewed as a core employment benefit by most large multinationals in Ireland, but the levy is forcing up their labour costs.</p><p> We need a change of direction and I call on the committee to lead that change.  Having resolved before the meeting to offer solutions, as well as emphasising the challenges, I will set out three proposals for action.  First, we urge the Minister to reduce or, at a minimum, freeze the health insurance levy.  Research by the Health Insurance Authority suggests that if the levy was reduced, lapsed policyholders would come back into the market.  We all recognise that an increase in the younger population base will make health insurance more affordable for everybody.  A further increase in the levy is not necessary to subsidise further an already profitable VHI.</p><p> Second, we recommend that the Minister exempt children from the levy.  It is currently set at &euro;95 per child per annum, which is almost the same as the household charge.  At a time when there is so much emphasis on children's health and children's rights, it seems truly unjust to impose a tax on children to support the health costs of adults.  Abolishing the levy on insured children would make health insurance more affordable for hard-pressed families.  If the levy is removed, GloHealth will immediately be positioned to reduce the cost of its health insurance products.  </p><p> Third, we urge the committee to ensure a stated objective of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2012 is to ensure affordability across society and avoid discouraging younger and healthier consumers from entering the market.</p><p> Nobody is under any illusion about the challenges facing the Government in framing the next budget and the added burden its provisions will place on all members of society.  The health insurance levy is Exchequer neutral in that it is not a revenue raising measure.  However, the spiralling cost of health insurance has a significant impact on 2.1 million people in this country.  We are very concerned at the failure today of the representatives of the Health Insurance Authority to undertake to address the overall affordability issue and the contraction evident in the market.  At our meeting with representatives of the Department of Health last week we asked for an assurance that the health insurance levy would not be increased at the end of the year.  We were disappointed that such an assurance was not forthcoming.  The committee can play a very positive role on behalf of consumers by urging the Government not to increase the levy further for 2013 and to address the key issue of affordability.  </p><p> I thank the Chairman and members for their time.</p></speech>

As copies of our submission have been circulated, I will keep my comments as brief as possible in the interests of time and sustaining people's general interest.  </p><p>  We focus in our paper, as others have done today, on current market developments.  The issue of most concern to us is the reduction in numbers taking out private health insurance in the past five years and the fact that this reduction is particularly noticeable in the 20 to 29 year age cohort.  Given the relative average claims cost per person of older versus younger claimants, it is clear that having a strong base of younger customers is what sustains the whole system.  If we do not have enough younger people coming in to subsidise existing members as they get older and require more medical care, we will see premiums being driven up.  That will be a major cause of concern for us in the coming years.</p><p>  It is important that we work together to ensure the young and healthy continue to take out insurance.  That will require insurers to manage their cost bases, as has been mentioned several times today, through internal efficiencies, negotiations with external providers and so on.  These are actions we are already taking, as, I am sure, are our competitors.  The State can play its role by not imposing other, external costs on insurers in a way that will make it difficult for them to manage their own costs.  Whether one is talking about the levy, charges for private designated beds in public hospitals and so on, all have an immediate impact on the cost of insurance.</p><p>  In regard to risk equalisation, our position is that we have been expecting this legislation for the past three years or so.  We are in this market and support the introduction of risk equalisation.  We have a genuine desire to work with the Department of Health on this issue, but we need the dialogue to be constant and timely and to see more of it.  We have had a useful engagement in recent weeks and some issues have been taken on board, for which we are grateful to the Department.  However, we still have concerns about the legislation.  </p><p>  On the question of whether risk equalisation will inevitably lead to an increase in prices, I am not convinced that it will.  It is very much a question of getting the detail right and operating to a sensible time line.  On the other hand, on being told, with only ten days notice, that one must produce a set of revised plans and so on, I cannot find the right word to express how ridiculous that is.  As a responsible company, we have to be able to anticipate what is coming up.  The 150% solvency requirement means we will have to put more capital into the business, which might well lead to price increases.  The industry has got it wrong on occasion, as we did in the case of the levy increases earlier this year.  In that instance, we scrambled to put up prices up for a period to make up for the fact that we did not understand what was happening in the first place.  All such issues can be managed by taking the right amount of time to get the legislation right.  I am not talking about years - it probably only needs another month or two - but it is vital that we understand what is being proposed and can put it into effect in the products we offer.</p><p>  The problem of young and healthy people leaving the health insurance market is often described as a vicious circle.  If it continues, price rises are inevitable because there will be insufficient numbers to subsidise the older, sicker cohorts.  That, in turn, will lead to more people leaving the market, thus putting greater stress on the public system.  We must find a way to prevent this cycle.  I am somewhat dismayed that some of the focus in discussing the legislation has been on "segmentation", which seems to have become a dirty word.  I am not sure what interpretation people are putting on that word, but one segment is 20 to 29 year olds and I intend to focus hard on getting more of them into the market.  Every insurer must focus on having a sustainable and affordable business.</p><p>  Aviva is absolutely committed to the introduction of universal health insurance.  We are ready to be engaged with and to work with the Government on the issue.  For now, however, our focus is on risk equalisation and understanding and better managing the implications for the market.</p></speech>

At the outset, I wish to introduce my colleague, David Muiry, who is head of global health for Swiss Re and a member of the board of Elips Insurance Limited, which is the underwriter of Laya Healthcare.  I thought it was important to put this in an international context and that it would be interesting to hear about universal health insurance from a broader perspective than the national perspective because obviously this is something to which we aspire in Ireland, rather than have at present.  The themes that have come up appear to be along the same lines we were speaking about and funnily enough, thus far all the insurers have been in agreement on a couple of matters.  One is the current market is becoming unaffordable and that young and healthier people are being driven out of the market.  The more of those young and healthier people who leave the market, the more complex it gets and the more costly it gets for the older.  Thereafter, one is talking about an unsustainable market after some time.  The drivers of this trend are known and include a substantial levy, by which I mean the net impact in respect of both age related tax relief and the levy to pick up on an earlier point.  In addition, the claims charges and what is happening with the claims costs in Ireland must be addressed.  One other factor which has not been emphasised sufficiently today is that the consumers themselves are in a recession.  People in Ireland today are suffering, although in my view the perception is a lot worse then the reality, but it drives-----</p></speech>

For example, people may think they had avoided having that dodgy knee seen to for quite a while but that now is the time to so do.  Alternatively, people might think they could be out of a job next year, etc. rather than what actually is the reality.  This both drives and changes people's behaviour.</p><p>  Fundamentally, however, as a country we must establish that we have a good system, we need intergenerational solidarity and we must protect community rating.  Laya Healthcare is behind that but it must be done effectively and efficiently.  There is no point in instigating a system that drives inefficiencies and causes the overall affordability and the consumer to suffer more than is necessary.  While we have some suggestions in this regard, I revert to universal health insurance and the ultimate destination we would like to reach.  Laya Healthcare is fully supportive of this idea as to us, the idea of developing a multi-insurer universal health insurance market is a really good idea and is something towards which we should work.  Moreover, any legislation, levies or interim measures that are introduced now should be following a roadmap towards this final destination.  We believe one key element in this regard is meaningful engagement.  It has been discussed in this joint committee both previously and today but in reality, we have found very little meaningful engagement.  When the insurers get around the table with all the other stakeholders, we participate, there is co-operation and I believe good solutions are arrived at.  However, we also are of the view that this opportunity is not taken often enough and the future path to success in this regard involves greater engagement with all the stakeholders.  In particular, for example, the universal health insurance working group has no representative from the health insurance market on it.  In addition, consulting on particular elements of legislation after they are published is a lot less productive than so doing before publication.</p><p>  However, to move on, when looking at solutions and the current position, I note this is an unusual market.  Each market is different and we are in a voluntary market in which penetration is exceptionally high at approximately 50%.  However, a highly diverse element of products is contained therein.  We must get the consumer to the centre of this.  Our view is to support the continuation in the market of the healthier people and younger people.  We concur with much of what has been stated here today.  We see no reason one cannot, in the interim solutions that are being proposed, have age-at-entry provisions to get more people into the market at a younger age to help to sustain its community rated elements.  It also makes no sense to us for children to be paying a levy.  We believe this all acts as a disincentive to families and for their future of this market.  Ultimately, in the current situation one is talking about a price spiral.  Basically, people leave the market but the more people who do so, the more the claims costs rise for those who remain and the more their claims costs increase, the more the price must rise.  As a group, our incentive should be to incentivise the younger and healthy people to stay in the market and equally, to then work out what actually must be done with regard to risk equalisation.</p><p>  On a future roadmap, if one considers universal health insurance and the ultimate goal of attaining it, there must be a change of practice.  The current two days notice for something to happen in legislation, two days notice for the price of a public hospital bed or a couple of days notice for the price of the levy, do not encourage good management.  This does not encourage us and I believe my colleague from Aviva mentioned the guessing game.  If one is in a position in which substantial costs may be put on anyone with two days notice, the reaction will be equally disproportionate.  This is what is happening at present in the market and we must get away from that.  We have made proposals that would allow for reasonable trade-in time in any of these legislative changes and would welcome any movement that gets us there.  The roadmap to the future must have a clear plan which gets us meaningful timing and management of our prudential elements that are required for the normal insurance market.  In that frame, for example, we welcome that the VHI is to be regulated this year and hope it will pass on this occasion.  Our perception is that if a reasonable roadmap and plan is put into action in the current legislation, we ultimately will get to universal health insurance.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their attendance.  Towards the end of his presentation, Mr. Clancy referred to incentivising people to get into the private health insurance market.  While the easiest part is saying that, I seek information on what steps could be taken to incentivise people to join private health insurance.  When referring to risk equalisation, I assume that all insurers are of the opinion that risk equalisation is essential and necessary in a civilised society in which there is intergenerational solidarity and dependency.  At the same time, however, I refer to a concern shared by many members, who could not get these answers from the Health Insurance Authority.  In respect of older people obviously costing insurers more, it is clear that if we continue as we are, premiums will escalate continually.  We should be honest about this and the risk equalisation measures being proposed will further exacerbate this issue.  Thereafter, one will have a continual falling out of younger people from the insurance market, which will perpetuate the price spiral to which Mr. Clancy referred.</p><p>  The key question for the insurers is what policy decisions should be made that would reduce the cost to insurers for public beds, for example.  I refer to the full costs being recouped for private patients in public beds.  As for the &euro;125 million that was being paid upfront by the insurers to address the budget deficit for this year, it appears that within a matter of days of this measure being announced, it also was indicated that the cost of premiums would increase.  Is this a sort of <i>quid pro quo</i> for an upfront payment?  In itself, this would mean that it is not the insurers but the policyholders who are plugging the gap in the deficit.  I invite witnesses to address this issue when making their concluding remarks.</p><p>  Primarily however, risk equalisation is an accepted practice and this is legislation that will come before the D&aacute;il.  What impact do the witnesses believe it will have on the cost of providing health cover for people?  Will it act as a further disincentive?  Very few people are telling me what, as policymakers, members can do to incentivise people to take up private health insurance.  Clearly, this is the key issue if we are trying to move to a universal health insurance model.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-25a.846" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1147" speakername="John Crown" time="11:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2012102500015#P00200"><p>I have a couple of quick points.  People really need to think through the full implications of what will happen if we have universal health insurance.  In the first instance, it will be compulsory and people will have to pay for it.  It is that simple.  It will be like tax, it will be the law.  If it is not done that way it will not work at all.  The necessary corollary is that tax should go down by the amount one is paying for health insurance.  On a level playing field, if everybody is paying an 8% fixed contribution to a health insurance plan, they should pay 8% less tax.  It is that simple.  That is the way it will work.  That gives a pot of money which is available to the insurers which gives them, acting on behalf of their members - and I would like to see a mixture of profit and not-for-profit insurers, but I hope mainly the latter - not their customers, tremendous negotiating power with the people who deliver health care.</p><p>  In partial answer to what Deputy Kelleher said, one of the issues is that one cannot have a completely free market in this respect for a couple of reasons.  Number one, people ultimately do not make the choice for the operation or treatment they have.  Somebody else makes it for them, and that person often gets paid if they do it.  That is a concept in health economics called &quot;supplier-induced demand&quot;.  There are ways of combating that and policing it in a properly efficient and competitive market.</p><p>  The same thing goes for hospitals.  If a new private hospital opens in an area where there are lots of privately insured people, it sees gaps in the market which it tries to exploit.  I am not saying &quot;exploit&quot; in any kind of pejorative sense, but it does tend to increase the demand for services.  There will need to be a system of registering, licensing and approving any new health care facility, even in any new dispensation which is based entirely on universal health insurance.</p><p>  There is a real risk that we are in a tremendously vulnerable interim phase right now.  We are all looking at this nirvana over the hill, after our 40 years wandering through the desert, of universal health insurance with a truly liberated system based on the principles of equity and efficiency.  It is one which will have many sullen, resentful, recently unemployed health bureaucrats and civil servants shuffling around wondering what their next job will be.  However, while we are on our way to that promised land, we will have a situation where the market is very unstable because people do not have a compulsion to take insurance.  They are not likely to use the health system because they are young and healthy so why, in recessionary times when they are having trouble meeting their other bills, should they start paying for health insurance?  That is the problem.</p><p>  The Minister has stated - sadly, in my opinion - that he will not introduce the reform until after the next election.  As I have said here before, that is a bit like looking at one's new bride at the church altar and saying &quot;I promise I'll be faithful to you after the first five years of marriage&quot;.  It is something we need to do now because all the things we are trying to do before that are basically putting palliative Band-Aids across a great big gaping malignant wound that we need to fix with the radical surgery of reform in introducing uniform health insurance.  When we introduce it, three things must be borne in mind.  If it follows the vision we hope it does, it will be very equitable.  Everybody will be able to take their negotiable insurance instrument to any hospital in the country.  There will be no concept that some hospitals are only open to some people, or that some doctors will only be available to some people.  Everybody will go at the same level, so it will increase equity.  It will also hugely increase efficiency because the current system incentivises inefficiency in the public - and to a lesser extent in our private - system.  It will cost more, however, and there is no getting away from that.</p><p>  The Beveridge model of general taxation-derived, central command and control, bureaucratised health care, <i>&agrave; la</i> the British national health service, is brilliant for containing costs.  It is not bad for equity, either, but it is terrible for access.  That is why the countries that follow that model always have the longest waiting lists in the world.  They are always the ones that have decreased access to cancer drugs and, as we are now seeing from statistics - generated both in my own research unit and the Karolinska Institute - they have inferior cancer outcomes.</p><p>  My questions are twofold, one general one and one specific one which I asked in a different context earlier this morning.  Do the witnesses think that enough attention is being paid to whether we have the skill set in our hospitals to manage this big change?  Do the people who are currently working as administrators in our hospitals - and are used to being given a cheque at the beginning of the year and told to make it last until New Year's Eve - have the skills to be able to work in a different environment?  In the latter environment, instead of their normal instinct to turn patients away when times get rough, their instinct will have to change to working out how they can attract more patients.  I am not sure we have that.  </p><p>  I wish to raise a small, technical issue with the witnesses collectively.  On multiple occasions in recent years - and sadly it will become more pressing in our new health and pharmaco-economic dispensation, which I must say I would resist with every fibre in my body - I have had experience of some of the smaller insurers declining the use of a drug saying that the VHI is not paying for it.  Could somebody please explain to me why that is not a cartel, if somebody says: &quot;The VHI is not going to pay for it, so we're not&quot;?  About 15 years ago, when doctors signed up to taking lower fees in return for patients not getting balanced billing, our consultants' association office was raided at dawn by whatever the local equivalent of Eliot Ness was from the Competition Authority.  I would like to know why is this kind of behaviour not a cartel.  </p></speech>

If not, what aspects of it have not been implemented?  That particular report flagged inefficiencies concerning the claims system, so have they now been addressed?  Is the VHI as efficient as it can be concerning claims?</p><p>  Senator Crown made the point that under a UHI system people will be able to go to any hospital they like.  Mr. O'Dwyer was involved in the Dutch insurance industry, so is it the case in Holland that all insurers cover people to access all the hospitals or do they have a situation like ours?</p></speech>

Clearly, the Government&rsquo;s long-term objective is UHI.  If that happens in the next four years, it will present a dilemma for us.  How the UHI model is designed is still up for discussion but one could exclude smokers or overweight people.  However, to the best of my knowledge this is not the case in other countries.  I am open to correction but it is the lower economic groupings that are predominantly smokers and overweight.  I personally do not have a difficulty if it were the case to exclude them.  However, this would be disadvantaging the lower members of our society.</p><p>  VHI pays 80% of the claims in the market.  We have a 48 hour turnaround and never delay claims in any way.  Our claims department is fully accredited with ISO standards.  In cases where some hospitals found it difficult on the administration side, we gave them advances.</p></speech>

Once we get a valid claim, there is no differentiation whether it comes from a public or private hospital or a consultant.  We do not have that amount of money sitting in the system.  When a valid claim comes in, it gets paid very quickly regardless of whether it is public or private.</p></speech>

One does not need such cover and it is open to how we design our system.  The Health Consumer Powerhouse, an accredited body, analyses health provision in all countries.  For the past three years it has made the Dutch system number one, stating UHI is one of the key reasons for its success.  It is not a panacea, however.  Competition among providers happens but not to the extent the Dutch wanted.  While it has its minuses, the people in Holland are very happy with their health care system.</p><p>  On the question of solvency, our number one objective is to ensure we are prepared to get full authorisation in the next 12 months.  We have been voluntarily compliant with the consumer protection code but, clearly, solvency is an issue for us.  One significant determinant of the solvency position will be how good and tight the risk equalisation system is.  We will work with the Government on this but there are many options we are exploring.</p></speech>

The Health Insurance Authority, HIA, identified that if health insurance were affordable, more people would be attracted back into the market.  The single largest component of health insurance cost is the health insurance levy.  It is &euro;760 for two adults and two children.  This can be reduced.  If it were, there would be an opportunity to attract people back into a market and making it more affordable and sustainable.</p></speech>

Senator Crown identified correctly that there is real risk now because we are in a very vulnerable stage in terms of migrating from one system to another, and I would fully agree.  The Senator mentioned a number of important matters, that there is an equitable system and we do not support inefficiencies.  There is a big challenge for us.  There are inefficiencies inherent in the system.  I will go back to my point in terms of not being able to negotiate the cost for public hospitals.  We know in many cases today that the cost of procedures in private hospitals are cheaper than the costs in public hospitals and that private hospitals are more efficient and can have much greater throughput.</p><p>  Senator Crown asked is there enough attention to the skill set in the public hospitals to address this issue.  I do not believe there is the experience necessary to address this or that it is being utilised to the extent that it can.  The issue is that 174,000 additional members have been driven back into the public health system and demand is increasing.  There is an opportunity to alleviate the demand while the public system transforms itself and we have to find a way to do that.</p><p>  I will take the Senator's questions on drugs, although some of the other insurers may hold a different view.  The challenge in the market is that the VHI is still a dominant player, and coming previously from a monopoly position.  It is an unfortunate reality that if the VHI decides not to cover a new drug, for example, then a much smaller competitor cannot cover the cost of that high cost drug because it would then be left to take all the risk and all of those who would use that new drug.  Unfortunately, one cannot do so because it would make a smaller health insurer less viable.  The issue of the VHI dominance-----</p></speech>

It is not a cartel.  The issue is that there is a dominant player which sets the pricing in the market and there is a challenge.  The other insurers find it difficult to negotiate with the private hospital providers and get rates that are comparable to a VHI rate because it has that dominant procurement effect.</p><p>  There were a couple of points raised by Deputy Naughten.  He asked would we cover all public hospitals.  The same point applies.  One potential issue is that in some cases the cost of the public hospitals is increasing and they may become much more costly than the cost of private hospitals.  At present, all public hospitals are covered.  If we see a continuation of the recent increases, it is questionable whether that is sustainable in the future.</p><p>  On the issue of 200 people a day leaving, Deputy Naughten is correct that we need to find a way to correct that slide.  The principal objective of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2012 should not be designed to prevent health insurers from attracting new members into the market or to restrict innovation.  There are ways that we can drive more innovation in the market but the Bill is shaped to try to curtail that, and that does not make sense.</p><p>  Deputy Naughten's last question related to smoking.  Of course, there are opportunities to change our approach here and encourage people to take a healthier outlook on life.  We believe there are.  I do not think they are being considered.  On lifetime community rating, the answer we received was that it was complicated.  It has been complicated for many years.  It is time to move this on and start implementing some of these mechanics that will make this much more viable and sensible.</p><p>  I hope I addressed the questions raised.</p></speech>

One would do it by product design, disease management and innovation.  For example, at Aviva, we have introduced a new back-up service to help people manage bad backs.  There would be a good example of trying to help reduce claims cost.</p><p>  There should be no levy increase.  It has been firmly established today that unless we change something, we should expect nothing other than what we have had previously.  While lifetime community rating is a big challenge, and we accept that if we move to UHI, a question arises which, if one wanted to solve it today, lifetime community rating would create that environment.</p><p>  In terms of the comments about smokers and overweight persons, this fascinates me.  In other markets in which Aviva works, for example, a customer can tell Aviva his or her weight and cholesterol level and confirm that he or she does not smoke, and then get a discount on his or her premium because he or she is less likely to claim.  If we were to introduce that under the Bill, as currently drafted, we could technically be sent to prison.  The Bill provides the opportunity for officers of insurers to go to prison if they do not comply with the Act, the principle of which is that we should not be seen to be distinguishing between the old and the young and the sick and the healthy.  It is not that there are no ideas and innovation that we could bring to the market that could contribute, but that the way the Bill is drafted, it would be an adventurous individual who would enter into that space.</p><p>  I echo Mr. Armstrong's comments on accelerated payments.  We have agreed to accelerate payments to help fund the budget gap.  We have been very flexible in responding to that.  We are happy to provide support.  We are paying the claims.  As soon as the claim is in and it is validated, the money is coming out of our bank account and helping to fund the budget gap.  I am not really sure, certainly from an Aviva perspective, where that sits.</p></speech>

Everything in the system should be structured to encourage that as an objective.  That brings in issues of competition, package design, etc.  The risk equalisation system can be done to encourage quality.  The German system encourages insurers to provide disease management programmes.  That will attract younger people into the system.  It is something that can be done.</p><p>  One of the issues we raise in our submission is our capacity as a country to introduce UHI.  I have worked in many different countries on UHI projects and all the countries tend to be significantly larger than our country.  It is a challenge that, because of our size, there will be much change within the hospital system and within the public policy area.</p></speech>

We need to try to understand the sources of the costs.  Procurement is clearly one.  Obviously we have large staffing issues in terms of doing that and they have been addressed separately.  They are issues beyond our health insurance market - the Croke Park agreement, etc.  It is quite difficult to manage.  Something fundamentally will change.</p><p>  The incentives will change significantly when UHI comes because the funding stream will shift to insurers rather than directly to hospitals, in some senses, and the public system.  That is a potential conduit for many changes.  Potentially it will change profoundly the way work is done.  Insurers may then have a responsibility to deliver a quality service to their members.</p></speech>

Deputy Kelleher asked about incentivising younger and healthier people to stay in the market.  We agree there is a dilemma for sure.  However, with regards age at entry and lifetime community rating, if that were brought in today, it would have a significant impact in encouraging young people to stay in the market.  The removal of the levy from children would be similar.  There is also the impact of the levy itself.  Those are three significant items that would make a difference.</p></speech>

I believe the market would equalise.  More younger and healthier people coming into the market would reduce the cost of insurance overall because the risk is spread across a broader base.  People who are younger then support the older and as they get older are supported.  The key is that they should join younger.  If people join later in life it is bad.  Unfortunately a significant number of our consumers under 50 are leaving the market.  If one looks at the lapsers, the number of those leaving the market is significantly higher than the overall profile of the entire market.</p></speech>

It may take four, five or even ten years, depending on the timescale.  Today the chairman of the HIA said that in his experience the length of time to get UHI to market is considerably longer than the current forecast.  In the meantime we can do nothing about it or we can incentivise the young and healthier to join.  In my view, as a consumer it is in everybody's interest to join a community rated market.  I accept that if it was to come in tomorrow or in the short term it would have a different perspective, but I think it will be in the longer-term future.</p><p>  Mr. Muiry will address the UHI question separately.  I will pick up on some other issues.  We were asked numerous times about the committee.  We highlighted it to the Minister and got responses along the lines that the universal health insurance committee was a rolling committee and that at an appropriate time we would be asked to join it.  We are just wondering when that appropriate time is.</p></speech>

It was a very informative but short presentation.  That was our first engagement on universal health insurance.  We expect a White Paper will be produced, etc.  However, we believe that as a market, we should be represented on the universal health insurance work group.</p><p>  Senator Crown asked about particular drugs that are coming into the market.  We have a standard procedure for assessing all medical technologies for efficacy, etc.  That goes through a medical advice panel and we take their advice.  People far better qualified than I am make that decision.  On the point about market efficiency, I believe there is an efficiency question.  As Mr. O'Dwyer said earlier, some 80% of the market is set by the VHI and that definitely influences across the board.  However, on the particular efficacy and adaption point mentioned by Senator Crown, that would definitely go before a medical advice panel and that would be it.</p><p>  On the &euro;120 million, there is no <i>quid pro quo</i> in my view.  There was a suggestion that the price increase had some <i>quid pro quo</i>.  There is no relationship because what is referred to as &euro;125 million - if I can say that - relates to a payment given for us to support the current dilemma the Government is in and there is no relationship on that.</p><p>  On the claims lag time, the time it takes to get a bill from a public hospital is on average above 90 days while a private hospital is around 30 days.  Without a doubt they are treated the same once they get in the door.  The problem is getting them in the door.</p><p>  Roscommon hospital was mentioned.  UHI is not defined and Mr. Muiry can pick up on that.  However, we would like to be in a position to ensure that our members are treated in the most appropriate setting.  We believe that places such as Roscommon hospital would be appropriate settings for certain procedures and obviously in other cases where they are not centres of excellence they would not be appropriate.  However, UHI will dictate how that will work.</p></speech>

Clearly many factors will drive the costs under such a regime, but foremost of those would be the scope of benefits, which is ultimately a policy decision as to what would be covered under such a standard package.  Senator Crown mentioned the good example of high cost pharmaceuticals, which is, again, a policy decision.  Should such novel treatments be part of the standard package, in which case it would have an effect in driving up costs in the system as a whole?  The ability of insurers to negotiate with providers and the effectiveness with which they can do that will serve to contain costs.  In addition, the provision for insurers to write supplementary health insurance benefits in addition to a standard package serves to bring down the costs of operating such a UHI regime and in my view should be encouraged.</p><p>  There is a very important point regarding the basis of risk equalisation for health status, which raises itself within the provisions of the draft health insurance amendment Bill.  Currently that is framed in such a way that equalisation will take place on the basis of health utilisation rather than health risk.  In other words it is effectively an after-the-fact health measure depending on the experience of the membership of particular insurers.  In principle that serves to discourage active management of health claims in the most efficient way, which ultimately has the effect of reducing costs within the system.</p></speech>

If one restricts the number of health care providers, one will automatically keep up the level of costs they can charge.  I make no apologies for filing a complaint with the Competition Authority on this matter because I certainly thought the case was anti-competitive.  The number of available private beds in a particular area was being restricted because of a decision by the insurers.  The issue of day care procedures is constantly changing and I am not sure if insurers are reacting fast enough.  I know of procedures where insurance cover will be provided if the person is admitted to hospital but will not be provided for the medical practitioner if it is done as a day care procedure.  That needs to be constantly reviewed because it seems to change at a very fast rate but I am not sure if insurers are responding quickly enough.</p><p>  I am not sure how insurers are approaching the admission of a patient with private insurance into a public hospital.  Consultants are being asked to sign forms but at what stage is the person treated as a private patient?  Is it when he or she is admitted or must the consultant sign off on the patient before he or she is treated as a private patient?  For example, what happens if a senior registrar, as is often the case, carries out a very simple procedure and the person is admitted to the hospital for a day or two?  In these cases, the consultant is quite happy to have the senior registrar look after that patient but the question is whether the HSE bills the insurance company and then asks the consultant to make out the bills when in fact the patient has not come in under the care of the consultant. </p></speech>

I know that many members of the delegation were in the Visitors Gallery when I first spoke about the figures with which this committee, the Committee of Public Accounts and I have been furnished by the HSE.  We seem to be at a crossroads and have been told by the VHI, Aviva Health Insurance and Laya Healthcare that there is no problem with payout.  I will read out the information we have.  We must address this issue because it is a substantial one for the public purse.</p><p>  At the end of September 2012, &euro;204 million was due to the HSE from private health insurance in respect of treatment provided to private patients.  Of the &euro;204 million, &euro;100 million relates to claims under preparation in hospitals.  This issue has been raised with consultants in terms of their failure to complete paperwork for whatever reason.  This is one of the areas in the ongoing Labour Relations Commission hearings where it has been outlined that consultants need to pull up their socks.  A total of &euro;104 million is outstanding relating to claims submitted to insurers which are either pending or being processed and this is the crux of the matter.  We have heard from the VHI that there is a 48 hour turnaround.  We have not heard from GloHealth in respect of the payouts there.  Laya Healthcare has told us that it has made the difference - and this is something of which I have experience - in terms of private hospitals being able to do their business much more efficiently in getting the bills out in the 30 day period versus a 90 day period.  We need further clarification on that because &euro;104 million is swishing around somewhere in the system and we would like to know where it is.  </p><p>  The HSE also told me that it has awarded a contract to roll out an electronic claims management in 11 HSE sites to replace the current paper-based system.  This is very timely.  The new system is currently operational in six sites and is expected to be operational in a further three by mid-November.  From the delegation's dealings with the six sites that are operating the electronic method of payment, is it increasing efficiency and are we bringing down that 90 day period to a much more manageable timeframe?  </p></speech>

It is wrong that people in the private health insurance sector who take in a huge amount of money and use public health services that are needed more by people who do not have health insurance can leave hospitals and the HSE in particular with such heavy outstanding bills.  This should be rectified.  People working in the private health insurance business are usually paid huge sums of money and they should get their act together, get the pen out and start filling out the cheques for the HSE.</p><p>  I know the index also covers Aviva Health Insurance, Laya Healthcare and the VHI.  The Aviva Health Insurance presentation shows that in 2011, there were 494,931 people in the category marked "17 and under".  There has been a drop of 127,000 in the category relating to people between the ages of 18 and 29 since 2011.  Once people are over 17 years, their premium doubles and probably reaches &euro;600 or &euro;700.  I understand some of these people may not be in the country because of the age bracket and because people may have gone away.  Part of the problem is that when people reach 18 and go into the next bracket, the cost takes them out of it.  Part of this cost has to do with the fact that many people aged 18 and upwards, particularly those aged up to 23 or 24, are still in college and do not have earnings.  The people who are keeping them are the parents, many of whom are not working.  The health insurance sector should look at raising the age level and not putting students in an adult age bracket even though they are adult-aged.  </p><p>  On Sunday, I attended the accident and emergency department at my local hospital as my daughter fell and sprained her ankle very badly.  It cost me &euro;100 compared with the &euro;255 quoted by the VHI clinic I rang.  I was quoted &euro;95 for what was basically an X-ray.  I do not think any private health insurance company can justify charging &euro;95 for an X-ray on a teenager's foot.  It is appalling.  </p></speech>

I will deal with the questions regarding our claims and the money that is in the system.  We agree with Mr. Clancy that public hospitals' submission is much slower.  I do not have the exact figures to hand but it might be four or five months.  It is longer than the figure quoted by Mr. Clancy.  The figure for private hospitals is around 30 days.  However, I am reliably informed that hospitals that have introduced the new process have improved.  It is worth noting that we as insurers, particularly Laya Healthcare, Aviva Health Insurance and ourselves, have used an electronic claiming mechanism over the past year or year and a half.  We are very keen to make this as efficient as possible and are piloting with a few private hospitals.</p></speech>

The average submission time in many public hospitals is 180 days and we are aware of three or four of these hospitals which have introduced a new system.  They have not quite halved their submission times but they have certainly taken one third off them.  There is no doubt a quicker process will get it in faster.  Our turnaround does not depend on whether claims are from a public or private hospital, we just pay it when it is valid.</p></speech>

When claims reach insurers we have a service level to which we adhere and which has been agreed with the market.  A second element of this is not receiving claims.</p></speech>

We should remember the scale of the total volume of claims in the system.  I do not have the exact numbers, but the value of claims paid in a working day by the insurers here is approximately &euro;10 million, which means an amount of &euro;100 million is equivalent to approximately ten working days of processing time.  There will always be a double digit million number in the system of the most efficient insurers.</p></speech>

I should make this clear to be fair to the insurers.  However, to ordinary people the amount of money which remains uncollected sounds huge.  They see their premiums increase and money being removed from the health budget while &euro;100 million, which is no small change, lies out there uncollected.  This is the point we are making.</p></speech>

We have heard much today about the fall-off in the market and the decline in the number of people who can afford to take out insurance and we are all concerned about this.  As the largest insurer, the commitment to sustaining the market as a whole is fundamental to how VHI operates.  Much can be done about cost containment, and one element which is important is a balance in the supply of services in the market.</p><p>  A big part of this supply comprises hospitals and hospital beds, which are very expensive.  We are all familiar with what happened to the hotel market in Ireland where we have a huge oversupply because of a large amount of overbuilding.  We would not like to see the same situation apply to private hospitals.  We attempt to ensure our members have access to an adequate supply of beds but not an oversupply.  As Senator Crown mentioned earlier, if the hospital sector has an oversupply and a hospital is under-utilised it would be very expensive to run and there would be a big incentive for the facility to bring in patients and potentially provide unnecessary treatment.  An alternative incentive would be to go to a private insurer and state it does not earn enough money and prices must be increased.  Internationally it is accepted that balancing supply of hospital beds is a very important part of managing costs.  This is what VHI does.  It certainly does not make us popular, but we are not there to support developers or private investors; we are there to manage costs on behalf of our members.</p></speech>

I am concerned that those of us around this table have our heads in the sand, insurers and policymakers alike.  The majority of people find it difficult to pay their health insurance.  The Department of Health, the Minister and others claim that waiting times have been reduced, the special delivery unit, SDU, has achieved efficiencies, etc.</p><p>  No one has discussed a major issue.  If universal health insurance is to be introduced in the coming years and the Government will tell people that they are obliged to take out private health insurance based on their ability to pay, what incentive is there for a young person to take out private health insurance before then?  People discuss reducing prices and this and that levy, but the fundamental issue is that the majority of people are finding it difficult to survive and pay basic bills.  Health insurance is almost a luxury at this stage.  It is becoming more expensive.  Due to the policy decision to implement universal health insurance, those who can afford private health insurance will be obligated to do so whereas those who cannot will be subsidised by the State.  I assume this is the form that universal health insurance will take.</p></speech>

I was always under the assumption that one would only be in hospital if one was sick, would only get a hip replacement if one required a new hip or would only get a stent if that was necessary.  The issue is not a question of ten or 100 beds.  One would hardly fill 100 beds with people just for the craic.  They must have a reason to be there.  Is Dr. Carr suggesting that, if there is a vacant bed, someone will be given a new hip even if it is not necessary, just to fill the bed?  Why does demand increase just because there are more beds?  I would assume that having three or four competitors would reduce the price of beds, hip replacements, etc., for insurers as well as premium holders.</p></speech>

Some 70% of a hospital's costs are staff costs.  It is not like a hotel, in that a hospital must focus on quality.  A hospital cannot get rid of nurses, as even a single patient in a ward still requires care.  One of two things can happen.  First, more patients who would not otherwise have been treated would be brought to hospital.  For example, there is always a level at which a hip replacement can be done.  The question is at what stage in someone's arthritis should it be done.  Discussing the issue of supply and induced demand is difficult, as one can argue over whether a person needs a hip replacement, but the real question is when does it become necessary.</p><p>  Second, if no additional patients are brought to hospital, it becomes a large white elephant with unoccupied beds, many nurses, doctors and physiotherapists and expensive machinery that needs to be paid for by-----</p></speech>

I am conscious of Senator Burke's first question, which was also raised by Deputy Kelleher, namely, competition between providers.  One insurer should not be able to determine the supply, whether a new medical facility should open or whether another must close.  The members' point is correct, in that medical providers should be able to find ways to innovate and bring value to customers.  If customers want to use facilities, they will.</p><p>  Deputy Conway made a number of points regarding the claims system.  If electronic claims processing and so on offer opportunities to achieve efficiencies, they should be welcomed by everyone.  We should seek ways to drive efficiencies in the public and private health sectors.  GloHealth would welcome opportunities to remove the overheads associated with processing claims from the system.  It adds no value for anyone.</p><p>  I am happy to inform the committee that GloHealth is not sitting on claims that are due to the HSE.  We process all claims in the same manner regardless of whether they relate to private or public hospitals.  As soon as we have the details, we process claims in single iteration within a short number of days.</p><p>  Deputy Byrne asked about costs.  As my colleague from the VHI clarified, there is a student rate, but the issue should be considered.  How do we attract people in the 18 to 29 years age bracket back into the market?  Lifetime community rating has been mentioned.  We may be able to use models and mechanisms to start making health insurance more affordable so that people can join the market.  However, insurers are prohibited by regulation from offering different prices to people over the age of 18 years if they are not students.  We cannot do anything for that community in pricing terms.</p></speech>

We routinely consider what benefits are appropriate for an inpatient or day patient setting, and we routinely move people from inpatient to day settings.  Well over 70% of our claims by volume are from day patient settings.  On occasion the move may not be quick enough but in general terms we have a process in place to review claims and ensure they are in the appropriate setting.</p></speech>

People are now staying in college for longer because there are no jobs, and there was a comment about bringing young people back to the system.  Perhaps the age limit should be increased to 25.

The challenge is that as we transition towards a universal health insurance model, we must do so in a way that facilitates a neat transition.  There is a particular issue with aged entry and community rating.  It is implicit in a universal health insurance model that, essentially, everybody pays the same cost, although it is usual with the State, through contributions in income, for subsidies to be made to those on low incomes, for example.  It would not be impossible to construct a system whereby in light of the particular challenge we face over the next few years, we could maintain a commercial insurance regime in a viable state by contemplating some incentives that could operate following the introduction of universal health insurance.  That relates to families having medical insurance currently or prospectively prior to the introduction of universal health insurance.  That could be time-bound, and with the often quoted regime in Australia the incentives to join early have a ten year life span.</p><p>  With the group represented here, it would be fairly straightforward to provide some creative options that could achieve both the short-term benefits we are looking for - including a more balanced and sustainable insured population - as well as setting up a neat transition to universal health insurance.</p></speech>

Instead of having an inexpensive X-ray, a person may have an MRI or CT scan, which would be more expensive.  That would not be done if the scanner was not there.  Many people with bad hip arthritis would not have had a hip replacement 40 years ago but as it becomes more available, the procedure is done much earlier.  If a sporting person has a hip replacement earlier - at 50, for example - the person would remain fitter and there would be a better quality of life.  Nevertheless, there is a cost.  That is supplier-induced demand.</p></speech>

That is where cost is relevant, as it must be balanced.  The more services provided, the higher the cost.  It is all about trying to provide what people need.  People must get what they need but they must be able to afford to be in the market.  This job is never finished or easy and it must keep going.</p></speech>

It is not really about getting a gall bladder out but rather an extra night in the hospital or three or four more tests that may not be required.  The standard test may be a blood test or X-ray, but there may be seven tests done on a patient.</p></speech>

I thank them for their engagement and hope they have found the experience positive.  From the perspective of members, it has been enlightening.  As a consequence, we hope to see a reduction in premiums.  Policyholders of health insurance companies, as I hope all committee members are, want to see bills reducing rather than increasing.  I thank the delegates for giving us plenty of information and engaging in a thought-provoking exchange.  For those members who wish to attend, we are meeting in the main hall at 1.30 p.m. for a photograph.</p></speech>
