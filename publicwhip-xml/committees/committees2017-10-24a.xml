    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-24a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Cogan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017102400002#C00300"><p>I thank the Chairman, Deputy Pat Deering, and the committee members for inviting Ethanol Europe Renewables Limited to address the committee.  As a member of the European Council, Ireland is currently deliberating on the recast Renewable Energy Directive, RED II, which is due to be finalised early in 2018.  The stated goals of RED II are carbon reductions, energy independence and sustainable economic development.  It is our view that the new directive should maintain and build on current targets for renewable energy in the transport sector.  We also believe that it should allow safe effective European crop-based biofuels to contribute fully within this target, as such biofuels greatly contribute to the stated goals with no adverse side effects.</p> <p>  Ethanol Europe Renewables Limited is an Irish firm that produces the bioethanol used in petrol blending in Ireland and Europe.  Our product helps countries reduce greenhouse gas emissions in transport and comply with their climate and energy commitments.  Ethanol is made by converting the starch and sugar in grain and sugar beet crops into alcohol.  Both European ethanol and its diesel counterpart that is made from rapeseed and sunflower oil are central to the health of the farm sector.  Biofuels and agriculture are two sides of the same coin and legislation concerning biofuels should treat them as such.</p> <p>  Europe's tillage farmers now depend on biofuels for nearly &euro;7 billion of annual income.  That means &euro;2,000 or more per annum for every tillage farmer in the Union.  It is also the equivalent to over 10% of total Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, payments.  The benefit accrues to all farmers in the form of a more robust demand for crops.  There is no doubt that if biofuels demand were to increase our farmers could readily supply the additional crop volumes from existing land without unwanted knock-on effects.</p> <p>  An additional &euro;10 billion to &euro;15 billion go to rural economies in the form of salaries, tax payments and service purchases at the biorefineries that process the crops.  Our plant alone has resulted in 2,000 new jobs since 2012, a tripling of the local authority tax takes and a rejuvenation of the surrounding region.  As many as 200 other communities around Europe have benefitted similarly.  Ireland could have several such biorefineries that process grain, beet and oilseed.  It is not too late and the rationale is stronger than ever.</p> <p>  As an integral part of the production process the EU biofuels sector produces some 17 million tonnes of GMO-free protein rich animal feed annually.  This is very valuable for Irish livestock producers and serves markets that demand the traceability of GMO-free produce.  Without the co-produced biofuel sharing the costs to produce a domestic animal feed then the feed would not be viable.  Our firm is leading the way in the production of ever higher quality feed under the Pannonia Gold brand.</p> <p>  The market for biofuels exists solely due to climate legislation.  The fossil oil industry would not consent to new entries to the sector otherwise.  There are three key legislative questions in the RED II directive.  First, the current 10% target for renewable energy in transport.  This target is the bedrock of climate legislation in transport today and hence the demand for European crops.  The draft directive of the European Commission proposes dropping the target.  Fuel distributors could dispense with biofuels in their petrol and diesel blends, which would result in a loss of farm incomes, rural employment and GMO-free animal feed.  It would result in more climate damaging fossil oil on the roads too.  Seven countries led by the Visegr&aacute;d group have signed a declaration appealing to the Council to take proper account of the impact on farmers.  Ireland and the Visegr&aacute;d group are strong allies when it comes to trade talks that threaten farm livelihoods.  RED II merits a similar unity.  Therefore, the 10% target should be retained and built on.</p> <p>  Second, in RED II, there is a 7% cap on crop-based biofuels that the Commission draft would see dropped to 3.8% on a path to a total ban.  This new cap might be reasonable if it applied only to biofuels that do not contribute to the climate, energy security and economic development goals of RED II or, indeed, if it applied only to biofuels that bring adverse side effects.  However, it applies equally to safe effective biofuels.</p><p>The reasons the Commission cited for imposing the 7% cap in the first place, namely, land grabs and food price hikes, have been shown to be baseless in the case of EU sourced crop biofuels, and in the case of the new lower cap the new reasons are likewise baseless.  The 7% cap should not be lowered for safe and effective biofuels.</p><p> Third, there is the opportunity to introduce standards to allow safe and effective crop biofuels be used above the 7% cap while barring the damaging biofuels which are easily identified and isolated.  The Commission&rsquo;s draft does not apply such standards.  Standards should be introduced in RED II as crop-based biofuels represent the most cost-effective measure for decarbonising the transport sector during the period that will be required for electrical vehicles to replace the fleet.</p><p> As investors, our confidence was sorely rattled by the Brussels U-turn in transport renewables legislation since 2009 when the 10% target was put in place and then immediately put back on the table for amendment by way of this indiscriminate cap on crop-based biofuel.  We cancelled our second biorefinery project, and several more as well, even though building works were already under way.  The draft RED II assumes that hundreds of new investors will be found to build new biofuels factories for advanced biofuels that do not use conventional farm crops, but there is no evidence that investor confidence will be restored to even the slightest degree.  In the lead-up to 2009, there were hundreds of biofuels business plans under evaluation in Europe.  In the lead-up to 2018, there is none.  Let us not throw away the European crop-based biofuels that give high greenhouse gas savings without adverse side effects.  They are here already and are cost-effective.  They will be needed in Ireland&rsquo;s, and indeed the EU's, climate programme.</p><p> A consensus has developed over the last six months that the draft RED II is based on an incomplete analysis.  The Commission&rsquo;s regulatory scrutiny board twice issued a negative opinion on it and, indeed, there was no third opinion.  The Impact Assessment Institute in Brussels found that "the policy to cap food-based biofuels for transport was assumed without supporting analysis".  Likewise, the Cologne-based Nova Institute in September found that "the systematic discrimination against first generation biofuels of the current Commission proposal is in no way founded on scientific evidence".  Finally, a few weeks ago the European Court of Auditors published a review in which it said "evidence based policy making" has become the second biggest challenge for achieving climate progress in Europe.</p><p> Ireland and the European Council have the opportunity to improve RED II in the coming weeks by keeping and building the overall target for transport renewables and by providing the right framework for the development of safe, effective, crop-based biofuels both as a climate solution and as an anchor of the rural economy.</p><p> I thank the committee for hearing this statement.  We hope it has been of service.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-24a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Brady" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017102400002#D00200"><p>Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 is commonly known as the renewable energy directive.  This directive establishes a common framework for the promotion of energy from renewable sources.  It sets mandatory national targets for the overall share of energy from renewable sources &ndash; 16% in Ireland's case &ndash; and lays down rules relating to renewable energy across the electricity, heating and transport sectors.</p> <p>  Directive (EU) 2015/1513 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 September 2015, commonly known as the indirect land use change or ILUC directive, amended the renewable energy directive.  With a view to minimising the risk of indirect land use change occurring, this directive placed a limit on the share of energy from biofuels produced from cereal and other starch rich crops, sugars and oil crops and from crops grown as main crops primarily for energy purposes on agricultural land.  These crops are commonly referred to as first generation energy crops.  Indirect land use change is where the crops grown to make biofuels are displacing crops grown for food and these displaced food crops are being grown elsewhere, possibly on land which, if used for biofuels, would not satisfy the sustainability requirements that apply to biofuels.  The ILUC directive placed a limit on the share of biofuels from these crops of no more than 7% of the final consumption of energy in transport in the member states in 2020.</p> <p>  Following the European Council conclusions in October 2014 and the energy union strategy of February 2015, the European Commission published the so-called Clean Energy for All Europeans package on 30 November 2016.  The focus of this package of eight legislative proposals, including an amendment of the renewable energy directive, is on the period post 2020.  The provisions of the proposed renewable energy directive build on the existing directive and provide a framework for renewable energy development to 2030.  As highlighted in the committee&rsquo;s letter of 19 October, first generation energy crops are of particular interest for this meeting.</p> <p>  Article 7 of the proposed revision to the renewable energy directive provides that in the calculation of a member state's gross final consumption of energy from renewable energy sources, the limit on the contribution from biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels consumed in transport, if produced from food or feed crops, will remain at 7% of final consumption of energy in road and rail transport in that member state for 2021.  However, it proposed that this limit shall be reduced to 3.8% in 2030 following a trajectory set out in an annex to the proposal.  The level of these biofuels in Ireland is currently circa 1%.  In addition, the proposal sets out that member states may set a lower limit and may distinguish between different types of biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels produced from food and feed crops, for example, by setting a lower limit for the contribution from food or feed crop-based biofuels produced from oil crops, taking into account indirect land use change.</p> <p>  The renewable energy directive has been discussed by member states at working group level and is also being considered by the European Parliament.  Ireland has expressed concerns regarding the proposed reduction which may reduce the demand for crops such as cereal and other starch rich crops, sugars and oil crops which are important break crops in rotation and diversification and could have a knock-on effect on the supply of oilseed-rapeseed meal available for animal feed.  Discussions at the working group are ongoing and the Presidency, currently held by Estonia, has issued a number of revised versions of the proposal with a view to reaching agreement between the member states.  Although many member states have expressed reservations about the proposal to reduce the 7% limit to 3.8% by 2030, final consensus on the proposal has not yet been reached.  Discussions will continue with a view to general agreement being reached by the Council of energy Ministers.</p></speech>

I will direct my first question to Mr. Cogan.  The dynamic behind this move at European level to reduce the 7% cap on first generation energy crops for biofuels comes from the ILUC report on indirect land use change.  Will he elaborate on his thoughts about that and his understanding of how it stacks up or otherwise?  There has been some dispute at European level as to whether it is accurate and whether the initial reports were correct.  That is very important in the overall context of what we are discussing.  I hope he will elaborate on that.  Will the officials from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment also give us their view on that and its bona fides?</p> <p>  The officials from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment indicate in their presentation that various countries, including the Irish Government, have expressed reservations and concerns.  That is not very firm about the Department's view on this.  Is the Department opposed to this cap being reduced?  Are other countries opposed to it?  One often sees scenarios in which various parties to a negotiation express concerns and reservations during the process, but ultimately the deal is done and that is the end of it.</p><p>Unless people are opposed to it, it does not stand for very much.  I would like the witnesses to flesh this out further.</p><p> We have dealt in this committee in recent weeks with the massive pressure our tillage sector is under.  We see year on year how the acreage under tillage is dropping and how there are no margins for farmers.  We have also seen in the past how the sugar beet industry, for example, has ceased to exist.  I am very interested to hear the views of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and our friends from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the potential of biofuel production to play a significant role in agriculture and the economics of how this might stack up in providing a profit to farmers, in particular the economics of how it may play out regarding the sugar beet industry.  I would also like further detail and commentary from our guests on the subsidies that are required in order to make this work.</p></speech>

I thank all the witnesses for attending and making their presentations to us.  I find it very surprising that there should be a reduction of this nature in terms of what we are trying to do in aiming to generate energy from renewable sources.  Can any of the witnesses give me any indication as to why we are dropping to this level?  I would have thought there are plenty of opportunities for us to convert to renewable energies.  What position is Ireland taking on this new figure?  This follows on from what Deputy McConalogue said about the 3.8% cap.  Surely the energy ministers can carry enormous influence on this, be ambitious and have a vision whereby we can move to reaching targets instead of finding reasons not to reach them, perhaps because of our own inaction or whatever else.</p> <p>  Mr. Brady referred to advanced biofuels.  To what was he referring?  I have another question for Mr. Cogan.  Is there any reference to palm oil diesel and whether the draft goes far enough in stopping its use?  As the witnesses will be aware, this is something we are aiming for, so what is the position in that regard?  Furthermore, is the change of land use from food production to fuel production driving this reduction, or what is the position in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-24a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1370" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017102400002#E00600"><p>I thank the gentlemen for their presentations.  Regarding reducing the 7% cap, which operates efficiently, at least at present, to 3.8%, is it the position that the new RED II would significantly alter the course charted by RED I?  What impact would this have on the growing of crop-based biofuels such as sugar beet, rapeseed and maize?  These are normal alternatives in terms of farm activity to ordinary grain-growing, which, as Deputy McConalogue has indicated, was on the verge of dropping out of the equation altogether in terms of viability over recent years.  What is important about biofuel production at farm level is that it provides an important source of high-protein by-products, which are central to many of the rations that may well be forming.  Is that not the case?  What would happen, for example, in Ireland, where we are highly dependent on beef and dairy products, which replace at significant cost the soya inputs at that level, if this were to be achieved and if a virtual halving of the cap were to come into it?  Surely the argument or focus of the policy objective is to achieve a significant reduction in carbonisation.  It is surely self-evident that biofuels are cleaner than normal fossil fuels.  Are we in Ireland in a position to say what the net impact of biofuels has been in terms of reduced carbon dioxide emissions?  What is the rationale for all these proposals under RED II?  How and why are they progressing at all in the face of negative regulatory impact analyses by a number of independent bodies?  The bio-ethanol industry is significant.  Can the witnesses explain or outline how this would all be impacted if this proposal and directive were to come into being?  Will the witnesses outline the position the Minister, Deputy Naughten, has adopted to date on these proposals?</p></speech>

Who wants to start?  The departmental witnesses might get the ball rolling.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-24a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Brady" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017102400002#E00800"><p>I will make a general point to start.  The 7% cap does not limit us - we can go beyond it - but when we add up our renewable energy, we can only count 7%.  If 8% of our energy in transport were to come from first-generation biofuels, we would only be able to count 7% of that towards our target.  At present, we are at 1%, so the 7% cap will not impact us for 2020, and even if the level were reduced from 7% to 3.8%, it would be well on the trajectory down to 2030.</p> <p>  A wide range of questions was asked.  I will try to take them as chronologically as possible.  Regarding the 7% cap and the point of view of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, the way these things work is that in the early working group meetings, member states set out where they have particular concerns and issues and the Presidency tries to accommodate these into a revised text.  The latest revised texts remove the drop from 7% to 3.8%.  I was very clear in my statement that this is not guaranteed and is still under discussion.  However, as far as the Minister, Deputy Naughten, is concerned, and following the use of political capital and the energy councils to discuss this, it appears that the Estonian Presidency has very much heard the concerns of the member states, and the current Presidency compromise proposal would not reduce the cap.  The current 7% cap would therefore remain in place unchanged, which is something that I think the Minister, Deputy Naughten, will support when it comes to the energy council.  The earliest this would come to the energy council is December of this year.</p> <p>  I will go through each of the remaining questions.  I think I have dealt with the question of the firm views on opposition to the cap.  Regarding the impact on the tillage sector and the potential role biofuels can play in emissions, Deputy McConalogue is absolutely correct.  We are not talking about 2020 here; we are really talking about 2030.  The key is the role biofuels will play.  If the cap were dropped overnight from 7% to 3.8%, which it will not be, there would be no impact.  We are currently at 1%, but it is a matter of how we develop.  The European Commission is very much trying to use RED II to propose that we keep developing first-generation biofuels but only up to a point, after which we would need to start using second-generation biofuels.</p> <p>  If I may, I will digress slightly and explain what biofuels are in our current fuels today.</p></speech>

It has increased from 6% to 8% as of 1 January this year.  This biofuel obligation rate is a volumetric requirement, not an energy requirement.</p><p>Biodiesel has slightly less energy per litre than normal diesel and bioethanol would have two thirds the energy per litre although it varies.  In terms of the current directive and double counting, there is an incentive to move away from first generation biofuels.  In our current targets for 2020, each litre of bioethanol that a fuel supplier puts on the market, which in this country is generally in petrol, they get one credit.  If they put in something that is in a list in the annexe, which in Ireland is generally used cooking oil and tallow, a waste product from the agricultural animal sector, they will get two credits because these are not grown for that specific purpose.  They are waste.  Advanced biofuels, which we do not generally use in this country, are substances such as algae, the biomass fraction of municipal waste, of industrial waste, straw, animal manure, sewage, sludge and palm oil, crude glycerine etc.  There are many more advanced biofuels.  Those are three levels.</p><p> The biodiesel content of the diesel in this country is generally tallow or used cooking oil.  Overall, when the double counting for the biodiesel is included, there is just over 5% renewable energy in transport.  When that is counted on a pure energy basis, there is just over 3%.  There are some supplies on the biodiesel side being supplied into the fuels in Ireland but there is very little, if any, ethanol coming from Irish producers and Irish farms.  There is an indirect impact such that prices may be higher if there is demand in eastern Europe, where I understand the factory is located.  That demand can increase grain prices across Europe.  The real question to ask in respect of these directives is not what is the role of bioenergy today, but what is its future role.  Up to the 7% cap there is quite a large area for us to grow by expanding biofuel, bioethanol in petrol, etc.  As it reduces to 3.8%, we would need to move towards those second and advanced biofuel levels.  That is where the proposal is coming from.  Sugar beet was mentioned and if it came back in, it could be used for biofuel.</p><p> This is the demand side measure.  The Commission is creating the demand for these fuels by setting these national obligations which in Ireland we transfer through to the biofuel obligation rate.  How do we get Irish farmers to produce it for the supply side?  It is disappointing that many biofuels are being used in this country but our production of them is quite limited.</p><p> The draft bioenergy plan as published, and which is being re-examined, considers the issue in terms of supply and demand.  This reduction is being considered because of the indirect land use change that is happening.  People are questioning the evidence.  There is a lot of evidence from the European Commission also and there are differing views on it.  As with all these matters, it is a question of balance.  The 7% reduction in the indirect land use change, ILUC, directive is now law for 2020 and the question is whether that should be reduced further.  It would appear that the consensus of member states is moving towards answering "No" and that it should remain at 7%.  </p><p> The answer to Deputy Penrose's question about the by-products, high protein, is absolutely "Yes".  That is where Ireland does import as part of feed and food crops.  That was a key part of our interventions in energy working groups.  As for the impact on beef farmers or farmers in general, we are at 1% and all of Europe, in terms of biofuels and even with double counting, is only at 5%.  The 7% has not created a barrier yet.  It is really a question of the future and whether the cap should remain or be reduced.  On biofuels versus fossil fuels, biofuels have been proven to reduce emissions.  The reduction in transport sectors from biofuels is between 3.3% and 3.5% of our energy between 2015 and 2016.  It is the heavy lifter.  Electric vehicles are doing a bit.  Even electrification of the Luas and DART does a small amount, but biofuels are the key heavy lifter in terms of decarbonising transport up to 2020. </p><p> The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment has signalled to another committee that it is his intention to carry out a consultation later this year on further increases on the biofuels obligation rate.  Given that there was a change on 1 January of this year, it has been clearly signalled that there will be no change on 1 January 2018.  That consultation would examine a change possibly on 1 January 2019 and 2020.  We need to be very aware that as we move to higher levels of biofuels, some of the vehicle fleet is not able to take those higher levels.  I would suggest that most of the petrol in Ireland is E5.  It has 5% ethanol.  Diesel varies but is approximately the same mix, 4% or 5%.  With the change that came in on 1 January this year, diesel will probably move up its biofuel rate towards what is called a standard grade of B7.  There are vehicles on our roads now, not many, that are not warranted to use E10.  As gasoline or petrol to move beyond E5 to E10, we need to be careful.  We could be back to the change from leaded to unleaded where some people will use an E5 and an E10 handle and some cars can take both but others cannot.  We hope we do not reach that level for a while yet but part of the consultation would be to tease out these questions and what impact they might have on infrastructure. </p><p> The rationale for renewable energy directive round two comes from the conclusions of the European Council in October 2014 which set out the EU's targets for 2030.  There are eight European directives on energy, energy efficiency, renewable energy, market and market regulation which are being reviewed as part of this process.  It is an entire update and review of the energy portfolio.  That is why the renewable energy directive is up for examination now.  I apologise if I have missed any questions but I have covered as many as possible.</p></speech>

When we had a sugar beet industry there were over 30,000 ha.  Last year, there were between 500 ha and 600 ha.  If the sugar beet industry is to come back, it will be to produce sugar.  Ethanol will be a by-product.  The same applies to wheat and barley.  The committee has met the grain growers.  They are competing with world market prices.  Unfortunately, with the cost of production here, it is better for grain to go to a high value end product rather than something like this which is secondary.  At the moment, there is no market.  The area of tillage is falling and anecdotally the area of winter plantings is down again because of the weather but also the hard harvest.  There may be in the future the potential to use grass as a biomass product because there is 93% grass in the country.  We are very good at growing it and are getting better at it.  There is no market opportunity for cereals for tillage farmers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-24a.29" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Cogan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017102400002#F00400"><p>I will quickly address some of the later comments and then answer the questions.  What Mr. Brady said about biofuels being key in European programmes until 2020 is absolutely true.  It is also true up to 2030 and 2050.</p><p>That is unfortunate for the climate in so far as the provision is that even under the best scenarios, electric vehicles will not have taken over the fleet to the extent that one would like by 2030 or 2050.  As a consequence we will still have hydrocarbon fuels sloshing around in petrol and diesel tanks, which we need to decarbonise and lower.  The vision, which we share, is that they would be advanced biofuels.  In the meantime, whether the solution is advanced biofuels and-or electro-mobility, we should not throw out what we have.</p><p> Regarding the value or otherwise of producing ethanol from grains and other crops, as a company, we are very active in producing ethanol from crops but also in producing feeds.  We produce ever more valuable formulae of those feeds.  We also break the inputs into other things that we can use in a higher value way.  One should look at it as an integrated refinery process where we are not simply building factories based on selling commodity ethanol, but rather building factories based on the notion that we will be selling commodity ethanol plus another five, six or ten things that are highly valuable.  That is our vision and mission as a business and what we want to do in Ireland.</p><p> I will return to the questions from the Deputies on indirect land use change, ILUC, how it stacks up, the ILUC food and fuel question and the rationale for the drastic change in direction on the renewable energy directive, RED II.  RED II effectively empties out the ambition of transport decarbonisation entirely because it takes away the overall target and proposes a new target which goes up gradually, from 1.5% in 2021 to approximately 7% in 2030.  Within that target are advanced biofuels and electricity.  There is double the number, up to five times, of forms of energy within those targets.  If one looks at the real climate impacts with regard to the actual amount of carbon emissions reductions, they are minuscule by 2030.  The Commission has effectively taken transport out of the deal for climate change mitigation by 2030, which seems unconscionable in so far as transport accounts for over 25% of carbon emissions now and is the only sector that is actually growing because the fleet of vehicles on the road is growing.</p><p> Why is there a negative approach to biofuels if we need them so much?  There are two or three things at play.  One, palm of diesel, which Deputy Corcoran Kennedy referred to, is very simple.  I deliberately did not mention it in my statement.  The street name for ILUC is palm oil diesel.  It has flooded into Europe since the biofuel friendly legislation came into place in the 2000s.  It is cheap, can be bought in huge quantities and the fossil oil companies can process it rather than having to buy from new companies such as us.  It is very cheap and popular but its indirect and direct impact on the climate is very damaging, since the forests and peatlands that are destroyed to produce it release much more carbon into the atmosphere than ever gets saved by displacement of fossil fuel.  It is a horrible commodity, an elephant in the room and is a huge part of the rationale for emptying out the RED II policy.  That calls for a policy that, instead of throwing all the babies out with the bathwater, has a standard in place that allows us to distinguish between something like palm oil diesel and fuels that do not have any adverse side affects.</p><p> European ethanol and biodiesel made from European oil do not have any of the negatives that palm oil diesel would have because, if one looks at from a common sense point of view but also using the scientific models that have been developed for this specifically, there is simply no pressure to create new farming land to supply European biofuel demand.  There is no pressure because even in the most optimistic scenarios, supposing Mr. Brady's Department decided to put 20% biofuels into the mix, and then we had to buy those crops from farmers to turn into fuels, we would still not be buying a significant enough amount of crop produce to impact the dynamics of agriculture and land.  European crop output increases by 1% or 2% a year.  It is a normal thing that happens despite the fact that demand is very depressed and prices are very low.  People get better at their jobs even if they are not trying to, due to technology, education and so on.  That tiny increase in European crop output each year would cover a very ambitious biofuels policy several times over by 2030.  Europe is a starch and sugar superpower and there is no way we could ever take away sufficient volumes from that to have an adverse impact.</p><p> We have a positive impact since if we were to increase demand and double or treble crop-based biofuels, Europe's farmers would love the extra &euro;10 billion or &euro;20 billion of demand.  They would not have any difficulty supplying it and would not need any more land.  Yield increase and use of marginal land or land going out of economic use at the moment would cover it many times over.  If one runs that through the scientific models developed by the European Commission to do that with real world data, one gets real world answers that confirm it.  The directive impact assessment, which is the technical side of the directive, cites an initiative to use the modelling systems based on a spike in demand that is way beyond any real world scenario.  Many people became concerned about biofuels because of the notion that if we replaced all our fossil fuel with biofuel, we would not have enough space on the planet to produce them.  That is true but nobody is suggesting that.  It is not a feasible scenario that exists in the real world.  The real scenario is one where the transport sector is decarbonised by 10%, 20% or 30%, using biofuels in ten to 20 years.  That is the optimum amount by which to do it and that can be covered multiple times over by Europe's farm sector.</p><p> There are no subsidies in Europe for biofuels.  There were in the past but there are none now.  There is a mandate.  Member states take the directive and transform it into a local national mandate, putting an obligation on fuel suppliers to blend.  In the case of our ethanol, which costs 45 cents per litre if bought in bulk, it is not a mad figure compared to the low price of fossil petrol.  It is also a highly efficient fuel blend additive.  It is marginally more expensive than the base petrol that we use, but blenders are only putting in somewhere between 5% and 20%, so it is not increasing the weighted average cost of the litre by a huge amount and it allows for other additives to be avoided that would typically be added to, for example, increase oxygen levels in the petrol or to make it cleaner or leaner burning.  Ethanol does that naturally.  Economically, it is not subsidised and it does not need a huge push.  We are overcoming the reluctance of the fossil oil industry to take into its business something that it does not actually make.</p><p> Why was there such an impetus to drop the target?  There have been big discussions in figuring out how to deal with palm oil and a couple of other shady elements in the biofuel sector.  It appears to me that the European Commission, out of a sense of fatigue, said that it would just get rid of the lot rather than implementing a slightly more sophisticated process that could actually distinguish between the good and the bad.  It is a big problem.  The European Parliament groups working on it actively now and the European Council, unlike the Commission, have decided that this will be key and that whatever comes out will have standards on it.</p><p> It appears that if a person does not have a biorefinery in sight of his or her farm he or she might wonder why they should care.</p><p>That is a legitimate thought.  If one has a biorefinery inside one's farm, it is terrific because one gets around 10% more per tonne than if one was selling to a trader.  One has more control over how one sells and gets a better price.  However, because a large amount of farm crop produce in Europe goes to markets anyway, the fact that the market is there but not visible still buoys it up generally.  Most Irish rapeseed goes to the UK where it is used for making biodiesel.  The effect is not something that one can see but it is there.</p><p> Regarding some of the others, in the case of the high-protein by-product, if the cap was halved, there is another element to the rationale for having a bluntly non-negative policy towards biofuels.  Five or ten years ago, the by-product of ethanol and biodiesel made from European oil seeds was good for animal feed but was not massively attractive as the quality was variable.  Some producers burned it or threw it away if they were unable to sell it quickly or easily.  That has changed but perceptions take a while to follow.  Now, no company in Europe treats their protein feed as something to be given or thrown away.  The emphasis has shifted from getting the highest yield out of the fuel part to getting the most consistent high quality from the feed part.  We could not exist without our feed.  It has to be the same colour every month, have the same smell, texture, and taste for the animals and have the same nutritional and handling qualities for the feed companies to which we sell it or we would be unable to sell it and we would have to give it away or burn it.  We have had to invest significantly in this, as have others.  I can see why that was not that important to architects of the policy but it is now.  The volume we produce is effectively the same volume of GMO soy meal imports from the Americas, and is very significant in the feed system in Europe and our ability to have a GMO-free feed system.  </p></speech>

Slightly more than 200,000 people work in the sector in Europe, and I referred to the farm demand.  There will be a cut.  What will happen is that the least competitive, the smallest and least ambitious will fade away.  It will depend on which states reduce it first because when it is translated into local legislation, some countries will maximise production.  The 7% and the 3.8% do not need to be applied equally over all forms, so that someone could say that they will continue using 7% ethanol and no palm oil, which would be terrific.  It is likely that the ethanol sector will be the one that will be the most hearty and healthy at the end of the period.<br/><br/>As for Ireland, we are not here worrying about our own demise, because we are a highly entrepreneurial, fleet of foot, confident, optimistic group of people.  While we are very confident that we will be more than alive and kicking, we just will not be doing this.  We are before the committee to discuss the principle of the thing rather than our fearing that our own pockets will be affected in the short term.  We have increased our staff in Ireland, opened new offices and new companies that are based on the biorefinery concept.  We see ourselves as an emerging star in taking tillage crops and treating them as more than commodities to be dumped on whoever will take them off our hands but having them treated as highly valuable inputs in a process that can produce really valuable nutritional feed, materials, energy, speciality chemicals and so on.  </p></speech>

I may be mistaken, but there is a conflict between what we have heard here today.  The view of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is that even if we were to grow grain for this product, it would not be feasible and the farming community would not buy into it in large numbers.  It is something like 1% now.  Would we reach 7% with the current margins?  That is the core of my question.  We have had a lengthy discussion about the viability of the grain industry and where it is going.  Acreages have fallen from perhaps 2,500 ha to anything as low as 1,500 ha now, which is a significant drop.  No new land is being made available and what we have is what we have.  Farmers have become more productive.  In many ways there has been a major change in dairy and grassland production is one of the key drivers there, especially in my part of the world in the south.  When it comes to the future of the grain industry, will farmers see it as a product to chase and one in which they see a future?  Will they perceive it as a product that will keep the industry going, whether it is the knock-on effect of having land for nitrates or straw?</p> <p>  I question the figures.  We can do anything up to 7%, and we are at 1% now, so we are 6% behind the curve in an industry that is running out of grain production.  How do the witnesses see that turning around?  Do they think farmers will see it as a commodity they will buy into as something that provides a sustainable future?  We must consider that grain is probably at its lowest levels over the past decade.  There have been four or five years of consistently low grain prices, although they have increased slightly this year on the previous two years but they have been at an all-time low.  The committee has heard about a levelling-off of grain prices and a dramatic increase is not evident. Members were told that 40% of the grain market is already there.  Ultimately, will that 6% be fixed by this cap or will we buy into it?  </p></speech>

I am sorry that I have missed some of the presentations and responses.</p> <p>  Teagasc had a synopsis of our responsibilities regarding greenhouse gases and emissions.  The EU has set a target of 20% reduction by 2020 and a 30% reduction by 2030.  The matter was debated in the Seanad recently, and no doubt in the D&aacute;il also, and I refer to the pressure on the agriculture sector since one third of those greenhouse gases come from the agriculture sector, especially ruminant animals and their methane emissions, which is a big challenge.  Teagasc has published four or five bullet points regarding its recommended strategy to the Government on how to address this.  When I read that, and participate in a debate in the Seanad, I cannot understand how an industry solution that would assist us in the process and in reaching those targets would be limited.  I would have thought one would incentivise the area.  Looking at the overall responsibility, one third of greenhouse gases in Ireland come from agriculture, which poses a real challenge with which we must grapple.  We do not want to harm our important beef and dairy sectors or the sheep and lamb sectors and here we have this industry-based solution.</p><p>Could we have a sense of the two Departments' views?  The EU has laid out our responsibilities, which we accept as a country and a people.  We must clearly make the case that they cannot ask us to meet those targets and put responsibilities on us but hold our hands behind our back when we have potential solutions, such as the industry-based solution presented here today.  I appreciate that the Government is engaging with the European partners.  Are we engaging robustly?  Are we pointing out that we have been given responsibilities by the EU while it appears to be limiting our options for meeting them?</p></speech>

I had a question in the D&aacute;il.  My understanding is that a lot of this is around change of land use.  The officials will correct me if I am wrong.  There is a kind of worldwide lobby suggesting that if I take Rwanda out of producing food and put it to producing energy, there will be people starving in the Horn of Africa.  We had the Famine in Ireland because of potato failure but there was an awful lot of other food produced that people could not get.  Famines then and now are caused by political decisions rather than a lack of food.  I think most people would agree with that.  I do not believe the logic works through.</p> <p>  What the officials are really saying is that the problem is profitability for farmers to produce the grain to make the bioethanol.  It is not profitable enough compared with traditional farm methods.  Is there a possibility of using more marginal land for different crops which could produce the goods we require?  Would that require incentivisation?  In my part of the world there are an awful lot of trees being planted through forestry and there is no work for people in the community.  We wait 40 years for the trees to grow, they are thinned after ten years and then it is another seven or eight years before they are thinned again.  It all happens by machine and there is no need for people.  If there was a crop that was reducing our greenhouse gases and solving those problems while involving an element of labour, that would certainly be a positive.  I would like the officials to tease that out a little bit.</p> <p>  I was interested in the point about growing grass very well if we are growing it.  I presume the reference was to using biodigesters to produce gas from the grass.  I would like to understand more about the profitability of that.  How would it fix the problem of work?  With slurry, we have deadlines.  We cannot get it out on the land when the land is too wet, and we have run into huge problems there.  I do not think we have any biodigesters in the country compared with other places around the world where biodigestion is used more to take care of that problem.  Our climate seems to be getting wetter and wetter and the problem of getting the slurry out is continuous.  Is there a possibility of killing two birds with the one stone and resolving this issue by using the grass which we produce very well while being able to pay the farmer a reasonable price for it?</p></speech>

The circa 1% is what is in our tanks.  Production of bioethanol in Ireland is almost zero.  In terms of the 7%, we are at 1%, but I would point out that we have a much bigger diesel fleet and use a lot more diesel than the average European country.  All of the renewable energy in our diesel, I think it was 99% or 100% last year, was second generation.  It was tallow and used cooking oil.  Much of that is produced in Ireland.  Those are not subject to the 7%, the 3.8% or any sort of limit like that.  We are a way off from this.  At the moment, the 7% or even the indication for 3.8% is not a barrier to development of bioenergy in Ireland.  It may be in the future as we get towards that level, but at the moment it is not.  In terms of emissions, we need to be very clear that this is in respect of our renewable energy targets only.  Nothing we have talked about applies to our emissions targets.  If a piece of land is taken out of beef farming and put into forestry, growing grain or whatever, or even the greenhouse gas emissions reduction if the whole country turned, there is no limit on that 7%.  It is important that we look at the two things separately.</p> <p>  There is a move away from a national renewable energy target.  The 2014 European Council conclusions that set an "at least" 27% target for the European Union as a whole stated there would be no national targets.  We talk about our 16% 2020 target a lot.  There will not be a European set target for 2020 for renewable energy.  We will have to put together our national energy and climate plans and specify our ambition.  That is why there would be no sectoral targets for transport, heat or electricity.  There is a biofuel trajectory there.  It is important to-----</p></speech>

Our actions are interlinked, absolutely.  In terms of land use and where the agriculture goes, however, there is no limit.  This will not create any sort of arable move to cereals that might help the emissions targets in the agriculture sector.</p> <p>  On land use change and marginal land incentivisation, there are land use change impacts if one does that, and that is where it is ultimately coming from.  I will leave the question of what can or cannot be grown on marginal land to other colleagues to answer.  On incentivisation, the renewable energy side of the piece very much puts the demand side in place.  We are saying this is what the market and the fuel suppliers should do.  They should put renewable energy into their petrol or diesel.  That is where the renewable energy directive is coming from.  In terms of incentivising industry in a particular country, that is more agriculture policy than energy policy.</p> <p>  On the commercial viability of gas and biodigesters, we do not have many of them at the moment.  Many of the ones that are here in terms of anaerobic digestion would have been funded under the REFIT 3 combined heat and power programme.  I am sure the committee is well aware that there is a renewable heat incentive in development.  Part of that process is a consideration of how commercial anaerobic digestion would be and what sort of tariff or subsidy might be required.</p></speech>

I do not think they would mind whether it was going to biofuel or malt barley.  Premium products are not getting a high price at the moment.  My understanding is that this is a by-product.  That is the barrier.  There is no price for farmers from which to make a decent profit margin.  A lot of the land farmers are on is rented.  The committee heard all this last week.  They simply cannot afford it.  Even farmers who are getting over 3.5 tonnes per acre of spring barley are not making a profit.  The area of wheat, barley and oats has gone down by 10% from 2008 to 2016.  That will continue.  Farmers are following the price.  Our dairy numbers are increasing because farmers see it as more profitable.  There was pent-up demand at the end of quota and we have excellent dairy farmers who are soaking up some of the land that is becoming available.</p> <p>  As regards the climate change issues, we are looking at the cows.  We had 1.43 million dairy cows in the last census.  We are very good at growing grass.</p><p>We are breeding a cow that is good at converting that grass into milk.  We have the economic breeding index.  That was a success, so we now have a beef data genomic programme where we are looking at the suckler herd and trying to make the animal more efficient.  We are grant-aiding farmers to use low-emission slurry spreading equipment, such as trailing shoes, dribble bars etc.</p><p> A major problem is that only 10% of our soil is at optimum fertility.  We are low in lime and pH which means that we lose about 50% of the efficiency of the use of fertilisers by being at the wrong pH.  This year is the year of sustainable grassland supported by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Part of that is the Teagasc 10t, which aims to get farmers to grow 10 tonnes of grass per hectare and use it, whereas at the moment the average is only about 6 tonnes per hectare.  There is huge scope there.</p><p> Growing crops on marginal land would not be a good idea because farmers are losing money when growing on good land.  Marginal land can be used for grass or other purposes but not to grow a crop because farmers would not make money.  If they cannot make money where it is dry and with a better climate and so on, it would be very difficult.</p><p> The profitability of biodigesters will vary.  Grass and profitability will depend on the tariff that is paid in.  There is none there at the moment.  People are not using it.  If the tariff were correct, there could be, or if the process gets better and we get better at growing it, there may be something there, but not at the moment.</p><p> The other thing with anaerobic digesters is that we do not reduce the amount of nutrient, meaning that phosphorus and nitrogen would still be applied to land after it.  However, we could transport it further and perhaps get money from producing electricity from the gas.</p></speech>

Our harvest is approximately 3.3 million cu. m of wood per year.  We forecast that to increase to about 7 million cu. m by 2035.  Almost all of that increase will come from the private forestry that has been established over the past 25 years.</p> <p>  On climate change mitigation, we forecast that between 2021 and 2030 approximately 22 million tonnes of CO2 will be sequestered by our forest estate, which will make a significant contribution to our climate change targets between 2021 and 2030.  There is considerable potential with afforestation increase in area.  There are very good grants and premium rates available to private growers to engage in afforestation.  From a macroeconomic perspective, the level of production from forests offers considerable potential for jobs and rural development.  The CO2 taken in by forests as they grow offers a considerable potential contribution to our climate change mitigation targets.  The benefit is not just from the growth of the forests but also from the produce of those forests.  The use of wood biomass for combustion has a very significant potential to reduce the level of emissions from other materials used in the building sector.  The benefits of the forest sector to employment, macroeconomic development and climate change mitigation should also be taken into account.</p></speech>

Where I live, all I see are trees around me and no people.  Every 1,000 acres of forestry employs only one full-time person.  I absolutely agree with Dr. Hendrick on the climate change benefits, but it employs nobody.  That is the reality when compared with any other sector of farming.  I never saw trees having to go to the town to buy a gate or a bit of fencing to put up.  Once it is planted, it is gone forever.  It is a permanent change of land use.  While I understand the benefits from the wider societal point of view, those of us living in the rural areas where we used to have communities but do not have them anymore are angry about it.</p></speech>

The plantation then needs to be maintained to control vegetation and so on.  That also takes labour inputs and so on, usually locally.  The other point is that depending on the rate of growth, the plantation can start to be thinned after 14 or 15 years.  It can then be thinned at three or four-year cycles thereafter.  Again that all generates employment from harvesting, transporting of material etc.  It also generates employment in the processing sector.  There are some great examples of sawmills and board mills giving good employment in rural places where there can be low levels of employment.</p> <p>  The level of production will increase substantially with a doubling of output.  A typical forest plantation from the time it is established to the time it reaches what we call the end of the rotation can last 25, 30 or 35 years depending on the growth rate.  There is actually considerable activity in those forests with a lot of wood coming out of the forests and generating local employment.</p></speech>

It cannot be sold.  Private operators are thinning forests at the moment and cannot sell the product.  They are piling it up.  Coillte is allowing that to happen.  I blame Coillte for it.  Thinning at the moment has no economic value.  People planted forests in the expectation that when they thinned their forests, it would have a value at ten, 15 or 20 years.  They are thinning the forests and even when Coillte was buying it, it was not covering the cost of transportation.  However, it has stopped buying the wood pulp now.  It is questionable whether this is creating an economic value.</p></speech>

Last year it was about 3.3 million cu. m and the previous year it was about 3.2 million cu. m.  The level of harvest is increasing all the time.  The level of harvest from the private sector is increasing.  It was not at the same level in 2016, but in 2015 it was at quite a high level.  There is a lot of activity with considerable increase in harvest.  There is considerable demand for wood, including pulp.  There is also a strong and vibrant market for wood fuel.  Many people are looking for wood.  The private forestry companies are looking for timber to buy from private forest owners.</p></speech>

I am stepping outside the transport sector into the heat sector, as it were.  Biomass is a key future fuel to decarbonise the heat sector.  It is one of the key fuels in the analysis for the renewable heat incentive through the use of biomass boilers.  There is a supply of biomass that could be used in the heat sector, but there is a price differential between a fossil fuel and renewable energy heating systems.  The renewable heating incentive is examining filling that gap.  That might be an opportunity.  I do not say it will be the solution to everything that was raised there, but it certainly has potential in the future.</p></speech>

It is important.  I spend much of my time in Brussels where so much of what impacts us in Ireland gets decided.  There is nearly a divide-and-conquer thing going on whereby something may not be screamingly important to us here today, but it is important to other people over there.  If our farm sector gives away Europe-wide &euro;6 billion or &euro;7 billion per year of demand on the basis that it is not very important to us right now, it will have an impact.</p><p>It softens the market for everybody and it is one big connected market.</p><p> The other issue here is that many things are eroding away at the farming sector and at farm life.  There is this particular matter, of course, there are international trade talks, there is the current battle over the Mercosur countries that we may well lose, and there is Brexit, which will obviously affect us very specifically.  I would consider it a positive development if we were to think about this on a European level and defend the farming sector in general against any kind of legislative manoeuvres that would erode the ability to make a living in this sector.  We should stoutly do this.  I also think that we have been supported in our stance on Mercosur by many countries who do not really care very much about beef but who see agriculture as something worth defending across the board.  We should belong to that cohort of countries, including both France but also the central and eastern European countries, that are ready to stand up and be counted on every battle and on every front that is eroding away at agriculture.  That is my main point here.</p></speech>

I am conscious that yesterday an NGO called Friends of the Irish Environment was given leave in the High Court to take an action against the State for perceived failure on our climate mitigation actions.  This country is generally coming under criticism in this regard.  The witnesses are of course appearing today before an agriculture committee.  Obviously we value agriculture economically and we are very proud of the fact that we in Ireland farm in a carbon-efficient manner, which was the subject of discussion here.  A certain proportion of our emissions is allocated to agriculture.  To get the balance right, then, we have to be very active in developing other areas and in upping our game in these other sectors: electricity, transport, as we have been discussing here, heat, and energy efficiency.  We have an abundance of renewable electricity sources.  We have been talking about biofuels here today and it seems that we have so much available to us and that we just have to get the policies to match.  I know that there are issues around cost and so forth.</p> <p>  People have mentioned biomass and forestry, which fall into the camps of both the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I want to echo some of the points raised earlier by Deputy Martin Kenny.  We in Mayo have a lot of forested land but most of the forestry currently owned by Coillte is being felled and then shipped down to Waterford. As a result we in Mayo get no value added to that product.  I very much welcome the renewable heat incentive scheme, which is long overdue and can bring a new stimulus to the market.  When it comes to many of the policies that we are trying to implement, we talk about creating a stimulus because the default position - fossil fuels, conventional generation etc. - are cheaper and all existing technologies have developed around them.  We are going to have to invest and this is what we have been doing.  I welcome that.</p> <p>  I am not up to date but I often got the impression in the past that there was not much of a conversation taking place between the two Departments on how to drive things forward when it came to renewable energy, land use issues, and areas of departmental commonality.  This may have changed and I would be delighted to hear it if so.  I am talking, however, about the situation as it was up to two years ago when I would ring people and one hand did not seem to know what the other hand was doing.  Other than the proposals coming from the farming organisations, what vision or plan is contained in this renewable heat incentive scheme to add value to a community?  We have been talking about sequestering carbon in forests, for example, and we know that the Government has given many grants to forestry.  When the wood is cut, however, we could perhaps introduce systems or some kind of co-operative whereby all of the farmers within a certain radius could bring their crop, be it forestry or willow or whatever, and have it dried or turned into woodchip.  From what I can see in the west and north west, we could introduce a system along these lines which would be much more labour intensive than the current model, thus creating much-needed value and employment in the local areas.  While we encourage people to burn woodchip and the like, I have heard of people having to bring it down from Enniskillen, despite the fact that we are surrounded by forests.  I would like to ask the witnesses what concrete plans have been made to develop this aspect of things and to show real value for communities that need to make the most of their natural assets, among them forestry and biomass.</p> <p>  I also have a comment on the area of willow and energy crops.  I heard recently of the ways in which a particular farmer has to deal with his willow crop.  First, the willow has to be harvested, and then the farmer in question has to bring it somewhere else to have it broken down.  Anyone harvesting any other crop has a single machine in the field to do the job required, so the willow situation sounds highly inefficient and hit-or-miss.  I think that Teagasc does a great job in advising and guiding farmers, but does willow come under its remit?  Is it excluded because it is not food?  Does it perhaps come under the general agriculture remit?</p> <p>  On the fuel side of things, Deputy Corcoran Kennedy and a number of other speakers mentioned the issue of palm oil, and I am trying to understand the logic here.  I understand that many of our fuel crops are imported from outside of the EU.  If we are taking in fuel crops like palm oil from south-east Asia, what about the carbon footprint incurred by the transport of this?  How does this fit into the equation?  A further issue highlighted by NGOs and by Irish Aid is the fact that energy crops are displacing food crops in the developing world, particularly in east Africa.  This is not just a question of people going hungry to bring us energy crops.  People are also being displaced from land by governments that may not be operating in the manner that they should.  Will Mr. Brady explain how this matter is being addressed?  Again, the crops in question have to be transported, thus generating a carbon footprint.</p> <p>  I will finish on the matter of our very carbon-efficient farming methods and the argument that people should be fed using the most carbon-efficient processes.  To what extent does this argument cut the mustard in Europe?  To what extent can we in Ireland argue that we produce food in a more efficient way than our counterparts in Italy, for example?  Does Ireland actually get any credit for this, or is it just a matter of us telling ourselves that we are doing a good job with our beef genomic schemes and so forth?  Does any of this actually have any currency when we discuss our targets and objectives in Europe?</p></speech>

I would like to ask Mr. Cogan if Ireland, given our weather, is fit to produce sunflower oil.  I also have a question for the witnesses from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine on the production of bioethanol.  My understanding is that bioethanol can be produced from pulp for cattle and that it is possible to produce a biodegradable bottle, something I know to be under way in County Clare.  I believe, however, that one needs sugar to be available on the world markets at &euro;500 per tonne for this to be viable.  Is that correct?  That is the figure that I was given.</p><p>I agree the market would be an opening for farmers, especially the tillage guys, because we are 1 million bales or 100,000 acres down on tillage this year because people are fed up taking a bad price.  </p><p> My next query is for Mr. Brady.  Will his Department stand over giving a renewal heat incentive, RHI, to a company that erects a factory in another country, like Bord na M&oacute;na is doing or going to do?  I mean a company that sources the raw material in its host country, hauls it to the factory, processes it there, hauls it by a boat and brings it into Ireland.  Will his Department give an RHI to a factory that acts in this way?  </p><p> Palm kernels are being imported into the country at present.  This committee must make it clear that agricultural emissions have decreased.</p><p> I have more questions for Mr. Brady.  There is an EU directive whereby in order to have food security one could not go too far in producing some of those crops.  Why is it okay to not have an EU directive that stipulates every country must have a certain amount of trees or cannot kill all of their cattle like some phenomenal people are talking about at present?  Why has one sector been picked on?  I have analysed other aspects of agriculture and the directive does not seem to be applied in the same way. </p><p> Mr. Nolan referred to a grass anaerobic digester, food and grass in terms of the directive.  I looked at such a digester in the past few weeks and can attest to the fact the machine needs a terrible amount of grass in order to work and produce biogas.  To be brutally honest, unless one has a proper tariff of 10 cent or 11 cent built in then the task is not worthwhile for farmers.  We have talked about using such digesters but, on the other side, there is a directive that has stalled everything.</p><p> I have figures on miscanthus willow production to hand that I can show the witnesses.  The figures reflect the fact that the farmers who went into such production ended up earning less than &euro;100 per acre per year.  Last week, one farmer in interviews on all of radio stations stated that he has resumed beef production because there was no money to be made from growing miscanthus willow.  </p><p> My next query about trees is for Dr. Hendrick.  First, if one lives in the real world, one earns nothing unless one in commercial timber production.  I come from a machinery background and worked in forestry.  Therefore, I know that a lot of guys who worked in forestry went bust.  Second, the sector does not employ many people as one guy can do the whole contract.  Dr. Hendrick was correct to say that a grant introduced 18 or 20 years ago has resulted in timber coming on stream from the private sector because some people planted bad land.  Such planting was not done for the love of doing so it was done just to receive a grant.  It is a fact that the thinnings cost producers money.  If one has a plantation that is fit for cutting, unless one has commercial timber one is at nothing.  Has the downside been examined?  Many areas have been planted - Deputy Martin Kenny's area of Leitrim is one of the worst cases but the west of Ireland has got its fair share of plantations - and communities and schools have been lost.  The people in those areas must go somewhere and, unfortunately, emigration has been the answer for a lot of them.  Therefore, I do not think we should go down that road.   </p></speech>

The local use of energy for heating is welcome.  We hope that the renewable heat incentive will result in a local demand for material for use in heating and so on.  The RHI is a good model to incentivise the use of wood fuels locally and some local businesses or small district heating facilities use wood fuel for heating.  We see the initiative as being a great match to the forest resource because a lot of additional material will come on stream from the private sector over the next 15 to 20 years.  We view the heat market as a good way to use such material. </p> <p>  On the point made by Deputy Fitzmaurice, County Wicklow has the highest level of forest cover in the country and it has thriving local rural communities, in many cases on foot of afforestation that took place 30, 40 or 50 years ago.  The county has many small sawmills and many companies that make garden sheds etc.  We see this as a good model and example for the rest of the country in terms of the benefits generated by afforestation over time.  </p> <p>  The Deputy made a point about tree thinnings.  The forest service provides a forest road grant to landowners in order for them to thin out their plantations. </p></speech>

From an energy perspective, we hope the RHI will be a useful vehicle for the forestry sector that will stimulate local demand.  In terms of the privately owned estate, there is a roading grant and there are other grants available.</p> <p>  On the energy side, the Department makes available a lot of information on the supply chain.  We organise workshops around the country to bring owners, developers and entrepreneurs together.  We show them what one needs to do to put together a good plan to exploit a forest area and supply wood fuels to the marketplace at a competitive price.  A lot of things are happening in terms of wood fuels and so on. </p> <p>  It is important that we stimulate that market and not just in terms of the wood fuel supply but for the more valuable material that will eventually be produced from forests such as large stake wood and, ultimately, sawn material.  The earlier we intervene in forest plantations in terms of taking out smaller material then the greater the knock-on effect there will be when it comes to providing larger sized material for sawmills, etc. which is the higher end of the market.  Such work will give a return to the growers who are local landowners and private forest owners and to the locally developed industry and, on a wider scale, the sawmill sector.  </p> <p>  I hope I have covered all of the questions and points that have been raised. </p></speech>

Any time there is a question he talks about it and he has done a lot of work on the subject.  Advice is one of the key elements of the rural development programme.  The Department proposes to give &euro;100 million to encourage farmers to attend discussion groups and engage with advisers because the best way to cause change and become more carbon neutral or carbon efficient is to make each farm more efficient and use less energy, and eventually become an energy hub.  There may be a role for planting some of a farm and a combination of farming.  I do not think it has to be an either-or scenario but that is my opinion.  There is definitely scope in the future for more use to be made of forestry on different types of land.</p> <p>  Today, we are here to talk about regulation.  The big international buyers like Danone and Nestl&eacute; are now not happy to simply say, "Show us your regulation."  They are saying, "Show us your impact on water quality, greenhouse gases and so on."  Ireland supplies 15% of the milk powder market in the world.  It is a premium market but to maintain our position we must produce to the highest standards and our farmers are becoming more efficient all of the time.  In Brussels we are all of the time giving the message that our farmers are at the forefront whether it is producing beef and filling in a carbon navigator, the dairy sector or whatever.</p><p> As regards the sugar beet price, I am sorry but I am not sure what it is.  What I do know is that before the factories closed here, it was very difficult at the price that was in place.  The UK is under pressure even though it has bigger farms and more sunshine.  Unless the price is quite high, it is difficult to see an industry here.  However, there is a Beet Ireland energy group which states it will bring something back.  However, I am not sure what the price is.</p><p> As regards using grass in the anaerobic digesters, it costs &euro;40 a tonne to produce grass silage and one will get &euro;25 a tonne.  That is what is being spoken about.  At present, it does not pay.  Maybe it will in the future as we get more efficient.  I hope I have covered everything.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-24a.74" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Brady" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017102400002#N00500"><p>Yes, he has corrected me once or twice already.  In response to Senator Mulherin, in terms of the working relationship with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I have only been with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment less than two years but in my experience we have an excellent working relationship.  In terms of the renewable heat incentive, RHI, biofuels and the bioenergy steering group, we have had a great period working together.  If there were issues there in the past, I see no evidence of them there now.</p> <p>  The climate piece, the emissions reduction etc. are obviously a core part of this.  We are here talking about renewable energy, but I refer to the secondary part in terms of emissions reduction.  That is the key driver of this.  It is a climate and energy package.  That is what is driving the whole piece.</p> <p>  The directives and regulations coming from the European Commission are very much from an energy policy point of view.  They are trying to drive national policy on energy, and how we translate them nationally is our competence.</p> <p>  In terms of transport, we will meet the transport decarbonisation target by putting an obligation on fuel suppliers.  That is our key lever.  We are also moving into electric vehicles, EVs.  That could be described that as Exchequer-funded subsidies.</p> <p>  In terms of the heat sector, we have spoken about the RHI.  That also is an Exchequer-funded subsidy.  In terms of the RHI, it is important to distinguish between supply-side and demand-side measures.  The RHI is a demand-side measure.  It will stimulate demand for bioenergy.  Undoubtedly, that will require supply.  Deputy Fitzmaurice mentioned farmers who have planted certain crops and have found there is no market for them.  It is clear we need to put the demand side in place first and then develop the supply lines.  As set out in the draft bioenergy plan, as I stated earlier, there are both demand-side and supply-side measures.  The demand side is very much the RHI.  It is not alluding to something beyond that, but we do need to put that demand in place.  In the Senator's example, if there are businesses, factories or industry that would like to convert from fossil fuel to a renewable alternative and at present that barrier is more expensive, if that gap can be filled through the renewable heat incentive, that can be made happen and then that provides a local demand for biomass, which is the key element.</p> <p>  The palm oil question opens up the question of sustainability.  In fairness, that would be part of the indirect land use change, be it in Europe or beyond, that if one is demanding something, there is something else shifting.  There are sustainability requirements in the renewable energy directive currently and they increase with time.  Renewable energy produced from existing installations is at a certain percentage.  As for energy produced from new installations, any installation that starts operation after 1 January 2021 will have to ensure a 70% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for the fuels that are produced.  There are sustainability requirements in the renewable energy directive that ensure we are moving towards a path where there is not a gap in the arithmetic and we are not reducing emissions where they are increasing elsewhere.  Those sustainability conditions are in there.</p> <p>  On Deputy Fitzmaurice's point about the proposed renewable heat incentive, I would make two points.  The first is that the incentive would be paid to heat users, not suppliers or importers of biomass.  The factory owner who converts his fossil fuel boiler to a renewable energy boiler would receive the tariff and then buy the bioenergy.  It would be very much for the heat user as opposed to the heat importer.</p></speech>

Does it make sense to import this biomass, burn it at 40% efficiency to produce electricity and pay the person to participate in the RHI because we are not providing an incentive to Irish farmers to produce something when it can be bought or produced cheaper abroad?  We will never solve it if that is the road we go down.</p></speech>

We can control to some degree through sustainability criteria.  Under European state aid rules, we would not have the ability to say that this incentive is paid to a heat user but only if he or she buys biomass that is produced in Ireland.  We cannot distinguish.  It is a European single market.</p></speech>

The second point is in terms of how we would encourage it to happen in Ireland as opposed to France.  We have to look at the supply side.  In the past, it did not work as well as planned because when the supply-side measures were put in place, there was no demand.  One must put the demand-side measures in place, that is, the RHI, and then that will provide a market, a demand for biomass.  If domestic industry needs support, the appropriate place for that to be put in place would be on the supply side.</p> <p>  There were a couple of other questions.  In terms of why the EU is deciding to do this in renewable energy and not in other areas, I honestly cannot tell why the EU has chosen this particular area but, obviously, it is focusing on the renewable energy targets.</p> <p>  For grass working in biomass needing a tariff of 10 cent or 11 cent, we need to be conscious that the RHI is a multi-annual programme that would be funded from the Exchequer.  Therefore, we need to ensure that there would be value for money for the Exchequer and identify the most cost-effective way for the renewable heat incentive.</p></speech>

Regardless of whether we like it, would Mr. Brady agree this will cost a lot of money?  It is subsidisation.</p></speech>

Bringing us back to what we are here to talk about in the first place, the bioenergy and biofuels obligation rate is not Exchequer-funded.  It is effectively placing the obligation, via the suppliers, on the users of fuel for transport to include a certain amount of renewable energy in it.  There are myriad options available.  Certainly, to start something, an incentive is sometimes the most appropriate action.  I think that completes the questions.</p></speech>

The idea of indirect effects, that is, if we use land to produce biofuels then we do not have it for food and somebody else has to use other land for food, is a kind of scary Hallowe'en ghost in so far as it is definitely the single most widely used rationale for the change in direction in the biofuels policy in Europe.  I remind everybody that while it is a legitimate phenomenon, it does not happen.  It is not happening in Europe for the biofuels that are produced in Europe for European use.</p><p>Even under a more optimistic or ambitious biofuels policy in Europe, as long as it was restricted to European crops processed into biofuels and used in Europe, those land use change dynamics would never kick in in a way that would be worrying.  That is not just an opinion; it is scientific.</p><p> With regard to Senator Mulherin's point on the import of Asian palm oil diesel and possibly even the African example she used, to my knowledge not a drop of biofuel has arrived in from Africa, although people feared that would happen.  It is tightly monitored.  Every single drop, or at least every tanker load, of biofuel that is used in Europe is traced.  At a load basis, it is all extremely closely monitored and, to my knowledge, nothing has ever come in from Africa.  Unjust things can happen in Africa but there is no evidence of any connection to European biofuels.</p></speech>

People had been growing food there but they were displaced.  There was a lot of consternation at the time which is why I am wondering what has happened.  I assumed it was not the only example.  It was an Italian company whose idea was to import it into Europe.</p></speech>

As far as I know, it did not then happen.  Perhaps the injustice happened initially in terms of the reuse or repurposing of the land.  However, I am not aware of any of the fuel then coming in.  Right now, Italy is the biggest and most ambitious processor of palm diesel, and it is busy adding more capacity to its palm diesel processing.  Every time I turn on the radio in Italy, where I spent a lot of my time, I hear the advertisements.  It is marketing it to consumers as a green way of getting from A to B.  That is because the legislation allows it.  In both instances - the African and Asian palm oil - I cannot be more categorical.  We are absolutely against it and is an atrocious way of abusing the basic principles of climate legislation to do something that nobody wanted, because it is worse than the illness we are trying to cure.  I would much prefer if we were to carry on using fossil fuel than to use palm oil diesel or something imported from Africa if it were to be done in a socially unjust way.</p> <p>   Mr. James Cogan: That is an interesting example.

However, right now Italy is the single biggest and most ambitious processor of palm diesel and it is busy adding more capacity to its palm diesel processing.  Every time I turn on the radio in Italy, where I spend a lot of my time, I hear the advertisements, and it is being manufactured to consumers as a green way of getting from A to B.  That is because the legislation allows it.  On both instances - the African and Asian palm oil - I cannot be more categorical: We are absolutely against it.  It is an atrocious way of abusing the basic principles of climate legislation, which is to do something that nobody wanted, as it is worse than the illness we are trying to cure.  I would much prefer if we carried on using fossil fuel than use palm oil diesel or something imported from Africa if it were to be done in a socially unjust way.</p> <p>  The thrust of our argument is that the legislation should be capable of blocking the palm oil diesel and those things that do not actually do any good.  It is not a difficult thing to do.  If we could simply get that through, we would be able to carry on helpfully and happily developing the sector within Europe based on European-produced crops of European producers being consumed here.  We would ring-fence the whole market, which is good for everybody, and provide more demand for all those tillage farmers who are suffering.  That is not just an Irish thing.  It is happening throughout the Union.  We would very much echo, therefore, the Senator's sentiments on it, as would the industry as a whole.</p> <p>  To answer Deputy Fitzmaurice on whether Ireland could produce the sunflower seed needed for biodiesel, I am not sure that sunflower is an optimal crop for Ireland.  However, Ireland can produce rape, wheat and beet, and they are ideal crops for producing fuel for cars.  I would always stress that it would be done in parallel with other products in order that it would not be entirely biofuel-based and we would be getting materials and food out of it as well.</p> <p>  Deputy Kenny mentioned marginal land use.  It is not a black-and-white issue where there is marginal land and non-marginal land that can be either used or not used.  Land becomes marginal as it falls out of use and is no longer managed.  The longer it is out of use, the less likely it will come back into use.  The production of European biofuels reduces the tendency for land to drift out of use and into redundancy.  Typically, European biofuels are certified and are monitored for being produced in ways that do not eat into existing agricultural production.  They should be produced from land that is at risk of drifting into redundancy and from yield growth.  That was the principle behind it, and it has also been the practice.  We have had ten years of monitoring reasonably large scales and growth in some areas, and the practice has been as good as the principle.  Where the practice is not good is where it involves imports.</p></speech>

For example, in the case of Athenry, if the wind farm gets a REFIT tariff when it is built, the company itself will not be able to get carbon credits or green energy credits for it.  There is a prohibition in this article.  From speaking to some people in the renewable energy industry, I understand that if there was some deviation on this, it would allow us to be more attractive to FDI and to enter into certain arrangements.  At the moment, we have a REFIT tariff that supports, say, renewable wind.  However, if a big company wanted to come into Ireland and be associated with a green energy project, perhaps it could pay something towards supporting the cost of it in order that the entire REFIT tariff would not be borne by Government.  To make us more attractive to FDI, could there be a more flexible approach rather than that set out in Article 19 of the renewable energy directive?</p></speech>

We are after covering a lot of ground and getting away from the main point anyway.  I understand that there is a crop called camelina which is viable in Ireland.  I understand that it is not really that well grown but I believe it can be used for aircraft fuel.  Could that possibility be developed further?  I understand it is a very good break crop.</p></speech>

The challenge with aircraft fuel is that it is not taxed.  It is very cheap for airline operators and there is little incentive for them to swap to anything at all.  There are different crops that could be more efficient for producing specific types of fuels.  The only caveat I would raise is that one would have a very vulnerable chain if one were to create a little walled garden market going from the farmer who learns how to plant, grow and cultivate a new crop to a firm that processes it to a company that buys it and puts it in its aircraft.  One broken link and the rest of it falls down.  One part of the chain is the legislation around it.  It is preferable to stick with the ones we know and to stick to crop types that can be expanded or contracted in an elastic way depending on a number of other things in order that they are not entirely dependent on one processor who is dependent on one regulation and one customer who is prepared to pay more for ten years while the rest of it gets off the ground.  Therefore, the answer is "yes, but".</p></speech>

In the voluntary market there are markets for voluntary offsetting and so forth.  However, in terms of the afforestation programme in Ireland that would potentially be eligible for use to make a compliance statement, that is the compliance market.  It is not as if it is traded or whatever.  It is for Ireland to make its compliance with its national target in the EU.  It is not a traded commodity in that sense.</p></speech>

It may potentially be used in a voluntary market but the amount of carbon that would be sequestered by forests in Ireland - incidentally, it is not all forests but a category of afforestation over 20 or 30 years depending on what is agreed between 2021 and 2030 - would be used for compliance.  That is not a tradeable commodity at present in respect of Ireland's compliance.  It is used for Ireland's compliance with its targets; it is not a traded commodity.</p></speech>

It is probably more appropriate to think of wind farms and Article 19 in terms of the renewable electricity support scheme and the next support scheme for the next wind farms that will be built.  The key point is that this is under public consultation and has not yet been finalised, so the terms and conditions of that scheme, what they might allow the wind farm developers to do and so forth are still under consideration and discussion.  That point must be taken into consideration.</p></speech>

These are all things that can be considered.  If a foreign direct investment company wishes to come here and be associated with a green energy generator, it cannot get any carbon credits for that under Article 19.  The suggestion is that some other agreement could be entered into whereby the State is not fully paying the support payment and perhaps this other company could co-pay or there could be some type of contribution by the FDI company.  I understand the rigidity of Article 19 at present but obviously suggestions have to come forward as to how to make it more flexible and responsive whereby one has the generation of renewables but one is also getting buy-in from FDI and there is more economic growth on the back of that.</p></speech>

It might be the terms and conditions of the existing REFIT schemes.  That is why I made the point that in the new renewable electricity support scheme there is potential for that to be different.  There is nothing to support a company building a wind farm, having the guarantees of origin from that wind farm and effectively counting them off its data centre if it funds the wind farm.  That is available at present.  Should it be allowed in conjunction with the new electricity support scheme?  That is key feedback from the public consultation that needs to be included in the development of that scheme.</p></speech>

However, is it not the case that we already have installations in this country that are allowed to trade up to a certain emission level and can buy credits?  There are such installations and the Deputy is asking whether the farmer could potentially sell those credits to these installations.  Obviously, only certain companies fall under this definition and they are already able to trade emissions in some way.  That was really Deputy Fitzmaurice's question.</p></speech>

It is not allowable under the emissions trading scheme to use forestry credits to make compliance.  One can only trade allowances under the emissions trading scheme itself, or if one does not meet one's particular emission level one can trade off the balance.  They are not allowable under the current effort sharing regulation and there is no provision in the new proposal currently under negotiation for forestry credits to be allowed under the emissions trading scheme.</p></speech>

Various studies have shown that people in Ireland are set to be among the most obese in Europe.  It is estimated that the cost of adult obesity to Irish society exceeds &euro;1 million per annum.  There is no doubt that overweight children are more likely to become obese adults.  However, schools can play a vital role in improving youth health, promoting healthy lifestyles and tackling obesity before the problem becomes established in later life.  Schools are in a unique position to have a major and positive impact on the levels of obesity through education on healthy lifestyles, healthy eating and nutrition and the provision of physical education.  This is an issue in which many Departments are involved, but the Department of Education and Skills has a big role to play, as does the Department of Health.  It is good to see the focus being placed across a number of Departments in tackling childhood obesity and trying to make sure we all adopt better habits.</p> <p>  I acknowledge a number of people to whom I spoke over the weekend in getting ready for this meeting and carrying out some research.  They include Ms Kathleen Gardiner, Ms Gillian O'Loughlin and Ms Louise Reynolds of the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute.  Because we will hear from a number of experts in the field we decided to break the session into two groupings on a thematic basis.  On behalf of the joint committee, I welcome the following delegates in group one: Ms Claire Heneghan, B.Ed, MSc. in exercise and nutrition science; Mr. Kevin Creery, Mr. Liam McCorry and Mr. Damien Mitchell from Healthy Kidz; Mr. Eddie Ward, principal officer, teacher education section; Ms Rita Sexton and Ms Clare Griffin, primary inspector, from the Department of Education and Skills; Mr. Mike Neary from Bord Bia; and Dr. Celine Murrin and Dr. Silvia Bel-Serrat from UCD.</p><p>We also have Mr. Mike Neary from Bord Bia and Dr. Celine Murrin and Dr. Silvia Bel-Serrat from UCD.  I thank all the witnesses for their submissions.  They are very welcome.  I ask them to limit their oral submission to five minutes.  If they wish, witnesses from the same delegation can share time.<br/><br/>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Any opening statements provided to the committee will be published on the committee website after the meeting.  I advise members of the same.  I invite Ms Heneghan to make her opening statement.  She has five minutes.</p></speech>

I have been a primary teacher for ten years and work in Scoil R&oacute;is, Galway.  I got the opportunity to specialise in the study of childhood obesity when undertaking a master's degree in science and exercise in 2013.  My mission is to strive to help combat the childhood obesity crisis in primary schools.  I have first-hand experience of the existence of this epidemic in classrooms and I am clear on the root causes.</p> <p>  I see evidence of obesity every day in the classroom.  One in five primary schoolchildren are now obese.  In a junior infant classroom where children are four or five years old uniform size can vary from size 4 to 5 all the way up to a much greater size.  The larger size is now becoming the more uniform size.  Obesity is a real problem.</p> <p>  I extensively researched best practice in countries such as Australia, New Zealand and Finland that have led the way in school-based programmes and initiatives that can make a difference to children's health and well-being.  While many of the studies focus on healthy eating alone, which is very important, I was interested in how physical activity could be promoted throughout the school day.  I believe there is one key area of the primary school day that is not being utilised fully to help combat this epidemic, namely break times.  The recommendations state that for good health and well-being children need at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity per day.  From the recent Growing Up in Ireland study it emerged that only a quarter of children met those recommendations.  Those patterns have been shown to carry into adulthood.  Children spend 183 days per annum in primary school, so it is a key area to target.</p> <p>  In a sedentary education system children generally have two outlets for physical activity in school, namely, PE and break time.  PE alone has been shown not to meet physical activity recommendations needed for health benefits.  That is especially true in this country where primary schoolchildren are allotted only 60 minutes of PE each week, which is just half of the EU average.  The NCCA reported that primary teachers identified there being insufficient time to adequately cover all 11 curricular subjects due to an overloaded curriculum.  A total of 52% of teaching time in primary schools is awarded to the core subjects, namely, English, Irish and maths, leaving 48% for the remaining eight subjects, including PE.  As a result, the EU Education Information Network in 2013 found that Irish primary schools offered fewer hours of PE than any other EU member state.</p> <p>  Comprising three hours and 20 minutes weekly, break times are a key period to target the promotion of physical activity in children at school.  After research and a stint working in New Zealand and Australia where break times have played a significant role in combatting childhood obesity levels I focused my research on the effect of fixed playground equipment such as climbing frames, monkey bars, swings, slides and balancing beams on the fitness levels of Irish primary schoolchildren and how that could help combat childhood obesity.  No previous study of that nature has been done in Ireland to date.</p> <p>  Generally, Irish school playgrounds can be described as flat and uninspiring pieces of tarmacadam with equipment being scarce and basic.  I was working in St. Conleth's infant school in Newbridge County Kildare at the time when a playground was installed in the school grounds.  It was installed in 2009 at a cost of &euro;80,000 that was raised by the school community.  Primary schools with a fully equipped playground are very much in the minority in this country.  Images are shown in the handout of the scarce scattering of equipped school playgrounds around the country.  In countries such as New Zealand, Australia and Finland fixed playground equipment is the norm on school grounds.  As outlined in my submission, my completed study found that the presence of fixed playground equipment in schools had a significant, positive effect on the fitness levels of children over the school year in the areas of endurance, balance, speed and agility.  The children from schools with fixed playground equipment were fitter than those from the control school who did not have access to equipment during their break time over the academic year.  It was the first study of its kind in Ireland and was subsequently published in 2015 by the Irish National Teachers Organisation.</p> <p>  My recommendation is clear.  We need to utilise break times in a significant way to help raise children's activity levels.  In New Zealand, the United States, Australia and even in Scotland activity co-ordinators have been employed in clusters of schools to promote physical activity in students.  They are qualified PE and health promotion practitioners.  Their job is to make the school environment more activity promoting, especially during break times.</p> <p>  Schools can often be obesogenic in their environment, that is sedentary promoting.  Children spend a lot of time sitting, especially on wet days, which is unnatural and detrimental to health.  In a local school where I live in Galway a fast-food chain is advertised on school grounds.  What kind of message is that sending to children?  I propose that it should be mandatory for all schools to have a health and well-being policy in place and implemented with schools highlighting the importance of activity through active homework, the promotion of walking to school, activity-promoting staff and active break times.  Break time is a key period at nearly three and a half hours per week that can be easily targeted.  A lot of current health promotion initiatives such as Playworks can be short lived and fleeting in schools, here today and gone tomorrow.  The installation of a fixed playground in schools is a commodity that will be used daily.  It is an asset to the community.  It brings people together.  It promotes activity, fitness and well-being by its existence.  It promotes outdoor play, freedom and fun.  An aesthetically pleasing playground entices children to move, climb, balance and be active, to be children.  A recent Irish study revealed that almost half of children-----</p></speech>

The term "cottonwool kids" was used to describe this new phenomenon of children today who spend the vast majority of time indoors.  It is time to get back to basics.  With more resources used to target our uninspiring playgrounds physical activity will be promoted automatically in schools.  Utilising break times can make a significant difference to children's health.  Little to no training is needed for teachers to implement activity-promoting playgrounds.  It is a concrete legacy that will exist for many years to come in school communities.  Doing nothing is not an option.  This committee can have an enormous impact.  We need action now.  I would relish the opportunity to be part of putting the recommendations on the ground.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-24a.126" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Creery" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017102400002#E00500"><p>My name is Kevin Creery and like Ms Heneghan I am a primary schoolteacher and PE co-ordinator in County Armagh.  During my 20 years of teaching, like Ms Heneghan, I have seen the effects of the increasing problem we now face in society, namely, inactivity, on children in classrooms.</p><p>Pupils in my classroom and school are presenting as lethargic, tired and disinterested not only in sport but in many areas of school life and, as mentioned by Ms Heneghan in her presentation, in their changing body shapes.  This inactivity is growing rapidly because of increased sedentary lifestyles, increased technological advancement and the lifestyle choices now prevalent in society.  While inactivity is the problem, obesity is the consequence.  According to statistics, child and teen obesity in Ireland has increased tenfold since 1975, such that within a decade Ireland will be the most obesely populated country in Europe.  </p><p> In a typical classroom in Ireland, only one third of children participate in GAA, soccer and rugby, which leaves two thirds of school children with no pathway to activity.  Combined with poor physical education delivery by teachers bereft of experience, training and resources school children are sitting longer and are less physically active.  I will now hand over to my colleague, Mr. Liam McCorry.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-24a.128" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam McCorry" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017102400002#F00200"><p>My name is Liam McCorry.  I am a full-time Gaelic football promotion officer for the Armagh County Board.  Like Ms Heneghan and Mr. Creery I have noticed an increase in obesity levels over the last five to ten years.  This problem exists not only in Ireland but throughout Europe and the world.  What is the solution?  I believe that we have the right programme to deal with the inactivity of our children.  We have been running the Healthy Kidz programme for five years and the results have been outstanding.  This programme is ready to be rolled out in every school in Ireland, the UK and through Europe.  All of the experts believe this is a comprehensive and effective programme.</p> <p>  The programme comprises four strands.  The first strand involves putting coaches into schools to build up the agility, balance, co-ordination and strength of children.  The children are tested in week one and week 24.  The programme is an in-school programme over 24 of the 30 weeks of a school year.  As I said, the results thus far have been outstanding.  The programme is now being run in 60 schools.  We did have the support of Stormont but, unfortunately, it has collapsed.  Had that not happened the programme would now be operational in 100 schools.  We are ready to bring the programme to the South.  We believe this is the most effective programme available to combat inactivity and obesity in our children.</p> <p>  Strand 2 involves the golden mile athletic challenge, which requires children to run at least one mile three times per week.  Every child and class is rewarded and incentivised to do this.  This is not about children running around in circles, there are different targets and incentives set for each term.  Children have signed up to this programme.  We now have children who are running 40 km per month comfortably.  Other children are running 20 to 25 km per month.  The results are unbelievable.  Children are dropping sizes in their clothes, their eating habits are changing and thus concentration levels in class have improved and education results for schools are also changing.</p> <p>  Strand 3 is the after-schools programme around habit building, which is endorsed by all of the schools.  We target children who usually do not participate in sports such as GAA, soccer and rugby.  This programme is over-subscribed.  Lest anybody here might think I am speaking grandly of this programme I invite them to visit any of the schools in which it has been rolled out to see the difference it is making.</p> <p>  Strand 4 is the programme app.  To address inactivity we needed a programme for in-school and another for outside of school.  Parents now take responsibility for increasing their child's activity.  Once again, we reward and incentivise in respect of each strand of the programme.  Mr. Creery will elaborate on the app.</p></speech>

In terms of how it works, for example, when a child reaches level 5 on the app he or she receives a homework pass.  We are currently in consultation with local councils on the provision of free access to local amenities, such as local swimming pools, for a family when a child reaches level 6 on the app.  The programme has been evaluated by Queen's University in Belfast.  A student there is currently doing her PhD on Healthy Kidz.  As stated earlier by Mr. McCorry, the results to date have been really good.</p> <p>  The programme was piloted in Portlaoise, which my colleague, Damien Mitchell, will speak about now.</p></speech>

I am a fourth year student in Athlone Institute of Technology, AIT, studying sport science with exercise physiology.  As mentioned, the programme was piloted in Portlaoise and children were tested on speed, agility, flexibility and balance.  In terms of results, some of the children who were previously inactive had taken to walking their dogs and were now out and about rather than stuck indoors.  The children love the app.  It encourages them to do additional activity like walking after their soccer training and so on, for which they get additional points and homework passes.  During one particular week, the children got top grades.</p> <p>  I have done some research on Healthy Kidz and it might be connected with health profiles and physical activity.  For example, it might be possible to connect health profiles and physical activity with PPS numbers such that when a person runs seven miles or engages in a particular sport it is registered on the app and a GP would be able to review it and advise him or her whether he or she needs to do a bit more or less.  To ensure people are protected, the only person who would have access to the app would be his or her GP or consultant.</p></speech>

This is a societal issue.  The research referenced points to the urgency for policymakers and people in education and outside of education to take ownership of this issue.  I do not think responsibility for this issue lies in any one place because a child spends only one third of his or her day at school. Outside of this they are with their families and in their communities.<br/><br/>From a Department perspective, our work covers curriculum, which essentially governs what happens in schools.  Teacher education is essential in terms of mediating change in schools and ensuring that the curriculum is supported and implemented.  We also provide a range of supports and resources to schools around targeted issues such as obesity and physical education.  The Active Schools Flag is one of the key support programmes we have in place.  We also have a wellbeing team in place providing CPD.  A lot of what is put in place arises out of schools identifying particular needs.  <br/><br/>In terms of curriculum, PE is a core part of the primary school curriculum.  It is one of seven areas of the curriculum and a minimum of one hour per week of physical education is recommended for all primary school students.  In regard to post-primary schools, well being a huge part of the new junior cycle curriculum.  This includes physical activity.  There is a programme of support around that.  At senior cycle level a new curriculum is being developed and it will be rolled out in schools from next year. <br/><br/>In regard to teacher education, it is a key responsibility of the Department to ensure that our teachers are fully equipped in terms of their pedagogical requirements and to ensure that teachers are <i>au fait</i>with the requirements of the curriculum and are able to support their students to work through it.  This all begins in the initial teacher education space.  The programme around teacher education has been reconfigured in recent times.  Programmes have been extended, broadened and deepened and there is now a much greater emphasis on the practice piece.<br/><br/>Once a teacher enters the school system there is a period of induction, which is guided by peers.  There is now a framework, which is currently being implemented, around the regulation of career-long professional development for teachers.</p><p>It will begin to fill in our expectations of teachers in terms of their professional development and the commitment expected in that regard.  It is clear, given the research that was referred to, that, from a policy perspective, the emphasis on physical activity and student well-being at an holistic level will be a key part of it.</p><p> Active School Flag is a programme that has been supported by the Department for a number of years and over 600 schools have signed up to it.  It provides a framework for schools that choose to engage with it.  It is very much aligned with the Department's methodologies for school improvement.  The Department works with key national strategies such as Healthy Ireland to ensure there is a joined-up policy.  One of the challenges from a school's perspective is balancing society's expectations with those of different departmental strategies.  It is a challenge all those of us working in public services face.  We have to mediate and make sense of them from the perspective of school management and providing leadership.  We know the pressures they can be under on a day-to-day basis.  </p><p> That concludes my presentation.  My colleagues will probably be anxious to fill in any of the areas I have not covered adequately.</p></speech>

Bord Bia is the agency responsible for promoting the consumption of horticultural produce and the marketing of Irish food and horticultural products.  Within its horticulture remit, it manages and oversees implementation of the programme which is led by me in my role as director of horticulture in Bord Bia.  While the specific task of tackling obesity is not within the remit of Bord Bia, it is widely accepted that a healthy balanced diet with fruit and vegetables at its core is a key contributor to reducing and minimising obesity levels.</p> <p>  Food Dudes is an evidence-based, incentivised, behaviour changing programme which was developed by Professor Fergus Lowe in Bangor University in Wales and aims to encourage increased consumption of fruit and vegetables by primary schoolchildren by changing attitudes and cultivating a liking for fruit and vegetables.  The programme is managed by Bord Bia and receives financial support from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the European Union through the school fruit and vegetable scheme.  It is based on the three core principles of the three Rs: repeated tasting of raw fruit and vegetables to cultivate a liking for fruit and vegetables; role models, which take the form of cartoon characters or food dudes; and rewards - small prizes which incentivise schoolchildren to take part and eat fruit and vegetables.</p> <p>  In phase 1 of the programme portions of raw fruit and vegetables are provided for primary schoolchildren throughout an intervention period of 16 consecutive school days.  The graphic contained in my submission shows the range of produce provided for the children and how we sequence delivery over the 16-day period.  Supporting materials, including consumption diaries, a DVD on food dude superheroes, prizes which are depicted in the graphic contained in my submission, certificates and school-room wall charts, are provided to maintain fruit and vegetable consumption in the longer term.  </p> <p>  After the initial 16 days of produce delivery, phase 2 of the programme commences and the focus switches to the home, which is very important.  This phase can run for a number of weeks.  The children bring their own fruit and vegetable portions from home in Food Dudes lunch boxes which are distributed at the end of phase 1.  </p> <p>  The Food Dudes boost programme was introduced in 2015.  It maintains all of the key elements of the original programme but uses fewer rewards and has a stronger focus on the junior cycle, ensuring the programme can reach more children in a school year.  Its operation is detailed in my written submission to the committee. </p> <p>  The Food Dudes programme has been evaluated a number of times.  All of the evaluations show that the programme has effectively increased the consumption of fruit and vegetables among its target group and that a sustained pattern of eating more fruit and vegetables has been established among participating children.  The most recent evaluation was carried out in 2016 by an expert team from UCD which evaluated the long-term impact of the programme on schools that had participated in the 2010-11 school year.  The results showed that the number of senior pupils bringing and consuming fruit and vegetables had remained significantly higher than since before the Food Dudes programme intervention in 2010.  An interesting finding that emerged from the evaluation was that consumption rates were high at baseline and had remained high at follow-up after the running of the boost programme when increased portions were brought.  This suggests the majority of children ate what was provided in their lunch box, even when additional portions of fruit and vegetables were provided at follow-up.  This underpins and highlights the importance of parental influence on children&rsquo;s eating practices. </p> <p>  As part of the EU development of a single school scheme, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine submitted a six-year strategy to the European Union for the delivery of the Food Dudes programme through the European school scheme.  It was introduced from 1 August this year.  The strategy includes a period of pilot programme testing in the 2017-18 school year of some new elements and activities that might supplement the core elements of the Food Dudes boost programme in future years such as gardening activity, healthy eating days or weeks, project work related to healthy eating, online activities linked with healthy eating or sport linked activities, which have been mentioned.  It is envisaged that the additional aspects will be particularly relevant to senior classes.  The prime motivation and criterion for success will remain the increased consumption of fruit and vegetables.</p></speech>

My colleague, Dr. Sylvia Bel-Serrat, is a post-doctoral researcher in the national nutrition surveillance centre, NNSC, also in UCD.  On her behalf and that of my colleague, Dr. Mirjam Heinen, who made the original submission but who, unfortunately, cannot be here, I thank the Chairman and committee members for giving us the opportunity to present current research evidence on childhood obesity from the national nutrition surveillance centre.</p> <p>  Before I present the recent findings from the NNSC, I will give some background information on the centre and our role in addressing childhood obesity in Ireland.  The national nutrition surveillance centre has been in existence since 1991 and a track record of providing robust surveillance and scientific data for colleagues in the research community and policy makers.  Towards the end of the last century, the increasing prevalence of overweight and obese adults led to concerns about similar trends in the childhood population.  In 2005 the World Health Organization's regional office for Europe issued recommendations and guidelines for the regular collection of data on weight, height and waist and hip circumference in children worldwide.  In the same year the Department of Health published the report of the national task force on obesity and recommended the development of a national database of growth measurements for children and adults to allow for the monitoring of prevalence trends under the headings of underweight, normal weight, overweight and obesity.  </p> <p>  In 2008 the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive commissioned the NNSC to commence this surveillance work among primary schoolchildren in the Republic of Ireland.  This childhood obesity surveillance initiative was repeated in 2010 and 2012 and most recently in 2015.  The data enable us to look at trends over time in the childhood population.  I have circulated some slides to the committee which compare data from 2008 with data produced in more recent times.  The prevalence among first class children under the headings of overweight and obesity appears to be stabilising overall.  However, the prevalence continues to be significantly higher among girls than among boys across all rounds.  The second slide I have shown to the committee shows a reduction in recent times in the prevalence in non-disadvantaged schools.  Overweight and obesity rates in 2015 in disadvantaged schools were the lowest when compared with previous rounds.  Disadvantaged schools continue to have a high prevalence in comparison with children in non-disadvantaged schools.  The prevalence in disadvantaged schools appears to increase as children grow up.  </p> <p>  We agree with the targets set out in the obesity policy and action plan for the period 2016 to 2025.  Clear targets have been set.  We need to see a sustained downward trend in the prevalence of obesity and being overweight of approximately 0.5% per annum.  We also need to see a reduction of 10% in the gap between obesity levels in the highest and lowest socioeconomic groups.  </p> <p>  Tackling obesity requires a multi-level and cross-sectoral approach as outlined by the original task force on obesity and also suggested here.</p><p>Schools are just one of the many settings that need to implement strategies to address the determinants of overweight and obesity.<br/><br/>We have been involved in a large piece of European research that identifies schools as being appropriate settings to look at feasible change, but we also need to consider what is feasible to change in the school environment.  We know certain areas, such as the eating environment, are feasible to change and might have a larger population level impact.  Portion size should be considered, particularly with regard to children.  This large piece of data allows us to be able to look not only within Ireland, but also to compare ourselves to our European neighbours to see where we can make changes within the determinants of childhood obesity.<br/><br/>We know also from a piece of work conducted across Europe, within the WHO childhood obesity surveillance initiative, COSI, study, that compared to some of our European neighbours, Irish schools are doing reasonably well with certain types of indicators.  For example, if we look at the availability of milk, Irish schools are doing very well.  This is also the case with the provision of water.  In general, our schools do not physically provide sugar-sweetened beverages, sweet snacks and salted snacks.  This is because most European schools have a facility to cater for primary school children.  The provision of fruit and vegetables is one area that does require improvement in Irish schools.  The National Nutrition Surveillance Centre is planning a fifth round of the childhood obesity surveillance initiative.  We are also evaluating, in conjunction with the HSE, the school meals programme, and the new guidelines were launched recently.  We are also looking at healthy vending and at present we are particularly focused on HSE hospitals.<br/><br/>Other research projects in which we have been involved include evaluation of the Food Dudes programme.  We also have the large Lifeways cross-generational cohort study.  We are involved in the DEDIPAC European joint programming initiative, to which I referred earlier.  We also work with <i>safe</i>food in looking at certain areas regarding treat behaviours of children.  We have quite a range of work and information on which we can draw in trying to inform national strategies on children.</p></speech>

It was very interesting to listen to all the contributions.  We can see recurring themes in what the witnesses have said.  My first comments are for Ms Heneghan.  I am very familiar with St. Conleth's, which is a very good school.  Were there any issues regarding insurance?  This is something we would need to know.  We are dealing with a societal pressurised area regarding eating fast food and healthy food.  Ms Heneghan commented on advertising fast food in school grounds.  We should certainly ask the Department to ensure this absolutely does not happen.  It was very interesting to hear what Healthy Kidz had to say.  What are the fees for participation?  Are these raised by the school community or is there an extra fee on parents with children in the schools that participate?  It is great the parents are involved because this is key.  The witnesses said this is something they want to do with regard to the Food Dudes programme.  Are there any proposals on involving the parents?</p> <p>  My next point is for the Department of Education and Skills.  With regard to vending machines and having water in every school, surely at this stage having vending machines in schools that give crisps, chocolate and sweets is absolutely wrong and should not happen.  Every school should have access to free drinking water.  It is great that nine new health promotion officers have been appointed nationally and they can link in with schools on nutrition and dietetics, but it must be a concern that there is not great take up of the active school flag.  Are there any plans to try to ensure more schools participate?</p></speech>

This is my first time to attend this committee and it is a very interesting topic.  I do not have specific questions for Ms Heneghan or Healthy Kidz and I thank them for their presentations.  I have questions for the National Nutrition Surveillance Centre and the Department of Education and Skills.  This is a very important topic when we consider six in ten adults are obese, and one in four according to the Department of Health, so it is something we need to tackle.  It is a societal issue and it needs to be looked at from a multidisciplinary perspective.  It involves everybody.</p> <p>  Will the witnesses from the National Nutritional Surveillance Centre give the reasons obesity has stabilised in recent years?  Its submission specifically mentioned first class children and children over the age of eight.  I am interested to know why the witnesses think this has occurred.  It is a positive indicator, although small.  With regard to the broader problem of weight in Ireland and the statistic I mentioned on adults, is there an observed correlation, or have the witnesses done any research on, overweight parents and weight issues in their children?  There seems to be a reverse statistic, with regard to girls being overweight more than boys when they are younger and then it seems to be men more than women, at 69% to 52%.  I wonder why this is.  Would the witnesses be able to answer this?</p> <p>  My next question is for the Department of Education and Skills.  I welcome the goals of the obesity policy and the 2016 action plan.  Will they be achieved?  How do they align with best international practice on tackling obesity?</p></speech>

I must try to think to whom I will direct my questions, because many of them are general statements and I am probably going to vent more than anything so I apologise.  Something in which I have had a personal interest for a long time is physical fitness and well-being in schools, particularly in disadvantaged schools.  Dr. Murrin pointed out the difference in the prevalence of obesity between disadvantaged schools and advantaged schools.  I would love to know why this is and I had a conversation with my daughter and many of her friends over the past week on this topic.  They all go to different schools and I asked them what they did during physical education.  One of them said the PE teacher really liked football so he played a lot of football with the boys and the girls were just told to take hula hoops and footballs from the equipment room and they did a bleep test every now and again.  This is what has been happening and it is really unfair.  I know all schools are not like this but the problem is that it is so hit and miss.  How do we set a standard and ensure people adhere to it?</p> <p>  We need to be creative and innovative.  Many young people care about their physical health.  I know where I train there are teen TRX classes, which are full to the brim of young people who also learn about nutrition.  Obviously this not enough children, but they are involved.  Is there room, and perhaps this question is for the Department, to be a bit more specialised in physical education?  If someone likes basketball or football, that is great, but if children do not like them, it is tough luck.  Is there room for accreditation for young people working towards points or having a certificate in nutrition, PT training or gym courses, so they have something to work for and it is an incentive for them to enjoy it?  It would not just be with the PE teacher, but specialised coaches would be brought in who really are engaged and know what they are talking about.  Is there room for PE teachers to become trainers?  I do not know about accreditation.</p> <p>  Some of the feedback I got from some of the girls to whom I spoke was a little worrying, in the sense some of them spoke about being embarrassed, because they were slightly overweight in secondary school, with the idea of getting changed in dressing rooms and the pressure it brought on, and not feeling as fit as some of the other children.  One young girl spoke about the fact she almost stopped eating and she was counting her macros and calories and had her fitness pal and was watching every morsel.</p><p>We must be mindful of the potential for children to develop eating disorders as a consequence of feeling embarrassed about their weight and under pressure to lose pounds.  We need a balance between promoting healthy living and watching out for those who may, through being obese, become isolated and experience the impact on their mental health.  Both issues must be addressed in tandem.</p><p> I hope Dr. Murrin can answer my question about the differences between advantaged and disadvantaged schools.  The departmental officials might respond to my query about accreditation and the more specialised stuff.  I am interested in hearing from any of the delegates on the mental health aspects.</p></speech>

My chief concern is that policy in this area should be inclusive.  There is very good practice in various places, some of which has been described.  The challenge is in extending it to all children in all schools.  Mr. Ward spoke about the Active School Flag programme which is very helpful in increasing participation in a school by ensuring there is a range of activities to suit all pupils, not just for those who are good at sports and very fit.  Should there be a directive from the Department of Education and Skills in that regard?  It is a fantastic programme, but it is optional.  There should be a way of encouraging as many schools as possible to participate.  Will Mr. Ward and the other delegates also comment on how we can ensure such initiatives are inclusive of children with disabilities?</p> <p>  Senator Lynn Ruane spoke about children who might be embarrassed about being overweight and have issues with joining in physical activities.  How do we ensure such children can participate without feeling uncomfortable and inferior to their classmates?  No child should feel fitness and healthy living are things in which they cannot participate.  I am interested in comments in that regard from any of the delegates.</p> <p>  My next question is primarily for the two researchers from UCD and relates to the differences in outcomes between children from disadvantaged schools and those from non-disadvantaged schools and also between girls and boys.  In terms of patterns that have been identified, to what extent would the delegates say we need to encourage earlier intervention?  In other words, to what extent are patterns already established when children begin their education?  I am referring more to eating habits than physical activity and the degree to which it is reasonable to expect schools to be able to counteract what is going on at home.  The committee is concerned with education matters, but I am strongly of the view that education in this area must begin at home when children are very young and that schools can only do so much.  Should we be encouraging and promoting parental involvement in these issues rather than expecting all of the educating to be done during school hours?</p> <p>  My final question is to the officials from the Department.  The Wellbeing programme at junior cycle is a very positive initiative.  Is there a way to ensure some of the lessons of that programme are referred back into the primary system?  We should be copying that programme's focus on positive as opposed to negative messages into the broader primary school curriculum in order that more children will benefit and at a younger age.</p></speech>

As colleagues noted, when it comes to healthy living habits, problems often begin before children arrive in school.  As well as educating children, we also must educate their parents.  That is a particular challenge we face in this area.  Children are only at school for X number of hours a day and it may be too late to correct things if problems are already apparent at the age of four or five years.  We have serious work to do in educating parents.  After all, it is they who are mostly responsible for feeding their children.  When I was in school, PE was considered more or less to be a free class in which one could mess around.  For the benefit of society as a whole, we must move towards a situation where physical education and nutrition are core subjects in primary and secondary schools.  Part of the difficulty for overweight children, apart from the impact on physical health, is the psychological damage that may be caused.  As other speakers noted, that damage can carry through into adulthood.  An increase in obesity levels brings problems for society as a whole.  Until PE and nutrition are core subjects, we are only tackling the fringes of the problem.  Will Mr. Ward, in particular, comment on this?</p> <p>  I am very impressed by the successes the two delegates from Armagh have achieved with their initiative.  As a person who lives in Monaghan, I am not surprised to discover that they are leading lights in the world of physicality, given what the Armagh football team has done in the past 20 years.  I might talk to them after the meeting to learn more about what they are doing.  There is serious potential in the initiative.</p> <p>  Will Ms Heneghan comment specifically on the issue of costs?  As we know, everything boils down to the euro and it is something we cannot avoid.  The Minister has noted that vending machines are often a source of funding for schools, some of which would not survive without the revenue the machines provide.  That is a sad reflection on where we are.  The existence of vending machines in schools is not really the problem but rather what items they contain.  Funding is a key issue in all of these matters.</p> <p>  If they will excuse the pun, the delegates have given us serious food for thought.  It is now a question of how we can take advantage of all the information in a joined-up way in order to devise a policy for the future.</p></speech>

Is there adequate time for incorporating healthy living initiatives and activities within the 183 days that make up the primary school year?  Mr. Ward spoke about the national school curriculum and the amount of time children spend in school.  I was a member of the board of management of my local school for many years.  We are fortunate to have an all-weather pitch adjacent to the school which is part of the GAA club and available for use by the students.  It is great to see the level of activity there, involving both boys and girls.  There is a great deal happening throughout the country in children's sport, including Gaelic football, soccer, rugby and karate.</p> <p>  I was very impressed by what Mr. Creery and Mr. McCorry had to say.  I very much welcome their suggestion of bringing their programme of events for schools south of the Border.  Both male and female children can get involved in tag rugby, Gaelic football and other sports and participation is usually open to all age groups.  It is vital that we begin incorporating these activities into the school curriculum.  I am involved with the local soccer club, Strand Celtic FC.  Some years back, the club introduced a rule under which children participating in club activities could only bring water with them.  Under no circumstance were sugary drinks, crisps or sweets to be permitted.</p><p>If children brought them, they were confiscated and they were either sent home or the parents brought in.  The club has in the region of about 500 children from all age groups.  They are participating in activities at all levels and the club has been very successful.  The parents know what the conditions are.  This is what should be done.  I am actively involved in GAA, soccer and rugby clubs in my constituency of Sligo-Leitrim.  I see what success this club has had.  At the beginning, children were going home complaining to their parents that they were not allowed the drinks.  I am sure Mr. Mitchell will see the same thing in his activities in Athlone.  This is the way forward.  It is the biggest scourge for young people at present.  There will be health issues at a later stage.  I am sure Dr. Murrin has outlined them.  Young people have enough pressures on them without the issues we are talking about today.</p><p> Ms Heneghan mentioned playgrounds.  I know of playgrounds, not only in schools but also provided by local authorities, that have been withdrawn because of the insurance issues.  There have been a number of claims over the years and many issues.  It is another problem in many schools.  She is right when she says all we have is a small piece.  Some schools are lucky enough to have a big area.  Others I have visited in my constituency have very small areas.  Some of it is in grass, which cannot be used much of the time, and the other area is a small bit of tarmacadam.  There is no room for activities, which have to take place within the school building.  If the school is lucky enough to have a sports hall or whatever, that is good.  However, that does not happen in many cases in rural schools, either.  I would like the witnesses' advice on that.</p><p> I was very impressed with the presentations by Mr. Creery, Mr. McCorry and Mr. Mitchell.  Mr. Ward mentioned the curriculum and perhaps he might expand on that.  Healthy food is certainly the way forward.  We are talking about vegetables and various other things. Chips and all these fast foods are being put in front of some children and we have got to get away from that.  The parents have a huge responsibility for educating children at a very young age that the way forward is healthy eating.  Mr. Neary from Bord Bia is quite right in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-24a.148" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1242" speakername="Catherine Martin" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017102400002#K00200"><p>I thank the witnesses.  As a mum of three young kids and as a former teacher who taught at second level for 20 years - four in a private school and 16 in a disadvantaged school - I have seen the differences in facilities offered to children.  On the Food Dudes programme, described by Mr. Neary, I saw the change that occurred when I, as a parent, did not choose what went into my children's lunch box.  They made the decision and wanted the fruit and the vegetables.  I thought it was fantastic and it has been sustained.  I love the idea of the golden mile.</p> <p>  On the fixed playground in primary schools, which Ms Heneghan raised, the only issue is insurance.  Other members have raised that.</p> <p>  My questions are really directed to Mr. Ward.  As my colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan said, great things are happening but it is sporadic.  What can we do to make sure it is happening in all our schools for all our children?  Even in my own constituency I see one of those issues.  A second level school is waiting 37 years for a PE hall.  I have asked for an audit of the second level schools but have been told it is not happening.  A response from the Department told me that where schools do not have PE halls, they have access to local facilities.  They do not.  Much of the time they are disadvantaged schools that do not have the money to pay for transport to a local facility.  Frankly, I do not think they should have to use up part of their PE time getting on a bus to go to a local facility.  If Mr. Ward will pardon the pun, waiting 37 years is not a level playing field.  It is not fair on second level pupils.  It rains a lot and they do not even have an all-weather pitch.  I do not see how that is right at any level when we have an obesity crisis in Ireland.  They are being asked to change in a classroom when it rains.  It is mixed school.  That classroom is their PE hall, with the outline of a goalpost painted on the wall.  It is a huge issue which the Department needs to address.  I do not understand the refusal to audit second level schools.</p> <p>  Mr. Ward mentioned that teachers should be equipped in terms of the requirements of the curriculum and these wonderful initiatives in the junior and leaving certificate cycles.  If they do not have the facilities, it is very hard to deliver the programmes properly, fairly and equally to all children.</p> <p>  Ms Heneghan talked about the small areas covered with tarmacadam that are seen as the play areas.  There is a problem coming down the road and we are not future-proofing our schools.  This came up in my constituency and in the neighbouring one.  Some 93 of 105 schools in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown are zoned residential.  We have seen two schools lose their green spaces.  There is no forward planning or future thinking when it comes to population growth.  We will need more space for schools and green space, yet we even had the chief executive of Dublin City Council announcing last week that we should build on the green spaces in Dublin city.  There is a lack of thinking ahead to protect the future.  There is a crisis currently but we must also think ahead to make sure it does not continue.  We must protect the green spaces in our schools and cities to keep our children healthy and happy.</p></speech>

As I am the last member to speak, many of my questions have been asked already and I will not go back over them.  I agree with Senator Gallagher about the parents.  It is about educating them.  For too long, parents were not very conscious of what they put in the school lunch boxes.  There is much more emphasis now.  We have to find some way of getting the message to them.  As has been mentioned, many children are very conscious of what they are eating but I still think the parents need to be made aware of this.  Do the schools send out a guideline as to what is advisable to eat or whatever?  Many schools are much more conscious of this now and of having healthy foods.  Obviously, the DEIS schools are being provided with healthy school boxes and breakfast in the morning.</p> <p>  Many schools nowadays do not have vending machines with fizzy drinks or sweets.   When I was going to school, we could get whatever we wanted in the tuck shop.  Many schools have come on board in terms of what they are offering.  We should have more incentives to try to bring the parents on board.  I am aware that a number of the Department's initiatives have involved bringing the parents in.  We need to bring them in and encourage them.  The active schools flag has been referred to.  A well-being programme is being introduced now in many schools.  What children eat could be included in that programme.</p></speech>

On the issue of parenting, it is absolutely agreed that much work needs to be done with the parents as well.  Schools that are fortunate enough to have home school liaisons and the strengthening families programme have a really strong link with parents.  They are better equipped to be able to roll out those healthy eating programmes with the parents.  I have certainly seen some really good results in that regard.  I will invite the witnesses to respond.</p><p>If they want to come back with further clarification or information on any of the questions asked, they should go through the clerk to the committee, Mr. Alan Guidon, and all members will be circulated with those follow-up responses.</p></speech>

I must give a shout out for parent associations in some schools which get involved in the Food Dudes programme and give out the produce.  It means it is more effective than the school itself.  As part of our new strategy over the next six years, we have pilot programmes for the school year 2017-2018, which will include engaging with stakeholders, like parents, to get closer links with them.  Once it goes outside the school, parenting is critical to its success.</p> <p>  From 1 August this year, 100% of the funding for the produce in the scheme will come from the European Union through the EU school fruit, vegetables and milk scheme.  That allows us a bigger opportunity to spread this scheme wider and involve more schools and children.  It will allow us to promote physical activity, as well as targeting the programme at senior as well as junior classes.  Thankfully, the funding issue is not the challenge but actually getting it out to as many schools as possible.</p></speech>

It sounds like the problems we are facing are exactly the same.</p> <p>  There were several allusions to inclusivity and how we deal with kids who would not ordinarily take part.  As a physical education co-ordinator, I was bringing rugby, soccer and Gaelic football programmes into my school which has 641 kids.  As soon as the ball came out, half the children were disinterested.  I could see the girls and boys who did not want to play rugby and soccer and did not want to be there.  We decided to write an all-inclusive programme in which every single child felt important and took part.  We now have data on 6,000 children.  Every child is tested on week one and then given their scores.  If Claire Heneghan and I were in a 30 m sprint, it does not matter what time either of us achieves.  Instead, I am competing with myself the next time and the coach encourages me to do that.  These are station-based programmes like circuit classes in which all the children take part.  No child sits out.  We have parents, principals and teachers involved.</p> <p>  The greatest testament we can give to this is the fact that Stormont gave us &pound;40,000 and Sport Northern Ireland gave us &pound;20,000 to keep the programme going in three schools.  After Stormont collapsed, every school in the programme paid for it out of their own money.  We now have 64 schools willing to pay for it.</p></speech>

Accordingly, over ten months, that comes to &euro;40 per child.  Schools are currently paying for it.  However, we have been dealing with MLAs.  We brought the education and health Departments, as well as the council, together to discuss this matter.  Our ask today is that we want to join everything together and bring all the committees and public health bodies together to come up with a strategy where we can make this work and simply offset the cost to the school.  Even though the schools are paying for it now, we are not so sure whether it will be sustainable in the future.  When we get a government up and working in Stormont, then we will.  With the Oireachtas, we would like to get financial support and contribution going forward.</p></speech>

To point to a particular reason as to why would be challenging, considering there are so many determinants driving the obesity problem.  Essentially, there is a greater awareness of obesity.  This would not necessarily have been part of our conversation ten or 15 years ago, particular concerning children.  There is certainly a greater awareness of obesity among parents and the wider community.</p> <p>  We know in certain disadvantaged groups that there are different behavioural patterns.  It is not something we can directly associate with our data.  We would like to be able to analyse it in more detail.  Whether it is regarding dietary patterns and physical activity patterns, we know there are differences in disadvantaged communities compared to advantaged ones.</p> <p>  On Deputy Madigan's question on the correlation between overweight parents and overweight children, this is a phenomenon which is well known to be true.  If one parent is overweight or obese, the child is likely to be too.  If there are two parents, the child is much more likely to be overweight or obese.  Is this genetic or environmental?  In certain instances, it is both.  One may have a genetic predisposition to being overweight or obese.  However, unless one is engaging in an unhealthy lifestyle, one may not necessarily become overweight or obese.</p> <p>  We also need to consider obesity in a life course perspective.  We are researching that approach in that one cannot pinpoint one particular critical time within somebody's life regarding their risk of obesity.  There is much research at the moment looking at early life course which involves intrauterine phenomenon.  From our research we have conducted as part of the lifeway study, we have found a mother's body mass index, BMI, before she becomes pregnant is one of the strongest determinants for a child being overweight and obese.</p> <p>  Accordingly, we should not only be looking at primary schoolchildren but also secondary schoolchildren because they are the future parents.  They are the ones we need to ensure have developed sufficient life skills, are aware of how much physical activity they need and are aware what good and healthy food is.  We must ensure that they can they cook and have the capacity to be able to provide healthy lifestyles, not only for themselves, but for their future families.</p> <p>  On how we tackle these, I would speak to several of the questions which spoke to disadvantage and addressing children with disability.  This requires a whole health promoting school approach.  Speaking with different physical activity or nutrition hats may not necessarily be helpful.  The whole child needs to be tackled, whether it is through diet, physical activity or mental well-being.  The World Health Organization's health promoting schools require parents, not just teachers, to be involved in developing programmes within schools, as well the wider community.  We know from much intervention research that schools on their own have some success in developing interventions.  However, schools and the home environment together have greater success while schools, the home and the wider community have the best outcomes overall.  Looking at the school as part of the community appears to be the best approach in intervening with schoolchildren.</p></speech>

That is why we created this comprehensive programme.  Up to 25% of kids going into primary school are classified as obese while 35% of children leaving primary school are classified not only as obese but having no basic movement skills.  Obviously, something is not working inside and outside of school.  That is why we created this comprehensive programme.  This is not a PE gimmick programme but involves every child.  From our research of a class of 30 children, the first ten kids are the normal sporting ones who play Gaelic football, rugby or soccer, or their families are associated and they follow their family members.</p><p>As a result of the Healthy Kidz programme, these children and their attitudes have been shown to be far fitter.  That is the response of coaches, parents and schoolteachers.  The second ten children are those who have great potential but, perhaps because their parents are not associated with sport, they are in a sort of limbo.  The Healthy Kidz programme is now encouraging those children to begin physical activity.  The last ten are the children who come from very difficult backgrounds or children with disabilities.  Every one of those children is engaging with the Healthy Kidz programme.  That is the difference we are making.  As coaches, we are seeing that difference.  As Mr. Creery said, in no class has there been one child sitting out the physical activity.  Some 85% of children in Ireland are not getting 60 minutes of daily activity.  The Healthy Kidz programme addresses that problem.  We also include the parents in this.  The app, the fourth part of the programme, encourages parents to get involved with their children outside school.  All activity is recorded on the app.  Every child involved in the programme last year got a full physical report for what he or she did inside school and outside.  </p><p> Where do we want to go with this?  We want the main agencies in health, education and communities to come together to make this stronger and better.  We would like a full physical activity report and physical literacy report for every child at the end of the school year.  The only way that can be achieved is by everybody coming together.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-24a.163" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Claire Heneghan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017102400002#M00500"><p>Of course.  I know that Deputies Catherine Martin and Tony McLoughlin raised the issue.  It is a very relevant question.  It should not be the case that insurance stops us tackling our playgrounds.  In St. Conleth's national school, where I worked, all parents signed a disclaimer at the start of the year and the school's insurance covered the programme because it was on during school time, in school playgrounds and under supervision.  The tarmac is always soft tarmac.  There was never really an issue.  I know insurance is always the main thing which stops these kinds of things happening but when it is under supervision and during school hours, the school's insurance will cover it.</p> <p>  Senator Robbie Gallagher alluded to the cost involved.  A good playground would range from &euro;45,000 to &euro;90,000.  It is a once-off payment and it is amenity to use for years to come.  Even a small grant towards it would make a big difference to schools.  Parents are really on board with these things and want them for their children so they and the schools would also raise funds for them.  A grant towards it would make such a difference.  As I said, it is a once-off payment and it can reap great rewards.</p></speech>

While I accept that gets around the problem of insurance, I feel that it is a shame that sometimes when we, as a Government and as a society, invest in infrastructural equipment which will only be used during certain hours of the day, 183 days a year, we do not grant access to others who could use it on the other days of the year.  We need to start moving towards more community sharing of all the types of facilities we have, be it in schools or in the community.  I accept Ms Heneghan's point, however.</p> <p>  I will direct a number of questions towards Mr. Ward.  He and his colleagues will be the final speakers in this session.  It would be great if he could answer some questions.</p></speech>

All new-build schools have fresh drinking water as standard.  If other schools have any concerns around the quality of their water, they can have it tested.  The policy is that all schools will have, and should have, fresh drinking water for students.</p> <p>  In respect of the vending machine issue, I will share some findings with the committee from the Department's life skills survey 2015.  In terms of vending machines in primary schools, there is really no issue because 99% of the schools surveyed said they had no vending machines on their premises.  In terms of post-primary schools, Senator Gallagher mentioned that vending machines are a source of revenue for post-primary schools.  The findings do show some improvements, however.  Some 27% of post-primary schools surveyed said they had vending machines in place.  In 2009, some 35% had vending machines in place.  A high number of those schools also sell fresh fruit in the school.  The Department has issued guidance to schools through circulars on healthy lifestyles for both primary and post-primary schools.  We ask that, where possible, schools minimise the sale of fizzy drinks and unhealthy snacks.</p></speech>

This provides for classroom-based assessment which is reported by the school to parents, guardians and students at the end of the junior cycle period.  At senior cycle, a leaving certificate physical education curriculum has been prepared.  It has gone through a consultation phase, which was positive.  Once implemented, it will provide for examination, which will include physical performance in three selected physical activities.  This examination will account for 50% of the student's result.  A written examination will account for the other 50%.  It is a detailed specification at that level and includes, for example, learning and improving skills and technique; promoting physical activity; gender and physical activity; and physical activity and inclusion - a point which was raised a number of times here today.  That is just a sample of what is within the specification.  That goes towards the Senator's question on certification and accreditation.</p> <p>  It is also important to point out that, apart from the exam component, there is another option available to students who do not wish to pursue physical education as an area of study for examination.  That is the senior cycle physical education framework, which is also available to schools.  This ensures that all students at post-primary level have access to physical education, whether examined or not.  This is, of course, complementary to what happens at primary schools, where all students from infants to sixth class have an hour of physical education a week.  That information goes towards the Senator's questions on accreditation.</p></speech>

The critical part in all of this is the autonomy of the school in respect of its decision making.  Largely, a school decides its own curriculum.  It decides on how to make its policies and how inclusive an approach it adopts.  Clearly, from the Department's perspective, we see that all policy making should involve parents, and increasingly the students, as policy has a great impact on the holistic development of a child, particularly at post-primary level.  That would be our guidance.  We cannot coerce schools into doing something.  We can prescribe the curriculum in certain areas.  They are usually general directions but may be specific in the case of some subjects.  We are generally in the role of funder, but also of persuader.  We do that.  We try to influence schools through raising awareness; high quality continuing professional development; working with national curriculum making bodies; working with national strategies such as Healthy Ireland; and working with the national representative bodies and partners in education generally.  There is a very keen commitment here.</p><p>Teachers and schools want to do a good job so that their students grow to be mature, responsible, healthy adults.  We all acknowledge that there is an issue and we all need to ensure it is owned by society outside schools.</p></speech>

However, Department budgets were severely curtailed in recent years, at a time when the student population was exploding and when there was a demand for new schools on the eastern seaboard and in the greater Dublin area in particular.  The Department prioritised those and the various Ministers prioritised the front-line services, including the PTR, and now we are beginning to address that in a more positive way.  One would imagine that as these problems begin to become more manageable and subside, the kinds of issues and the audit the Deputy mentioned would be looked at and addressed in the most appropriate way.  At the end of the day, the Minister and the Department are there to serve to the people and ensure the best infrastructure is in place.</p></speech>

It came through the Celtic tiger without getting a PE hall.  When the State was at its wealthiest and money was spent ridiculously on other things, this school was overlooked.  That is why I would like an audit.  Have other schools spent 37 years without a PE hall and, if so, why?</p></speech>

It might seem blindingly obvious that the best way our schools can contribute to the fight against our childhood obesity crisis is through more effective education.  However, we know the vast majority of our children and young people are already keenly aware of the importance of a healthy diet and are concerned about the amount of fat, sugar and salt in products they consume, yet over one in four children in Ireland is overweight or obese.</p> <p>  Our key message today is that what they are being taught in the classroom is being undermined by a school environment that often not only fails to enable healthy choices, but is a powerful promoter of unhealthy eating.</p> <p>  The Irish Heart Foundation has a long track record of supporting healthy eating as well as health-related physical activity in the school system.  Two years ago, we published research which found a proliferation of "snackeries" emerging in post-primary schools, with 70% of those surveyed offering items such as sausage rolls, mini pizzas, danish pastries and cookies.  Over a quarter had tuck shops, selling sweets and soft drinks, and 47% had vending machines, while 40% had no access to free drinking water.  In other words, there was no great difference between the availability of fizzy drinks and water in these schools.</p> <p>  This is what confronts schoolchildren every day.  They learn about the food pyramid and the need to limit their intake of treat foods and drinks, but for many once they leave the classroom, junk products are everywhere all day long.  The temptation pupils face is constant.  The contradiction in what they are taught and what is widely available to them is breathtaking.  It does not end there.  Junk food and drinks companies use many strategies to target children within schools, including advertising on vending machines; exclusive contracts to sell particular products; sponsorship of school programmes and events; branded educational materials; and company-sponsored fundraising.</p> <p>  Pupils are also besieged outside the school gates.  Some 70% of schools have a fast-food outlet within 1 km, and 30% have at least five.  Today, we are not addressing the bombardment of individually targeted junk-food advertising especially via young people&rsquo;s smartphones, dubbed the "brand in the hand" by marketers, but this is further manipulating their eating habits.</p><p> In the midst of these unprecedented challenges for young people, it is important to acknowledge two crucial policy initiatives undertaken in recent weeks that demonstrate a new determination by the State to tackle obesity, those being, the sugar sweetened drinks tax and nutrition standards governing the school meals programme, which can have a profound effect, particularly on the long-term health of pupils in disadvantaged areas.</p><p> What can policy makers do to protect schoolchildren's health better?  We need an urgent implementation of no-fry zones outside schools to stop further targeting of campuses by junk food firms, along with tough regulation, particularly of digital marketing to children.  Inside schools, we need a commitment to a whole-of-school approach to health and healthy eating in which, although education is as important as ever, all schools practise what their lessons preach by incorporating health and nutrition policies, physical activity, the physical environment, the social environment and school-community relationships.</p><p> Although school food accounts for a growing proportion of pupils' food and calorie intake, at a time when 26% of children are overweight or obese, it is not subject to any national standard.  Of the schools we surveyed, 95% said that it should.  The quicker such standards are introduced and workable models are integrated nationally, the more children can be saved from heading down a society-made path to lives blighted by chronic disease and premature death.</p><p> We have a school catering award that helps post-primary schools to adopt healthier cooking practices and food choices.  It is crystal clear from our experience that healthy school food cannot co-exist with junk food within the school perimeter.  For example, if a child is given a choice between an apple and a bar of chocolate, he or she will almost always choose the bar.  Take the chocolate away, though, and the apple will always be eaten.  Consequently, removing all junk food from sale, including through vending machines, is a prerequisite for making healthy food provision the norm in post-primary schools.  Financial support should be available from the proceeds of the sugar tax to provide facilities, equipment and whatever else is necessary to promote healthy eating and to ensure that drinking water is always freely available.</p><p> Although guidelines state that two hours of physical education per week should be provided in post-primary schools, just 4% achieve this in first year, 3% in second year, 1% in third year and none in fifth and sixth years.  This has to change for both physical and mental health reasons.</p></speech>

The quality of children's diets, including in school, has changed in the past 20 or 30 years.  Approximately 20% of children's daily calories are from sweets and confectionery.  Overweight and obesity are not just a question of inactivity.  The general ratio between diet and inactivity is 70:30.  Inactivity is very important, but diet is more of a driver.  It is a matter of achieving a balance.<br/><br/>We are discussing overweight as much as obesity.  We are not referring to the margins.  On average, children are heavier now than they were 20 or 30 years ago.  In my early career, early onset diabetes and infertility relating to overweight and obesity were unheard of, but we are now seeing these.<br/><br/><i>safe</i>food has taken a wide approach to schools, which are a key setting.  My colleague, Ms Gilligan, will discuss our resources from preschool up to early school leavers, who we consider a particularly vulnerable group, given that they have less education.  According to our research, their planning, budgeting and cooking skills are often less developed, perhaps partly because of what they have seen at home, but also from a school perspective.<br/><br/>As to what <i>safe</i>food does with our provisions, we have classroom resources.  Ms Gilligan will discuss those further.  We have also worked with a number of partners on the school environment.  We have run campaigns and had an input into the school food standards that Mr. Macey mentioned.  An interesting phenomenon, and one that could be copied in Ireland, is the broad-based food in schools forum in Northern Ireland.  We have started discussing this phenomenon with Healthy Ireland and the Department of Health.  It is an ongoing policy and implementation group.<br/><br/>Something that was mentioned by Mr. Macey and that Ms Gilligan will refer to again is the influence of marketing and how to develop health and food literacy in children, for example, what is the difference between an ad, which is often subtle and surreptitious, and real information.</p></speech>

My final point is that our approach, which is a long game, is one of partnership because we realise that providing resources, issuing simplistic information and so on is not the way.  We have partnerships with teachers' organisations.  We attend their conferences and undertake what is mostly qualitative research with parents about the real world and how they manage the school situation, particularly secondary school, where children are entering into adulthood, have more autonomy and so on.</p> <p>  The last element that we focus on is support for all schoolchildren, but particularly those who need it most.  We cannot speak often enough about bullying and the psychological and long-term impacts of overweight and obesity on how children do in school and their further career achievements.  There is a long-term legacy.</p></speech>

Members have a paper in front of them that contains details on a number of the resources that we have developed and sent to schools over the years.  I will draw members' attention to three in particular, the first of which is MediaWise.  Mr. Macey mentioned the "brand in the hand".  As Dr. Foley-Nolan indicated, MediaWise teaches children media literacy and health literacy.  Some of us believe that our children are tech savvy.  They can Snapchat skilfully and create slo-mo videos in a second.  However, they still believe what they see, particularly primary schoolchildren.  MediaWise is about helping them to develop the critical and analytical skills that they need to make decisions for themselves now and later in life.  Our colleagues in the Irish Heart Foundation published research on children and their ability to distinguish between content and marketing.  There are major problems in that regard, which is one of the reasons for our development of this piece of work in partnership with the Irish Heart Foundation.</p> <p>  Another piece of research that we have done with Dr. Celine Murrin of UCD related to the ads that children watch.  At three years of age, children see more than 1,000 unhealthy food ads in a year - take that to the nth degree over the years.  We convened a team of experts.  Social, personal and health education, SPHE, personnel were involved in the development of MediaWise, as were psychology experts like Professor Colman Noctor, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, the Irish Heart Foundation and others.  It is an eight-week programme.</p><p>It started in schools in September.  More than 1,000 schools have taken it up.  It tells children about emotions, persuasion and what the media is, and it is produced in a cross-curricular way in order that it covers all aspects of the curriculum.  Some of the conversation has been about extending things to parents.  We hope that, over the next year, we can look at how we can get that into parents' hands, as it were.</p><p> We have developed the lunchbox leaflet in partnership with Healthy Ireland and the HSE.  It is the Holy Grail since it goes into parents' hands.  It goes to children who are starting school every September and all schools are given copies of the leaflet.  We talked about the nutritional needs of children.  One third of their nutritional needs come from what is put into their lunchboxes.  Parents told us in the delivery and development of a new campaign that we may refer to later that it is really helpful if they have a piece that they can point a child towards to show what they have been told they can put in the child's lunchbox.  It is a really useful leaflet.  There are tips in it for how to avoid soggy sandwiches and there is a lunchbox planner which is a five-day piece.  We know that many complaints from parents are about what they will put in the lunchbox in following days.  The leaflet is very nice.</p><p> The last item to talk about is Little Bites.  A speaker earlier spoke about whether we needed to start these things at an earlier stage.  This is in a child care setting where Early Childhood Ireland and Early Years, the equivalent agency in the North, are involved.  I am not sure if we said that we are a North-South agency.  Work that we do needs to run into the North.  It is a one-stop shop for guidelines and policy for people working in the area, for menu plans and ideas for snacks.  There are also lessons in how to teach children about food and how to deliver food to themselves.  There are small pieces about fussy eating etc.  There have been approximately 10,000 users of that to date.  It has been going since 2016 and is a significant piece.</p></speech>

Like previous contributors, many of whom are close partners in our work in this area, I thank the Chairman and the committee for the opportunity to be here.  I have circulated a very short paper and will address a couple of points in that.  I am the head of health and well-being in the Department of Health.  We lead the whole-of-Government and whole-of-society implementation of the Healthy Ireland framework, which a number of previous speakers have referred to.  A critical part of that is cross-Government work and interdepartmental work.  The committee has seen some evidence of that in the submission from our colleagues in the Department of Education and Skills, and I will address further examples, but it is a broader than that.  It is about every sector, not just education, and includes local authorities, workplaces and the whole community in how we join the dots better to support individuals, families and communities to look after their own health and well-being better and to give them the tools and resources to be able to do so.  Much of what we are talking about here today, as some colleagues have touched on, is a focus on schools, parents, children and young people.  That is within the context of a wider community and society drive.<br/><br/>As well as Healthy Ireland, in our implementation of this, we have two national policies and plans which have been approved by Government in the past year.  The national physical activity plan, which I will speak about in a moment, was approved by Government early last year.  The obesity policy and action plan, A Healthy Weight for Ireland, will come later in the year.  The committee has heard from our colleagues in the Department of Education and Skills and a key part of our work with our colleagues in the HSE is continuing work to align our work with the reform in education, particularly to support the new well-being curriculum.  For example, our colleagues in the HSE would give their expertise and input into developing training programmes for teachers in co-operation with the Department of Education and Skills, and they would also provide resources to ensure that whatever is done in school is in line with national policy, best practice evidence and national guidelines.<br/><br/>We had the first meeting of our new oversight group for the obesity policy and implementation plan last week.  The Departments of Education and Skills, Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Children and Youth Affairs, and Housing, Planning and Local Government, which all key Departments, as well as agencies such as <i>safe</i>food are involved.  As people have said and Dr. Murrin articulated very clearly earlier, both the causes of and solutions for obesity are multifaceted, quite complex and interlinked.  It is a matter of having action on all of those issues.  To give some detail on that, we will take a population approach, with a focus on child obesity.  It is important to acknowledge that when we developed the policy, it involved consultation with children and young people.  It is important for us to include them in implementation.  Healthy Lifestyles Have Your Say was supported through the Irish Primary Principals' Network and Comhairle na n&Oacute;g to hear from young people.  Some things they mentioned had already been referred to, such as the lack of diversity in some schools or communities with regard to different sports or activities.  For example, if a child is not interested in ball games, are dance or other activities available?  We heard from children who were overweight or had issues with their diet and weight about the stigma, mental health issues and other issues that people have mentioned with regard to that.<br/><br/>People have referred to a number of more recent developments to tackle the broad issue and support the work that every family and school in the country is doing.  There has been reference to the new sugar-sweetened drinks tax.  That is about both obesity and dental deterioration and is very much focused on young people.  There has been mention of marketing by food companies so, under the obesity policy, we are trying to work where we can in partnership with the food industry and we developed a code of practice for marketing foods, especially to young people.  The Minister of State with responsibility for health promotion will launch that in the coming weeks.  It is a step in the right direction with regard to our other work with industry on reformulations or reducing sugar, salt and fat and such in foods.  Colleagues in <i>safe</i>food have referred to the new child obesity campaign that we will launch next week with the Minister for Health, all going well.  With regard to stigma and how children feel, some language is now changing.  For example, our policy is called A Healthy Weight for Ireland and our campaign centres on a healthy weight for children.  We do not talk about obesity in children so much any more but ask how we ensure that every child in Ireland has a healthy weight.  There has been reference to the new standards that we created.  All food going into school meals, which receive the guts of &euro;50 million of investment by the State into both DEIS schools and some non-DEIS schools, has to meet the new healthy eating guidelines in the food pyramid.  That will be a very impactful measure as it is rolled out into schools from this year.<br/><br/>Earlier intervention and supporting parents was mentioned, and would be a focus of the campaign.  Key work that we are now doing is to have the new healthy eating guidelines and food pyramid for the population of those aged five and up, whereas we are developing new healthy eating guidelines underpinned by evidence for one to five year olds.  That will be helpful in the future to both parents and those in the early years setting to tell what is best practice for nutrition for children.<br/><br/>We have a separate plan for physical activity, because while being a pillar and very important for weight management, it is also about much more.  It is for mental well-being and for the social, emotional and other development of children and young people.  The obesity policy recognises that and we work with the two in tandem.  Something that has been referred to is the active school flag.  We have supported the Department of Education and Skills in rolling that out.  A recent development in that regard has been the new Healthy Ireland fund that the Government has set up under our framework, with an additional &euro;5 million this year and another &euro;5 million, thankfully, allocated in budget 2018.  We will put more than &euro;200,000 into the active school flag initiative to promote it to schools, expand the number of primary schools using it, and develop a fit-for-purpose model for secondary school which will align with the new well-being curriculum.<br/><br/>I will finish by saying that there has been a lot of focus on children in schools.  It is instructive that we launched our Healthy Ireland survey for 2017 this morning so some people may have had earlier figures from it on the numbers of people who are overweight or obese.  As one gets older, one is more likely to be overweight.  We had a focus in the survey this year on the 15 to 24 year old group who, as people have referred to, are soon going to be the parents of the future, even though they might not think that.  We have highlighted concerns about levels of smoking, alcohol consumption and overweight people.</p><p>Some 30% of our 15 to 24 year olds are overweight. </p><p> We have ambitious policies and plans and a much-improved infrastructure for partnership working across Government and across society.  There is an awful lot of work to do but there is a lot of good work under way.  By continuing on that path, we will hopefully start to make some inroads in terms of the statistics on obesity.</p></speech>

I have a few queries myself.  Mr. Macey spoke about vending machines.  We had a debate earlier on.  Is it his view that vending machines should be banned outright?  There is a divergence of opinion in that regard.</p> <p>  On the sugar tax that will be coming in, one of the recommendations was that it should be ring-fenced.  There would certainly be a number of us who would think that.  However, it has already been stated that it cannot happen.  If it was to be ring-fenced, what measures does Mr. Macey think it should go towards?  There seems to be a difference between the facts he has given on the availability of free drinking water and those of the Department.  That is something we will have to take up with the Department separately again.  The clerk to the committee might write to the Department looking for clarification on it.</p> <p>  Turning to Safe Food, it is good to see the education piece around MediaWise and also around the hygienic handling of food.  That is very important and we cannot forget about it.  In terms of monitoring, which the Department of Health has also mentioned, the monitoring of nutritional standards for the school meals scheme is hugely important.  I would be interested to hear the witnesses' views on that and on how we can educate parents in making the lifestyle changes that are needed.  Ms O'Flaherty mentioned that the childhood obesity campaign launch will be next week.  It is very welcome.  What will be new in that?  Does she feel that schools have adequate time and resources to roll out what is needed in terms of the collaboration with the Department?</p> <p>  I will now hand over to my colleagues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-24a.199" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1242" speakername="Catherine Martin" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017102400002#Q00500"><p>Following on from the Chairman's question about vending machines being banned, is the case even more extreme?  Some schools do not have vending machines but they have the fizzy drinks for sale behind the counter in their canteens.  Should we looking for fizzy drink free zones in schools?  One can see the difference in the children's behaviour after taking that sugar rush.  Is that something the Department would consider?</p> <p>  My other questions are for the officials from the Department of Health.  What sort of contact do they have with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Department of Education and Skills, not just about activity in schools but about ensuring that children can walk and cycle safely to school?  Activity on the way to school can also help tackle obesity.</p> <p>  We always look to Finland when we talk about education.  They have a "health in all policies" approach which has helped tackle obesity in childhood in recent years.  Some 8% of Finland's education budget goes on delivering school meals.  I understand it is provided for in legislation that every child is guaranteed a school meal.  Is that something we should be considering?  Should we be rolling out comprehensive healthy school meals?  We have a crisis in obesity but we also have one in five children going to school hungry.  It makes sense that it would help their education if they were eating the right foods and if we make sure they are not hungry in the classroom.</p></speech>

It is great to see that level of awareness.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-24a.202" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Chris Macey" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017102400002#Q00800"><p>Do we want to ban vending machines outright?  Yes, we do.  We cannot have healthy food going up against unhealthy food because the unhealthy food will always win.  When we take the junk food away, children will enjoy the healthy, nutritious food.  As far as we are concerned, healthy food and drink provision should be the norm in schools.  There is no need for fizzy drinks.  The Department had a Circular on this and it seems to just accept that unhealthy food is going to be in our schools.  There is no reason it should be.  For us, it is very clear that we need to get the junk food and vending machines out of schools.  On the notion of healthy vending, there was a proposal before about a 60:40 ratio of healthy to unhealthy foods.  Again, apples will not be eaten if chocolate bars are available.  There are also issues about keeping fresh foods within vending machines, which is a whole other area.</p> <p>  On ring-fencing, we are told it cannot be done.  It is being done in the UK, where they are bringing in the same sugar-sweetened drink tax.  They call it the narrative of hypothecation, which means it is not actual ring-fencing but it sort of actually is.  They are going to fund physical education facilities within schools and other things from it.  We understand there will be &euro;40 million coming out of this tax in Ireland.  That is what the Department of Finance is saying.  If we are serious about tackling this problem, why would we take the money away from people?  More of this tax is going to be coming out of disadvantaged areas.  Given that the obesity and overweight problem is bigger in such areas, why not put the money back into those communities?</p> <p>  To clarify the issue around free drinking water, our survey was of 50 schools so it was 40% of those 50 schools.  It is very clear to me from being in schools around the country that there is not free drinking water in all schools.  In the schools we surveyed, Coca-Cola was as available as free drinking water.  That situation is not acceptable and is not going to help combat the obesity problem.</p></speech>

The vast majority of primary schools have healthy eating policies.  Then our children transition to post-primary school, which is a very different environment in which they have greater autonomy financially as well.  We are failing our children when they transition to post-primary school at the moment.  We know that education is not enough to tackle obesity.  We can educate parents and pupils but unless the world in which our children live supports them to put that education into practice, we will not tackle this problem.</p> <p>  School liaison officers were referred to earlier.  This speaks to the importance of having a cross-Departmental approach.  In our experience of being out in post-primary schools, we see that school liaison officers have a huge influence on children.  They can be a great support to influencing what happens in schools.  It shows how the Department of Social Protection has a vital role to play outside of the school meals scheme in influencing food provision within schools.  However, we have found school liaison officers who have not been interested in the nutrition status of what is offered in schools.</p><p>It is a case of getting the children to stay in school and if that means offering a chocolate muffin or chocolate milk, so be it.  There is a body of work to be done in order to have a consistent approach in maximising the support that school liaison officers can give us.</p></speech>

This year four DEIS schools we worked in got rid of their vending machines.  They were not getting any money for them.  Often it is a historical thing where these vending machines have been there for years and there is no money changing hands.  We have heard this said but we have seen no evidence that schools need this money.  I am sure that they do; they need every penny that they can get.  We would say that in terms of weaning themselves off the money they need, if that exists, that should be something that should come out of some fund because it is very important that it is done.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-24a.210" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Cliodhna Foley-Nolan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017102400002#R00700"><p>The approach we have taken in <i>safe</i>food in terms of supporting and collaborating with Healthy Ireland as regards the next campaign, and it is part of the school situation, is recognition of where parents are at rather than maybe a more idealistic thing.  It is an approach of one day at a time and a start in terms of getting going on different behaviours.  The evidence base alluded to has not changed in terms of what are healthy behaviours.  It is a question of how parents can role model themselves and how they can give a good example in each of those areas and make a start or have a bit of a win one day at a time.  There is a bit of the 12 steps approach to it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-24a.211" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Fiona Gilligan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017102400002#R00800"><p>In addition to that, it is more cohesive in terms of the discussion around who is at the table.  Healthy Ireland, the HSE, the Public Health Agency and the Department of Health are the big names at the table.  Apart from that, we developed a stakeholder strategy which will run over the five years of the campaign.  It is looking at bringing education, communities, sports bodies and the food industry to the table.  All those elements have to come together in order for this to work.  As Dr. Foley-Nolan said, it is a start.  There will be small starts.  It will be over the five years but the intention is that across that period, we will be making those changes.</p> <p>  It is more cohesive in so far as we will all have the same messages.  They will be rolled out through health professionals.  At the moment, the HSE is giving the materials to health professionals, to district health nurses, to ensure, from a medical perspective, that is where the start is being made.  We will also push it out to schools.  </p> <p>  We are looking at bringing food parenting to community settings.  Where parenting courses are currently running, there is a piece around food parenting that is missing, namely, how to say "No".  Those pieces need to be introduced so that will be another part of these programmes.</p> <p>  In terms of the policy pieces, to which Ms O'Flaherty alluded, the code of practice on marketing is due to come out in the next couple of weeks.  That will all be inclusive in this start approach.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-24a.213" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Kate O'Flaherty" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017102400002#R01100"><p>I will take the specific questions.  Hopefully, I have recorded all of them.  The current vending policy that the Department of Education and Skills has supported is the one that is currently running in the HSE.  It is to make a start to move to a 60:40 split in terms of healthy and less healthy products, and to give that choice.  A key part in starting in that way in secondary schools was to align with the whole well-being curriculum and helping young people to make decisions for themselves.  The school councils are involved in that.  That is where we are at the moment but that will be reviewed in the future in terms of whether we need to move that further.<br/><br/>On the sugar tax, we have said that the Department of Finance's tax policy is not to hypothecate a tax <i>per se</i>.  Colleagues have referred to the narrative hypothecation and it is a very nice phrase in that we are not actually hypothecating it but are being seen to give money towards something.  In terms of our new Healthy Ireland fund, there is some element of that, that is, to help promote and leverage cross-sectoral working at national and local levels.<br/><br/>I refer to school meal standards.  Currently, school meals are funded thorough the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the funding has increased.  The new standards will be monitored by it.  It is setting up a more robust system where it is signing service level agreements, SLAs, with all schools that sign up to the programme.  That will be written into the SLAs, so that the schools must comply with the standards.  The Department of Health will also liaise with some of the main providers of the school meals to ensure it is done as efficiently as possible.  There is no excuse for any child in any school, particularly if it is State subsidised, not to be able to have food that matches the food pyramid.  Some of the monitoring and evaluation will be done by Dr. Murrin and by colleagues to see the impact of that.<br/><br/>We have an agreement in principle in terms of how we encourage schools that are outside the school meals programme to start to use those standards in the context of the provision of other foods and meals in schools that are not necessarily State subsidised and to try to have that consistency among schools as standard.<br/><br/>My colleagues in <i>safe</i>food have probably given the members a little bit of a sneak preview into the new campaign.  We have our own policy framework and it is good to reference the child policy framework, Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: The National Policy Framework for Children &amp;amp; Young People 2014-2020, which this committee will be familiar with, in terms of supporting parents.  While children are in school settings, most children grow up in families so it is really about supporting the parents and making healthier choices and behaviours.  How do we support parents so that becomes normalised across eating and activity?  It is the approach we take in terms of smoking, alcohol and so on.  How do we make it easier for people to make those healthier choices and for that to be the norm?<br/><br/>We probably did not elucidate it enough but we have a number of cross-sectoral groups and very good working relationships with a number of Departments.  We have an overall cross-sectoral structure for Healthy Ireland but then we have a group for the obesity policy and the physical activity plan.  It was remiss of me not to say that we that we developed and implement the physical activity plan jointly with our colleagues in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.<b></b>Active transport is a key part of that and we will be looking to continue to build on that.  Under that, at population level, we launched a new Get Ireland Walking strategy, so there is a piece in that around how we join the dots in terms of good infrastructure, encouraging schools and encouraging parents to leave the car at home and walk to the school if they live less than a kilometre away.  Some schools are taking that on board.  <br/><br/>We will also be working on a new Get Ireland Cycling strategy which would go hand-in-hand with that.  How do we make it easier for people?  How do we normalise it?  Over time, more people will seek to move to change their behaviour because more people around them are now doing that.  That is certainly there in terms of the overall piece.<br/><br/>Finally, I have to respond to Senator Gallagher's remark.  I will take it as a compliment that the focus on strategic communications is starting to filter down to the Department of Health.  They are very quick answers to the questions that members raised but if they would like any further information, we would be happy to respond in writing.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to be here.</p></speech>

The key thing is to take them all taken together.  We have set up the structure to ensure we can monitor implementation of them.</p></speech>

Their submissions were very interesting and informative and we have learned a lot from their insights and observations.  Many good things are being done to try to tackle the issue of obesity in children and in adults and to have a policy in place around having a positive, physically healthy lifestyle and eating appropriately.  There were many lessons for Deputies and Senators.  We have to try to grab something very quickly and we do not get the chance to do any physical activity.</p><p>It is well documented that being overweight or obese is a significant risk factor for many chronic diseases, including heart disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes, infertility, respiratory disease and mental health illness.  There is an onus on all of us to ensure we have in place long-term sustainable school programmes, including adequate teacher training, training for leaders in communities and parents, to enable us to reverse obesity trends, prevent health complications and reduce the overall health burden for individuals, their families, the health system, wider society and the economy, taking account of my earlier comment that it costs approximately &euro;1 billion annually to treat individuals who are overweight or obese.</p><p> The committee will be making recommendations to the Minister based on all of its interactions and the information gathered.  We look forward to further interaction on this issue into the future.</p></speech>

It also clarifies that children born to diplomats and associated persons who are exempt from immigration controls do not qualify for Irish citizenship by birth, unless one of the child&rsquo;s parents is an Irish citizen or entitled to be, a British citizen, a person entitled to reside in the State without any restriction on his or her residence, or a person entitled to reside in Northern Ireland without any restriction on his or her residence.</p><p>With the amendments I am proposing to address a minor anomaly that has been identified in our citizenship legislation with regard to Irish public servants serving the State overseas.  Under section 7(3) of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, a person born outside the island of Ireland derives Irish citizenship through a parent who was also born outside the island of Ireland but only if their birth was registered on the foreign births register.  Pursuant to section 7(3)(b), if at the time of birth that parent was abroad in the public service of the State, the person is automatically an Irish citizen without being required to be registered on the foreign births register.  This ensures children born to non-Irish born public servants serving abroad are not disadvantaged in terms of entitlement to citizenship.  However, an issue has been identified with the provision insofar as disadvantages may arise in respect of subsequent generations.  For example, if a person who has derived his or her citizenship by virtue of section 7(3)(b) and who is not a public servant has a child abroad, assuming the child&rsquo;s other parent is also non-Irish born, that child would not derive Irish citizenship unless registered on the foreign births register.  The proposed amendments are aimed at correcting this anomaly by deeming such a person as having been born on the island of Ireland for the purposes of that subsection. </p><p>I am sure Deputies will agree that public servants working overseas do crucial work and are a credit to the State.  In many cases, taking up a foreign posting can entail considerable sacrifices for the individuals concerned and their families.  For these reasons, we are committed to ensuring disadvantages are minimised.  This is a minor anomaly in the citizenship legislation.  Nonetheless, it seems appropriate to take the opportunity in a miscellaneous provisions Bill to address it to ensure public servants, their children and grandchildren will not be disadvantaged under the citizenship laws.  I hope Deputies can support the amendments which are a practical and sensible response to recognising what service abroad is actually about, namely, working for one's country.  In simple terms, the provisions recognise that when an Irish diplomat serving abroad has children abroad, in law it is the same as having a child at home.</p></speech>

The Bill is technical in nature and I welcome the explanation in the memorandum of the amendments the Minister is putting forward.  On Second Stage I referred to my concerns about the provisions of this section.  Those concerns were reflected in the disallowed amendment.  Having read through the debate on Second Stage in the Official Report, it seems mine were the only concerns raised in this regard.  My amendment was disallowed on the grounds that it could involve a charge on Revenue, in accordance with Standing Order 179(3).  With the Chairman's indulgence, I would like to explain why I submitted it.</p></speech>

The section seeks to amend the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 to provide that any period of time spent in the State where persons are exempt from immigration controls, as workers in embassies are, is not reckonable for residency in the context of a naturalisation application.  The rights of embassy workers are important and should not be undermined or interfered with in any way.  On Second Stage I said I did not understand why this provision was being included in the Bill.  Is it to do with immigration controls, checks and so on?  It proposes to take away the rights of a category of persons without any explanation as to why it is being done.  I still do not understand the purpose of excluding in this way what is likely to be a very a small group of workers which will probably comprise no more than 20 or 30 persons.</p> <p>  Following the Second Stage debate, nobody from the Department contacted me to provide the information I had requested and the section remains the same.  That is bad form.  It is seldom we have legislation passing through the House these days but normally the Minister or the Minister of State who sums up the debate will reply to questions raised by Members in the course of the debate.  That was not done in this instance.  I acknowledge that it was the Minister's predecessor who took the debate, but it is still unacceptable.  On Second Stage I asked the previous Minister to explain why these workers should be treated differently from others and indicate how many people had applied for naturalisation or citizenship in this way in recent years.  I pointed out that having this important information would help to explain the inclusion of this provision.  I questioned why this change was being made at this time and asked the Minister to outline the policy goal it reflected, but none of my questions was answered.  Does the Minister agree that they deserve some response?</p> <p>  On Second Stage I indicated my intention to raise this matter again on Committee Stage unless my questions were answered in a satisfactory manner.  Bizarrely, I was told my amendment had been ruled out of order because the retention of the current provision might involve a cost to the Exchequer.  Apparently, under the existing provision, people might potentially be eligible for citizenship at an earlier date, as a consequence of which additional costs might arise.  That is my understanding of the reason the change is being made.  That is an unacceptable usage of Standing Order 179(3), in respect of which there is no appeal mechanism.  When I queried why it cost an applicant &euro;950 to apply for Irish citizenship, I was told that the charge was necessary to cover the cost of the administration work involved in processing the application and reflective of the high value in which Irish citizenship was held.  If applicants are paying for their own application process, how can more applications be considered to be a charge on Revenue, or do citizenship applications cost the State money?  </p> <p>  I am seeking clarity from the Minister on these legitimate questions.  I am unable to push the amendment to a vote, but the Minister can do so on Report Stage.  If he does not, I will be voting against the Bill, something I do not want to do.  I have no other objections to what is a largely technical Bill.  When an Oireachtas Member asks legitimate questions, he or she should be given answers.  I thank the Chairman for allowing me to speak to the section.  It is worth spending a few minutes to discuss the matter</p></speech>

That decision fell to me as Chairman of the committee and was made on the basis that the proposal would involve a potential charge on the Exchequer.  Only a Minister or a Minister of State may bring forward an amendment that has a revenue or expenditure implications.</p></speech>

As the Chairman noted, neither I nor my Department has a role in deciding whether an amendment is ruled in or out of order.  From a policy perspective, the Deputy deserves to understand why we have not brought forward a similar proposal to what he has set out in the amendment which has been ruled out of order.  During the Second Stage debate my predecessor, Deputy Charles Flanagan, explained the rationale for this policy which I will reiterate briefly for the benefit of the Deputy.</p> <p>  Under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, members of diplomatic missions and their families are required to be exempt from immigration controls.  With regard to citizenship, like many other countries, Ireland has long considered that the spirit of the Vienna Convention envisages people coming to the State as employees of a foreign government for a finite period of time before returning to that country or another on assignment.  In these circumstances, it is considered appropriate to exclude such persons from the mainstream citizenship arrangements, just as they are exempt from immigration controls, one being a logical corollary of the other.  In effect, employees of foreign governments are deemed to be the responsibility of those governments.  Persons who are working in a diplomatic mission here are effectively exempt from all sort of things, including a potential liability for tax and PRSI, and do not need to go through work permit application procedures or anything like that.  They come as part of a diplomatic mission and are usually here for a set period before moving to another mission, whether back home or in a different state.  As such, they are in a different category from other types of non-citizen worker.  Somebody who receives a work permit to come here is effectively part of the Irish immigration system by being here.  After four to five years, he or she has the timeline required to be eligible to apply for naturalisation.  By contrast, a person who comes to Ireland to work in a diplomatic mission bypasses all of these application procedures and arrives as part of a team from another country, representing that country's interests and being employed by its government.  Of course, at some later point, if such persons wish to apply to come here as individuals, they may do so on the same basis as anybody else.</p><p>The matter being raised by the Deputy was whether they should be able to use the time they spent here on a diplomatic mission as time towards a naturalisation application at some stage in future.  That was not the intention of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations in general.  Just as when Irish teams are abroad in Irish embassies, they are essentially still part of Ireland although they operate outside the State as a representative for Ireland.  That was the rationale as outlined by the previous Minister, Deputy Flanagan.  I will take a look at it in a bit more detail if the Deputy so wishes before Report and Final Stages.  Perhaps we could have a stab at the numbers involved, as they would not be huge.  There is a point of principle whereby somebody who comes to Ireland and needs to go through the permitting and visa procedures and who works here on the back of that permit system is in a different category to somebody who comes here as part of a diplomatic team.  I will have a look at it but the rationale as outlined by the former Minister stands, and that is why we do not have an amendment mirroring that of the Deputy yet.</p></speech>

The purpose of the Bill is to make the necessary provisions in Irish law to enable the State to ratify a 1954 Hague Convention on the protection of cultural property in the event of armed conflict.  There is also a 1999 protocol that supplements this.  It is important to recognise these conventions go back some time.  I am glad to say we are amending Irish law to recognise them.  This is as important in terms of the signal sent to other countries as it is to the law in Ireland.  I am glad to say we are unlikely to have armed conflict in Ireland where this law would be necessary to apply but, unfortunately, many other countries are not in those circumstances.  We have seen devastating consequences of the destruction of very significant cultural and historical monuments, artefacts and so on in the latest Syrian war, for example, as well as many other conflicts in other parts of the world.  I hope that with Ireland ratifying and producing this legislation, we will encourage others to do likewise.  I thank the Opposition for its support in allowing us to move this through swiftly.</p></speech>

A total of 126 states are party to the Hague Convention and we want to ensure Ireland makes the necessary provisions in law to ensure it complies with obligations.  I acknowledge the work of my colleague in the North, Ms Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n, who served as Minister with responsibility for culture, arts and leisure in the Six Counties and supported similar legislation in the Assembly.  I welcome the Bill but I also want to see the application of its core values in the country at all times.  It is useful to be cognisant of the various aspects of cultural property in this country during peace, and not just in the case of war, as the Bill outlines.  It would be farcical to lament the destruction of cultural property in war without applying the same standards to the preservation of such property during peace.</p> <p>  We need only look at the historical quarter around Moore Street, which falls into the broad and positive definition of cultural property as laid down in section 1 of this Bill, yet it remains under threat from the policies of the Government and construction companies.  I am thankful we are at peace but I wonder whether outsiders looking in would consider the Government guilty of the destruction of our cultural property in peace through negligence and ignorance.  We have seen historic buildings being knocked down by developers because of light-touch legislation in the past and I refer to fighting a legal battle against the likes of the Moore Street campaign with public money in order to side with developers, whose only appreciation of culture is from pictures on bank notes.  I commend the Lord Mayor of Dublin, who held a cultural event last weekend on Moore Street that drew attention to the spirit of bygone days, as well as the historic nature of the quarter.  I support the Bill but we must also scrutinise what we do during peace as well.</p></speech>

It has been the Minister's first opportunity to address this committee and we are looking forward to having good interactions and working well alongside him.  I know that he has a very heavy agenda and workload but I was in County Down at the weekend where I was given a clear message by people I met from both communities that they are very concerned that the institutions are not back up and running in Northern Ireland.  I said that I would be speaking to the Minister today - I am not asking him to comment - and I would convey the people's frustration to him and how anxious they are that the two main parties in Stormont, Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP, would make every effort to get the institutions back up and running as quickly as possible.  We know the importance of the Good Friday Agreement and the institutions it provides for.  I have the privilege of representing an area that has benefited very considerably from the agreement and we would like to see its potential maximised.  I said that I would convey that message to the Minister on behalf of people from both traditions I met at the weekend.  We look forward to further engagement with the Minister.  I am sorry if I have drifted off topic.</p></speech>

This is my first time before this committee, dealing with two quite technical pieces of legislation.  There are many other things we need to tease through and discuss.  I look forward to being asked back to the committee again.  I would like us to have regular interaction on Northern Ireland in particular.  I know that the Chairman is very interested in and knowledgeable on the matter, as are other members.</p> <p>  It is a very important week in the context of protecting and maintaining devolved government and the institutions in Northern Ireland.  I will be in Belfast tomorrow, working with all parties but especially the two largest parties, to try to find a way to ensure that we do not allow the heart to be ripped out of the Good Friday Agreement, which is what would happen if we do not have institutions in Northern Ireland making decisions for people there.  In order for that to happen, the two largest parties need to find a way to accommodate each other, which is not easy, and I recognise the efforts made by both parties and their negotiating teams in recent weeks.  That has happened in private, which is as it should be, but the negotiations cannot go on forever, as everyone knows, so we are coming to a point where people must make choices.  My job and that of the Secretary of State, James Brokenshire, is to try to facilitate and encourage and help parties find the accommodation that is necessary in a way that is true to the agreements, including the Good Friday Agreement.  There is a genuine effort in both the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in to do that and support from the other political parties who want to be part of a fully inclusive executive in Northern Ireland.  We are at a point where most people accept that negotiations cannot continue week after week.  Northern Ireland needs a budget.  There are practical issues around that.  I passionately believe that Northern Ireland needs to decide on its own budget and how it is spent and it is people elected in Northern Ireland rather than anywhere else who should be doing that.  It is an important week, a sensitive time and we should be careful about what we say but also be clear about the outcome that is necessary for the people of all communities in Northern Ireland.    </p> <p>  I also want to thank the committee members for their support for the Government's efforts to represent Ibrahim Halawa who arrived back in Dublin about 20 minutes ago, where he met his family and friends at the airport.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, is there representing the Government.  It is a happy ending to a very difficult period in his life.  I had the opportunity to speak to him over the weekend and we wish him well in trying to get his life back to some form of normality.  Today is a great day for him and his family, who I am sure will celebrate it.  We will do what we can to ensure that he finds the transition from imprisonment over the last four years to normal life as a young Irishman in the coming months and years as smooth as possible.  </p> <p>  There are many other issues that I would like to talk about but we are unable to do so this morning.  I would like to return and discuss some of the matters on which the Government has strong views including the Middle East peace process, EU relations with Africa, Brexit, and the future of Northern Ireland, and there must be many issues on which the members would like to probe me.  I look forward to doing that when we have more time.  </p></speech>

Our committee had much engagement with his predecessor, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and Department officials regarding Ibrahim Halawa and we are all very glad he is back home in Ireland.  We wish him well into the future.  We want to record our appreciation for the officials in the consular section of the Department who met us on numerous occasions and briefed us.  We had engagement both publically and privately, during which we all expressed our concerns about Ibrahim for so many years.  We wish him well in the future.</p><p>As the Minister said, there is generally not much interest in Committee Stage debates which are technical matters but I am glad so see we are joined by members of the diplomatic corps.  I see the ambassadors of Cyprus and Israel as well as the <i>charg&eacute;s d'affaires</i>from Georgia and Saudi Arabia, and also a representative of the Russian Federation.

We thought it would be good to have some regional views as well.</p> <p>  Chambers Ireland is Ireland's largest business network, with 45 chambers of commerce across the country representing over 10,000 businesses ranging from small and medium enterprises, SMEs, to large corporations.  We welcome the opportunity to work with the committee.  As a general point, our network has called this year for priority to be given to infrastructure build over other potential budgetary measures such as reducing marginal rates of tax.</p> <p>  On the specific topics we raised in our submission, labour costs account for one of the largest outlays for businesses in the country and are therefore of huge interest and concern.  Of most concern to businesses are the high cost of living and the rising cost and lack of supply of housing, both of which potentially will contribute significantly to demands for increased pay.  We also refer to the minimum wage and the process adopted for increasing it this year.  In future we would like to see the Low Pay Commission report being published and discussed in advance of any announcement by the Government on changes in rates.  In addition, we continue to believe that this process should take place as part of the annual budget cycle so all impacts to incomes through tax, welfare, social insurance, minimum wage adjustments and so forth are dealt with in conjunction with each other, not separately.</p> <p>  Regarding property, while significant developments of commercial property are now under way and coming available there remains uncertainty about whether the amount under construction will meet demand.  In the meantime, rent levels are escalating significantly and are a threat to competitiveness.  However, investment in housing is critical.  The national housing crisis is also a business-critical issue.  Business is anxious that long-term solutions are adopted and applied, aside from addressing the short-term issues.  We welcome initiatives such as home building finance Ireland, HBFI, and the introduction of a site value tax from 2019.</p> <p>  Our network also has concerns about the stagnation surrounding local property tax, LPT, while noting the Government&rsquo;s plan for a comprehensive review of the tax.  Failure to reset values and further exemptions from LPT carry the risk that businesses will be expected to make up the shortfall arising in funding through commercial rates.  Concerns about significantly increasing values leading to a surge in the individual rate of tax can be addressed by adapting bands and rates appropriately.</p> <p>  Infrastructure development generally is a priority, none more so than in transport.  We welcome the work being put into the national planning framework to create a template for strategic investment in the future.</p> <p>  Access to finance appears to be less significant as an issue now than during the recession.  The main challenge facing businesses is the absolute cost of credit in Ireland and the need for alternative sources of finance, such as equity investment.  Regulation is also a particular concern.  Government Departments should undertake regular regulatory impact assessments.  We are also concerned about the general data protection regulations, GDPR, and Brexit.</p> <p>  As regards insurance costs, we welcome the work of the cost of insurance working group and emphasise the importance of implementing its recommendations.  In particular, claims costs and types appear to be a significant issue.  We welcome the enactment of the Mediation Act as a means to assist in more cost and time effective resolution of disputes.</p> <p>  I will hand over to my colleague, Thomas Mc Hugh.</p></speech>

As Ian Talbot said, infrastructure is also at the top of our list and was so for our budgetary submission.  Another big issue for us at present is the potential changes to the non-domestic water rates.  There is a high level of concern that businesses would bear the cost of cross-subsidising that space.  That is a serious area.</p> <p>  With regard to climate change and adaptation, storm Ophelia last week was a major event.  There was a number of red weather warnings in Cork as a result of it.  Nationally, there is potentially approximately &euro;111 million in costs to insurance.  It is a critical issue for competitiveness.</p><p> On the question of infrastructure more broadly it is obvious that there is potential for the population of Cork to increase to up to 850,000, with 120,000 jobs by 2050.  Critical infrastructure, such as the M20 and M28, are essential to further enable employment on IDA Ireland sites.</p><p> Climate change mitigation and adaptation are relevant.  I wish to reinforce the Storm Ophelia point that there is a need for construction of infrastructure to ameliorate these effects.  That is absolutely essential.  Flooding is a particular area that we are interested in.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-24a.273" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Olivia Buckley" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017102400002#F00200"><p>Thank you very much, Chairman.  I intend to share my time with my colleague, Cora O'Brien, our policy director.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for the invitation and the opportunity to outline our views on the tax barriers and tax-related costs of doing business.  The institute has recently undertaken a detailed analysis of the Ireland's tax policy and tax administration system as it relates to Irish business.  The analysis highlighted some of the aspects that have a restrictive impact on the growth potential of our businesses.  These restrictions act not only as blockers but also build additional costs into the system.  These costs and the additional costs that are already emerging because of Brexit impact on the competitiveness of our businesses at a time when they need to be business-ready and fully supported not only for the challenges but the opportunities that arise in the global environment.</p> <p>  Tax-related costs to Irish businesses arise from two issues: tax policy and tax administration.  Ms O'Brien will deal with the tax administration issues presently.</p> <p>  Many issues arise on the tax policy side.  Some of these have already been mentioned by Chambers Ireland.  The first is personal tax.  Our high effective personal tax rates continue to be a challenge for employers trying to source the best possible staff in Ireland and abroad.  Obviously, they represent a labour cost.  We have had progress in the recent budget around the threshold for the higher income tax rate and the USC cuts.  However, the fact remains that there is a marginal income tax rate of 52% for some earners in Ireland.  This is among the highest personal tax rates in global terms.</p> <p>  Funding is also an issue for Irish businesses.  Its relevance has been highlighted in the past week in particular given the ECB reports on Irish interest rates to business versus those of other EU countries.  There are also issues with regard to interest rates in our tax administration system, which will be elaborated on further by Ms O'Brien.</p> <p>  Irish small and medium-sized businesses are more reliant on bank finance than those of other EU member states.  They need to diversify into other sources of finance, including equity, a point that has been made by the European Commission and the National Competitiveness Council.  This makes our capital gains tax environment critical.  Yet, at 33%, we have the fourth highest capital gains tax rate in the OECD.  This does not incentvise investment into businesses.</p> <p>  We also need angel investors.  They are important part of the funding story.  Yet, when it comes to Ireland's entrepreneurs relief system these important angel investors are locked out of our regime.  They bring not only money but experience, contacts, expertise and enthusiasm.  The rate of business angel investment in Ireland is low compared to other countries, including the UK, Spain, France, Germany and Sweden.  We are also behind similar economies of a similar size, including Denmark and Finland.  This is to the detriment of building and scaling Irish businesses.  It was a subject on the business news on "Morning Ireland" this morning.</p> <p>  There are also costs associated with policies that do not work.  For example, in our Brexit environment there is recognition across the board that we need more exports.  Yet, measures such as our foreign earnings deduction regime are limited.  The measure is aimed at encouraging businesses to send employees into emerging markets.  However, only 144 claims were made in 2014.  Across the policy regime we are not fully aligned with the needs of the indigenous sector.  We need to look at the blockers and costs involved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-24a.274" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Cora O'Brien" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017102400002#F00300"><p>Tax administration issues arise from burdens and uncertainties in the tax administration system that lead to higher costs for business.  These range from the uncertainty about tax obligations and entitlement to reliefs, such as the research and development tax credit, to Revenue projects, such as PAYE modernisation, and on through to the uncertainty of tax appeals in dispute.  We know there are over 4,300 such cases at this point totalling &euro;1.5 billion.</p> <p>  We need to bring home the importance of the tax administration system in the growth of Irish businesses and their employees.  I will use the research and development tax credit as real example.  Only 1% of small firms and 16% of medium-sized firms consider themselves to be research and development active.  These are low percentages in the context of our national ambitions.  Innovation is key to driving growth.  While Ireland has an attractive research and development tax credit regime administration barriers are weighing heavily on its success in terms of the low take-up among SMEs.</p><p>The institute&rsquo;s research shows that 75% of Irish companies are aware of the research and development tax credit and 20% have availed of it.  However, of those that availed of it, 47% said that the process was difficult to prepare for and administer.  Only 35% of companies surveyed said that they intend to use it in the next 18 months, although this would rise to 62% if there was more clarity around the criteria for qualification.</p><p> In terms of efficiency and the service to Irish business, we need to ensure that Irish businesses are well served by our tax administration system.  Businesses and their advisers deserve to be at the heart of a Revenue customer service model that aims to provide a standard of technical support which is best in class internationally.  To achieve this, we believe that there needs to be an increased focus on the resourcing and delivery of Revenue&rsquo;s technical tax supports, and in particular the current model for the Revenue technical service needs to be reformed.  Businesses, through their advisers, need a timely, efficient and responsive technical service to provide certainty on their tax position when entering into commercial transactions.  Over the budgets of 2015, 2016 and 2017, Revenue hired 226 additional staff with an emphasis on audit and compliance activity.  It is just as important that new resources are targeted at supports and customer services to enable businesses to administer with certainty their tax affairs in a cost-efficient manner in these difficult times.</p><p> Tax is difficult and as well as calculating their own corporation tax businesses are also responsible for calculating and collecting VAT and payroll taxes.  When they get things wrong the cost is very high in terms of both interest and penalties.  Interest charged by the State on underpaid VAT and PAYE is 10% and it is charged at 8% on income tax and corporate tax.  This compares with the 2.75% charged in the UK and with the 4% which the State pays taxpayers who have overpaid.  Interest charged at this level is unfair and urgently needs to be addressed in the Finance Bill 2017.  </p><p> To conclude, given the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead, the greatest cost of all lies in the opportunity lost to Irish businesses should we fail to have a tax policy and tax administration strategies that serve the needs of Irish business.  The impact of this will be felt in terms of their competitiveness, attractiveness, resilience and ability to compete internationally in the export market.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-24a.276" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Neil McDonnell" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017102400002#G00200"><p>I thank the Chair.  ISME thanks the committee for the invitation to address it on the issue of business costs.  We have identified five separate cost lines for business.  I have asked our vice chairperson to voice the actual cost impacts of those areas on a small and medium enterprise, SMEs.  These areas are commercial insurance, labour costs, public service costs, commercial property costs and energy costs.  The one thing which all five of those cost areas have in common is that they are within the gift of members of the committee, as legislators, to control.</p> <p>  Insurance costs are a direct function of how members legislate for the insurance industry, the Courts Service, legal services, and the status of the book of quantum.  I can confirm that ISME will present a draft law on perjury to the Houses of the Oireachtas for their consideration next month. </p> <p>  Ireland is a high-cost economy where citizens and businesses struggle to meet basic costs of living and trading.  That does not mean, however, that we can meet those costs simply by increasing the cost of labour.  As has been said by our colleagues from the Irish Tax Institute, our average hourly rate of pay is just over &euro;30 per hour, placing us in tenth position among our OECD comparators, but we receive much lower levels of social services than those who are paid more than us.  Our income tax is extremely low below an income level of &euro;20,000 a year and extremely progressive above &euro;34,000 per year.  This leads to an unwillingness to get promoted, to work overtime, or to take a job which would breach the income threshold for social housing, which is &euro;35,000 in the cities. </p> <p>  Regarding our public services, they would be tolerable if they gave us, as citizens and businesses, satisfactory outcomes.  The Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Robert Watt, last week criticised the "nonsense, waste and inefficiency" in our public services.  We also have an extremely high gap between public and private sector remuneration, and yet all the pressure for pay increases come from the latter.  This pay gap is no longer sustainable economically, politically or morally.</p><p> Commercial and private property prices are rising to unsustainable levels and constitute a direct threat to employment in small and medium enterprises and inward investment.  All of these costs are heavily influenced by legislation and Government policy.  Upward only rents and commercial rates are within the gift and control of legislators.</p><p> Energy costs are also a function of Government policy.  While the public service obligation, PSO, levy was introduced with the best of intentions, namely, to support green energy generation, the fact that it is linked to wholesale energy prices defeats the very objective it was designed to support because the levy increases as wholesale prices decrease.  As the cost of renewable energy fall for everyone, the PSO levy absorbs savings that are being made by SME users.  This is counterproductive and legislators need to change it.  I ask Ms O'Connor to give some examples of the real world effects of these factors. </p></speech>

I was startled to find that gas charges increased by 15% this year, while our bank charges increased by &euro;500 and the price at the pump to fuel our vans was 4% higher than it was last December.  If we implement a 2.5% wage increase, our wage bill will increase by &euro;100,000.  The current discussion on public sector pay is influencing expectations in the private sector.  Many of our staff do not want to accept a wage increase because the taxation rate is so high and instead want time in lieu.  This a problem because introducing a policy of allowing people to take time off the work would immediately create pressure for the company in terms of trying to operate.</p> <p>  I also found that our building rates increased by 2.6% this year, while the cost of our main liability insurance and motor fleet insurance increased by 7% and 4%, respectively.  This year, as a result of the general data protection regulation, which many small companies in ISME are struggling to grasp, we had to take out a cyber-insurance policy costing &euro;3,670.  I have cited these figures because it is important to get back to basics and recognise the costs of doing business, which is the subject of our discussion.  To support Mr. McDonnell's point, we must be a position to see these costs because they are real.  </p></speech>

This will involve a number of pillars.  We need innovate companies and we need to expand into new markets.  We also need to have talent and the best people to allow us to do this.</p> <p>  Companies also need to have funding.  It was interesting to note the comment by the chairman of the European Union's open innovation and strategy policy group in an interview on "Morning Ireland" this morning that one of the big issues to be addressed across Europe was the scaling of companies.  This requires funding.  One of the important sources of equity, apart from bank funding, that companies need is angel investors.  The relief for entrepreneurs is capped at &euro;1 million and is only available to owner managers.  We have many enthusiastic, highly capable and successful entrepreneurs.  It is part of their DNA and their natural inclination when they make a success of their business to reinvest in other start-ups and bring enthusiasm and experience to these companies.  However, the entrepreneur's relief, which gives people a lower rate of capital gains tax of 10%, locks out angel investors on the basis that they may not be involved full-time in the company.</p> <p>  We did another interesting piece of research which looked at EY entrepreneurs across the world.  It found that a large number of them reinvest in other companies and that other countries, notably the United Kingdom, have a much better system in place.  Perhaps Ms O'Brien will elaborate on that issue because we have a competitiveness issue in terms of Ireland's regime versus the UK regime.</p></speech>

Our entrepreneur's relief is targeted to capital gains tax rates.  If one does not want to have lower capital gains tax on everything, one needs to target a lower rate on business.  That is what the entrepreneur relief is intended to do.  It sounds like a lot at &euro;1 million, but when compares it to other jurisdictions it is not.  Many conditions are attached to it, including ownership, the level of shares and the fact one has to work full-time in the business.  That means we are missing an opportunity to bring in external investors using entrepreneur's pronounce relief.  It is only available to the owner-manager of the business.  We have to ask ourselves why we are restricting the types of investors we could have.</p></speech>

It is an issue I raised occasionally with the Department and Minister.  There does not seem to be any willingness to have a wider discussion on the issue.  I know we do not discuss policy here.  Could we have some numbers on that?</p> <p>  Ms Buckley or Ms O'Brien stated there are about 4,000 tax appeals in the system.  What is the average waiting time for a person to have his or her appeal heard?  The quantum of money cited is quite significant, given that it is in excess of &euro;1 billion.</p> <p>  The under-resourcing of the technical service part of the customer service remit within revenue was mentioned.  How long are revenue clients waiting for a determination if they submit a query on the tax treatment or tax status of a potential transaction or contract?  It is obvious that if it is too long it will dampen competitiveness and stall decision-making.  Could the witnesses revisit the numbers they quoted on the insurance rates applied for late payment in Ireland compared to other jurisdictions within the UK?</p></speech>

Ms O'Brien will deal with tax administration.</p> <p>  It is very difficult to get numbers in terms of businesses lost the UK, although we hear constant feedback because capital and talent are mobile.  It is very easy for both to move out of the country.  The Institute for Fiscal Studies, IFS, did a report and, I understand, made a submission to the Department of Finance in the lead-up to the budget.  It examined the entrepreneurs relief rating in the UK and Ireland.  I understand the report received some coverage in the media.  It warned that Ireland risked being at a competitive disadvantage given the attractiveness of the UK regime.  In terms of a London think tank saying Ireland is at a disadvantage, its observations are indicative. </p> <p>  We have examined other countries' patterns of progress.  Sweden is jumping up the rankings in the latest OECD report in terms of its performance.  Funding, venture capital and investment are very successful areas for it.  Stockholm is a very successful city and is the same size as Dublin, yet it finds itself in the upper ranking of entrepreneurship, unicorn companies and high growth and high performance.  We need to examine countries like that.</p> <p>  Mr. Martin Curley, the head of the EU open innovation and strategy policy group, was on "Morning Ireland" today.  He talked about how Israel is the most innovative country and its success in scale-ups.  We have examined it in terms of its introduction of funding, concentration on venture capital and entrepreneurship.</p><p>We have learned that a deliberate policy intention and implementation that is pro entrepreneurial has been effective in the likes of Israel, London and Stockholm.  Perhaps that is a lesson we can consider in Ireland.</p></speech>

We look at the UK regime where interest is pegged.  I refer to instances where somebody has underpaid his or her tax.  He or she might be in tax arrears, made a mistake or are involved in a settlement with Revenue but he or she has not paid his or her tax on time.  The penalties are parked.  In the UK penalties are charged for careless mistakes or deliberate error.  The penalties imposed are for a fixed amount and are almost like a fine.  The interest is really a charge for the fact that one has not paid the money on time.  In the UK the interest rate is pegged to the base interest rate of the Bank of England.  I think the rate is half a per cent above what pertains in the UK and I can confirm that aspect later.  The end effect for the UK taxpayer is that he or she pays 2.75% as the cost of not having paid his or her tax on time.  It does not matter whether it is VAT, payroll taxes or income tax because all of them are treated the same.</p> <p>  In Ireland, an interest rate of 10% is charged for the fiduciary taxes of VAT and payroll and 8% is charged for other direct taxes.  Every year for the past seven or eight years the Irish Tax Institute has asked for this matter to be considered because we do not think it is fair on taxpayers.  Yes, they should have to pay interest if they have underpaid their tax but not at such a high rate.  We think the interest rates applied are penal rates and taxpayers must pay penalties on top of that. </p></speech>

In fact, Revenue is a world leader and best in class when it comes to e-services.  The Revenue Online Service, ROS, is excellent, as is online filing.  We also have electronic Revenue Contracts Tax, RCT, and electronic registration.  All of the systems work very well and are great for businesses generally because they cut down on the time one has to file.</p> <p>  The problem is that we have gone so far down the electronic route that simply technical queries cannot be answered.  Let us say one wants to change one's tax credit.  Now, if one telephones the 1890 number one will basically be put into an email service called MyEnquiries and advised to send an email.  One will probably have waited 20 minutes for someone to answer one's phone call but then one will be told that the query cannot be answered over the phone and it must be put in writing and emailed to us.  Unfortunately, it could take three to five weeks for Revenue to reply to the email.  Our members have told us that often times Revenue, when it does reply, wants more information.  That situation does not just apply to the Revenue service in Ireland.  There has been a move to electronic services generally for tax administrations in the UK and US.  We have reached a situation where people cannot speak to a human being by phone to discuss in order to resolve an issue.  </p> <p>  We feel that with all of the challenges such as Brexit, which Ms Buckley mentioned, and all of the costs that businesses have to cope with, we need to assess the present service.  Revenue is a great enforcer and collector of taxes, which is important.  However, money and resources must be set aside to help businesses at the critical stages of starting in business and starting to export.  The UK has dedicated people to work in certain areas.  When UK businesses start exporting they get a person for six months purely to help them with their tax obligations and ensure filing is done right.  Ireland needs to do human things like that to help businesses with their technical services.  Tax uncertainly only ends up costing businesses and the State because it leads to audits and settlements.</p></speech>

A response could be a letter saying, "We hear what you say, give us more information", or it could be someone answering the phone but not giving one the information that one needs.  In the UK, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, HMRC, has looked at this issue.  In its annual report, it said that it wanted to be a leading customer service provider and that it was not good enough to just measure how long it takes people to answer the phone or how long it takes to send a letter; what matters is measuring how long it takes the customer to get the answer that he or she needs.  We need less quantitative statistics because they often do not give one the full picture and more real and valuable information about whether taxpayers are getting the service to which they are entitled.  </p></speech>

We reckon that it will take approximately ten years, with current resources, to clear what is on hand at the minute.  A detailed consultation was published a few weeks ago to which we made a submission.  There are 2,000 small businesses and taxpayers with appeals on tax amounts of less than &euro;10,000.  In other words, half of all appeals are for less than &euro;10,000.  Those people are in the system.  Our members have examples of appeals going back ten years that have not yet been heard.  There are delays in getting the appeals heard, in getting one's day in front of the appeal commissioner but now we are also finding, with so many appeals in the system, that once the appeal has been heard there are delays of up to 18 months in getting a determination or a decision on that appeal.  It is a very expensive process and people in this system who may end up losing their cases are having to pay really high rates of interest, of between 8% and 10%, through no fault of their own because of the appeals process over which they have no control.  All of these issues are tied together - long waits on appeals, high interest rates and people struggling to deal with the electronic part of Revenue's service.  It all ties in together and needs to be looked at again.</p></speech>

We have suggested that there should be a separate process for smaller amounts.  We have asked that consideration be given to a small claims court type system for small cases.  That would take half of the appeals out of the system.  Alternatively, we have suggested the introduction of mediation processes which operate successfully in other countries.  Such processes would mean that cases would not have to go into the appeal system but could be dealt with through mediation.  Something needs to be done to unlock the system.  Potentially, the State will not win all of the cases in the appeal system but there is &euro;1.5 billion worth of tax is in dispute, waiting to be heard.</p></speech>

I wish to pick up on comments from Chambers Ireland and ISME on the minimum wage.  Following the budget, I did not hear any commentary on or criticism of the fact that the Minister increased the training levy element of employers' wage costs.  Maybe something was said and I missed it.  However, given the witnesses' comments and concerns about the low-pay commission's recent awards on the minimum wage, the response seems very different.  Have the witnesses any hard numbers or data on knock-on pay claims being experienced by their members or member industries following the recent increases in the minimum wage?  As I understand it, there are approximately 80,000 people on the minimum wage.  While that is a big number, it is a small percentage of the overall labour force.</p><p>I find it difficult to accept how the paltry increase in the minimum wage was such a big issue for the witnesses.  Can the witnesses explain that to me?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-24a.300" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Neil McDonnell" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017102400002#M00200"><p>I will start on the national training fund and the PRSI levy.  We are the first to say that our sector needs a lot of resources to be diverted into training because that is what all the economists are telling us about our sector.  The SME sector in general, and this is not a criticism but an observation, is not a productive sector in comparison to foreign multinationals.  The only way we are going to get there is through training and investment in people.  However, and we pointed this out in our pre-budget submission, while we acknowledge that money needs to be spent on training, if one looks in the break-out in the budget about where the training moneys have gone, they have gone substantially towards the tertiary, the university sector and not towards on-the-job or employment training.  That is not what people like those in ESRI are telling us.  In fact, ESRI is telling us that there is a substantial degree of overtraining and overeducation in a lot of employment sectors.<br/><br/>A second concern about this is the cost one.  Again, these are not out figures.  The National Competitiveness Council says that up to 86% of the cost for a small business, especially in service businesses like Codex, can be manpower.  Therefore, a small change in employers' PRSI in a business that has a large labour cost is disproportionately penal on that small business than it would be on Google or Intel.  Lastly on the levy, and we would drew the committee's attention to it in our pre-budget submission, in 1979 employers were asked for an extra 0.5%<b></b>in employers' PRSI to cover an insurance fund for redundancies.  That levy has been in place ever since, and in 2012 we abolished the statutory redundancy rebate.  That fund was in so much surplus from its inception in 1979 that the then Minister in 2002, Mary Coughlan, wrote a cheque from the Department of Social Protection to the Exchequer for &euro;635 million.  That is how much that insurance fund against redundancies was in credit at that point.  Then, of course, we hit a massive wave of unemployment in the crash and then we took away that rebate from employers.  The net effect of that is to make employers far more reluctant, even when the economy is in on the turn, to recruit people.  Therefore, one needs to think of the unintended consequences of what one does when one takes away something the employer was paying for all along.<br/><br/>The message on the national training fund is, by all means take money out of PRSI for training, but by God we better see it in training.  If we do not, then we want it back in PRSI.  <br/><br/>I refer to the national minimum wage.  The trade union sector has already queried why some employments are reducing their hours of labour as a result of the increase in the national minimum wage.  We said all along that, if in those strained sectors or those sectors paying at or close to the national minimum wage, the payroll cost cannot be recovered from the customer, it will be recovered from the employee.  It does not matter what the Houses of the Oireachtas say is the national hourly rate of pay.  If the employer cannot pay that in what we would call P60, then the P60 will fall.  We told the committee it would happen and it is obviously is happening in some areas now.</p></speech>

However, we said at the time that it was really important that we had transparency on where the training moneys are being spent and that we need to rebalance the money Mr. McDonnell referred to, that is, the money that the then Minister, Mary Coughlan, took from funding that was going into training people in employment and put it into the very necessary training for people in unemployment.</p><p>With unemployment down to 6.1% or whatever, and expected to continue to decline, we need to rebalance the amount that is being spent on the unemployed and to spend more money on training for people in employment in small business and, going back to the point Ms Buckley made, giving businesses the opportunity to obtain the skills to scale up.  If we do not train people better, they are not going to be able to scale up.  When it was announced in the budget that the levy was going to be increased by 0.1% over three years, we made the point that if we need money to be spent on infrastructure, for example, it has to come from somewhere.  However, we reiterated the point that we need to know how that money is being spent and the transparency around it.  Our focus is on rebalancing the money we are spending on training and making sure that we give businesses the opportunity to scale up.</p><p> On the minimum wage, the point I made in my report was more about the process followed this year than a comment on the increase itself.  This year, somewhat out of the blue, the Minister made an announcement that the Low Pay Commission had reported and that he was increasing the minimum wage.  Even when the press release came out, the link to the report itself did not go active for a couple of hours.  The increase was announced even before the report was produced.  What we suggested was that we would rather see a process whereby the report could come out and that there would be some opportunity for debate or setting expectations around it.  The reason we are here, and I think we all have the same objective, is that we really want to see a situation where the fruits of economic recovery and employment growth need to be seen in improved standards of living and not being just soaked up by escalating costs, whether they are within Government control or otherwise.  We need to see people seeing increases that they can spend as disposal income rather than just, of necessity, paying bills, whether rent or whatever it might be.</p></speech>

What we are now starting to hear is the concern from business coming through, particularly going into 2018.  We are at the point now where businesses are making their budgets for 2018.  Their concern is that they are going to sit down with their members of staff who are going to say that they expect a big increase in 2018.  It has not actually come through but businesses are very concerned it is coming through.  It is being fed by several things.  It is being fed by the housing crisis, the increase in rents and so on and by the perception of increases being passed through in public sector jobs.  People are looking at the percentages and are saying they should get that and that we have all had five, six or seven tough years, so it is their turn.  It is back to the point about trying to make sure that the fruits of our recovery go into improvements in disposable income rather than being soaked up in costs, or people even falling back even though they are getting salary increases.</p></speech>

Does inflation ever come into the equation in the debate because ten years ago it was all about inflation?  I know our economy could not compete in 2007 and 2008 and that was one of the reasons we took such a hard bang.  I understand that.  However, I know when I was working in recruitment and people were going for salary increases, it was always because of inflation.  Is inflation off the table because it is so low or is that ever referred to?</p></speech>

That is coming through primarily in labour costs, but also in people's commute time.  We are back to where we were ten or 12 years ago where in order to get accommodation that is affordable, people are having to live further away from their job.  The crisis in the infrastructure, public transport availability and reliability and so on all become issues to people's quality of life.  It has an impact.  If people are arriving at work and they are tired and weary from their journey and are stressed out because of their finances, they are not going to be as productive when they get to their job.</p></speech>

The point I am making relates to inequality.  I have a concern because there seems to be this general theme, particularly with ISME, that the real challenge is to stop workers from getting pay increases.  The witnesses have been very clear on the minimum wage and yet we know from the CSO figures that one in three workers in this country in this country is on less than &euro;400 a week.  We know that in terms of inequality we have a huge gap between low paid workers and CEOs.  We know that the living wage is currently &euro;11.70 and yet the witnesses are objecting to the minimum wage going up to &euro;9.55.  That means workers do not have enough to live but the witnesses are saying it is still too much.  How do the witnesses justify that?</p></speech>

The Senator must show me the courtesy of allowing me to answer the question.  What we have said is that one can set a minimum rate of pay at whatever level one wishes.</p><p>However, the members, as legislators, must then accept the effect that will have on the levels of employment in the economy.  That is the first message.</p><p> The second message, and the point we constantly make, is if one gives someone &euro;1 in income that does not translate directly into &euro;1 of earned wealth whereas if one reduces a person's cost of living by &euro;1, that translates directly into &euro;1 increase in wealth.  To go back to the point that Mr. Talbot has made, and this is why it is so important, we are listening to a narrative that says we can close this unaffordable gap.  The housing part of the consumer price index is 7%, 8% or 9% of the total CPI.  However, that does not matter to a person who is working in a warehouse in Blanchardstown and who is being asked to pay &euro;1,500 or &euro;2,000 a month in rent for a small apartment.  It is irrelevant what the metric is.  The point we are making is that unless the cost of living is materially and meaningfully tackled, and we can increase the national minimum wage to higher than that in Luxembourg - we are already second highest to Luxembourg - it does not matter.  Unless people can afford to live on what small businesses can afford to pay, it does not matter what the national minimum wage is set at.</p></speech>

We have touched on increasing living standards, which Mr. Talbot mentioned earlier, and the quality and the calibre of jobs.  It is something Senator Gavan is touching on in terms of people's pay.  We need to see how we expand and create jobs in this country that have a higher level of salary for people.  That is where everybody wants to get to.  The Irish Tax Institute is doing a lot of research in this area in terms of looking at Irish business and where the opportunities are for Ireland because that is the best starting point.  The services area globally is the greatest area of growth.  It is outpacing manufacturing and industry.  In fact, the growth rate globally in services is 10% per annum, which is huge.  One of the greatest areas of opportunity for this country, as we are becoming more of a service economy than a manufacturing one, is in information and computer services, or anything in ICT and communications.  A recent OECD report, looking at the gazelle companies which are high growth, high speed, high revenue companies across the OECD, tells us that computer programming, information services and the whole area of ICT is where success is and where we should be focussed.</p> <p>  The Boston Consulting Group did a report a year ago looking at the digital economy.  It listed Ireland as one of the top nine front-runner countries in terms of digitised capability and where the greatest opportunity for us as a country is.  We know, however, that we have a digital skills shortage in terms of younger and older people.  We know we have a digital skills shortage in terms of talent in the country.  Across Europe, 40% of companies are looking for the same people and yet they cannot get them qualified in ICT.</p> <p>  I refer to where we, as policy-makers, can make a real difference in terms of our legislation.  In our area, we are looking at tax policy, in particular, personal tax rates, and at the burden on business.  What is the strategy for us as a country so that we can create the kind of jobs, we grab the opportunity that is there globally and we can give our people higher paid jobs?  That is where one can make a real difference, that is, when it is possible to say to somebody that the growth is in services and that there are global opportunities.</p> <p>  Our SMEs are not as e-commerce focused as they should be.  Some of them are not online.  There are perhaps broadband issues, but there are a multitude of issues. Where is the opportunity for Ireland?  How can we, as policy-makers, get our strategy right so that we can give our people and companies the best chance and that an employer can increase a person's salary from &euro;27,000 to &euro;35,000 and upwards?  We need to be able to grab the opportunities.  We need to be searching in the right space if we are going to make a difference to people.</p><p>I thank the members very much for their comments. </p></speech>

Entrepreneurs are risk takers and job creators.  In the worst of the recession, most entrepreneurs were struggling to pay themselves any sort of living wage.  That was in the worst of times.  They had to get on with meeting other obligations: taxation, interest, paying their staff the best they could, dealing with redundancies and everything else.  They are stressed out, they are anxious, but they are risk takers and they are doing their thing.  If they are successful, we charge them an extra 3% taxation.  If they are not as successful, if their latest operation does not work out, a safety net is not there in the same way as it is in other jobs.  We restrict their allowances.  Entrepreneurs are out there doing their thing for the economy and they get better recognition in other countries than they do in this country.  Most of the businesses we talk to are struggling to survive.  We started this conversation, as Mr. McDonnell pointed out, talking about a handful of people on high salaries but we are here to talk about the cost of doing business for the almost 2.1 million people employed in this country, not a handful of people at the top.  That is where our submissions and our synopsis come from.</p></speech>

I am sorry to hear that.</p> <p>  I despair that any time someone raises the issue of inequality to employer representative bodies, or points out the gap between the minimum wage and a living wage, the issue is never addressed.  I will take up one issue Mr. Talbot mentioned regarding the cost of living.  I agree with him that the cost of living is a massive issue.  The issue of housing was mentioned.  The only way that we can fix that is by a greater investment by the Government.  Yet at the same time, the witnesses are saying we need to decrease taxes for business.  Well, we cannot have it both ways.  If we are going to address the housing crisis properly and have the long-term investment that has not been happening in housing, then that will cost taxpayers' money.  To be honest, the witnesses are saying on the one hand things are really hard and we need to reduce taxes and they are also saying the Government must do more to address the cost of living.  How does one marry those?</p></speech>

High taxes do not equal high yield from tax.  That is an important point.  Things like high capital gains tax do not give the country more tax.  A tax rate that is too high discourages activity.  It means entrepreneurs are not doing the types of things they should be doing because they are facing these high taxes.  As a result, our capital gains tax yield has actually halved from what it was in 2008, even though the rates have increased from 20% to 33%.  There is a difference between high tax yields for the State in order to pay for services and setting rates of tax too high so that they do not match economic policy.  Tax policy should follow what economic policy is trying to achieve.  It is a double-edged thing.  We have social needs and money we need for housing and infrastructure.  However, we are a certain type of economy.  In order to raise the amount of tax that we need to pay for all of these services, we have to work within the bounds of being a small open economy.  We need a tax policy that will generate the most euro for those spending needs, given the constraints that we have as a small open economy.  One should follow the other.</p></speech>

We just want to see it spent better.  It is not about training management, but about training resources through the entire network of companies and bringing the next wave of entrepreneurs through.

However, our pre-budget submission called for a figure of 4% of gross national income, GNI.  We were not rashly saying 4% of gross domestic product, GDP.  We said 4% of GNI needs to go on infrastructure and then legislators have to decide how to redistribute the rest of the pie, and this is the difficulty and why I am sorry to have to say to the Senator "right back at you".  We have over-prioritised current spending at the expense of capital spending and all that is doing is beggaring our children with increased national debt.  Our national debt still went up after the budget.</p></speech>

I missed the start unfortunately, but I read their briefs before coming in.  I would like to go back to the minimum wage for a minute if the committee does not mind.  We discussed it at length in previous sessions in the context of banded hours contracts, and we spoke to the witnesses about that.  I was concerned about the comment made by Mr. McDonnell that it does not matter what wage people are paid.  It really does matter to people because many people - Deputy Collins referred to 80,000 - are on the minimum wage.  That is a problem we have.  We are talking about taxes and tax cuts, and Mr. McDonnell said it does not matter what one pays.  The costs of housing and transport need to be addressed, and I agree with him 100% on that.  The State, for example, pays almost &euro;500 million a year on the family income supplement.  Some 57,000 people are accessing the family income supplement and that is because of the low minimum wage we have.  Mr. McDonnell disagrees with that, saying it is the second highest in, but obviously costs here are higher and they need to be addressed.  If that &euro;500 million was put into infrastructure, it would improve transport, allowing people to get to work more cheaply.  It could provide houses and the rents would go down.  As Senator Gavan said, we need a massive housing investment to deliver these houses.  Then the pressure might come off wages, but we are where we are, and I believe the minimum wage needs to be increased more quickly.  We need to get to the living wage, but we also need to address housing and transport.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-24a.354" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Neil McDonnell" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017102400002#R00400"><p>Funnily enough, I do not think there is a huge difference between us.  There is a philosophical difference on how one bridges the gap.  Let me explain it this way.  Funnily enough, when unemployment hit its highest level in 2011 or 2012, the Gini index of inequality was at its best for Ireland.  In other words, what it was saying was that in terms of social supports in Ireland, the safety net was good enough that, although 300,000 people lost their jobs, the safety net picked everyone up, and as a result inequality decreased.  I was not in this organisation when I made the comment, but I said that it follows that when unemployment starts to fall off again and we come out of recession, the Gini index is unfortunately going to go the wrong way.  As more people go above the safety net, by definition perceived inequality decreases.</p> <p>  I have met with the Vincentians and debated with them about what constitutes a living wage.  One serious issue I have with the calculation of it is that it is done on the basis of a 39-hour week.  I would be much more comfortable with the expression of the living wage as a gross weekly wage rather than as an hourly rate, because one could capture the increase in the hourly living wage this year by working two hours more.  That means working 41 hours instead of working 39.  That is just a fact.</p> <p>  In the long-term, however, the only way we are going to bridge some of these gaps without being perpetually in disagreement is by breaking down some of the walls between the social support systems and the revenue system.  I can the Deputy that people in Dublin are refusing jobs as distribution drivers because they do not want to earn more than &euro;35,000 a year.  If they do, they will come off the social housing list.  That is a fact.  There are people who are insisting on remaining on jobseeker's allowance in order to do that.  Again, it is over to the members.</p></speech>

However, they are not on the minimum wage or close to it.</p></speech>

That is the backdrop to what we are talking about.  If anything, we are talking about growing pains here.  These are growing economy pains, as opposed to what we were used to in previous years.  I understand we are trying not to repeat the mistakes of the past in relation to competitiveness, and we want to try and spread it as equally as we can.  Nobody predicted that it would be this fast, and because it has been we are now seeing parts of the economy outgrow the infrastructure and the infrastructure is trying to catch up.  That is the backdrop to this.</p></speech>

I thank all of our guests.  The main reason I decided to invite the Irish Tax Institute here was because we do not always hear from that point of view.  I wanted to see, while we are discussing the cost of doing business, if there are any tax savings out there for small and medium enterprises and entrepreneurs which might not be obvious.  Very significantly, the witnesses have addressed people who are in tax arrears and pay a huge interest rate.  I think that is certainly something the committee could address.  Is there anything further the witnesses would like to add?</p></speech>

Our tax base is extremely broad, which means that there are very few reliefs for businesses.  There used to be more.  The biggest one is probably the research and development tax credit for businesses trying to innovate, which is so important.  Then there are reliefs for investment, like the employment investment incentive.  To be honest, the most helpful thing that we could get concerning those reliefs, and the tax system in general, is better certainty for business through tax administration.  That is what we hear continually.  On a related point about tax certainty, it is not just about administration, but also certainty of legislation.  We have asked a number of times and have had really good improvements in consultation on tax policy over the past five to ten years.  However, we need consultation on tax legislation.  We have a new share options regime, a really welcome development which has come out in the Finance Bill 2017.  When big changes like that are announced, we would like to see that legislation put out for businesses and tax advisers to look at in draft, to see if it is going to work for them and if there are issues with it.  We are in a process now, between the publication of the Finance Bill 2017 and Committee Stage, where we have a raft of small issues with the legislation.  We need certainty for taxpayers through getting to see legislation in draft, and through more supports from Revenue for businesses, because that is really where it is hitting the road at the minute.</p></speech>

I have given members a submission and I intend to go through its highlights.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions is an advocacy group for workers with 800,000 members on both sides of the Border, so some of the things I say will not surprise members in being diametrically opposed to what they heard before.  In some areas, however, I will identify areas of agreement between us and the previous speakers.<br/><br/>When examining the cost of doing business, the cost of labour is defined by EURSTAT as the total expenditure borne by employers for the purpose of employing staff.  It includes employee compensation, wages, salaries in cash and in kind, employers' social security and other expenditure such as recruitment costs, minus any subsidies received.  While some will argue that workers in Ireland enjoy relatively high hourly earnings, in reality the cost associated with employing staff in Ireland is about average by EU standards, and relatively low compared to small open-economy competitors such as Belgium and Austria.  This is because employer social contributions, as a component of total labour costs, are significantly lower in Ireland.  A recent research paper by the Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI, identifies the total average hourly labours costs in Ireland in 2015 as &euro;28.70 in the business economy.  This compares with a cost of &euro;29 in the UK and &euro;29.50 in the eurozone.  International comparisons of statutory minimum wage levels that do not take into account differences in employer social insurance are misleading.<br/><br/>A further consideration in any analysis of labour costs is productivity.  Productivity is what the employer gets for his or her &euro;28.70 an hour.  The National Competitiveness Council's scorecard for 2017 notes that Irish labour productivity performance is strong in an international context.  Irish labour productivity growth has been above that in competitor countries since 2013, and was 2.3% in 2016.  The productivity of Irish workers allows Irish companies to be competitive.  In the short term, the cost of employing labour is more than offset by the productivity of the labour involved.<br/><br/>Previous speakers raised the issue of executive pay.  We raised this issue last year in a report called Because We're Worth It.<i></i>We pointed out what we know in terms of executive pay for chief executives of public limited companies, plcs.  We also made the point in the report that this is only the tip of the iceberg because there is a large number of private companies whose executive remuneration is a secret.  The disquiet about the inequality levels of executive pay is developing quite significantly in the UK at the moment, and will trickle through to Ireland through the application of most of the UK Code of Corporate Governance.  The <i>Financial Times</i>has a city panel and in yesterday's newspaper, one of the contributors, who was described as a city grandee, made a point that was reflected by previous speakers in another way.  He said that the premium that is attached to entrepreneurship risks is being paid to managers, who are mere employees.  That is the point that is being made in our work on executive pay.<br/><br/>Another issue is the cost of housing people.  Escalating rents must feed through into wage demands.  Both the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and NERI have produced comprehensive proposals aimed at tackling the cost and supply of housing and the cost of rent.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions will continue to make the case for greater state investment in public housing.  A couple of weeks ago, Members of this House and the other House paid tribute to the late Taoiseach, Liam Cosgrave.  One of the <i>leitmotifs</i>that came up was that he was a conservative and cautious man.  This was quite correct.  What is often forgotten is that in his term as Taoiseach 100,000 local authority houses were built.  That is under a Taoiseach who is described as conservative, and under a Minister for Finance, Richie Ryan, who was a fiscal hawk.  There are learning points from that.<br/><br/>The exceptionally high cost, by international standards, of renting office accommodation Dublin, noted by the NCC, does not reflect higher than average costs of labour and materials in the construction industry, but rather the acute shortage of suitable sites and the escalating cost of development land.</p><p>It is vital that such costs are controlled.  In order to control these costs, more investment is required to provide for balanced regional development, along with improved transport and communication links.  Last week I attended a public meeting addressed by the European Commissioner for Transport - her name eludes me.  She is a very impressive lady and she said that the Commission has a problem at the moment, that it is not getting sufficient quality projects from Ireland.  In other words, for public transport projects such as a heavy rail link to the airport which is required by 2030 under an EU Directive, or the DART underground in its slimmed-down format, there is very cheap European Investment Bank, EIB, money available.  Evidently, however, for whatever reason we are not putting forward the proposals.<br/><br/>I noted that Mr. Ian Talbot mentioned child care.  We produced a report last year called, Who Cares: Report on Childcare Costs &amp;amp; Practices.  This does two things.  It takes money out of people's pockets after they count their earnings at the end of the month, and it also pushes second earners, mainly women, out of the labour market.  There is a body of research done by EUROMOD, a European institute on tax and benefits, where graph number one shows support to second earners across member states.  Ireland comes first, top of the pack, in terms of supports.  Graph number two is support for second earners, taking account of child care costs, and Ireland moves from number one to number 28.  We could hear that echoed in Chambers Ireland's statement, the need to tackle child care costs. <br/><br/>There is a number of other aspects to doing business.  Energy costs were mentioned.  We are into a great era of uncertainty there for a number of reasons.  In the context of Brexit, about 82% of our natural gas comes down a pipe from western Scotland, so that is a huge area of uncertainty.  Second, we are going to have to decrease our reliance on fossil fuels or face enormous fines, so investment in alternative energy will be needed.<br/><br/>There is also the cost of getting credit for SMEs.  The re-establishment of the Industrial Credit Corporation is basically what we would be suggesting.<br/><br/>Business representative groups frequently complain about the variation in commercial rates among various local authorities.  We believe that commercial rates are an important and essential source of funding for local public services, however we would welcome a more predictable and more transparent system.<br/><br/>Another area where costs are outlined is legal costs.  We strongly endorse a more comprehensive and transparent information database on legal service prices.  The provisions of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 should be speedily implemented and the resources of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority increased as recommended by the National Competitiveness Council, NCC.  It seems strange to us, who represent people who got the full brunt of the troika in many areas, that the legal services profession seems to have gotten off very lightly from implementation of troika representations, for whatever reasons, on which we will not speculate.<br/><br/>We are strongly of the view that public capital investment levels should be substantially increased.  Infrastructure improvements, for example improved public transport systems and road networks, will reduce the cost of doing business and the cost of commuting.  It is not often that I quote an employer, but Mr. Ian Talbot rightly makes the case about what use to an employer are workers coming in wrecked after a commute of an hour and a half.  That is a very valid point and that is within the resolution of the Government.  In most international competitiveness indices, Ireland tends to perform poorly in infrastructure, notably in broadband.  If we are to get some sort of regional balance and correct the regional imbalances, which would in turn make life more tolerable for those of us who live in Dublin, we need to up our game in terms of broadband.<br/><br/>Finally, enterprise policy should focus not just on labour costs <i>per se, </i>but on unit labour costs.  To this end we must consider how productivity and quality of work can be raised in private or public enterprises.  The Nordic model, which originates in Norway, Denmark and Sweden, has succeeded in generating high levels of employment, high wages and high levels of life satisfaction.  These countries also measure extremely well in international competitiveness outcomes.  How do they achieve these outcomes?</p><p>The Nordic model is based on a high-quality social wage in the form of health, education, lifelong training and upskilling, social housing and child care, all of which are hugely important to national competitiveness and sustainable job creation.  It is the view of congress that the Nordic model is one that Irish economic and social policy should be seeking to emulate.  Go raibh maith agaibh. </p></speech>

I have to go to another meeting, so I thank my colleagues for letting me speak first.  It has been an excellent presentation in terms of its breadth, the issues it covers and as a counterbalance to some of the other information that we have had.  I mean no disrespect to that information.</p><p>We seem to have emphasised the issue of labour costs.  The witnesses' figures on labour costs suggest a different picture.  I see here the figures suggest a total average hourly labour cost of &euro;28.70, as opposed to a figure of &euro;29.00 in the UK, and some &euro;29.50 in the eurozone.  Could the witnesses talk about the social insurance employer costs?  It was mentioned that there is a differential operating here<i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>most of Europe.</p></speech>

The first thing to note is that we now have 2016 data as well with which I am happy to update the committee.  According to EUROSTAT, total average hourly labour costs, for industry, construction and services, that is, traded sectors, which excludes public administration, defence and so on, is &euro;30.40 in 2016.  The euro area average is a figure of &euro;29.80, so we are broadly on a par.  It is interesting to note that the most expensive countries by labour cost are Norway, at more than &euro;50.00; Denmark, at &euro;42.00; Belgium, at &euro;39.00; Sweden, at &euro;36.60 and so on down.  It turns out that there is a correlation between the countries with the highest employment rates and the countries with the highest labour costs.  Let me read out a few numbers, and then I will talk about the employer pay related social insurance, PRSI.</p> <p>  The country with the highest employment rate in Europe is Iceland.  For people aged 20 to 64 it is 87.8%, an astonishingly high number.  This is followed by Switzerland at 82% employment, but then we start getting to the Nordic countries.  Sweden is at 81.2% employment and Norway is at 78.6%.  Germany is also at 78.6%.  Denmark is at 77.4%, and so on.  Ireland is at 70.3%, and this is in the context of people talking about overheating.  We still have a way to go, but to get from our 70% to a figure of 80% implies adding an extra job for every seven jobs we have at the moment.  That is in the region of a quarter of a million jobs. </p> <p>  Ireland is failing in terms of its labour market policy.  It is not failing because of high labour costs, because we can see that the most successful countries, in terms of employment rates, are actually the high-cost ones.  Labour costs differentiate from wages because of employer PRSI and other employee compensation.</p> <p>  Tax was discussed earlier.  Labour taxation in Ireland in a strict sense is about average in European terms.  However, on a ranking by labour taxation which includes social security contributions Ireland is very low.  In particular, 60% of the difference between Ireland and the average high-income Western European country, of which there are ten with a GDP per capita over &euro;30,000, is explained by employer PRSI alone.   In Ireland, we have low levels of employer PRSI, and indeed PRSI across the board, and that means that Irish labour costs are that much lower than they would be in Nordic countries, for example.  It also means that the social wage is that much lower.  The benefits that workers receive are not the same.  People will talk about labour costs and employer PRSI, but the question then is whether it is desirable to move towards the Nordic-type model.  We find that across the board, in terms of inequality, poverty and deprivation, employment, gender wage gaps and female labour force participation, those countries tend to do much better than Ireland. </p> <p>   Everyone talks about child care.  It is true, child care is a huge barrier in Ireland to second earners and lone parents, who are primarily women.</p><p>However, it is also the case that there is a large safety net in the Nordic countries that enables people to move in and out of the labour force, to go back to education and so on.  It is a different model.  It would be expensive to do, and it is certainly not something that one could do overnight, but it strikes me as something that would be attractive over the medium term.  We know that in the future, because of automation and an economy that is increasingly speeding up, with more and more jobs becoming obsolete, it becomes more important for people to be able to step out of the workforce, to go back to education and to retrain in new things.  That strikes me as a better model in the long term.  I do not know if that answers the question.</p></speech>

I have two other follow-up questions, and I will be brief.  It is important we hear about a social wage.  We have only ever had conservative government in this country, so the social democratic concept of a social wage perhaps might not be as familiar as it should be.  Could Dr. McDonnell tell us about what it means, and why it is so beneficial to a modern economy?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-24a.373" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tom McDonnell" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017102400002#X00300"><p>It is important for a number of reasons.  Ireland has developed in a very different way.  Education spending was originally through the church and the same applied to health.  In the northern European countries, however, a pact was reached between what might be called social democratic or even socialist parties and Christian democratic parties on the other side.  To offset revolution, as had been seen in the Soviet Union, for example, a welfare state was built up.  They had built up a welfare state decades before we did.  Part of that was an insurance model like the National Health Service in the UK, for example, but it also included pension benefits and so on.</p> <p>  There are drawbacks with the social insurance model, of course.  For example, the original social insurance model was very much based upon the male breadwinner, and often the benefits did not necessarily go to the spouse, or to women or whoever it might have been.  Broadly speaking, the way it works is that all the money is collected, it is put into a pot, and then workers gain benefits in terms of health care, pensions, unemployment benefits and so on, which insulate them.  It is effectively an insurance mechanism for when things go wrong.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-24a.375" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tom McDonnell" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017102400002#X00500"><p>It is partially related to that.  If we had a strong social insurance system whereby all workers and their employers were paying in, it would allow us to have a more robust system of pension payments for former workers.  Part of the problem in the Irish case, of course, is that many women have a very spotty employment history, often because women are the ones who engage in child care.  They often leave the workplace for a number of periods of time, and that means that their contributions are not sufficient.</p></speech>

Could Dr. McDonnell speak about productivity levels?  It is important to clarify how well Irish workers and Irish companies are doing in comparison to our EU competitors.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-24a.382" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tom McDonnell" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017102400002#X01200"><p>I can answer that directly.  Broadly speaking, productivity growth in the West has been between 1% and 1.5% since World War II.  It has deteriorated in the last ten to 20 years, however, because of the changing composition of the economy.  Ireland's productivity growth was higher than other countries in the West up to about 2007 and 2008.  There was a major catch-up effect associated with that.  As the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, says, there is now marginal scope for productivity catch-up, although it says there is some scope for higher labour resource utilisation, which I discussed earlier.  What we have seen in the last couple of years is that, allegedly, Irish productivity has exploded.  However, it has exploded in regard to the onshoring of intellectual capital.</p><p>That means that when one looks at unit labour costs in Ireland, they have come down dramatically across the economy <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>other European states.  However, it is a chimera, essentially, and unfortunately the headline unit labour cost statistics are now broken in Ireland.  What I can say, however, is that the labour cost index has only increased by 3.1% in Ireland since 2012, and has increased by about 20% in Germany and the Netherlands.  Ireland is now in the top one third of Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, countries for productivity.  That means we are a high-productivity economy.  That means there is limited scope for catch-up with the United States in management best practice and so on.  What it means, however, is that if one wants productivity gains in the future, and that is not to say that we should not continue to pursue those, it will have to be based upon having a robust innovation system whereby we are generating new ideas ourselves, and putting them into practice in new businesses, whether they are high-potential startups rolling out of the universities, or something different.  Unfortunately, we know that the technology diffusion mechanism in Ireland, as in other western European countries, has now broken down.  We are seeing productivity growth in the multi-nationals, but they are locking that up through a system of patents.  We are not seeing productivity gains in small and medium enterprises, whether in Ireland, other European countries or, indeed, America.  It is not specifically an Irish problem.  It is now an international problem.  There are things that one can do, but broadly, we have not been doing well on productivity from small and medium enterprises in the West in the last ten years.</p></speech>

We are talking about countries which have much higher tax rates than we do, and much larger social safety nets.  They have built this up from the first half of the 20th century.  It is something that is built up over time, essentially as a three-way partnership between the state, employers and the broader labour movement.  Essentially, the agreement was to focus on labour peace in return for reinvestment in the economy by business and large contributions by business towards employee education, child care and so on.  That then provided what became known as the social democratic welfare state, which allowed a high level of human capital to be generated.  By human capital I mean low levels of poverty and high levels of education, so that there is a very highly qualified workforce, which of course takes decades to build.  There are also high value-added industries.  They are paying their workers a lot of money, but they are high value-added.  Deputy Neville is dead right about Norway.  Norway has oil.  I would not count Luxembourg as a Nordic country, but there is also Denmark-----</p></speech>

None of those countries would be particularly resource-rich.  A point was made earlier about the knowledge economy.</p><p>In the future productivity gains will really be about knowledge.  Having an educated workforce in which nobody falls behind because of poverty will be key.  In terms of the enterprise environment, achieving productivity gains to allow everyone to benefit in the way previous delegates discussed will mean sustained long-term investment in education and research and development.  The level of investment in research and development on a <i>per capita</i>basis is two thirds of that in the United States which is considered to be a low-tax and low-spending economy but it spends much more than Ireland on research and development.  The Netherlands spends twice as much per person on research and development, while Denmark spends three times as much.  These countries are investing in new ideas and innovations and will generate new high value businesses.  Many will fail - many in Ireland will also fail - but in these countries more businesses will be generated.  There are more ideas coming through because of which they have a more educated and qualified workforce.  Unfortunately, all of this costs money, but that is the deal between employers and employees.  The employers are saying they will invest more in their workers.  The countries mentioned also have great infrastructure, of course, which helps to reduce costs.  In Ireland one can travel from Maynooth to Dublin and essentially be a sardine.  That model required a long period of trust building.  It also required buy-in from all parties in order that there would be something in it for everyone.  Employers gained a high quality workforce; employees achieved a high standard of living and a high wage, while for the state there were low levels of poverty and high levels of GDP.  Ireland could not do the same overnight, of course.  Its model was based on attracting US multinationals and it was very successful in doing so, but it has not been successful in developing indigenous enterprise.  The Deputy asked about Denmark.  A much higher proportion of its exports come from small and medium enterprises in its indigenous sector.  It has very successful small and medium businesses.  It also tends to do well in areas such as wind energy where we have not really pushed out the envelope.</p></speech>

Otherwise there is a veil of corporate secrecy.  There are other people, who I will not name, who have to be taken into account.  The report found significant levels of increase in pay, made up by a decrease in basic pay and an increase in what are known as long-term investment plans.  It is almost impossible to compare one of these to another, because they are weighted in different ways.  The report named good practice when we saw it and commended companies for reporting in a particular way.  It made the point that companies listed in Dublin have to concur with the London Stock Exchange code of practice.  There is much dissatisfaction on the London exchange in terms of executive pay in Britain.  The issue came up in Teresa May's first speech as Prime Minister, although she subsequently drew back from it.  That issue is still causing anger in the London system, and it will appear in the Dublin exchange.  ICTU intends to update that report annually, and will be producing a new report around the turn of the year.  That pressure will, if anything, become more intense.  This year we have added Irish companies which are listed in London but not in Dublin.</p> <p>  In terms of the cost of doing business we are talking about a small number of people, but it causes a demonstration effect within the economy as a whole.  SMEs and owner-managers do not figure in that.  However, a man who described himself as a grandee of the London Stock Exchange said that people who are essentially managerial employees are reaping the rewards of corporate entrepreneurs who have put their house or their wealth on the line.  That is the disconnect.</p> <p>  One of the things that I have always been impressed with is the quality of the Oireachtas research service.  If I am a business owner and my truck driving contractor allows three crates of food to rot through lack of due diligence and I want to sue it, what is the cost of settling that claim in a selected number of countries?  If I have an insurance claim for a given injury, what is the cost of settling that in a number of countries?  These are the "unknown unknowns", to quote Donald Rumsfeld, but they present very significant costs to businesses.  How much does public liability cost in Britain and Denmark and what does it have to be insured against?  From speaking to SME owners, insurance is a key issue.  Much of the responsibility for this is in the hands of the insurance industry.  It can organise its work more collaboratively - having regard to the rights of data protection - to monitor claims, etc.  Perhaps it is not for me to say, and I hope that I will not be cited for contempt or anything, but the Oireachtas research service is very good, and perhaps there is a job of work for it in this area.  There are other costs besides the usual suspects of labour costs and tax.</p> <p>  We are a republic.  The first republic in modern times was conceived in America in 1776, with the slogan, "No representation without taxation".</p><p>There is an implicit link between paying tax and being a citizen.  They are two sides to the same coin.  If there is one concept that needs to be driven out of public life, it is that of a burden of taxation.  Taxation is a part of citizenship.  If one does not like how one pays one's taxes or what they are spent on, there are representatives, such as members of the committee, with whom one can have that debate.  It is not a burden but an aspect of citizenship.  The phrase "burden of taxation" needs to be driven out of the public discourse.</p></speech>
