We can have the discussion on the Croke Park agreement immediately afterwards and complete whatever housekeeping is necessary at the end of the meeting.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-11a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012101100002#A00600"><p>I thank the Chairman for responding so quickly to my letter offering the committee an opportunity to be brought up to speed on the Government's public service reform plan, one of the most important jobs of work the Government is undertaking.  The last time I attended the committee I stated no one had a monopoly of good ideas.  Traditionally, I have been a strong supporter of the Oireachtas being fully involved in actions, particularly on the reform side.  I value members' opinions and advice on what we must do.</p><p>  I am joined by the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, who works closely with me on implementation of the plan.  The committee knows the Secretary General, Mr. Robert Watt, and the assistant secretary, Mr. Paul Reid, whom we have recruited to drive the dedicated reform office.  We have just come from a Cabinet sub-committee meeting at which the sectoral plans driving the reform agenda were considered.  Last month we published a statement on the implementation of the reform plan, a copy of which I forwarded to all of the committee's members for reading.  The statement set out the significant progress made in the first ten months of the plan.  I thank the staff of my Department, as well as those of all other Departments, for embracing the reform agenda.</p><p>  It is fair to say the Government has embarked on the most ambitious and comprehensive public service reform programme in the history of the State.  No previous Government has taken on anything of this scale and breadth.  Our task is considerable.  However, given the situation the Government inherited, comprehensive reform of the public service is not an option.  It is an essential part of the strategic response to our economic challenges.  This was the rationale agreed to by both parties in government for establishing a dedicated Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>  Before I get into the detail of public service reform, it is important to recall briefly the progress made in achieving our fiscal targets.  In total, budgetary adjustments designed to save or yield approximately &euro;25 billion have been made.  This is an extraordinary burden on the people.  As the committee is aware, two thirds of these adjustments have been on the expenditure side.  It is also important to recall that we have negotiated substantial reductions in the cost of our international programme of assistance to the value of approximately &euro;10 billion.  Last year's underlying central government deficit was 9.4% of GDP, a healthy improvement on the underlying deficit recorded in 2010 and well within the 10.6% limit set under the EU-IMF programme.  The deficit limit we have set for this year is 8.6% of GDP, or approximately &euro;13.5 billion.  We must incrementally reduce the deficit to below 3% by 2015.  We are determined as a Government to do this.</p><p>  Since 2008, overall gross departmental expenditure has reduced by &euro;6.5 billion, despite the pressures on public services imposed by the downturn.  We are committed to making significant further reductions during the next three years.  It is a difficult circle to square - we have reduced amounts of money and numbers of public servants and have significantly increased demands.</p><p>  As set out in the comprehensive review of expenditure report last year, a total expenditure reduction of &euro;2.2 billion is envisaged for this year, of which &euro;1.45 billion represents current expenditure and &euro;750 million capital expenditure.  The Exchequer pay bill has reduced by 17.7% between 2009 and 2012, from &euro;17.5 billion gross to &euro;14.4 billion, including the pension-related deduction.  The aim is to reduce the total cost of the Exchequer pay bill by &euro;3.8 billion in the period from 2009, when it peaked, to 2015.  To put it another way, the aim is to reduce the public pay bill by 20%, which is a daunting challenge.</p><p>  In discussing the pay bill we should, of course, recall that those working in the public service have already had two pay reductions, totalling an average of 14%, by way of the pension-related deduction and direct salary cuts.  Salaries at the highest levels have been reduced by up to 30% and capped in the Civil Service at &euro;200,000.  We have also reduced the salaries of new entrants to the public service by 10%.  Public service pensions have been reduced, saving more than &euro;100 million annually.  Legislation for a new single public service pension scheme has been enacted this year.  Public service staff numbers have been reduced by 28,000 from a peak of 320,000 to 292,000.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the progress made, the deficit in the public finances remains large.  To this end, the Government has begun working on the detailed measures underpinning next year's budget which will be announced on 5 December.  We must also be conscious of our obligations to reduce public spending in a way that is fair, protects those who rely on public services, supports employment and enterprise and takes a more strategic view to position ourselves for economic and social recovery as a nation.  In terms of public services, it is clear that we must work harder and more flexibly than ever before.  In other words, we must get more for less.  </p><p>  With a backdrop of ongoing significant reductions in public expenditure and numbers, the Government's ambitious public service reform plan was published last November.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-11a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/958" speakername="Brian Hayes" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012101100004#C00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to appear before the committee and recognise its importance in our work.</p><p>  To put it bluntly, the key task of the Government is economic survival.  That means getting the country to a better position over a period of years in order that we can get the economy growing again.  When both parties were elected to office, the mandate given to them was not just to clear up the economic mess we inherited and bridge the gap between expenditure and tax receipts over a period of years, it was also to seek radical reform of the public sector and specifically to decide how to deal with this.  It was important that, nine months after the launch of the public sector reform plan, we put in place a review and set out what we had achieved.  As the Minister said, what we are looking for is buy-in and support across the public sector in delivering on these key tasks.  We have a clear plan that is headed by a special unit in the Department.  There are key time lines with the names of the officials who will deliver the reform within a period of time.  We have a political responsibility, as does the committee and all Members of the House, to ensure the plan is implemented.</p><p>  In much of the commentary surrounding this debate there is no focus on what has been achieved.  The achievements have been astonishing, given the economic collapse that occurred in this country.  The number in the public sector was 320,000 some years ago and it is just over 290,000 now.  It will go down to 282,000 in the next period of time.  That is an extraordinary reduction in the total number of public servants.  We must ensure the group that is left is organised in such a way that we secure maximum efficiencies within the public sector at a time when more people are using the health service, more children are in school and there are greater demands because of the economic collapse.</p><p>  I have responsibility for four areas in the plan: shared services, public procurement, property and Ireland Stat.  The Minister spoke about the reductions in human resources.  To put it simply, we have approximately 860 employed to perform HR functions across government.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-11a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012101100004#C00300"><p>Human resource management.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-11a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/958" speakername="Brian Hayes" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012101100004#C00400"><p>Yes.  By the time our plans are fully implemented that number will be down to approximately 640.  Bringing all of the HR personnel together will yield savings of 26%; therefore, we will have reduced by one quarter the total amount of money we are spending on HR services in the public sector.  It will allow us to move HR personnel to do other things because of the arrangements in place under the Croke Park agreement.  That is a tangible example of what "shared services" means.  We also have plans to bring forward the same principle of shared services on the pensions, pay and banking sides.  We are very confident we can achieve this.</p><p>  We are still spending a great deal of money on public procurement.  The figure is about &euro;9 billion for goods and services and &euro;5 billion for construction.  We must achieve much greater savings.  I will be clear and blunt to the committee.  We have too many involved in public procurement.  This is a small country.  The efficiencies should be much easier to obtain here because of our size.  If we can organise the system properly, we will do so.</p></speech>

Deputy Howlin states in his presentation that he has had discussions with colleagues, both ministerial and others, on the Croke Park agreement.  Will he update us on his objectives for savings: the timeframe in which it will happen; what is being done to make the agreement work to its maximum limit and the progress that is being made?  One does not need to reinvent the wheel, but management is very important.</p><p>  The Minister also referred to the second category of allowances which are made up of payments that do not form a significant element of the overall remuneration of the beneficiary.  What is the timeframe for sectoral management getting agreements in these areas?</p><p>  Earlier in the week the Minister announced an additional 8,000 voluntary redundancies.  What is being done to ensure that key personnel are not lost, so that we do not suffer from a brain-drain?  I am conscious that we could lose intelligence built up over many year, which I value greatly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-11a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1034" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012101100005#D00600"><p>My questions relate to the announcement to target 88 allowances.  I would like to get a figure for the total value of these allowances, the breakdown by Department, the salary grades that are affected, if they are directed at existing public sector workers, and whether it is envisaged to buy out and abolish those particular allowances.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-11a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012101100005#D00700"><p>I welcome the Minister and Minister of State.  I have read all of the progress reports and found them very helpful.  Any initiative the Government undertakes is being sucked up underneath the umbrella of the Croke Park agreement.  Let me give an example from the progress report from September which states we have progressed in relation to ordnance surveys, Revenue online and data sharing.  How can we attribute such progress which the Minister would want to happen at these times to specific steps under the Croke Park agreement?</p><p>  I fully welcome and acknowledge the progress that has been made in relation to the Garda roster, the consultants' roster and so on, but why has it taken so long?  The negotiations on the consultant contracts went on for years.  The Garda roster change-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-11a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012101100005#D00800"><p>That was conducted by the previous Government and it took four years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-11a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012101100005#D00900"><p>I accept the Minister's point.  I believe it is the first time the Garda roster has changed in 40 years.  To put it bluntly, why has it taken so long to achieve something that everybody would want to make happen?</p><p>  The Minister's point, which I accept, is that 3,000 people have moved across the health service to fill jobs.  Many people would say that should happen anyway.  If there is a vacancy and somebody in a job is able to fill it, then the person should fill the vacancy.</p><p>  The Minister has also made this point many times, and last week he criticised the slow rate of change.  Who is accountable for the length of time it takes to make changes?  Who is not getting paid an increment or not getting a promotion in the different sections because of the slow pace of change?  I am supportive of the Croke Park agreement and it is the way to handle staff.  The most decisive characteristic of the economic lives of the people who pay our wages has been involuntary change - the involuntary loss of jobs and wages.  Many in the public sector are doing a great job but they labour under a voluntary agreement.  I think the Minister may share my views on the rate of change. Will he comment on the factors that contribute to the slow pace of change?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-11a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1045" speakername="Derek Nolan" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012101100005#D01000"><p>I welcome the Minister, the Minister of State and the officials to the committee.  I may be following on from Deputy Donohoe's point.</p><p>  The plans are very ambitious, which is welcome and the Croke Park agreement is allowing for flexibility and willingness on the part of the staff.  One of the issues that was raised with me early in my career as a Deputy was the lack of management, particularly in the health services.  We saw how a new management structure in a Galway hospital was able to turn around the hospital using the existing budgets.  What is the Minister's sense of the ability of management in the public service to deliver the plan?  One can have all the plans but if one does not have the management experience to deliver them, they will not happen.</p></speech>

Was a business case made for the payment of those allowances by the various Departments?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-11a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1100" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012101100006#E00200"><p>I thank the Minister for his presentation which dovetails with the discussion we had during Question Time in the Chamber yesterday.  When he announced his plan in November 2011, I mentioned the appointments of eight to ten senior responsible owners in the overall delivery of each of the major ten crosscutting projects.  Are they ten new staff?  How many people have been employed to deliver this?  The document gave the impression they were new positions.  They might be old people with new jobs.  It is just new titles.</p></speech>

I would hate to think we are just growing our own internally.  People have done MBAs in procurement but have never personally purchased anything beyond a car for themselves.  I ask the Minister to outline the range of commercial practical experience.</p><p>  My other point relates to property and is broader than just the OPW.  I wish to make a constructive statement.  The State property portfolio involves many agencies.  OPW is responsible for many Government buildings.  NAMA, a Government agency, has the biggest property portfolio in the world.  IBRC, formerly Anglo Irish Bank, still has a massive property portfolio, which it is entitled to dispose of or whatever.  There is something else known colloquially as the "NAMA for local authorities" - the Housing &amp;amp; Sustainable Communities Agency.  During the boom years all the local authorities paid boom prices to buy land for housing developments in towns and on their outskirts, none of which are now proceeding.  There are at least &euro;500 million worth of almost greenfield sites being sent over to this agency through the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  There is nothing wrong with consolidating the ownership of those away from the approximately 40 different local authorities. </p><p>  Those are four State bodies with major property portfolios.  I would like to see a co-ordinated State approach to the management of all property under all State agencies.  I would suggest the OPW should have ongoing talks with NAMA.  We asked representatives of NAMA here before and I might have mentioned it.  I want to broaden it to the local authority properties that were purchased and those owned by IBRC.  The Minister should have a consolidated approach rather than four State agencies competing with each other in the property area.</p></speech>

He has dressed up things that are housekeeping and streamlining measures and tried to pass them off as some great change.  The Government has consistently protected a segment within the public and Civil Service at the very top and defended them at every turn.  They are cosseted and the Government shows no sign of taking that on.  The big issue is that of pay equity and fairness in the system, and the Government has failed on that.</p><p>  If the Government was making any claim that there had been any kind of cultural change within the service, two top officials from the Department of Health and the HSE comprehensively gave the lie to that at the last meeting of this committee.  We have a major problem with accountability, transparency, delivery and the level of pay at the very top level.  I could comment longer but my time is limited.</p><p>  What are the 88 allowances to which the Minister has referred?  To whom are they being paid?  What grades are involved?  What are the savings envisaged from those 88?</p></speech>

What is the biggest challenge for the Minister in terms of the Croke Park agreement?  My second question is on shared services.

I would like to see that dealt with because once that dynamic is removed; there would be a different experience from workers throughout the service.  I would like to see exactly what is contained in the contracts particularly for those on lower levels of pay in the Civil Service.</p><p>  The Minister of State spoke about the 860 people involved in human resource management or with human resource qualifications.  I am absolutely amazed to hear that.  With the number of problems in the public service relating to human resource management, bullying and other issues, I want to know the qualifications most of those people hold in terms of how they manage.  Given the qualifications that exist in the private sector then the issues relating to salaries, increments, add-on payments would not have become so embedded in the system.</p><p>  I believe one of the Deputies may have touched on this already.  Who is managing the change?  Are there change managers running right down the service with a particular agenda to drive change and nothing else?  On procurement, in my constituency a &euro;5.9 million contract was issued.  The contractor went broke and all the subcontractors were caught again.  No one local could tender for it because they did not have the turnover and yet they had the ability to do the job.  The same is happening with the Government's print management framework.  I recently tabled a parliamentary question on the issue.  A &euro;10 million turnover is required and all the smaller enterprises need to feed into the bigger companies that are tendering.  As a result they do not have the access to the tender process.  The Minister of State might indicate how that is broken down.</p></speech>

I am not going to go back into the debate on that.  It has been said that there are legacy issues over the eight health boards and the 50 agencies.  Obviously that organisation needs investment in terms of financial management, technology and so on.  Is there room within the budget to take a big spending agency such as that and modernise its controls and management so that its representatives do not end up in here every year talking about overspending?  Is that an issue for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform?</p><p>  Are senior managers and top civil servants co-operating with the reform programme?  The Minister has often pointed to the need for better engagement from them.  Is that a secret code for: "Get into the programme here and let's bring about the reform that is necessary"?</p></speech>

However, I have asked sectoral managers to add to that list and I will keep the committee informed of how that work is progressing.  I do not want them all to be referred to the Labour Court, although people have that option.  I am hoping to negotiate a quicker arbitration mechanism to determine these cases.  If people want to use the legal mechanisms in place, they can do so, but I want to engage with the unions to try to find a quicker way of dealing with these cases.</p><p>  In terms of voluntary redundancies, the exit package in February involved people making sensible decisions for themselves.  Those who were coming up to retirement were given the option of having their pensions based on their pre-cut salary level and some decided to leave early.  We had no control over who those people would be and, as Deputy Paschal Donohoe rightly said, we lost skilled staff we did not want to lose.  The voluntary redundancy scheme for which I have Government approval involves each Minister examining his or her own Department and agencies within its remit to find areas in which there are surplus staff.  There are surplus staff in many agencies.  There are significant staff surpluses in the HSE on the administrative side, for example, and also in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, to name but two.  We will have targeted schemes to deal with these surpluses.  Staff will not be applying for redundancy and no one with a critical skill who would have to be replaced will be eligible.  We can talk about this matter again in greater detail at a future date, but I am under time pressure today.</p><p>  I have answered Deputy Eoghan Murphy's question on allowances, but I can provide more details for the committee, if required.  I will furnish members with copies the letters sent.  In fact, I will put them on the website which perhaps might be helpful to the committee.</p></speech>

I heard the distinguished broadcaster Ms Ingrid Miley talk about a boot allowance of &euro;69 per year, but abolishing it will not contribute massively to the public finances.  Allowances are included in a great amalgam, but they vary widely.  I will endeavour to give as much detail as possible by issuing the aforementioned letters and so forth.</p><p>  The question was asked as to how we could disaggregate Croke Park agreement reforms from what would have been happening in any event.  The implementation body is supposed to examine the implementation of the Croke Park agreement, the framework through which the reform agenda is progressing.  </p><p>  Members asked why change was taking so long, which was a nice and handy political ball to present to me.  We now have a Department responsible for reform, led by a Minister and a Minister of State who are determined to reform, as well as an office and a Secretary General responsible for reform, which is why things are now happening.  However, the proof of the pudding will be in the eating.  At the end of our five year term we want to have a transformed public service.  I hope it will be accepted that there will be hiccups along the way.  </p><p>  Deputy Paschal Donohoe spoke about involuntary pain in the private sector, but I can assure him that there was no voluntary sign-up for a pay cut or a 7% pension levy in the public sector   We must, therefore, be balanced in our approach.  New jobs are still being announced and there are a lot of areas in the private sector which have taken no hit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-11a.59" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012101100008#G00200"><p>A question was asked about senior responsible owners and whether they were new people.  The approach we are taking to reform is rather different.  We are driving reforms throughout Departments.  For example, the human resource shared services must be driven across 40 public service bodies.  In that case we need one accountable person and one senior responsible owner.  We have assigned people who have senior responsibility to lead and drive the reform throughout 40 public service bodies.  In general, the senior responsible owners are from within the system and the senior management have responsibility and accountability to drive change across the systems.  We have had limited recruitment of specialist skills.  We brought in one person to work centrally in the reform office on shared services.  That person has global experience of implementing shared services.  We supported the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, which has a large local government plan related to driving shared services.  It is in the process of recruiting a similar person to help the Department drive that agenda.  There has been limited recruitment.  Overall, our governance structure is strong.  We hold each Department and each of the large sectors accountable for the reforms in their area.</p><p>  As the Minister said, this morning we presented to the Cabinet committee a single view of reform.  We are now in a position to outline a total suite of reforms that encompass the public service reform plan, the programme for Government reform elements driven in each Department and sector and the Croke Park elements of reform that have industrial relations implications.  We have an overarching reform and each of the major sectors must put in place and is putting in place the equivalent of what we have done centrally, that is, a central governance structure.  Overall it is strong.  It is a programme management discipline that has strengthened our approach to reform.  This has probably not been traditionally a skill.  We used to lean harder on policy but now we have strong, disciplined programme management and we hold Departments and sectors accountable.  This morning was our fifth Cabinet committee meeting in the course of this year since we launched the plan.  Overall there is a strong governance structure.</p></speech>

It was interesting that the Chairman approached the issue from the perspective of the local business but not from the perspective of the public purse.  It seems that if we are to make the savings on procurement, we must become a good deal more strategic and ensure we implement what we claim we will implement.  The Chairman referred to print managed contracts.  This is something the national procurement service negotiated under my Department.  A total of five companies won that contract, three of which were Irish small or medium-sized enterprises and two of which were US multinationals.  We put it to everyone in the Irish public sector that the framework we had negotiated on exceptional prices should be used.</p><p>  One example is the savings that Dublin City Council has managed to realise as a result of a print managed contract.  What is a print managed contract?  A print managed contract is an alternative to the old fashioned way of having photocopiers everywhere which we own and every time they spew out paper, we pay for it.  Under this method, we give a contract to a company to run printing in that aspect of the public sector.  Dublin City Council had savings of 60% over a two year period by doing this.  We will replicate this in every other aspect of the Irish public sector.  If that means some local companies miss out, I am sorry.  However, if the Chairman is telling me that he wants to extract savings on procurement as part of his role as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, then this is the brave new world we are entering.  Moaning and groaning about local businesses here, there and everywhere will not achieve the targets we want to achieve.  The Chairman cannot have it both ways.  There is a reason I am being so potentially belligerent on this point.</p></speech>

The Minister of State can correct me if I am wrong but the contract stipulates a &euro;10 million turnover.  The small and medium-sized enterprises buy into it.  I want to see value for the public purse.  If the services can be purchased for better or equal to the best tender, then so be it.  That saves the public purse and that is my view on it.</p></speech>

They have shown that they can do this.  Stationery is another example.  A deal was won by an Irish business which is now securing costs in the local government sector that it thought unimaginable.  If we are going to move to this, we need political support.  We are not in the business of supplementing local employers in terms of what we can do.  We are in the business of driving the best deal we can get.  We are going to introduce in the public sector the same requirement that the private sector has and we make no apologies for that.</p><p>  Another question was asked about shared services.  There are 860 staff at the moment but we will go to 630.  This is real reform, a reduction from 862 to 630.  There are 320 on the transactional side and 300 on the training side.  Can I be blunt?  The Chairman put his finger on it.</p></speech>

In Clonskeagh we will move to an open plan office where all the human resource transactions will be dealt with in the same way as in Hewlett-Packard or any other organisation.  That is the difference it will make.</p><p>  Deputy Fleming spoke about property, a matter he has raised this with me in the past.  We have had and continue to have discussions with NAMA to establish whether we can extract the best possible deal in terms of the utilisation of space.  Along with the Minister, Deputy Howlin, I will bring a new memorandum on property to Government.  Property in the public sector is like a gigantic chess game.  If one moves someone, there is a gap that must be filled.  Up to now, we have not had the big stick to compel a Department to move to a particular place and say "sorry for your troubles", but we will have it as a result of this memorandum, and that is important.  Up to now, the OPW has been in the position of trying to cajole and persuade people but we have not had a big stick approach.  The memorandum will give us that.  The memorandum will also ensure we have for the first time ever a map of what we know we own throughout the country.  This has not been the case in the past but the new office plan we will put in place will ensure greater and more efficient use of space.  I will challenge everyone to reconsider cellular offices.  Is a person entitled to a cellular office because he is a particular grade?  In my view, he is not.  That is something we will drive to ensure we get those efficiencies.</p><p>  I was asked whether we have people from the outside in the system for procurement.  Yes, we have.  Recently, we took in seven buyers from the private sector who have particular knowledge in certain sectors.  They are working in the national procurement service, which was under the OPW but which will move now to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></speech>

I am sorry Deputy McDonald has left the meeting.  Unfortunately, she always makes the same presentation, that we do not need any of these changes and it is all a matter of cutting top pay.  She regards top pay as anyone earning over &euro;100,000 a year.  I explained in some detail yesterday that the number of people in the public service - not the Civil Service - earning more than &euro;100,000, is 1.8% of the total.  Deputy Fleming had a discussion yesterday about increments.  The increments involved for fewer than 600 people would be so small-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-11a.93" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1100" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012101100009#H01400"><p>It would be &euro;30 million.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-11a.94" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012101100009#H01500"><p>Does the Deputy mean to say that 500 people get &euro;30 million in increments?  That is &euro;80,000 or &euro;60,000 each.  I do not think it is &euro;60,000 each.  As an example, if they were each receiving an increment of &euro;1,000, that is &euro;500,000 and half that comes back, so it is less than &euro;500,000.  Would the Deputy recommend bringing in specific legislation for that sort of money?  If we are talking real money, let us deal with that in a proper way.  Deputy McDonald is not present, unfortunately, but the presentation of her argument seems to be much more important than the substance of it.  This committee is about substance.  As a people we have a horrendous task to solve our economic woes and this committee has a role to play.</p><p>  I refer to the other point made by Deputy McDonald.  I may be straying away from my role this morning in commenting on yesterday's meeting of the committee and the officials who came before it.  To put it bluntly, there are standards of decency which should be observed when people come to attend.  Every public servant should be treated with respect.  This is a personal point of view about how senior public servants, who are servants of the public, must be held to account but in a way that is respectful of the individual.  I do not think that was done yesterday, but that is a personal perspective.</p><p>  Deputy McCarthy spoke about the biggest challenge and I think I have already answered that.  We are driving an agenda for which we need to have a buy-in at all levels but we have not succeeded yet.  However, I am determined to do that.  The shared services issue is a very large and important agenda for us.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, spoke about the human resource service which is to be put in place.  We are fast-tracking other areas of it and we can supply details of these areas.  One body doing the task rather than 40 centres all doing the same work is a significant reform not only in monetary terms, but also in terms of efficiency.  It is often the case that personnel officers are moved on promotion to other duties.  This may mean that such individuals have no skills in personnel work.  We need to change this practice and make it more professional.</p><p>  On the Chairman's final point, I will send him a copy of the standard contract.  The contracts for driving the reform agenda in my Department are all term contracts.  The last time I sat beside the director at this committee we were discussing public pay - I should not say this - but he gave me a note in which he wrote that he was now earning half of what he earned in the private sector for doing a similar job and without the public scrutiny.  That is an issue we need to be mindful of when discussing salary ceilings.  If we want to recruit capable people to drive the change, then we must mindful of that also.  The Secretary General has a seven-year contract.  The new procurement officer will be on a contract and the Minister of State is determined that the pay for the office will be determined by achievement.  This will be an innovation in the public service.</p></speech>

I would be happy to discuss these with the committee when I appear again.  It is an issue for the top level appointments committee.  It is much more complex than much of the commentary on this issue.  The percentage of candidates from the private sector filling vacancies has risen over the past six to nine months compared to the previous periods.  The sample size is very small so care must be taken.  We are not recruiting large numbers but there has been an increase.  I can discuss this with the committee at my next appearance.  There are issues associated with the perception of the public sector and of how it is portrayed in the media.  The issues include pay, how senior civil servants are called to account by this committee and how committee members interact with individuals.  Those issues are very important when we want to attract high calibre candidates.  To put it bluntly, I have had conversations with people in the private sector-----</p></speech>

My perspective, looking in at it, is that in the context of the extraordinary economic crisis facing the country, it is vital that the committee - the flagship committee of the Oireachtas in terms of its role in scrutinising public expenditure - go about its work in a co-operative way.  After almost 30 years in the Oireachtas, I have learned that there is a way of proceeding in these matters which does not seem to have been followed in this instance.  I refer to the discordant incident at the beginning of Tuesday's meeting.  That is just my personal perspective and I will say no more about it.  I agree that the meeting was subsequently very good.</p><p>  I look forward to having open, frank and sometimes, I am sure, discordant conversations at the committee as we map our way through the very difficult task we face.

We said on the last occasion that we would be happy to return when we had completed the second review of the public service agreement.</p> <p> Performance management is still a big issue, and it must be driven right across the public service.  The recent review of the performance management system certainly does give it more teeth.  It addresses some of the issues we discussed here on the last occasion about the power of managers to discipline the public service and the fact that they do have the same power as managers elsewhere.   There are positive aspects to the performance management system.  It has developed a system for those who are doing a good job.  There are, of course, thousands doing a good job so I would not like to give the impression that there are not many people doing a good job.  The revision of the sick leave scheme is a positive aspect as well.</p><p> We need to see further changes to work practices, particularly where there are outdated working arrangements, extended working hours, and there ought to be efforts to ensure the availability of resources to front-line services by making full use of the redeployment provisions of the agreement.  We need to see continuing co-operation on the rationalisation of structures, organisations and offices.  Any agency rationalisations or amalgamations that have been progressed so far have enjoyed full co-operation, including in respect of the redeployment arrangements that are very often necessary to enable those rationalisations or amalgamations to happen.  We give some examples in the report.</p><p> More effective inter-agency co-operation must be considered.  One considerable area that the Department of Justice and Equality is examining is co-operation between the courts, Garda and prison service, particularly with reference to the utilisation of fewer prison officers and garda&iacute;.</p><p> Let me return to a point I have mentioned here before and at many fora, that is, the need for more online services.  These are critical.  They involve providing a better service to the customer or user and reducing the work for the staff in organisations.  There is still much potential in this area.  Much progress has been and is being made.  However, there can be no let-up in this area.</p><p> In summary, it is clear that the agreement continues to deliver, but there are challenges ahead.  Industrial peace has been maintained.  When I last appeared before the committee, we continued to insist that action plans for savings and reform be sufficiently ambitious, both in their scope and timeframes for delivery.  We have just completed a series of meetings with the top management of other sectors, although we must still meet representatives in the defence area.  We emphasised once more the importance of accelerating change through reviewing action plans.  We all know the budget challenges will not be any easier and that they will be significantly more difficult.  We were frank in our report in saying it is not sufficient for management to rely on the reforms delivered to date, however significant or welcome they might be.  We recognise there is further change required in light of the continuing difficult circumstances confronting the economy.</p><p> The agreement continues to provide a very effective framework.  I have seen nothing frustrated or stopped by the unions or staff.  Where there are disputes or issues that cannot be resolved genuinely, there are fora to achieve this quickly.  That is what is happening where disputes arise.</p><p> I assure the members that the body will continue to do what it can to increase the momentum around the agreement.  We will also be working to ensure that all sectors play their part.  I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to brief the committee on recent developments.  I will be happy to deal with any questions they have on implementation.  I know they will be taking up the progress report with various sectors and Accounting Officers.  As I said at our last meeting, this is mutually beneficial.  I thank the Chairman and members.</p></speech>

The terms of reference of the implementation group cover driving the implementation of the agreement, yet the targets for reform are set by the Government and implemented by management.  How does the body drive the implementation of the agreement?  I am trying to figure out the role of the body.  There is certainly a dispute resolution mechanism, which is extremely valuable in achieving quick resolutions.  Could the witnesses elaborate on the implementation of the agreement?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-11a.120" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P. J.

Therefore, it is a very useful forum.  We have similar arrangements in place for each of the big sectors, which total eight.  We recognised at the beginning that if we were to become a dispute-resolution body, we would just get bogged down in industrial relations issues, and the focus would not be on the change agenda at all.  We met the Labour Court and Labour Relations Commission and everyone was very clear that the dispute resolution procedures that would be used would be their well-tried, well-trusted ones.  They work very well.  I compliment both the Labour Court and the LRC on the manner and the speed with which they have handled the Croke Park referrals to them.</p><p>  We have an interpretation role.  If issues arise over the interpretation of issues in the agreement, they can be submitted to us.  There have not been very many of them.  Our main role is to try to ensure that whatever obstacles arise are unblocked  We meet sector management regularly to try to make progress.  We are not working on this full-time.  We are non-executives and all those concerned have full-time jobs.  However, we meet regularly and meet sector management.  We do, therefore, have a role in driving and reviewing the action plans, challenging the action plans we get, sending them back, as we have often done, and ensuring we face up to new expenditure challenges.  The budget, for example, always brings new challenges that are not provided for in the Croke Park agreement.  The detailed steps that were to be taken are set out in a series of appendices at the back of the agreement.  Virtually all of them have been taken.  The agreement has moved on, therefore.</p><p>  The big ticket item was reducing the number of staff and facilitating the Government to do so.  It also involved ensuring the redeployment arrangements worked to support that process.  This is still a significant feature.  Many of the points in the individual sector plans have been addressed.  The agreement has moved on and every budget brings a set of new challenges.  Take the area of defence, for example.  The Army barracks closures were handled under the Croke Park agreement.  At the moment, the Department of Defence, with the staff associations, is managing the collapsing of the three brigades into two.  This is not easy because it involves much movement and retraining of people.  Our role, which is challenging, is to drive progress and report to the Government on that.</p></speech>

I assume management sends an action plan to its sector and the implementation body sends it back stating it is not ambitious enough.</p></speech>

Many people have been promoted through the ranks without necessarily having been given management training or without their having management skills.  In Mr. Fitzpatrick's work, does he find there are sufficient management skills and ability to implement change?  Does this present an obstacle?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-11a.124" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P. J.

There are a couple of points I would make on it.  First, it is a long time since the recession preceding the current one.  I believe I made the point on the last occasion that many private sector mangers face the same issue as those in the public sector.  There are many people in management roles who never managed in a recession and who never had to look people in the eye with bad news.  This is not just a public sector phenomenon.  This is the first time many managers have managed in a recession, and it is not easy.</p><p>  Managing change requires skills, so there is no doubt that training is required.  This is covered in the reform plan of the new Department and it is being pursued by some other Departments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-11a.126" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1045" speakername="Derek Nolan" time="11:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012101100015#O00200"><p>However, we are coming to the end of the agreement at the end of next year.  Mr. Fitzpatrick suggests these skills are needed and must be put in place but if we are approaching the end of the agreement and the skills are not in place, it gives rise to the possibility that three years have passed in which the maximum amount of change possible has not been achieved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-11a.127" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P. J.

I was recently invited to attend the launch of a human resources strategy in Teagasc, which had a superb training programme.  That was more than a year and a half ago.  Another issue is external recruitment, which is also assisting in areas in which particular skills are required, such as shared services, for example, or areas like contract management, procurement or information and communications technology.  In any organisation undergoing major change, training and development is always an ongoing issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-11a.128" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1045" speakername="Derek Nolan" time="11:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012101100015#O00400"><p>Part of the implementation body's remit is to drive implementation and review progress.  However, a lot of the stuff we get lists incredible achievements.  I am quite a supporter of the Croke Park agreement and what it aims to achieve but while savings and so on are listed, progress is not measured in lists but in targets.  One measures progress by having a target and assessing how well one achieved it.  However, we do not appear to have that type of measurement.  How does Mr. Fitzpatrick define progress in respect of the body's terms of reference?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-11a.129" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P. J.

Obviously, we have been tracking progress against those lists and in most sectors, virtually all of those are done.  The other big one on which we were able to track progress is the reduction in numbers and in reducing the pay bill.  When the agreement was drawn up, that was the big issue.  At that point, the target was a reduction of 25,000 by 2014 under the then Government's four-year recovery plan.  It subsequently became a reduction of 37,000 by 2015 under the new programme for Government.  Consequently, we track the numbers on a quarterly basis.  On the other reforms, such as shared services or the more organisational reforms, we track the action plans.  Before carrying out our review, we must get progress reports from all the sectors on what progress they are making against the action plans.  At the same time, we seek new action plans for the following year.</p></speech>

We will and have challenged them very strongly.  Obviously, this is a big agenda and a tough one and I assure the Deputy we have tough meetings with the managements.  This happens every year with some sectors.</p></speech>

Mr. Fitzpatrick should classify which sectors or Departments give the most co-operation and the least co-operation to the body.  He should indicate what those sectors are and where the problems arise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-11a.133" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P. J. Fitzpatrick" time="11:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012101100015#O00900"><p>First, on the reduction in numbers, there has been full co-operation across the board although people do not really have a choice in this regard.  On redeployment, there has been full co-operation and full engagement with the agreement.  As for the areas around which we would like to see greater urgency, we have identified shared services, for example, as the big one.  In sectors such as local government and education, which are ready-made for shared services, there is no reason for loads of organisations to be doing the same work.  In this regard, members may have seen the recent review but the local government sector has now put in place a dedicated office and has identified 29 projects for shared service potential, which range from major projects like payroll and pensions and human resources down to items such as waste permits, for example, which have been centralised in a single county for all the counties in Ireland.  I would say the big one is education, where there is much scope for shared services, in that there are a lot of third level colleges doing pretty much the same work.  While some work has been done in that there is some joint procurement and so on, there is big-ticket stuff there.  I note the new reform unit in the Department is driving this with the different sectors.  However, if the Deputy asked me about the area for the biggest savings that needs more acceleration, this is one big area.  The other one is online services.  Very often, people wait for a big expensive system to put in online services but this is not always required.  For example, when the second house tax was introduced, the local government sector had that up and running within weeks.  Very often, it does not cost a fortune to put in place online services.  Sometimes, people think it needs a major IT system when it actually involves quite a modest investment.  The new single student grant facility was implemented very quickly.</p></speech>

I assume there have been meetings between the implementation group and the third level sector to push that agenda, which obviously has not happened.  What is the main sticking point and why is there a drag in the third level education sector?</p></speech>

When the dedicated resources are put in place, things begin to happen.  The human resources shared service has moved very rapidly.  I reiterate that shared services are major projects that do not take place overnight.  However, they are worth it.</p></speech>

As such, it only works for as long as both sides are of the same mind.  What is Mr. Fitzpatrick's view of the appetite for or the continued acceptance of the agreement on both sides in the public sector?  I refer to the appetite to continue to work it and beyond that, the appetite perhaps for an extension or re-negotiation of a new contract in the future.</p></speech>

I would be misleading the committee were I to state otherwise.  We have four excellent people from the trade union side on the body who really take the agreement very seriously.  They resolve the issues that arise on their side.  My secretary, who is with me, will confirm that, as chair, I have encountered no difficulty with either side in terms of their desire or ambition.  It really has been exemplary and I have dealt with unions for more years than I care to remember.  However, another important point to remember is that by and large, trade unions do not go out to cause trouble.  Very often they get blamed for something they have never been asked to do.  One must be careful in this regard.  In my experience, and I dealt with unions in a number of different positions, when they understand what is sought and the reason for it, they are highly practical and this has been my experience in respect of the Croke Park agreement.  In addition, members will have heard some of the people on the body speak before Oireachtas committees and in the media.</p></speech>

I was asked to chair it in July 2010.  There is no date in the agreement.  There is nothing in the agreement that states what date.</p></speech>

I am around industrial relations long enough to know that things can be fine today and something can happen tomorrow out of the blue.  Let us be under no illusion that industrial peace can never be taken for granted.  It is never a given.  It has to be worked at and preserved.  As regards when the agreement might end, I would have thought probably the end of next year or early 2014.  It is really a matter for the parties.</p></speech>

In relative terms, it was not huge.  Some areas had more than others.  On that particular issue, we have explicitly said in the report that our view is in line with the official policy that it should be the exception rather than the norm.</p></speech>

I accept there were certain emergency cases, such as teachers in education who had an examination year class.  For instance, I know of one example where a person who left in February last got a job back in the examination centre in the Department of Education and Skills.  I do not consider that exceptional or very important.  The Department had months to plan for that, and yet that individual got back into that job.  One should consider the level of unemployment in the country.  Does anyone have the set number of figures as to how many staff were rehired?</p></speech>

The numbers are determined by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Each Department is given a ceiling that it is instructed not to exceed in employing the numbers.  On the management of those numbers, our job is to facilitate the reduction in the numbers.  We do not micro-manage the day-to-day management of the numbers.  We know because we get the returns at the implementation body.  Returns are done from all Departments and all agencies to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the numbers.  I think they are done every quarter.  That is the only way we can track whether the numbers are likely to meet the targets in the programme for Government required to enable the State to meet the budget.  This agreement cannot operate in isolation from the budget.  It is key to ensuring Departments and agencies are able to manage with less money in pay and non-pay terms.</p></speech>

It is not our job to micro-manage.  We certainly expressed a view in the report, which was strongly in line with the official view, that the rehiring of staff who had retired should be the exception rather than the norm.  With teachers, that was very understandable.  Where teachers were teaching classes that were doing examinations, of course, there could not have been disruption.  The fact that announcement was made very quickly and very early, way back when talk about the February departures began, did a lot to allay parents' fears that students might be left high and dry and killed off a lot of fear and worry on the part of parents of children doing examinations.  That was perfectly understandable.  Other than that, our view is that it should be very exceptional rather than the norm for the very reasons Deputy Connaughton stated, that is, the numbers who are unemployed.</p></speech>

When the implementation body was set up first, we decided very deliberately on the issue of pay bill savings that we would use the figures of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Those are the figures that are provided to the troika and, as far as we are concerned, those are the only official figures.  Otherwise, we could have had a situation where we would get sectors giving us one set of figures, the Department's figures would be different, and the figures would be all over the place.  For that reason, we decided very deliberately from the outset that we were going to use only those figures, and those are the figures we have used on pay.</p><p>  The non-pay figures are sent to us with the review by the Secretaries General from each Department.  We have to accept those because, obviously, we cannot go out and check each one of them.  However, last year we did engage accountants to verify - I would not call it a full audit - the four sets of savings that had been reported to us, and this year we had a different set of accountants who verified four projects.  In all eight of those projects they verified that the savings that had been reported or had been achieved were being achieved or would be achieved, were based on accurate information and that they were satisfied that where there were forward judgments, the assumptions underpinning them were sound.  To begin to audit everything would become so expensive that it would-----</p></speech>

We published that this year with the review.  It is a separate report.  This one was done by Grant Thornton.  Last year it was done by MKO accountants.  It is not an audit in the conventional sense.  It is more of a verification.  I say that because I would not like to mislead anyone, but it is a verification.  In any event, Departments' and agencies' budgets have been reduced and they have to do a lot of this stuff to cope with their reduced budgets.</p></speech>

The agreement provides for a consultation period of six weeks to avoid procrastination and it is up to both sides to ensure adherence.  If the period lapses, it is because nobody is pushing the issue.  Other time bound procedures then come into play, including a four week period for the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission.  If it is under the Croke Park agreement those timelines are applicable and the decision is binding on both sides.  If a dispute goes before the Labour Court outside of the agreement, the time limits do not apply.</p></speech>

To give an example, disputes in the health sector go before independent adjudicators rather than the Labour Court.  The decisions of these adjudicators are binding on both sides.  Similar systems have been established in other sectors.  The number of issues that are not covered by the agreement is very limited.  I am struggling to think of anything.</p></speech>

Mr. Fitzpatrick stated, "The level of co-operation and engagement between the employers, the Government bodies and trade unions is excellent."  This is a good phrase for some, but it is a worrying one for others.  He also described the engagement as "exemplary".  People outside will interpret this as being too cosy.  When I hear of two bodies on different sides of a table describe their relations as "excellent" and exemplary, that creates the perception among the 1.5 million people outside the public service that perhaps the relationship is too cosy and the agreement is not being driven hard enough.</p></speech>

I was talking first about the four management representatives and four trade union representatives on the body with me and my role in chairing it.  They are the ones about whom I was talking.  There is no doubt that there are difficult issues, but the only point I am making is that nothing has happened yet that has threatened the agreement on the industrial relations front and given the scale of the reductions and changes, that is significant.  I also chair the Garda sectoral body, for example.  When the new Garda rosters were introduced, there was not one word in the media.  No unions were complaining and the rosters were introduced almost unnoticed under the radar.  That would not have happened before.  Part of it is a realisation of the times we are in.  Trade union officials know how tough and difficult things are, but it is a good example of something big that was introduced virtually unnoticed.  It was introduced nationwide on the same day.</p></speech>

I will touch on a few areas about which he commented to colleagues and a number of matters in the report.  He referred to the rationale used in the change to the Garda rosters.  I agree that it was a massive change and have witnessed the huge difference it has made in my community.  He said this would not have happened before and the fact that it is happening now is a tribute to the Croke Park agreement.  However, it should have happened previously and the normalisation of such change is a move to where we should be and perhaps is not the achievement it is made out to be.  The Garda rosters had not changed for 40 years and I acknowledge fully that it is a gigantic change.  However, this has not changed since the 1960s and the country has changed beyond all recognition.  Perhaps this is not the strongest case that can be made to recognise the change.</p></speech>

The rosters should have changed, but they did not.  The reality is that it was a big issue because changing rosters was different from any other change that could be implemented, particularly in any area in which 24-7 cover was required.  People's lives are often built around rosters, including their partner's working arrangements and child care arrangements.  One, therefore, is not just changing something in their workplace; one is changing their entire domestic life also.  That was the big challenge with the Garda rosters.  That is why roster changes tend to be more problematic than most other changes because they are intrinsically linked with people's home lives.  One tends to find this in the health service and any sector in which people work around the clock.  It was a big change in the Garda.</p><p>  The other thing is that a number of members have commented, as the Deputy has, on the increased visibility of garda&iacute; when they are needed.  This has come back to us from several quarters.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that subsequent to Mr. Fitzpatrick's appearance here in March, the implementation body published its June report.  I was pleased to see greater itemisation of non-pay-related savings than I had seen to date.  Pages 7, 8 and 9 itemised the savings and outlined where the figures came from.  Am I correct in saying that the September report-----</p></speech>

However, my point still stands in that I can see progress in the itemisation of non-pay savings because that was a question I put to Mr. Fitzpatrick the last time.  I return to the point of verification, a point we discussed.  Paragraph 2.6 of the report outlines the four sample validations that were selected for evaluating the non-pay saving element.  To the best of my understanding, the second point listed, the implementation of a national single procurement model in the HSE, is the biggest ticket item of the non-pay savings identified across that period.  The third-party evaluation of it picked the big-ticket item of the &euro;430 million.  This was something of which I was critical in March and it has changed.  I wanted to acknowledge that.</p><p>  Is Mr. Fitzpatrick still satisfied that the evaluation methodology is as broad as it can be for logging these?  I will give an example to bring it to life.  On Tuesday evening at a meeting, which is now famous for other reasons, we had a discussion with representatives of the HSE.  The most interesting part of the meeting came at the very end of it when we had a discussion with Mr. Tony O'Brien about the new consultant contract and the saving of &euro;200 million.  His perspective was interesting.  He cautioned against saying that the new consultant contract would automatically deliver a saving of &euro;200 million.  His point was as follows: the consultants will work for different hours and they will see more people at different hours.  While that is the right thing to happen, of itself it will generate an on-cost of which one must be aware as we work through the year.  With that in mind, are we adopting the right approach in evaluating the non-pay savings resulting from the Croke Park agreement?</p></speech>

There was also the pensions issue which we were much more transparent about, if one likes.  We did not intentionally put in the footnote.  What is happening as well is that the reporting to us is improving.  This is the second report.  The reporting to us is improving all the time as well.  On our reporting, obviously we are learning as we go along as well because this was only the second report.  We did try to take on board the suggestions that were made here the last day.</p><p>  Members should not forget that the trade union people on the body would have knowledge of what is going on out there as well.  It is not just the management people who have knowledge of what is going on out there on the ground.  Certainly from the evaluations that have been carried out we have no evidence whatsoever to suggest that what we are getting is not correct.</p><p>  On the issue of the consultants, we have not been given any figure yet as to what might materialise from the consultants.  So we have got no figure on that yet from the Department.</p></speech>

Up to June the annualised figure for non-pay savings is &euro;407 million - that is in the June report.  This area is crucial for the credibility of the entire Croke Park deal.  People who are not in the public service will be looking to the value of the other savings and reforms that have been made.  We could be telling those people more about our evaluation of those non-wage savings than the three bullet points we have here.</p></speech>

The full industrial relations machinery of the State, including the Labour Relations Commission, was exhausted to get to that point.  The working hours increased by approximately 1.5 hours on average.  Is that enough to allow us to say to the public that we are making the kind of change in work practice we need in local authorities?</p></speech>

That is what happened in local government.  They actually brought it through the LRC and Labour Court.  I think they were looking for 35 hours and got what came out of the court.  As I have said, the court decision is binding and that is what the agreement provides for.  That is one of the strengths of the agreement.  There have been some unpalatable decisions from the court for the trade union side, for example.  There certainly have been ones where there was quite significant loss of income.</p></speech>

It is more about time.  For example, if one looks at the Civil Service, I understand principal officers and assistant principals would have lost one day in annual leave.  More senior people in local government with high levels of leave lost a lot more.  There is no cash saving there as such because the people are still employed.  However, any extra hours, regardless of whether they come by way of less annual leave or other means, help to cope with the reduction in numbers.  That is where the benefit lies.  We had also to address the issue of what is an acceptable level of leave in those discussions.  There were seriously high figures in some areas over which nobody could stand.</p></speech>

So far, the agreement has coped robustly with whatever has come its way.  As I said earlier, big-ticket items have come its way.  I gave some examples of people losing real money, apart from pay cuts, as this is on top of that.  Of course something could happen.  Do I know of anything that is going to happen at the moment?

From my reading of that, it looks as though the break clause can only be implemented by the Government side of this agreement.  Only the Government can decide that the Croke Park agreement no longer applies.</p></speech>

I am not trying to be unhelpful, but it would not be helpful for me to speculate on this because there is much debate around these issues and a circular on some allowances has been issued in the last day or two.  How that is dealt with is really a matter for the employer and the trade unions.</p></speech>

I agree with the fiscal advisory council that everything should be on the table as we discuss the forthcoming budget and the adjustment that has to be made.  I think that includes increments and allowances.  I am trying to figure out, in respect of an interpretation of the break clause, whether one could use a discussion of increments and allowances as a reason to break the Croke Park agreement on the other side.  From my reading of the break clause, one could not.  I do not want to put words in Mr. Fitzpatrick's mouth but my-----</p></speech>

While the 40% allocation was in line with Department of Finance guidelines, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine considered it excessive when compared with the actual costs incurred.

An independent report from Grant Thornton referred to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's reasoning for not adhering to the guidelines, namely, that they were excessive, as being adequate and understandable.

Mr. Fitzpatrick seems to be prudent.  In the second progress report on the public service agreement 2010-14 he states the body is of the view that accelerating change needs to occur across all public service bodies in every sector with an increased sense of urgency.  I do not believe he has made that statement lightly.  Clearly, he has concerns that the rate of change is not fast enough.  He probably signed off on the document at the start of June.</p><p>  How long is Mr. Fitzpatrick's contract?  When the Minister was before the committee this morning, he indicated that there might be intransigence within some areas of the public sector at middle management level with respect to the changes required under the Croke Park agreement.  My fundamental view is that we do not need to reinvent the wheel, rather we need to get the agreement to work to maximum effect.  Are there jams within the system which prevent this from happening?  There are great people working in the public sector and I believe in the Croke Park agreement.  Nevertheless, it is about getting it to work to maximum capacity.</p><p>  With regard to redeployment, community welfare officers were transferred from the Department of Health to the Department of Social Protection.  I believed at the time that many of these personnel should have been assigned to the fraud detection section of the Department of Social Protection.  My understanding is they have not been.  Their local knowledge is unrivalled.</p><p>  Will Mr. Fitzpatrick provide the context in terms of where he sees the agreement working and where there are weaknesses?  Where does he see a need for oil to be applied to get the agreement to work to its maximum potential?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-11a.405" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P. J.

As the Deputy knows, it is not a full-time role.  As the contract took in the wording of the agreement, there is no specific date.  If the agreement ceases to operate, the contract will cease.</p><p>  We did not make the comment referred to lightly.  It was a considered statement that was subscribed to by management and union personnel.  It is a statement on behalf of the nine members of the body.  I also agree that there are thousands working very hard and trying to cope with fewer staff.  In many cases they are doing a really good job.  </p><p>  The main issues of concern are the big ticket items such as shared services.  We can see how much can be saved in the Civil Service, particularly in areas such as education and local government.  There is another in which we have sought more information, although I am not arguing that nothing has happened.  Nevertheless, we do not have information from the voluntary sector.  There is a significant amount spent in the health sector on voluntary hospitals and mental handicap organisations.  Smaller voluntary organisations are also funded by the State.</p></speech>

We know something is happening in some of these areas because we can read or hear about it.  We have asked for more information from the sector which accounts for a figure of &euro;4 billion or &euro;5 billion per year.  We mention this at the end of the report.  It is a big sector.</p><p>  To be fair, in the health sector in general there has been much progress and the sector has driven many reforms.  The budgetary position has, however, become more rather than less challenging and there has been negligible growth.  In making the statement we were very conscious that the agreement would be required to deliver more and more in order to enable the Government to meet its budgetary targets.  There are big ticket items, particularly shared services, to consider.  We have seen some good progress in local government, with project teams and offices driving the process on.  The people concerned are working with Mr. Paul Reid in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The education sector is also being pushed in this way.  These are the big areas and they have been included from the start.  Some are working better than others.</p></speech>

At the last meeting there was a question as to whether it moved at the pace of the slowest mover.  That is definitely not true.  There are some really good examples, such as the prisons area.

I would need to think about it.  As I said, there are some areas that have surprised everyone and the prisons is certainly one where there has been really good progress.  The Garda is another.  It has not just been the rosters in the Garda but there has been other serious stuff as well, including performance management.  In fairness, the health sector has been driving big change as well.

I have a quick question relating to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  I do not mean to pick on that Department but it is project No. 1 in the Grant Thornton report and I have not got any further, so all my questions are initially about that Department.  A sum of &euro;30 million annually in savings are expected, along with a reduction of 400 staff.  That &euro;30 million will come from four areas - the number of staff retiring, the number of staff redeployed, the number of retained offices enhanced and the number of offices closed.  The saving includes staff redeployed, which means staff coming off the books of the Department and not working there any more.  They will come off the balance sheet and we will see a saving of their salary costs.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

I know he is under a time constraint as he must go to meet the Taoiseach.</p><p>  I have a different view of the Croke Park agreement but I sat here willing to be convinced about the whole process.  I wondered why I had so many reservations about it.  The pace of change and reform, which is critical to the survival of the State, is very slow and tedious.  By comparison, in the private sector when the market closed down, everything chopped and changed, places closed and people lost their jobs and income.  Despite this, in the public sector, we have the Croke Park agreement which has undoubtedly delivered but at a pace that does not compare with the private sector.  That is the issue I have with the agreement.  The Croke Park agreement also protects the level of pay, which is out of kilter with the private sector.  Sometimes increments, which are added on each year, create a massive difference when one compares a low paid employee in the public sector and the private sector.  While all those involved in the Croke Park agreement might be quite happy about the progress within the rules they have fashioned, when it is benchmarked against the private sector it leaves a great deal to be desired.</p><p>  My next remarks are no reflection on Mr. Fitzpatrick, and I appreciate his frank exchange at this meeting.  The four senior civil servants, four trade union members and a chair seem to conduct business as usual.  Should the implementation body have been expanded to include someone different from the outside who would be able to give a flavour of the comparison between public and private sector operations?  Change is being driven by the reduction in budgets.  If there is significant reduction in a budget because of the economic collapse, one must shed staff or cut pay.  Acceptance is built on the reality that the State cannot do any more.  We were setting out to buy peace, where in fact there was no war.</p><p>  I appreciate that Mr. Fitzpatrick came before the Committee of Public Account and gave us an explanation of the facts and figures.  I wish him well in his work.</p></speech>

With each passing year, the agreement has improved, but that does not take from what has to be done as a matter of urgency.  We have emphasised the urgency of the situation.</p><p>  I thank the Chairman and members for their interest in our work.  We appreciate the discussion we have had with members.  It has been very useful for us too.</p></speech>

Agreed.  We will deal with the minutes from 9 October at our next meeting.  On matters arising from the minutes, I note the correspondence received.</p><p>  Item 3A is correspondence from Accounting Officers.  Correspondence dated 4 October 2012 is from Mr. Tom Boland, chief executive of the Higher Education Authority, in respect of the committee meeting of 27 September 2012, to be noted and published.  Correspondence dated 21 June 2012 from Mr. Pat Geoghegan, secretary of the Irish Environmental Forum, alleging waste of public funds is to be noted.  This matter was referred to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government for a note on the issues raised and also to the Comptroller and Auditor General for appropriate follow-up in the context of his audit of that body.  I have checked with the clerk.  The EPA comes under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In the context of that letter, there are a number of pieces of information that need to be clarified.  I ask that they be clarified in order that if members want to raise it with the Accounting Officers when they come in, we can refer to the note from the Comptroller and Auditor General or the note from the Minister's Department.</p><p>  Item 3B.2 is correspondence dated 2 October 2012 from Deputy Derek Nolan re HSE west property rental budget, to be noted and published.  The matter was referred to the HSE for a note and to the Comptroller and Auditor General for the appropriate follow-up in the context of the annual audit.</p><p>  Correspondence dated 1 October 2012 is from an anonymous source re the prison officers social club Castlerea and is to be noted.  This may not come within the remit of the committee as it relates to a social club funds.  However, as it alleges inappropriate use of moneys, we will refer it to the Garda Commissioner for appropriate follow-up and comment.</p><p>  On the issue of individual correspondence and complaints, the first two matter, 3.1 and 3C were deferred from previous meeting because they relate to issues raised by Deputy Mary Lou McDonald.  I discussed this with the Deputy and she asked that if she was not here today, because of the structure of the meeting, that they would be deferred again.  With the permission of the meeting, that can be done.</p><p>  Item 3C.3 is correspondence dated 27 July 2012 from Ms Julie O'Shea in respect of the second home charge and fine.  This has been noted.  The collection of the household charge is a matter for each local authority and is outside the remit of the committee.  However, we will ask the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to examine this complaint to ensure the local authority levys the appropriate change on this individual.  The Department will be asked to deal with this matter directly.  Presumably when that has been dealt with, we will get a copy of the correspondence.  With all of these new charges, it is important the issues that come out of them are followed up in order that we can improve the process of collection and so on.</p><p>  Item 3C.4 is correspondence dated 18 September 2012 from Mr. Martin Moore and Company, Main Street, Blennerville, Tralee, County Kerry.  This is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  This is to be noted.  We have dealt with his issue.</p><p>  Item 3C.5 is correspondence dated 23 September 2012 from Mr. C. Callan in County Clare re the budget.  Again, this is a policy issue and is not for the committee.  We can refer it to the Department of Finance for comment.</p><p>  Item 3C.6 is correspondence dated 26 September 2012 from Mr. Michael Brosnan, North Circular Road, Dublin 7, re Mr. Charles Farrell.  This is to be noted.  We have dealt with this matter arising from previous correspondence</p><p>  Item 3D relates to documents before this committee - opening statements - and we will publish them.</p><p>  Item 4 is reports and statements and accounts received since our meeting of 4 October 2012.  They are listed from 4.1.to 4.6, all to be noted.</p></speech>

On behalf of the select committee, I welcome the T&aacute;niste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, and his officials to the meeting.  The purpose of this meeting is to discuss with the T&aacute;naiste the policy choices that might be considered so that the cost of activities of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade can be made within the fixed expenditure ceiling for 2013.  The expenditure ceilings for each of the years 2012 and 2013 were fixed in the context of the three-year multi-annual framework that was established by the Governments' Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2012-14.  An indicative ceiling was set for 2014.  This means that the focus of our discussion should be on how a limited provision might be allocated rather on the adequacy of the overall provision.</p><p>  This is an opportunity to engage formally with the T&aacute;naiste on his spending plans for next year before that year commences.  This is a significant and a very welcome innovation in the way spending is done.  It gives practical effect to one of the core principles that the Government has said runs through all its budgetary reforms.  The principle is that in a democracy better decisions are made when policy makers are held to account and when the entire policy making process is subject to a parliamentary oversight, scrutiny and participation.  Parliamentary input into the resource allocation process has traditionally happened only in the context of the approval of Revised Estimates.  Typically, committees have not had the opportunity to consider these Estimates until half way through the year when much of the financial provision being debated had already been spent.  Key to our discussion is that there is no Estimate before the committee for discussion.  This is an opportunity to influence the options that will be considered in formulating the Estimates later.  </p><p>  The select committee had a very constructive engagement with the T&aacute;naiste in May this year on the 2012 Estimates and it was aided by the enhanced format, which reflected the move to performance based budgeting.  This select committee is the first committee to road-test the advanced scrutiny process.  I know that members and the T&aacute;naiste, as always, will engage constructively here.</p><p>  I propose we hear an opening presentation from the T&aacute;naiste and that we structure the subsequent discussion by considering each of the five programmes in turn.  Are members agreeable to our proceeding in this way?  Agreed.  Before I invite the T&aacute;naiste to make his presentation, I remind him that there are two new members of the select committee since he was last here.  Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe has replaced Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Loughlainn for the Sinn F&eacute;in Party and Deputy Brendan Smith has replaced Deputy Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l for the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  I note Deputy Olivia Mitchell is not present but she may arrive later.  I am conscious that the T&aacute;naiste is under a time constraint as he has an important meeting at 3.45 p.m. and will need to leave at 3.40 p.m. if that is agreeable to the members.  I hand over to the T&aacute;naiste.</p></speech>

I had an opportunity at a meeting of the Joint Committee on European Affairs Committee to have a discussion with Deputy Crowe in his new capacity and I look forward to working with both Deputies.</p><p>  Our exchanges this afternoon represents another step in the ongoing reform of the budgetary process.  As the Chairman has stated, this is the first time an Oireachtas committee has discussed the formation of the annual departmental Estimates in advance of the finalisation of the budget.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate and I will bear the views of members in mind in considering the distribution of the funds allocated to my Department.  I hope the members can agree that this is not the occasion for a debate on wider Government budgetary policy.  There will be an opportunity for such a debate the week after next in the House and, therefore, I will confine my remarks today to the priorities and resourcing of my Department for 2013. </p><p>  As part of the performance budgeting system, we presented more detail in the 2012 Estimates on our expenditure plans and on the relationship between money being spent and targets being achieved.  A range of relevant indicators provide benchmarks against which the performance of the Department can be measured.  While this approach is still in its formative stages, I hope members are finding it helpful and I believe it will contribute to greater public understanding of the Department's work.</p><p>  In preparing the Estimates for 2013, we will again set ambitious, attainable targets that reflect the programme for Government, are in line with the Department's statement of strategy and take account of the available resources.  The new budgetary procedures operate within the framework of the overall limits on Government spending which, as members know, are set in accordance with the troika programme.  Within that overall amount, expenditure ceilings were set for each Department for 2013 in the comprehensive expenditure report last November.  For the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that amounts to &euro;733 million for delivery of the diverse range of citizen services, economic promotion, programme management and policy advisory functions discharged by the Department across the globe.  That ceiling is also fixed.  Any increase for one programme is necessarily at the expense of another activity.  Members can be assured that I will be working to ensure that we get the maximum value from the available funds.  </p><p>  In July, my Department forwarded to the committee a working-through of the implications of the comprehensive expenditure report on the allocations for 2013.  The overall level of reduction foreseen was &euro;27.7 million across the two Votes for which I am responsible.  At the request of the committee, we modelled the impact of a <i>pro rata </i>reduction across the various departmental programmes. The effect on the services we deliver and the outcomes we pursue is described in the accompanying commentary.   </p></speech>

I will go through each programme as efficiently as possible because of the time constraints.  I ask members to confine themselves to asking questions rather than making statements.  Everyone will get to contribute on five occasions.  I am conscious that the T&aacute;naiste has an important commitment.  We will start with Vote 28, which has four sections.  The first area relates to the promotion of this country's economic and trade interests in Europe and internationally.  I ask members to confine their questions to that area and we will address the other areas in sequence.</p></speech>

This is a new committee from my perspective.  The material we received was prepared by the Department in July 2012.  What was the expenditure profile of the Department at the end of September?  If there is an underspend in some areas it would help us in trying to assess where it might be possible to make savings.  We can come back to the issue later if the T&aacute;naiste prefers.</p></speech>

A question that springs to mind on trade is related to the remit of the Department.  Am I correct in stating many of the staff in the embassies will be transferred home for the EU Presidency?  What impact will this have on trade?  Some consular offices have only one or two members of staff.  At a time when there is pressure on us to promote trade, what will be the impact on the Department?  If one loses a vice consul, is pressure then placed on the consul in any given area?  I am thinking of areas such as San Francisco, which is to lose staff.  A considerable proportion of the trade between Ireland and the United States is associated with the region incorporating San Francisco.  If we are withdrawing staff from this area, what will be the impact?  People refer to the positive role of embassy staffs, including individuals, in some areas with regard to the promotion of trade.</p><p>  With a view to saving money, could the staff of the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and consular services be placed in one building such that we would have a one-stop shop?  There are cost implications but, in the longer term, it would be ideal.  Everyone would be singing from the same hymn sheet.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-11a.533" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1005" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOS2012101100004#C00300"><p>Earlier today, I was at two events, one of which concerned the global hunger index and the other the girl child.  I have these in mind making my contribution.  I listened to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, talking about sustainable development.  He made a point about the commitment to overseas development aid and millennium development goals and stated our overseas development aid programme focuses on promoting sustainability, food and nutrition, and security, and that the new, more practical approach will create greater opportunities for the meaningful involvement of the private sector.</p><p>  Having been at a conference on Africa recently, at which we were examining the wealth of that Continent, particularly in terms of minerals and natural resources, I noted the conflict that can arise between those who wish to exploit natural resources and those who are trying to use the land to produce food.  We must be conscious of ethical engagement if there are Irish companies involved in meaningful trade.  We must not go down the route of many other countries and multinational companies by engaging in a land grab that does not have the best interest of the African communities at heart.  The question of trade, therefore, is broad.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-11a.534" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1030" speakername="Eric Byrne" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOS2012101100004#C00400"><p>It is interesting that the closure of the embassies did not affect our re-establishment of the beef trade with Iran.  This should be welcomed.  The closing of an embassy does not mean the doors will be closed on one forever.</p><p>  I appreciate that the Africa strategy is relatively young.  However, we are becoming increasingly conscious, as we drift away from the black-baby box concept, that there are countries within the continent of Africa that are of growing economic importance.  Is there preliminary feedback on our trade with African colleagues?</p><p>  The President is in Brazil at present and I understand he is accompanied by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  As the Minister is formulating his budget for next year, he should target the BRIC countries.  There is no doubt that we have done a good day's work already in Brazil through heightening our profile.  I am not quite sure, however, that we are benefiting sufficiently from our relationships with Russia and India.</p><p>  We see Chinese visitors in our Parliament every other week, which clearly indicates there is great interest in Ireland in China.  I understand the DIT is doing phenomenally well in establishing a college in China, where it will specialise in tourism and catering.  We are contributing in that regard.  Given the excellent relationship we are developing with China, is there any tangible sign yet of knock-on effects such as investment or growth in Ireland?</p><p>  We should concentrate on the developing countries that are now powerful.  I congratulate those who decided to incorporate the trade mission with the presidential visits.  I congratulate the President, who has taken time out to learn Spanish at Santander university in Spain.</p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste's Department is the poster-boy Department.  We would very much like to see its funding retained.  I hope the funding will follow the T&aacute;naiste as he is to be chairman of the OSCE next year.  We could debate that another day.  Next year will be very important.  The budgetary allocation for a successful six-month term of the EU Presidency is important.</p></speech>

After a quick perusal, it seems that if changes were made in respect of programme A, it would seriously impair our engagement with Asia.  Change in respect of the second programme would have serious consequences for recipient organisations.  In respect of programme C, the funds are already oversubscribed.  With regard to the fourth programme, cuts would jeopardise key interests of the State.  There is an expenditure ceiling.  Is there a circle to be squared?  Is there money to be saved that has not been saved?  Can the Department not identify the savings that it needs?  I may be misreading the documentation.</p></speech>

A number of Departments and agencies are involved in the trade function.  These include the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has responsibility for Bord Bia and food exports.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is responsible for tourism activity.  A number of other Departments now have a trade role, including the Department of Education and Skills.  Education is now a product being traded.</p><p>  We are seeking to have co-ordination.  The lead role in any country is taken by the embassy.</p></speech>

We will now turn to Vote 28, programme B, which pertains to consular, passport and Irish abroad services.  Some of these subjects already have been covered.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-11a.539" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/970" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOS2012101100005#D00300"><p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste's commitment to enhance further the delivery of the passport service.  I wish to record my thanks to staff in the Passport Office and the T&aacute;naiste's own office because while dealing with constituency work during the summer, I encountered plenty of issues.  A media campaign still is required to encourage people to apply for passports in time.  All members receive weekend calls on Friday evenings or Saturday mornings involving people going on holidays or whatever.  However, I wish to record my appreciation for the assistance of the staff involved.  As for the Irish abroad programme, all members are aware that unfortunately, people still are living in difficult circumstances in the major cities in Britain, the United States and elsewhere.  The Irish abroad programme has been highly successful and it is clear, from visiting different Irish communities in different cities, particularly in Britain, the assistance that has been given is valued.  However, such assistance probably still is needed.</p><p>  I have often thought that with society having more active retired people, there may be an opportunity to engage with people who are retired from employment and to get them involved.  For several years, the numbers of people active within the Irish community have been declining and the age profile has been rising.  While the embassy staff would be in a better position to judge, I believe an opportunity exists to engage more people.  During the passage through the Oireachtas of the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Bill, Deputies Crowe and Maureen O'Sullivan and I met people from London who were dealing with Irish people who had been the victims of abuse in residential institutions.  There still is a major need to provide assistance and help to many Irish people living in many different communities.  Consequently, I am anxious for the maintenance of whatever assistance is possible for that programme, as it is put to good use by volunteers in those cities.</p></speech>

On what is that figure based?  Is it based on previous years?  As for the emigrants' service, I am conscious it is estimated that over the past three years, approximately 200,000 mainly young Irish people have emigrated abroad.  I believe 87,000 did so last year, 81,500 in 2010 and probably tens of thousands this year.  I presume the demand for services and support will be a lot higher in consequence.  How can the Department support such demand?  Much of the emigrants' services provided in Britain are directed towards an older population.  Is there the same demand for some of those younger people who are going there?  All members have received the telephone call at the weekend to the effect that Mary or Johnny so-and-so has been arrested in the United States or is in difficulty in Australia.  What is in place in that regard?  Based on previous experience, I presume demand will rise again this year.</p></speech>

I also wish to note my appreciation of the great help I always have received - particularly this summer when it appears as though very many people forgot to check their passports.  Certainly, where help could be given it was, which I appreciate.  However, there has been slippage in the time regarding the general queueing at the Passport Office and it is good that changes are planned.  Moreover, the online service is a great idea and is particularly useful because so many Irish people now live abroad.  I presume it will also be available to them as such a service will be a great bonus for people renewing their passports.  When does the T&aacute;naiste expect the online service to be up and running?</p></speech>

All of us have come across genuine emergencies requiring immediate issue of passports and the service has been extremely co-operative and supportive.</p><p>  In response to the tragic history of abuse of our passports by agents of other governments, including Israel and, perhaps, Russia, improvements have been made to the bolometric structures attached to passports.  How secure are our passports compared to those of other countries?  Are we at a stage where agents of foreign countries will no longer be able to abuse our passports?</p></speech>

It was a hard question and I ask her to give me a bit more time to think about it.  The Department has made considerable savings over the last three years in respect of money and staff numbers.  I pay tribute to the staff of the Department for meeting increased demands for services with fewer people and resources.</p><p>  We expect the online service for renewal of passports for adults to be available worldwide by the end of 2013.  I thank members for their complimentary remarks about the passport service.  We have seen a significant improvement in the service over the course of last year.  The performance target for 2012 was to process 60% of passport express applications within ten days and 90% within 15 days.  In 2012 we managed to process 78% of passport express applications within ten days and 99.55% within 15 days.  As of 30 September 2012, 529,152 passports have been produced this year, which represents an increase of almost 4% on last year&rsquo;s figure.  We also intend to introduce a different counter management system and an appointment system in order to address the issue of queueing.  We are now at the upper end and are probably world leaders in terms of security of our passports.  We intend to introduce a higher specification passport booklet next year to further enhance the security of Irish passports and reduce the potential for abuse.</p><p>  Deputies Smith and Crowe raised the issue of the Irish abroad.  We are trying to address two situations.  The first is the longer term emigrant, that is, people who emigrated in the 1950s and 1960s and in many cases sent back remittances to Ireland.  Some of these emigrants are living in difficult circumstances and we continue to provide support to emigrant services in the UK and the United States.  These kinds of support services tend to be more heavily dependent on grant aid from the Department, whereas younger emigrants are more dependent on consular services.</p><p>  We have opened an emigrant support service in Toronto in Canada and are working with the Canadian Department of Citizenship and Immigration to support our emigrants.  When the Canadian Minister for Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism, Jason Kenney, visited Ireland last week he announced an increase in the number of visas available to Irish people working in Canada, as well as an extension in the validity of visas from one to two years.</p><p>  The GAA makes a significant contribution by acting as a point of contact with younger emigrants.  We are working with the GAA to provide support to young emigrants.</p><p>  The total number of consular cases is higher than 1,500 but this is an estimate of the serious cases which require a degree of attention.  It is difficult to predict the number of cases in a given year but our estimates are based on experience.</p></speech>

That club is very thankful for the funding that the Department provides and the same can be said for many other emigrant groups.</p><p>  As I want to spend more time on Vote 27, poverty and hunger reduction, I propose to take Vote 28, subheads C and D, together.  Subhead C is reconciliation and co-operation on this Ireland and D is international peace, security and human rights.</p></speech>

Our excellent reputation will be severely tarnished if Irish companies get involved in tax evasion and tax avoidance in African countries.</p><p>  On subhead C, I presume the key outputs continue to be the maintenance of peace and stability and support for better mutual understanding.  However, we will make a mockery of this budget unless we deal with human rights issues involving certain prisoners in Northern Ireland.  Peace and stability will be undermined if these issues are not addressed.  The response from the T&aacute;naiste to my questions on this subject is that the Department is monitoring the situation as it affects Marian Price and others.  I will not go down the road of discussing their political views because I am concerned about their human rights.  If Ms Price either leaves prison as a skeleton or dies in prison, peace and stability will be severely undermined.</p><p>  The Defence Forces have earned a superb reputation for peacekeeping but I am concerned about Irish money being spent on peacekeeping operations which involve armies from other countries with questionable reputations.  Members of some of these armies have been involved in the rape of young women, robberies and assaults.</p></speech>

They have targeted the most disadvantaged communities and I have engaged with departmental officials in advocating and promoting schemes.  I hope it will be possible to continue this work.  The danger of trouble and thuggery is ever present in some communities and it was disheartening to see over the summer that certain political leaders lacked the guts or decency to condemn the thuggery that occurred in north Belfast in particular.  We must be careful to ensure these events do not spiral out of control.</p><p>  The International Fund for Ireland has done excellent work since it was established in the mid-1980s.  It has managed to leverage a considerable amount of community activity in the Six Counties and the six Southern Border counties.  I wish the T&aacute;naiste well in his chairmanship of the OSCE.  Preparatory for the chairmanship since it was decided in 2009 that Ireland would hold the chairmanship.</p></speech>

It indicates significant matters are outstanding and need to be addressed in the area of reconciliation and anti-sectarian funding.  We had another snapshot of this earlier this year to remind us that these difficulties remain.  Many awkward discussions, as described by my party colleagues, are going on in many communities and they need to be encouraged and built on as they involved people who were involved in the past in the conflict.  They are trying to create a new beginning following the hurt imposed on many individuals.  The sectarian footprint is still bubbling away under the surface and the committee can send a positive message that we need to continue the peace building and support of community relations.  All of us are worried about cutbacks to the funding, particularly for the positive inter-community work which is being carried on quietly.  Senator McAleese is doing significant work with people from a loyalist background.  We need to support and encourage this and it would send the wrong message if we cut funds in this area.</p></speech>

That brings it very much into focus how tenuous relationships are between the two communities, particularly when 30,000 loyal Unionists march and there are counter-demonstrations.  Then we read the Marian Price statements and hear that a thousand people attended the funeral of a Real IRA member in Dublin.  It makes us sharply conscious that Northern Ireland has not gone away.  It is amazing that in 2012 such scenarios exist.  The State still has to watch the peace process carefully and nurture the progressive community development programmes funded by the Government.</p><p>  Vote 27 also deals with international co-operation and expenditure on civil society programmes.  The work and targeted funding through overseas aid programmes on issues such as HIV-AIDS and education is admirable.  Irish Aid's work is phenomenally important and it helps us in the international arena to raise Ireland's profile, which is out of proportion with its size in comparison to other aid agencies.  I support the budget to maintain spending in this field.</p></speech>

There is North-South co-operation, the work of the North-South Ministerial Council and work I do in conjunction with both the First Minister and Deputy First Minister in Northern Ireland at a number of levels.  First, there is the issue raised by a number of Deputies, notwithstanding the progress at political and institutional level in the North, about the continuing underlying sectarian difficulties in many communities.  That is why we have the funds to promote co-operation and tackle sectarianism, which are important.  European Union PEACE funding has also been provided.  We have been in discussion with the UK Administration about this issue because there are differing views between Ireland and the UK, for example, on the composition of the EU budget to 2020.  The UK wants to reduce the budget while Ireland wants to maintain it and there will be consequences in all of that for PEACE funding.  That is something to which we are giving a high priority.</p><p>  I have discussed the issue of prisoners and the case of Marian Price, which was mentioned by Deputy O'Sullivan, with the recently appointed Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and his predecessor.  It has been discussed at official level and I have discussed it with the Northern Ireland Minister of Justice, David Ford, who has devolved responsibility for prisons.  It is something about which we are concerned and we will keep it to the fore in our discussions with the UK.  Following this meeting I will meet the shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, but I have discussed it in recent times with the Secretary of State.</p><p>  Deputy O'Sullivan raised the issue of investment and so on.  Our Africa strategy is based on ethical investment and absolute adherence to good taxation practices and national laws.  Our participation in peacekeeping missions is on the basis of UN mandate.  It does not require us to work closely with each member of the UN-mandated force.  We usually work with partners such as the Nordic states.  With regard to the behaviour of armies, we have been one of the promoters of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 and we were one of the first countries to adopt a national action plan in that regard.  Our mission and permanent representative at the UN is very much to the fore in the promotion of human rights issues at all times in UN discussions.</p><p>  The budget for the OSCE was a once-off but that does not mean we do not have that money next year.  The money was there because the OSCE chairmanship was happening in 2012 and it will not be repeated but, in 2013, we have the EU Presidency and we have to make that happen with our resources as well.</p></speech>

When the UN High Commissioner for Refugees appeared before the committee earlier, he praised Ireland's contribution over the past decade in many areas, particularly sub-Saharan Africa.  The Chairman acknowledged well, on behalf of the Oireachtas, that we appreciated his commendation of the work of Irish Aid in many countries.  The work, which is varied, has been hugely important.  Deputy O'Sullivan referred to encouraging funding development rather than only providing humanitarian assistance.  Does the &euro;514 million allocation include money from other Departments such as the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine?  That Department used to provide &euro;7 million or &euro;8 million and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government used to make a contribution as well.</p><p>  Deputy Eric Byrne outlined, correctly, the number of disturbing incidents that occurred in the past few weeks relating to Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

How will we reach that target?  I believe the aid budget has been cut by a third in recent years.  Most people who are active in this area wonder how we will reach the target.  If there are to be cuts, what areas will be cut?  Will this have a direct impact, resulting in children not being fed?  What impacts will there be down the line?  What programmes will need to be cut back?  Every year we hear of a new crisis in a different part of the world.  What will do if the money is not there and the demands are?  Clearly, things are getting worse in many countries.  People have pointed out that the T&aacute;naiste gave the speech in New York and then announced a cut when he came back to Ireland.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the work of the Minister, Deputy Howlin, in keeping the focus on it in last year's budget, and I wish the T&aacute;naiste well in doing the same this year.

If we have a set budget and there is a significant sequence of earthquakes, tsunamis or whatever, are we strictly bound by the terms of the budget?  I note that we recently released additional money for Syria and South Sudan.  One thinks of money always being available in emergencies.  Do we need to stick rigidly to the budget regardless of tsunamis or other international crises, or do we have access to additional funding?</p><p>  I commend those involved in the rapid response initiative.  There are unofficial ambassadors representing Ireland in all sorts of agencies.  We are engaging with the diaspora to bring investment to Ireland.  However, we have not yet rewarded people who volunteer for rapid responses to crises throughout the world.  They deserve some sort of recognition or status because they drop whatever they are doing to go off and do phenomenal humanitarian work.</p></speech>

The revised allocation for this year is &euro;514 million and the allocation under subhead E is &euro;524 million.  Does this indicate that the allocation is increasing?  If that is so, why is the ratio of ODA to GNP reducing?  Is GNP increasing at such a rate that the ratio is dropping?  Obviously, it is great if the amount is increasing but the target as a percentage of GNP is important and we need to have our ducks in a row.</p></speech>

However, we need to continue to work on it, which is why my Department continues its very vigilant engagement on Northern Ireland and the North-South relationship.  That is why we had people on the ground during the parades and other events that took place during the summer.  It is a responsibility of my Department to which I give top priority.  It is not possible to underestimate the maintenance work we need to do on it.  While it is not always in the news, it requires ongoing work.  There is a very big commitment from my Department to working with Northern Ireland institutions, the First Minister, the Deputy First Minister and so on.  While I know a separate committee deals with Northern Ireland issues, it is probably a matter to which we should return.</p><p>  The &euro;514 million does not include the contribution of other Departments in the area of overseas aid.  Regarding what Deputy Crowe said, I did not say at the UN that we would meet the 0.7% target by 2015; I said that we were committed to meeting the 0.7% target and that we would do so when we are able to do so economically and as our economic situation improves.  I do not believe anybody expects us to meet the 0.7% target by 2015 in our present economic difficulties and therefore there is no merit in our making statements to that effect.  The 0.7% is the target that has been agreed internationally.  We are aiming at that target and remain committed to reaching it.  As evidence of our good faith, it is important to point out that in difficult times we are maintaining our aid budget.  There were significant reductions in the aid budget in previous years, with reductions of approximately 30% since 2008.  The Government has maintained our commitment to aid.</p><p>  Deputy Mitchell asked about the difference between the &euro;514 million and the &euro;524 million.  It is based on a proportion of GNP and we do not know the GNP with ongoing quarterly revisions.</p></speech>

I saw it myself during the summer when I went to Mogadishu.  I was the first Irish Minister to go there for about 20 years.  We see appalling conditions in refugee camps.  One sees our financial commitment, the support we give to NGOs and how much it means.  I saw children attending schools and the rubble of a devastated city.  I saw schools being rebuilt and being used for a variety of other purposes.  We must maintain our commitment to and faith in the poorest people in the world.  It is the right thing to do and strengthens this country's reputation.  As I said when we were talking about the trade issues earlier, apart from it being the right thing to do, it will also benefit us in the long run.  We are now opening up opportunities for trade in places where we were providing aid years ago during famines.</p><p>  In respect of emergencies-----</p></speech>

The State's objective is to reach the 0.7% target and we are not demurring from that.  We remain committed to it.  As everybody knows, the question of when we reach that target is dependent on our economic recovery.  We have maintained the figure above 0.5%, which is still in the top end of the league table of commitment internationally.  There is great appreciation of the fact that we have maintained it at that level.  The figure of 0.7% is the target towards which we will work but reaching it is, as everybody knows, dependent on our economic recovery and the improvement in our financial circumstances.</p><p>  In respect of the issue raised by Deputy Eric Byrne, emergencies vary from year to year.  We have a fund from which we draw money to deal with emergencies.  Deputy O'Sullivan raised the issue of consultants in the aid area.  They deal mainly with the evaluations as our programmes must be evaluated.  Much of that is for evaluation and auditing of the programmes.  Deputy Eric Byrne raised the issue of the recognition of volunteers who work in developing countries.  This year for the first time, the President will give awards to members of the Irish diaspora in recognition of their work.  People who have worked and are working in development are included in that honours list and will be recognised as part of the presidential awards.  </p></speech>

We see evidence of this economically, from the visitors to this committee and from our visits abroad.  There is no doubt that the Irish Aid programme is one of the best out there.  Most of the money we give to our NGOs is well-spent.  The T&aacute;naiste is aware that the committee will be visiting Sierra Leone with Irish Aid officials for three or four days next week to see at first hand the funding that is allocated from that programme to Sierra Leone.  This is the first time an Oireachtas committee will visit a post-conflict area instead of a programme country.</p><p>  I am conscious of the T&aacute;naiste's time.  I thank him for attending the meeting and engaging so constructively with the committee.   I look forward to working with him and the committee on the year's budgetary process.  I know the T&aacute;naiste and the committee will play an increasingly relevant role in it.  I also acknowledge and welcome his senior officials: David Cooney, Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; Brendan Rogers, director general of Irish Aid; David Donoghue, assistant secretary, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; and Barry Robinson, assistant secretary, corporate services division, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I thank them for being with us.  We tried to run the meeting as efficiently as possible.  I know the T&aacute;naiste has a very busy private secretary beckoning him to proceed to his next appointment.  We again thank him.</p></speech>

The number of applications to conduct clinical trials in Europe fell by 25% between 2007 and 2011.  The costs of conducting such trials also increased in the same period.  The clinical trials Directive 2001/20/EC has been strongly criticised for contributing to delays and increasing the administrative burden.  The Commission has, therefore, prepared COM (2012) 369 to provide a regulatory framework to address the shortcomings identified in the 2001 directive.  As the proposal is broadly welcomed by the Department of Health, it is proposed it does not warrant further scrutiny, but I suggest the committee write to the Department to ask that it be kept up to date on significant developments.

We welcome the opportunity to appear before it.  I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Shane Dempsey, head of consumer foods, who will make the majority of the presentation.  I will make some introductory remarks on the overall position in the agrifood sector.</p><p>  Agrifood is our most important indigenous industry.  In total, between direct jobs, indirect jobs and linkages with the wider agricultural and rural community, approximately 230,000 people are employed in the sector, or one in eight jobs in the economy.  That is the same of number of jobs as there are in the car industry in Germany.  It is, therefore, our single most important industry.  As we have seen in some of the announcements made in recent days, it has its highs and lows.  It is under a lot of pressure in the domestic marketplace, but at the same time it is at the cutting edge of innovation in the overall food sector, not just on an Irish or European basis but on a global basis.</p><p>  The profile of the food industry includees 690 enterprises, 94% of them being SMEs and 6% being large companies.  Many of them have a strong export focus, but they also supply the domestic market.  We sell about &euro;9 billion worth of goods into the economy and about &euro;9 billion into overseas economies.  Food Harvest 2020, the strategy housed in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, was strongly industry-led in its development and has a vision of smart, green growth, with an ambitious export target figure of &euro;12 billion by 2020.  The industry is strongly linked with the broader economy and accounts for two thirds of exports by Irish companies.  We purchase &euro;11.5 billion worth of raw materials, other products and services in the domestic economy, while accounting for 90% of agricultural output. </p><p>  There are key drivers in the industry.  Competitiveness is vital, as is the brand, regardless of whether one is selling directly to the consumer or other businesses.  Reputation is very important.  Food safety underpins any food business operator in this or any other state.  The reputational issues that flow from this are of vital importance to the food industry, as we attempt to maintain and grow our share of the domestic market and, particularly, export markets.  From our perspective, it is vitally important that the image of the food industry and its reputation are not just protected but also enhanced.</p></speech>

I thank all the members who are present for the interest they have shown in this crucial issue.  We believe the State is failing in its duty of care to protect the health of children.  The facts bear this out.  One in four children at primary school level is overweight or obese, as is one in five teenagers.  Those rates are rising despite the measures being taken by the food industry, as outlined by the previous speaker.  Some 23% of heart disease, which is responsible for approximately 2,000 deaths in Ireland each year, can be attributed to obesity.  If legislators do not act decisively, we face an even worse future and the prospect of a generation blighted by chronic disease, long-term ill-health and premature death.</p><p>  At a time when the rights of children are at the centre of the political agenda, it is extraordinary that so little is being done to protect them from the powerful environmental forces that can lead to children being overweight or obese.  Political leadership is needed.  Up to now, responsibility has been pushed to parents and children themselves.  It seems that anti-obesity measures focus mainly on what parents and children can do to reduce risk.  Media campaigns and education programmes are valuable to a point, but we need to tackle the principal driver of obesity: the ever-growing availability of cheaper, tastier and more calorific foods and beverages.  Powerful and sophisticated marketing techniques that overwhelm parental will are resulting in the excessive consumption of energy-dense and nutrient-poor products.  Policies which could tackle this damaging food environment, such as the prohibition of the marketing of junk food to children, the introduction of traffic light labelling and the taxing of unhealthy drinks and foods, have been slow to win political support.</p><p>  I do not wish to criticise the Department of Health or the Minister, Deputy Reilly.  They deserve much credit for the important work of the special action group on obesity, which I am sure the committee will hear all about in a few minutes, but they cannot tackle this complex societal issue on their own.  Progress can only be achieved through a whole-of-Government approach, as Mr. Dempsey suggested.  Such an approach needs to be led by the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste and should be given solid support from all Departments, including the economic Departments that often bat for the industry.  Rather than having to make a choice between public health and the food industry, we are required to strike a balance between the two that puts children's needs to the fore.</p><p>  Higher rates of people being overweight and obesity are inevitable consequences of the commercial approach of producers of high calorie, low nutrition foods and drinks.  Their primary remit is to maximise profit for their shareholders by selling as much as they can.  The commercial requirement to keep selling more and excessive consumption go hand in hand, which means that industry self-regulation cannot work.  Therefore, the Government needs to make regulations that strike a reasonable balance between industry profitability and public health.</p><p>  We believe there are four immediate areas of action that could bring substantial public health benefits, lead to extra revenue for the Exchequer and provide food companies with incentives to provide healthier options.  We can take fiscal measures, for example, by introducing taxes and subsidies to promote health; we can protect children from marketing tactics; we can make schools healthier and more protected environments; and we can increase physical activity.</p><p>  As sugar sweetened beverages have no nutritional value, taxing them cannot be regressive.  It is estimated that children who consume such drinks receive approximately 20% of their recommended daily sugar intake from them.  In its pre-budget submission, the Irish Heart Foundation is calling for a sugar sweetened beverage tax that would increase the price of such products by 20%.  In addition to its obvious health benefits, this measure could yield approximately &euro;60 million in extra revenue that we believe should be used to subsidise the food industry to provide healthier options for children in particular.  This could also provide a win-win scenario for public health and the soft drink industry.  Sugar consumption would fall and the introduction of the tax would provide an impetus for the industry to reformulate its products, avoid the tax and potentially access new markets, as well as funding subsidies for healthy produce.  We are not calling for the introduction of a fat tax in our pre-budget submission.  Instead, we are asking for the immediate prioritisation of a full regulatory impact assessment, including a health impact assessment, of such taxation.</p><p>  My colleague, Ms Mulvihill, will go through the other measures we are advocating.  As the Chairman said, she is the health promotion manager of the Irish Heart Foundation.  She was also a member of the national obesity task force.</p></speech>

I am joined by Professor Donal O'Shea, Dr. Nazih Eldin from the HSE, Professor Mary Flynn from the Food Safety Authority of Ireland; Dr. Cliodhna Foley-Nolan from <i>safe</i>food, Dr. Catherine Woods from DCU, and Sandra Barnes from the Department of Health.</p><p>  The levels of obesity and people being overweight have increased at alarming speeds in recent years, so much so that obesity has been termed a global epidemic by the World Health Organization.  The problem was aggravated in recent years by our changing social, economic and physical environment, a dramatic reduction in the levels of physical activity and our changing dietary patterns.  Across Europe childhood obesity is reaching epidemic proportions.  It is well known that diets excessive in energy combined with physical inactivity are the key contributors to obesity.  However, as acknowledged by previous speakers, the relationship between these factors - what promotes obesity - is complex.  We acknowledge that problem.</p><p>  There is no harm in reminding ourselves of some of the stark facts we face.  Various studies have shown that children as young as three years are overweight or obese and this pattern continues as children get older.  One in four seven year olds is also overweight and obese and for teenagers, the figure is one in five.  This is of concern because of both the short and long-term effects, not only in childhood but also in later life.  In the short term we are aware of conditions such as high blood sugar causing diabetes, high blood pressure which contributes to diabetes, and heart disease.  In the longer term the effects of obesity include heart disease, stroke, type II diabetes and some cancers.  These are conditions we would normally associate with people who are quite old.  To compound these effects, many overweight children grow up to become obese adults.  The prevalence of obesity in adults has risen steadily in Irish society, so much so that some 61% of the Irish adult population is either overweight or obese.  In 1998 the corresponding figure was just 44%.  This indicates a trend.</p><p>  We have discussed the issue of diet.  We have very good information from nutritional surveys and what these show us is that approximately 60% of infants are snacking on chocolate, biscuits and crisps between their main meals.  Approximately 40% of older children and teenagers eat sweets daily and one in four drinks fizzy drinks at least once a day.  </p><p>  With regard to physical activity, approximately one in four adults takes no physical activity and approximately only half of children exercise four or more times a week.  A particularly noticeable trend is that there is a fall-off in physical activity among older girls.  For example, only 10% of girls aged 15 to 17 years had exercised during the seven days previous to being asked.  The figure is a little better for boys in that one out of five had exercised.</p><p>  It is well recognised by the Department and the Minister that there are a number of chronic conditions related to obesity and people being overweight and that there is also an impact on physical and mental health.  The Minister established the special action group on obesity in 2011 to tackle this growing problem.  Members have met some of the representatives of the group today, but we also have representatives from other Departments such as the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Education and Skills in recognition of the multisectoral element to this challenge.</p><p>  On what we can do, some years ago the OECD looked at the impact of obesity prevention strategies and concluded that the most efficient and effective interventions happened outside the health sector such as in education settings, the workplace, fiscal measures, food labelling and advertising.  Where the health care system has a role and has its greatest impact on obesity and related conditions is in focusing on high risk children and adults.  This is where it plays an important role.  In order to take a multisectoral approach and focus on high risk individuals, our group is liaising with Departments and organisations in a cross-sectoral approach to help halt the rise in the numbers who are overweight and obese.  The issues we are dealing with include calorie posting in restaurants, the impact of a levy on sugar sweetened drinks, the marketing of food and drink to children, the supply of products in vending machines, the detection and treatment of obesity, healthy eating guidelines and the promotion of physical activity.  These give just a flavour of the work we do.  I would like to expand briefly on one or two of these measures.</p><p>  We have identified calorie posting as being an important element as a means of educating the general public on the calorie content of menus.  Following public consultation and in response to the Minister having written to fast food restaurants earlier this year, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland launched a major public consultation exercise which resulted in over 3,000 responses.  This has demonstrated to us that the majority of consumers and some businesses want calorie labelling.  We welcome that support.  There is also broad support for this type of initiative and, together with the FSAI, we are working on an implementation plan.</p><p>  The issue of sugar sweetened drinks has been raised.  It has been estimated that these drinks contribute approximately 5% of total daily energy in the diets of Irish children.  This equates to something between 70 and 140 calories a day.  On my way here today I stopped at a shop to look at some of the high energy drinks which equate to 200 or 250 calories per can.  This year we established a steering group to conduct a health impact assessment of the health and economic aspects of introducing a levy on sugar sweetened drinks.  In the summer the Minister launched a stakeholder day.  The health impact assessment is close to completion and when completed, it will be brought to the Minister for further consideration and action.</p><p>  During the summer the Minister launched the healthy eating guidelines, a copy of which I have left for committee members interested in looking at them.  The guidelines are for the general population and inform people on the food and drink choices for a healthy lifestyle and set out in plain and simple language the food servings we need to maintain health and well-being.  A new emphasis is being placed on food servings from the top shelf of the food pyramid and alcohol is listed for the first time as a significant contributor to calories.  This is something of which many are not aware.  The physical activity guidelines were launched a few years ago and we are now working on a physical activity plan.  There are many good examples of local initiatives, on which we need to build.  My colleagues will be happy to provide more information in the discussion that will follow our presentation.  </p><p>  The issue of a broader cross-government approach was raised.  It is worth noting that the Department is developing a new health and well-being framework.  This will set out goals for improved health and well-being which are relevant for every sector and everybody's responsibility.  It will provide for new arrangements to ensure collaboration and co-operation between sectors such as children, social protection, education, housing and the environment.  Many of the determinants of health lie outside the control of the health care setting such as transportation, education, workplaces and so on.  Priority issues to be addressed under the framework will include implementing our tobacco policy and work on alcohol, nutrition and physical activity levels.  This year we are also starting a new health and well-being survey which will allow us to measure in much more detail health and lifestyle trends across the adult population.  We include in this children from as young as 15 years upwards.</p><p>  The trends in obesity and people being overweight are a major source of concern.  In Ireland, as in other countries, we have crossed a threshold where chronic diseases have become a challenge as great, if not greater, as those posed by communicable diseases approximately one decade ago.  The rising burden of chronic disease is very much due to behavioural factors.  It is due to what we eat, how we exercise, whether we smoke and high levels of alcohol consumption, all of which is amenable to prevention.  The focus in the SAGO is to build on those actions previously identified, the good work done by the obesity task force a number of years ago, various health promotion strategies and the cardiovascular strategy laid out two years ago which set out clear nutrition and exercise targets.  We want to move forward on all of these through our work.  </p><p>  A slide was presented on the complexity of obesity and the range of measures involved.  The question raised was whether we were singling out a particular measure over another.  The answer is no.  We believe no single measure will reverse the trend in people being overweight and obese and that a combination of measures will make a difference in dealing with this challenging public health issue.</p></speech>

I must also apologise in advance on my own behalf because I will have to leave this meeting at 10.50 a.m.  I will try to be brief as I note from the minutes of the last meeting that the Chairman was encouraging brevity.</p><p>  I am surprised at the level of unanimity between the three presentations, although it is heartening and a good thing because a partnership approach is needed.  We should be trying to design something that makes it easy for people to do the right thing and difficult for them to do the wrong thing.  It is some time since we discussed the role of pricing for unhealthy food and drink versus pricing for the healthy alternatives.  The food and drink industry spokesperson did not encourage that approach and has argued that it is a wealth measure and not a health measure and has pointed out that much work is being done by food production companies.  The problem is, as the evidence from others proves, that what is happening at present is not working.  We are not succeeding so we must examine what we are doing at present.  We need to do more and we need to make sure we are doing the right thing.  </p><p>  I was surprised at the statement from the Irish Heart Foundation that it wants to study the proposal for taxing high-fat, high-salt and high-sugar foods and subsidising more healthy foods because I would have thought that it has been fairly well studied already.  I also would have thought that there is a fair amount of political support for such a measure.  Perhaps I misunderstood what the foundation was suggesting and if so, I ask for clarification.  </p><p>  There was no reference in the presentations to children playing computer games.  It is my experience, and that of many other parents, that it is easy enough to get children away from television but once they are hooked on computer games, it can be extremely difficult to get them outdoors. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-11a.596" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1171" speakername="Jillian van Turnhout" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2012101100008#G00700"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  We have had many deliberations already about the need for a multi-faceted approach to this problem.  Part of me worries that we are over-analysing and over-complicating the problem.  I never thought I would refer to Ms Ann Widdicombe in this context, but she said that she would love to write a book on obesity  and losing weight but the only problem was that the book would only have four words - exercise more, eat less.  While it is very important that we analyse the issues involved, we must remember the fundamentals underpinning this.</p><p>  While I welcome much of the presentation from the food and drink industry and its positivity, I found it very difficult to see the tangible actions that the industry proposes to deal with the problem.  Reference was made to active engagement, partnership and so forth and we all agree that working together is important.  I would like to hear a little more on what the industry proposes we should do, apart from labelling.  </p><p>  Given my background, I am particularly concerned about advertising and marketing to children.  Reference was made to a voluntary reduction in such advertising and I would like to know where that figure came from.  Who conducted the research?  We all know that with voluntary codes the good companies sign up while those at whom the codes are aimed do not, with the result that we do not solve the problem.  Unfortunately, to get things done, we all need deadlines and we all need to feel someone is looking over our shoulder.  I fully support the advertising ban and believe the Irish Heart Foundation is being quite moderate in asking for the ban to be in place from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. I would go further.  </p><p>  The argument about cheese is being used as a red herring in the debate.  It is all about moderation.  Certainly there are some wonderful Irish cheeses on the market but the issue is about cheese products directly aimed at children.  Such products are highly processed and include squeezy and stringy cheeses.  Where is the nutritional value in such products?  We need to be a little careful with some of the red herrings in the argument.  Of course a balanced diet is essential but we must look at the specific products that are causing concern.  I am interested in the view of the Irish Heart Foundation on the question of cheese because it is constantly raised in debates with this committee.  </p><p>  I note that in the foundation's presentation it is argued that only 20% of children consume the recommended amounts of fruit and vegetables.  The special action group on obesity reminded us of data from the Growing Up In Ireland Survey from 2011 which found that one in four children, as young as three, are overweight or obese.  That is a startling fact.  We must demystify this whole discussion and get down to the basics.  We can have an ongoing debate the issue of obesity but the fact that this generation of children will have a shorter life span than their parents means that we, as decision makers and legislators, must act.  </p><p>  Including a calorie count on menus is an excellent idea and can inform one's choices and influence one's eating decisions.  However, I was surprised when I was in New York during the summer to discover that a restaurant must have 15 branches before it is required to list calories on its menus.  We are often told that New York is doing it and so should we but there is a cost to restaurants.  How does the delegation suggest we tackle that?</p></speech>

When I was canvassing during the general election campaign 19 months ago I  could not help but notice the number of people who were overweight or obese.  I said to myself at the time that if I could do something to help such people, I would.  The problem is alarming.</p><p>  I congratulate the Minister for setting up the special action group and some of the solutions put forward are excellent.  However, since I have entered politics I have heard a lot of talking but have seen very little action.  We could talk about this morning, noon and night.  I can go into the Chamber and listen, for four or five hours, to all the solutions in the world but there is no action.  There are a lot of clever individuals here today and we should all try to work together.  I am just an ordinary Joe Soap but I am willing to help.  I attended the local Novena this morning in Dundalk and the priest said that while Ireland may not have any money, 60% of our population is involved in voluntary work, which is wonderful.  Let us all work together on this.  </p></speech>

A comment was made about the cosy relationship.  It is fair to say we have our differences with the industry with regard to advertising and how it should be marketed and we make our own submissions in that respect.  That process is still under way so we cannot determine what the outcome will be.  That is being done through the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  We are holding strong on the watershed and especially with regard to those foods high or on the top shelf of the food pyramid.  We believe there should be restrictions for these.  The booklet outlines that certain foods, especially those on the top shelf, have no nutritional value.  Unfortunately, this is where most of the advertising takes place.  We would prefer to see more advertising in respect of fruit and vegetables and so on.  Many of the products advertised are not consistent with our healthy eating policy.  We work closely with the industry with regard to potential solutions in this area.  We have differences with regard to the desirability or otherwise of a sugar and sweetened drinks levy.  It is fair to say there are different perspectives on that.  This is why we have conducted a thorough health impact assessment and we will be reporting soon to the Minister with all the impacts relating to health and the burden of disease and obesity as well as the other potential impacts relating to trade and employment and so on.  At the end of the process, we will have a good indication of the options and information to be provided to the Government relating to decisions which we believe will ensure better public policy.</p><p>  A comment was made about disseminating booklets leaflets and information.  I will hand over to my colleagues because, as part of our communications strategy, these booklets have been disseminated widely.  We can provide a flavour of the numbers and the outlets where they have been distributed.  I call on my colleague, Dr. Mary Flynn, to comment on calorie posting.  As suggested, it is an important initiative but there are technical and practical considerations.  We are working on an implementation plan.  I will pass to my to colleagues in the front row.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-11a.600" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mary Flynn" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2012101100009#H00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee and I thank Deputy Fitzpatrick for his comments on our leaflet.  I reassure him that this leaflet has gone out from the Food Safety Authority of Ireland to all general practitioners, dieticians and all practice nurses.  It is a guide for health professionals.  Unfortunately, when the people read the information in the booklets and then try to buy food, problems arise.  Often there are problems with portion sizes.  In most cases one muffin would do for a family of five and it should be divided up in that way.  This is where calorie posting comes in.  We know what occurred in the United States: Kentucky Fried Chicken introduced grilled chicken for the first time on the back of calorie posting.  We know that outlets selling cakes and biscuits have begun to reduce or introduce portion sizes with which we were all familiar in the 1970s.  However, when we show them to people, they think we are referring to portions for children.  They think a certain bottle of Coke is a dinky.  We are used to portion sizes that have doubled and trebled.   This has been highlighted in the booklet.</p><p>  At the moment, because of the recession, food service outlets are hanging on by their fingernails.  We know this is a reality.  People running restaurants are not taking salaries and unemployment is affecting people severely in this area as well as in the construction area.  How do we do it?  Legislation was introduced in New York and consideration is being given to rolling out the legislation throughout the USA.  They have suggested that the proposal of making calorie posting mandatory should apply to outlets with 20 or more branches and it would be cost-effective to do so.  If one goes to the trouble of analysing recipes and standardising portion sizes, one could spread it among 20 outlets, and that is a good idea.  At the moment in Ireland this is done on a voluntary basis.  I thank the Minister for Health for highlighting the problem.  There were outlets operating here which had posted calories in their outlets in other jurisdictions but were not doing so here.  As a result of the intervention, we have had a change overnight, and that is welcome.</p><p>  I am a dietician but I did not know that there were 1,200 calories in a big box of popcorn that one might buy at the cinema.  Such a box contains the equivalent of seven bags of popcorn.  Something strange happens to humans.  When we are given such food in a box, we eat it and then we go home and decide that we only had popcorn and that we will still eat a dinner.  However, somehow if we open bags of popcorn and begin to eat them, we stop after three bags and we would probably decide that we did not need dinner.  We need these stops.</p><p>  The most wonderful thing about calorie posting was the reaction from the population to the whole initiative.  From a total of more than 3,000 consumers, some 96% responded.  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland was overwhelmed by the reaction to the public consultation.  It was the biggest reaction we ever had.  I could not believe it but 96% of consumers suggested putting calories on everything in all outlets because they wanted to know.  That was the first time we saw such a reaction.  It was not from the top down or from the authority trying to do certain things but from the bottom up and it involved people who are overweight.</p><p>  No one wants to be overweight and they all want a solution.  I have worked in Canada, the Middle East, Britain and for most of my life in Ireland, and I have never met anyone who wants to be overweight.  Everyone wants a solution.  Deputy Colreavy is absolutely right about the need to make the healthy option the easy option.  We need a partnership with the food and drink organisations.  I have never met anyone in the food and drink organisations who has wanted to make anyone obese.  They want to make a fast buck and a profit.  It is about setting up a framework such that we all get to where we want to be.</p></speech>

I cannot disagree with any of the comments, which were brilliant.  However, we held a similar discussion here last week.  Let us suppose I am in the supermarket and I have my shopping list.  How do I relate it to the top shelf and the pyramid?  How do we get the mindset of the mother or the father or the person doing the shopping to change from the top shelf?  We have no solution.  Should signs be put up in the local fast food restaurant or take away?  Should they put up the number of calories in fried chicken and batter burgers and so on?  Does that change minds?</p></speech>

However, for the first time this will affect the others because the industry would be allowed to produce portion sizes that are smaller without being called greedy and without a consumer wondering why she is not getting a massive portion although she has paid good money.  That has been the problem.  With calorie posting one can create demand for the healthier option around something other than price.</p><p>  There are many ways it can have these effects.  The problem is the cost.  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland is trying to come up with a solution involving an easy-to-use computer programme and establishing a related training programme that restaurateurs could use.  The plan is to embed it in the colleges which are training catering students.  That is a long-term plan but it is the only way to do it.  The larger operations can do it now and they should do it immediately.</p><p>  RTE carried out a vox pop on the back of this and some people were asked how many calories they needed in a day.  Some grown men thought they only needed 50 calories.  We need to raise awareness and the only way we can do so is through such initiatives and by showing innovation.  We need to catch something that hooks the imagination and follow it through.  We should not blame the small restaurant owners who are hanging on by their fingernails for not putting calories on menus.  We need to find solutions that will help them, and that is what we are working towards.</p></speech>

We can distribute it, not only to professionals in the health services but also to schools and other organisations.</p><p>  I am not a politician, but may I comment?  Knowledge is important and powerful, but it is not sufficient.  We have to change behaviour as well.  Chairman, you asked what else can one do.  Scotland is proposing to legislate for supermarket displays so that the top shelves, where people can see things easily, will be changed.  There are aspects of work that Deputies and Senators can do.</p><p>  Health promotion in schools is a wholesome concept that needs more than the support of the Department of Education and Skills and of school management.  We also need health promotion in advertising, in the availability of food in schools and so on.  Health promotion in schools is one of the most important elements of all.</p><p>  Breastfeeding is rarely mentioned.  The levels of breastfeeding in this country are disgracefully low.  Women and families need support in this regard.  Great work is being done by some elements.  Women need support, not only when they are in hospital but also outside hospital and even in preparation before they become pregnant.</p></speech>

It is in place in hospitals but also in other facilities.  We allow women to express milk and preserve it.  We give them breaks.  We invite cr&egrave;ches to be aligned with the health service to help breastfeeding mothers.  Industry could do similar things.  It could be done easily, whether in a bank or a factory.</p><p>  We talked about food, and rightly so because it is part of the problem.  The food industry is part of the problem but also part of the solution.  We look to them to help.  One solution is to have a physical activity plan for Ireland. This plan brings together five Departments, academics, practitioners and help from all over the place.  The Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Michael Ring, and Senator Eamonn Coghlan are supporting it.  We hope to have it on the table in the near future and that the Government health committee will agree it.  The plan needs huge support.  We congratulate the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on its consultation document on opening facilities and sharing them with everyone.  This is the response of the physical activity plan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-11a.606" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Kelly" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2012101100010#J00400"><p>Deputy Colreavy spoke about pricing and taxation.  It is worth noting the complexities associated with the construction and transmission of price and the whole area of margin in the food chain.  This has been evidenced in recent days by 20,000 farmers protesting outside the gates of Leinster House on Tuesday last and by some of the job losses in the last day or so.  There are significant issues relating to the asymmetrical transmission of price along the supply chain, that is, the ability of different players in the chain to recover costs.  Much of that has to do with increased volatility in commodity prices.  That, in large part, has to do with the disappearance of the managed market scenario we have had in the EU for the last number of decades.  Agriculture prices and food prices are normalising towards global levels and this is introducing a significant amount of additional volatility.</p><p>  It is also worth noting that the commodity that has jumped the most in the last year or two is sugar, which has gone from &euro;400 per tonne to &euro;1,200 or &euro;1,250 per tonne on the spot market.  From a production planning perspective, it would be incorrect to consider sugar a cheap nutrient in terms of price or availability and security of supply.</p><p>  Food companies are not completely obsessed with profit.  In this country, the net profit margins of the consumer foods arms of publicly quoted companies are in low single figures.  At primary level, primary dairy processors and meat processors are probably working between 1% and 2% profit margins.  That is the reality.</p><p>  The final price is set by the retailer.  Resale price maintenance is banned under competition law.  Food companies and food suppliers have no part to play in the price the consumer ultimately pays.  We already have a tax differential.  The 23% standard rate of VAT applies to a small number of food products. They are, typically, the ones in question, including confectionery, soft drinks and cakes.  There is already a 23% differential between them and all other food products, which are zero rated. </p><p>  In the consumer price index, food and non-alcoholic beverages now account for approximately 11% of consumer spend, compared with roughly 25% in the 1980s.  This has had a huge impact along the food supply chain.  Food is a highly regulated sector, and correctly so, with regard to food safety and so on.  All of these costs have had to be absorbed at production and processing level.  These costs are highly relevant to this overall discussion. </p><p>  In Denmark, where a saturated fat tax was introduced approximately one year ago, there is now cross-party support for the removal of the tax because of its impact on a number of areas, particularly the economic area.  It has driven cross-border shopping into Germany.  We had a similar issue here two or three years ago with Northern Ireland.  Work done by the Central Statistics Office and the Department of Finance suggested a cost in the region of &euro;800 million from that.  Denmark has also withdrawn proposals for the introduction of an additional sugar tax.  Similarly, in Italy a range of taxation measures are being examined as part of that country's austerity programme but the Italian Government has pulled back from introducing a tax of that sort.</p><p>  Senator van Turnhout mentioned stringy cheese and the fact it is highly processed.  The stringy cheese in question is cheddar cheese.  It is no more and no less.</p></speech>

There is European legislation that outlines the specification for cheddar cheese.  The only difference is that stringy cheese goes through an extrusion process.  In short, the cheese goes through a metal pipe where there is an application of heat and pressure to give it the physical characteristics with which we are all familiar.</p></speech>

Behind the reformulation statistics I quoted are millions of euro over the course of four or five years.  For example, over five years confectionery companies removed 35 tonnes of saturated fat from the Irish diet.  That took five years of research and more than 40,000 man hours.  Each of us on this side of the room is actively making contributions but our contributions are fragmented.  Even within the food industry each company is pursuing a different way to make a contribution.  That is why we talk about a whole-of-society approach.  To do the right thing, all the players must make a contribution.</p></speech>

We need them to do that and when they do so, we need to reward them so that it incentivises the other companies to become involved.  The big companies who sign up to voluntary codes are often the ones that are targeted the most by different stakeholders and groups.  It means that the people who have not made the effort to be part of the voluntary code ask why they should participate in it.  We need to encourage all companies to get involved and that can be done by means of a whole-society response.</p><p>  My colleague has spoken about the cheese argument.  This is always being raised because it is an example of the BAI's approach, which was to take a nutrient profile model from the English situation and to transpose it onto the Irish situation.  There are other products, apart from cheese, that will also be restricted in their advertising and which, in our view, should not be restricted.  However, the cheese advertising is being raised because this is a very political issue in Ireland.  As I said earlier, one in three children have calcium deficiency.  If we had used the Irish Universities Nutrition Alliance, IUNA, data, we would have identified that issue and we would have been able to use Irish data to change the system to suit the Irish population.  </p><p>  On the issue of soft drinks, Senator Crown put it very well at last week's meeting that no product is bad in moderation and no product is safe in excess.  Despite the comments made about soft drinks, IUNA shows they only contribute approximately 2% of energy for Irish children and 60% of the population does not consume soft drinks.  We are considering the introduction of a national tax across the whole population when 60% of the people do not even consume soft drinks.  I ask what impact this measure will have on obesity in the medium or long term.  I use this example to highlight a point that we need to target our interventions.  The Live Well project has been the subject of much discussion between the industry and other groups.  We think that project will be a very tangible step forward in how industry and government can work together on this issue.  It would not be the place of the industry to decide on the programme for the children because by doing so, the programme would be discredited.  We want to work with the relevant agencies on deciding what is the correct intervention.</p><p>  In reply to Professor Flynn's statement, the food pyramid and physical activity plan are in place and the healthy eating guidelines will be in place soon.  Those documents are the basis for a societal response but, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, they might not get out there.  We need to work on the implementation plan as much as possible and the industry is prepared to support it so that it is accepted by consumers and citizens.</p></speech>

In reply to Deputy Colreavy's question, the pricing measures for obesity are not about income generation but rather about behavioural change.  There is talk about stealth tax.  I understand that the income to be raised from any such taxes would be modest.  We must look to behavioural change which is how patterns of consumption are changed.  I acknowledge the argument that these measures are economically regressive and will affect poorer people more.  In terms of health, I would consider these measures to be progressive.  I refer to the concept that only 2% of energy comes from sugar-sweetened drinks.  This figure is 20% for those who consume those drinks.  A small number may consume these drinks but 20% of their energy intake comes from those drinks.  Therefore, the tax only affects those who consume and it will hit them more.  They are also in the lower socio-economic group so it is financially regressive in that sense, but their health gain is magnified, so it is progressive in health terms.  The committee members are the legislators and they must decide.  It is about behavioural change and progress in health terms.  We then must examine the knock-on impact and how we make up the difference to those who are more affected.</p><p>  I liked Senator van Turnhout's comment on the red herring which introduced fish into the cheese debate.  There should be no more mention of cheese.  It is on the third shelf of the food pyramid and it is nutritious.  We are talking about the top shelf of the food pyramid and cheese should be out of the argument.</p><p>  Deputy Fitzpatrick asked how to help the constituent who is clearly in trouble and whose children are also physically struggling but on a smaller scale.  That demands the kind of measures that have been discussed and it demands partnership and knocking our heads together.  It also demands treatment.  I would love to see Senator Crown stand over a prevention of cancer programme that involves no treatment.  At the moment that is what we have in Ireland.  We are talking about prevention but Deputy Fitzpatrick and others can offer practically nothing to the constituent who walks in the door.  That situation has to change.  One of the recommendations I would love to see as a result of today's meeting would be that prevention is the way forward but we must be able to treat our obese kids and adults and that is not happening at the moment.</p></speech>

While many unhealthy foods are taxed at the standard rate, many others are anomalies and are taxed at a reduced rate.  For example, the 13.5% rate applies to croissants, banoffi pie, chocolate chip biscuits, Jaffa cakes and jam doughnuts.  The zero rate is applied to foods such as frozen chips, pizza and chocolate spread.  We are calling for those anomalies to be removed in the next budget.  In the future we will be very strong proponents of a fat tax.  However, we try to base everything we do on the available evidence.  We believe there are very compelling reasons for the introduction of a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages if the interests of our children are to the fore.  There is some evidence about unintended consequences of fat tax, such as people may move from a high fat diet to a high salt diet.  There needs to be some clarification at this point.  We do not want to give industry a stick to beat us with.  We are worried about the regressive elements of a fat tax which may impact on people.  Further investigation is required on these points.</p></speech>

His response echoes what I said in my presentation that it is the foods at the top of the pyramid which are high in fat, sugar and salt which give us cause for concern.  I wish to add to what the Chairman asked about how to identify foods from the top shelf and how to create a more informed consumer.  Allied to the calorie count on menus in catering establishments, the Irish Heart Foundation, along with many public health allies both here and across Europe, has called for a traffic light coding system on the front of packs.</p></speech>

The challenge we are facing is well summed up in the following statement in the document by Food and Drink Industry Ireland: "Childhood obesity is a hugely complex multi-faceted problem that requires a 'whole of society' response."  Clearly, we are all in agreement on this.  It is my view that wealth is health - the more money one has, the more open one is to reading food packaging in the supermarket and the greater one's ability to identify the nutritional value of the products one puts on the kitchen table.  Some parents, particularly in poorer areas, may find this more challenging.  Like most women, I go to the supermarket every weekend and, I confess, often pay little attention to back-of-pack information.  I am usually rushing home to do something else or to canvass or deliver leaflets.  The booklet the delegates have produced is excellent.  It would be very helpful to me, as a public representative, if I were permitted to reprint some of that information in the public leaflets I distribute to communities on a regular basis.  This is a concrete way in which public representatives can contribute to promoting awareness of the issues we are discussing.  If the delegates' permission is forthcoming, I will be happy to do so.</p><p>  The booklet advises that a portion of meat or fish should be the size of the palm of one's hand.  The problem that springs immediately to mind here is cost.  In advance of this meeting, I conducted a review of prices in shops in my local area yesterday.  The cost of a small piece of fish, I found, was &euro;3 to &euro;4.  That cost would be difficult to cover for a person with five or six children, particularly those, including social welfare recipients, with very small budgets.  My survey showed that a package of cooking fat cost 48 cent compared with &euro;3 to &euro;6 for a bottle of oil.  We must take  realistic approach in all of this, and the reality is that the people suffering most from obesity are those living in poorer areas and struggling to survive on a daily basis.  My local butcher told me yesterday that his best-selling product is the cheapest cut of mince, followed by chicken, which includes not just the breast fillet but the small fillet that comes off the back of the bird and from which one must remove the innards.  Looking at bread prices, meanwhile, I found an 80 cent difference between the cost of a white and brown sliced pan.  This is where the problem lies for the poorer sections of our society.</p><p>  My children attended a local school in Goldenbridge where the principal, Mrs. Carmel Solan, developed a healthy eating policy some 25 years ago.  The rule that children would not be allowed through the door with crisps or chocolate bars had a significant positive impact on the lifestyle of many young people.  At the weekends, Mrs. Solan would purchase, out of her own pocket, bags of apples, oranges and bananas in order to ensure that every children would have some nutritious food every day.  This was long before initiatives such as breakfast clubs.</p><p>  I read some interesting statistics in a book which landed on my desk this morning.  My cultural background means that a patch in the back garden with a few carrots is the sum of my contribution to farming.</p></speech>

Moreover, it is predicted that by 2015, 1.5 billion will have died.  Meanwhile, the global diet industry commands a gross annual profit of &euro;13.9 billion.  Some of the answers to disordered and unhealthy eating can be found by an examination of that industry.  I have young teenagers who, although very slim, are always on crash diets which require them to restrict their food choices severely.</p><p>  Ultimately, however, the buck stops with parents and it is vital that they have control over what is in their cupboards.  My six year old does not decide how my cupboards are restocked at the weekend.  As I have said, however, pricing is an important element in this.  What is happening in poorer areas is that parents are going for the easier-fix solution.  People are buying bags of frozen chips and everything else, or a can of carrots instead of peeling three carrots into a pot to cook them.  Education is vital if we are to achieve a change in behaviours.  I realise that resources are extremely restricted, but would the delegates consider running a television advertising campaign based on the information contained in the booklet?  Television is the most effective medium through which to get any message across because it has very high penetration across all groups, in both poor and rich areas.</p><p>  I am not a fan of McDonalds but when I went to a birthday party there last week I found it was standing room only.  By contrast, there were plenty of tables to be had last Saturday in the small family-run restaurant close to my home where one could expect to enjoy a nutritious, well-balanced meal.  I thank the delegates again for their presentations.  There is a wow factor to what they are saying.  The bottom line, however, is that action must begin at home.</p></speech>

Dr. Donal O'Shea has spoken about the many difficulties that arise in tackling childhood obesity.  I would not like to turn up at Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick's clinic unless I knew my weight was in the acceptable range.  I have been on crash diets myself, starving myself to lose a pound or two.  As an ex-school principal, I am aware that children are entering school already overweight.  In fact, as Dr. Eldin said, increasing numbers of babies are born overweight.  I will not say what weight my children were when they were born - suffice to say, they were huge babies.  Such children are facing a battle from the very beginning.  I agree with Deputy Catherine Byrne that it is a difficult problem for parents to tackle, especially if they do not have the money to purchase more expensive cuts of meat and so on.</p><p>  I applaud the principal to whom Deputy Byrne referred who brought in apples and oranges for pupils.  What is required, however, is a deeper engagement by schools which should begin with training for teachers on nutrition.  There is a great deal of misleading labelling and misinformation on what is meant by "low fat" and other descriptors.  This type of information must be included as part of teacher training so that it can then be incorporated into the curriculum.  It is vital, of course, that any such initiative is implemented sensitively.  We all know that overweight children are vulnerable to bullying.  Teachers will be aware that they must not be seen, in imparting information to students, to be pointing their finger at the boy or girl whose weight is way beyond the healthy range.  Visits by district nurses offer a good opportunity to educate parents regarding healthy eating.</p><p>  Mr. Macey referred to the necessity of striking a balance between industry profitability and public health.  The industry representatives made strong arguments and referred, for example, to the farmers who protested last week.  The food produced in this country is of a very high nutritional quality.  The problem arises when it undergoes processing and the sauce, salt and everything else is added.  The challenges facing the industry must be set against the huge public health issue we are facing.  Dr. Donal O'Shea has warned that there is a diabetes epidemic coming down the track which will cost millions, if not billions, of euro to address.  That must be taken on board.</p></speech>

As a former teacher, I am very much aware of the limits of education in getting through to people.  It is only part of what is required.  We must ban the advertising of unhealthy foods to children.  In Sweden there is a general ban on advertising all products - not just foods - to children.  This is because advertising is regarded as an abuse of children who are not so well able to assess what they see and hear in advertisements.  I would be interested in hearing our guests' comments on that matter.  What are their views on the suggestion companies which are allowed to advertise unhealthy foods should be obliged to direct funding towards the advertising of healthy foods?</p><p>  I appreciate Mr. Macey's comments on various unhealthy foods which do not attract a high rate of VAT.  I may mention this matter to the relevant Ministers.  I accept that in closing the gaping hole in our finances any moneys collected via the imposition of a higher VAT rate on these foods would only be a pittance.  However, I remain of the opinion that charging a higher rate would be worthwhile.</p><p>  I accept that there is need for legislation in this area.  What are our guests' views on how comprehensive such legislation should be?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-11a.632" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1147" speakername="John Crown" time="11:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2012101100013#M01000"><p>Yes, I should stop digging.</p><p>  The issue of diet has become a much larger consideration in my professional life during the past decade.  At our previous meeting I indicated that I had undergone a road-to-Damascus like conversion on the dietary front approximately 12 years ago, which resulted in my losing in the region of 25 kg.  I have largely managed to keep that weight off in the intervening period.  My experience gave me an appreciation of the difficulties involved, the skills necessary and what needed to be done.  The more important issue, however, is the realisation that people in the profession, particularly those within my specialty, were horrifically ill-informed on the importance of diet.  There was nowhere near enough education on dietary issues in the past.</p><p>  I emerged from years and years of oncology training and experience to become a moderately involved breast cancer specialist on the international stage, but it is only in the past few years that the penny has been dropping with those in my profession on the importance of diet from the point of view of cancer prevention.  I do not just refer to diet in this regard but also to obesity and its various causes.  I will not discuss all of the details, but I can point out that almost all of the common cancers that are not caused by cigarette smoking tend to have an increased incidence in those who are obese or whose intake of calories is too great.  There are even data which suggest that if one has had cancer, the chances of it returning in a lethal secondary form are higher if one is obese following one's diagnosis.  As a result of this, I spend a great deal of time discussing diet with my patients.  I was doing a rough estimate and reckon that I take 20 dietary histories a week and make the same number of attempts at some kind of dietary intervention for patients whom I identify as being obese.  I do so without specialist support for my conclusions.  If someone looks obese and I know his or her actual weight, I will discuss his or her diet with him or her.</p><p>  The results of my efforts in this regard are surprising.  My patients are not children; most but not all are middle-aged women.  They will often wring their hands and inform me that they cannot understand their failure to lose weight.  They state they eat healthily, do not consume fatty foods and only eat modest amounts of bread, etc.  When one takes their histories, one comes to realise that while there are foods which are more likely to make one gain weight - a previous speaker alluded to this and I pointed it out last week - there is no food that is safe if one eats too much of it.  Likewise, I really believe there is no food that is dangerous if it is eaten in strict moderation.  People must understand that merely eliminating sugar and fatty foods from their diets will not prove sufficient, particularly if they are eating four spuds or a great big plate of rice or pasta every night.  In many of the patients I see the latter are the principal culprits.  My patients are women who, because they have had cancer, buy into the idea of avoiding extraneous chemicals.  As a result, they stay away from processed foods and soft drinks.  None of this probably makes that much difference to one's risk of cancer if one is consuming too many unhealthy foods - to the point where one has become obese - and one's daily calorie intake is too high.  This provides some indication of the challenge we face.</p><p>  The primary strategies we should adopt should focus on education and regulation.  I would be grateful if Dr. O'Shea indicated whether he is of the view that we are spending enough time educating young doctors in matters of nutrition.  It is my opinion that we are not doing so.  Other than stopping people smoking, the single most important action we could take to decrease the death rate from cancer 30 years from now would be to curb calorie intake.  This would have a greater impact than anything we do in the context of screening or treatment.  I support Dr. O'Shea in his comments on the lack of treatment.  I do not know what is the current position, but when I inquired a few years ago, he indicated that there was a two to three year wait for people to be seen at his clinic and that there was a corresponding wait for the minority of patients who required bariatric surgery.  I commented previously that if abortion were available in this country, there would be a ten month waiting list.  In that context, a health system which obliges patients to wait three to four years to be assessed and then a further three to four years to be treated is profoundly abnormal.  This speaks to the need for a fundamental reform of the health system and the removal of responsibility for managing it from those who currently run it.</p><p>  As we move forward, we must educate doctors, teachers and parents who need to get the message that systematically malnourishing their children - I am not referring to undernourishing them - and giving them the wrong foods is a form of neglect.  In extreme cases, it is a form of child abuse.  The traffic light idea has much to recommend it and if there are some foods which are utterly devoid of nutritional value and contain large amounts of calories - people may continue to consume these foods because they have a low-level addiction to them - they should be the subject of special treatment and there should be a total ban on their being advertised.  A similar and complete ban should be introduced on advertising alcohol.  Social pressure of this nature can work.  The debate in which we engaged in respect of people smoking in cars in which children are present has had some effect.  This is now something which people are reluctant to do.</p><p>  In the incentivising good behaviour and disincentivising bad behaviour I intend to bring before the committee in the near future a proposal to make the entire Leinster House campus a smoke-free zone.  I know Deputy Michael Colreavy who referred to this matter will support me in that regard.</p><p>  I am not so certain about using taxation measures to deal with this issue.  The idea of taxing people to modify their behaviour is one about which I am somewhat uncomfortable.  I do not understand why poor parents who provide their children with proper nourishment six days a week and then take them out on the seventh day to see a movie and have a "Big Mac" should pay more.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-11a.633" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1177" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="11:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2012101100013#M01100"><p>I apologise that I was not present for many of the contributions.  It is ironic that as I was attending the launch of the Global Hunger Index 2012, at which reference was made to children in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia being underweight and malnourished, the committee was deliberating on childhood obesity in Ireland.</p> <p> Dr. Eldin made an important point about breast-feeding.  He is correct that a baby-friendly environment will help to improve the uptake of breast-feeding.  The single biggest step that could improve our breast-feeding uptake in this country would be to allow public health nurses to have the time to assist new parents with breast-feeding, especially in the first couple of days after they come home from hospital.  The difficulty at the moment is that they do not have the time.  As a result of that breast-feeding numbers will begin to fall rather than increase.</p><p> I will give an example of what is happening at the moment because of the cutbacks.  One woman wanted to contact the breast-feeding specialist as she had a particular problem on a Tuesday.  The message she got is that she could contact the breast-feeding specialist between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. on Thursday.  By Thursday, she was bottle-feeding the baby.  That is the challenge that currently exists.  It is a simple thing.  We have the professionals and the know-how and we have women who are willing to breast-feed but they need support and basic time would make a significant difference in that regard.</p><p> The biggest single challenge to the food industry currently is information.  If one were to ask the committee members what is their target calorie intake, very few would know it.  We must address the issue.  People know what foods are healthy and what foods are not healthy but they do not know what should be their target calorie intake on a daily basis.  Such information would assist people.  Deputy Byrne&rsquo;s point about price was correct but it is also a matter of information and convenience.  We must make healthier choices the easy choice for people to make.  A campaign was run two weeks ago by Bord Bia in which a cookbook was distributed in one of the national newspapers on wholesome foods.  Many of those dishes were quick and easy to prepare.  Much more focus must go into the area.</p><p> Portion size is a big challenge for the restaurant industry.  One can go to a restaurant with healthy options on the menu but when one asks for the children&rsquo;s menu one finds chicken nuggets and chips and sausages and chips.  In some restaurants it is nearly impossible to get a half portion of the adult dishes.  The only option is the unhealthy choice for children.  The adults can have the healthy choice but not the children for some bizarre reason.  More must be done to assist the restaurant industry in that regard.  It is a matter of information for them as well.  In fairness to the FSAI and the Nutrition and Health Foundation, they are doing much work in that area.</p><p> Labelling is a significant challenge for us because one sees food products advertised as 95% fat free, which means that they are 5% fat, which is a significant amount of fat.  How it is being advertised, promoted and labelled is a big part of the problem.  There is much merit in looking at an amalgamation of GDA and traffic light labelling to provide people with clear choices because if they had the choice people would make the decision if the product is cost competitive.  When they do not have the basic information it is difficult to do that.</p></speech>

Deputy Byrne&rsquo;s first point related to the inequality dimension of the issue.  We are conscious of that.  It is something we would like to discuss with the industry in terms of what we can do also.  It does start in the home.  I do not like to use the term an "obesegenic environment" but the committee will know what I mean in that everywhere we go we see food outlets and when one turns on the television there is a considerable amount of food advertising directed not at adults but at children, in particular those under the age of eight who cannot make cognitive decisions as to whether a food is good or bad for them.  They will not look at the back of the pack and work out the GDA to see whether it is within the recommended daily calorific intake.  One has to deal with all of those issues.</p><p>  In terms of the tools and levers available to us, we must consider education and what more we can do.  We have produced healthy eating guidelines but the fact that the committee did not know about them shows that perhaps there is more we can do even though we have produced tens of thousands of booklets.  We would welcome the support of the committee in making them more available.  It is true that we do not have a large social marketing campaign so we must be innovative in terms of how we get our message across.  Meetings such as this one are helpful.</p><p>  Deputy Dowds made a point about regulation.  There is a hierarchy of approach and we like to try to start with education and awareness.  Co-regulation might be a good approach but regulation must be at the top of the scale.  A good example is caloric posting.  The Minister indicated that we will start on a voluntary basis and try to rope in as many restaurants as we can.  We will try to be practical in our approach.  We will start with restaurants that have menus that run for more than 30 days.  We are not talking about zooming in on the one restaurant that produces a single menu every night and the difficulty in that regard.  We are trying to be practical but if we perceive the process is not working on a voluntary basis regulation is somewhere at the back of our minds.  All of these levers are available to us.  It is not just education and regulation.  Pricing is important.  I did not want to let the remark slide in case anyone felt that many countries in Europe are going away from the notion of a sugar tax or a fat tax.  Many other countries are considering introducing it.  The matter is very much on the EU agenda at the moment in terms of looking and learning from the experiences of other countries.  This is a work in progress.  The EU is very interested in what we are doing in this country about a health impact assessment.  It is the first of its kind in the world.  We will be able to learn a lot from it and we will also be able to export our learning not just to the European Union but also to the World Health Organization which is interested in seeing what happens.</p><p>  The availability of foods and products must be taken into account as well.  The point was made about whether we should segregate unhealthy foods, which would be challenging but it is one of many things that have to be considered in the same way as the approach we took to our alcohol policy.  Senator Crown referred to people eating healthy food.  It is all very fine eating a healthy chicken but a bottle of wine on top of it negates the overall effect in terms of what one is trying to achieve with calorie intake and a healthy diet.</p><p>  A number of references were made to physical education.  I will ask Dr. Woods to speak about some of the things happening in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-11a.636" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Catherine Woods" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2012101100014#N00300"><p>There are two sides to every coin.  I have heard a lot of discussion around nutrition and a lack of discussion on physical activity.  I wish to draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to the fact that 86% of primary and post-primary school children are insufficiently active to benefit their current and protect their future health.  One could ask why that is important.  It is important because physical activity will protect one&rsquo;s heart and lungs, develop mental capacity and allow one to perform better in school and it will help one in social circumstances.  It will also address obesity.  It is a behaviour that has massive health consequences if not adhered to.  Inactivity &ndash; sitting - as we are all doing right now and have been for some time, is the fourth leading risk factor for premature mortality in the world.  We need intervention.  Dr. Eldin referred to the physical activity plan, which I urge members to read.  It explains exactly how we might go about addressing the problem of inactivity in a concrete way where we use a multi-sectoral approach but it tells us how to do it using evidence from around the world.  We have consulted with the WHO and everybody on the issue.</p><p>  Intervention is needed on children.  One could ask why and where it is needed.  It is needed because of high levels of inactivity but we can do it in the home.  The vision in the plan is that children are born into active families with active brothers and sisters, active parents and active aunts and uncles.  The vision in the plan is that there would be an increase in the frequency and quality of physical education in the school, where only 10% of primary and post-primary children get the recommended minutes of physical education every week.</p></speech>

There was a spurious psychological movement which said that we must not let children worry about their weight or we might feed eating disorders.</p><p>  Second, in terms of activity, would it not be simple to make it a part of the standard operating procedure of every school that students would spend one hour of every day in school standing up?  They could stand up in class for half an hour in the morning and half an hour in the afternoon.  We know that standing is a form of exercise compared to sitting and there are many classes which would lend themselves to that, in which people could stand while holding a book rather than sit a desk.  If that was done twice a day it would be an hour of augmented physical activity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-11a.639" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Donal O'Shea" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2012101100015#O00300"><p>On whether we will have an outbreak of anorexia in response to highlighting children's weight, that point has been made and we come across it regularly talking to parents.  It is a mistake.  Anorexia nervosa is a psychiatric disease.  The tool is food but it is not a food-related disease.</p><p>  In terms of increased physical activity in the classroom, this is part of the cross-sectoral approach.  Wake Up Shake Up programmes are in place in some schools, under which children stand up and do some musical dancing in between classes.  We mentioned the green school.  There is an active school programme that is trying to encourage all of that but it must be embedded in schools across the entire country, and that will involve resources.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-11a.641" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Donal O'Shea" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2012101100015#O00500"><p>Senator Eamonn Coghlan's programme is one part of that.</p><p>  I will briefly respond to each of the comments.  The personal responsibility comment from Deputy Byrne is critical.  One of the big problems is that parents do not recognise their child is overweight until it is too late.  By the time they recognise it they are in serious trouble, as the child has an 80% chance of being obese as an adult because if it is let happen it tracks, so to speak.</p><p>  To respond to Deputy Naughten, the role of the public health nurse in breast-feeding and monitoring will be critical.  Currently, we weigh children up to the age of four.  That is done historically because of under-nutrition.  The problem now is over-nutrition.  We stop weighing them at the age of four but we must continue doing that and tell the parents that their child is on track or a little over but they should keep it steady because they will grow into it.</p><p>  On Deputy Dowds's question about banning advertising of unhealthy foods and letting the industry promote healthy options for every unhealthy option they advertise, that is part of the bigger industry health collaboration.  The industry has a lot to bring to the table in terms of advertising.  Its expertise is fantastic.  If industry were to promote Dr. Flynn's guidelines from the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, that combination would be magic.</p><p>  To respond to Senator Crown's point on professional regulation and professional education, one of the recommendations of the obesity task force in 2005 was that education about nutrition and obesity would be embedded into nursing, medicine and all allied health.  It is similar to the rest of the 96 recommendations.  It did not get the attention it needed because it did not have the political clout from the top.  Our waiting list for surgery is now infinite.  We have more than 150 people awaiting surgery-----</p></speech>

I concur with my colleague, Professor Donal O'Shea, that eating disorders are at the very severe end of a spectrum but there is a huge problem with fear of fatness, particularly among teenage girls and women.  Professor O'Shea will take diet histories but they will be heavily influenced by under-reporting because we make people so uncomfortable about the whole issue of overweight and obesity they do not tell the truth about what they eat.</p><p>  I have a concern about the focus on obesity.  We must be careful and take people to task in this regard.  When there is anything in the media about obesity the most unflattering photographs of women and children they can find are made public.  They should be called to task over that because that stigmatisation is a prejudice against the very people who need to take action.  When we call for, say, the promotion of healthy eating guidelines we should not have the skinniest people in those campaigns but a mix of people, which reflects the reality.  Before we go forward with any campaign we should ask overweight men, women and children if it would encourage them to take action because if it makes them feel like hiding under a rock or burying their heads in the sand it will not do any good.  There should be a call to action about the fear of fatness.  We need to include the body image and be aware that we make people feel ashamed.  Parents are terrified that somebody will say their child is obese or overweight because of what it says about them.  We need to understand that psychological aspect to it.</p><p>  We did research from the mid-1990s up to the early 2000s in which 19% of our transition year students said they would smoke to keep down their weight.  They said they had started smoking and would continue to smoke to keep down their weight.  That is how terrified they are of putting on weight, and that is not within the eating disorders group.  We were surprised that 15% said they induced vomiting as a weight loss strategy.  Also, with regard to the use of drugs such as ecstasy, it is a reality that people lose weight.  We think of their vulnerability but adolescents do not think about what will happen when they are 30, 40 or 50.  They are thinking of tomorrow or next week.  They under a lot of pressure, and we must be very careful, when we talk about weighing people, that we do it in a manner that does not exacerbate those issues.</p></speech>

It would be very beneficial if they prioritised those they regard as realistic or otherwise.  Senator van Turnhout stated we could make this too complex.  This is possible.  Obfuscation might suit some parties.  The matter is complex but we must really focus on the basics.  This is what I urge the committee to do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-11a.654" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Kelly" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2012101100016#P00500"><p>I will speak very briefly on some of Deputy Byrne's comments and those of Deputy Mitchell O'Connor.  The complexity of the pricing system needs to be considered in the round when some of the fiscal measures are under consideration.</p><p>  Fresh produce, by its nature, incurs an additional cost because it is much more difficult to handle and there is a higher rate of wastage.  Seasonality must also be considered.  One can find virtually any vegetable or fruit in a supermarket for 12 months of the year.  These fruits and vegetables, however, do not exist seasonally in Ireland for 12 months of the year.  Therefore, there is a cost associated with their production off-season under glass in Ireland or with importing them from other countries.  </p><p>  Fresh protein, including that in fish, meat and chicken, tends to be more expensive because of the cost inputs.  This is evident when one considers the differences between the various proteins.  Chicken tends to be cheaper than some red meat products, for example, because the conversion efficiency of the feed inputs is greater.  In some respects, therefore, it costs less to use.  Such products are increasing in price significantly because of higher feed costs, which are driven, in turn, by factors such as the drought in the mid-western United States this year.  Unfortunately, our having a globalised food chain has implications for the consumer in Ireland, including Dublin.</p><p>  Rather than considering fiscal measures such as taxation and subsidies - our position on this is clear as we have talked about it before - there is a need to consider the margins of end organisations such as fruit and vegetable retailers.  There is some flexibility in this regard because there has recently been more promotion of fruit and vegetables.  This suggests there is flexibility regarding the margins that are being garnered at end of the food supply chain.</p></speech>

The members will not have seen too many traffic lights on produce in the Irish market because guideline daily amounts are ubiquitous here.  It is worth noting the FSAI has lobbied for front-of-packet guideline daily amounts.</p><p>  I share Dr. Foley-Nolan's view that the time for action is now.  There are many solutions, and we have all suggested them.  The members need to identify in their report the actions that need to be taken and they need to prioritise them.  From our perspective, a priority is establishing the Live Well platform.  There are four or five clear and key activities that must be stress-tested for use.  Industry is ready to go.</p></speech>
