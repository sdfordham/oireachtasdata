The lead Department is the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and has indicated that it welcomes the proposal as part of the overall EU international investment policy, which will assist in making the EU, and therefore Ireland, a more attractive investment location for foreign direct investment.

I am the chairman of the Drinks Industry Group of Ireland, Mr. Peter O'Brien is the corporate relations director for Diageo and Mr. Anthony Foley is the author of the report.</p><p>  Membership of the Drinks Industry Group of Ireland spans manufacturers such as Diageo, C&amp;C, Irish Distillers Pernod Ricard, and Heineken; distributors and importers; and the retail sectors of the industry, both the on-trade, such as pubs, restaurants, hotels, and nightclubs, and the independent off-licence sector.  Mr. Donall O'Keeffe, our secretary and the chief executive of the Licensed Vintners Association, is in the Visitors Gallery.</p><p>  Together, our members support over 62,000 jobs dispersed through every town and village in the country.  These jobs range from the barman in the local pub to the factory worker on a bottling line to the tourist centre guide to the marketing manager for many of our major international brands.  We also make a major contribution to the overall economy.</p> <p>This is made not only through employment but also through the &euro;3 billion turnover and &euro;1 billion in exports generated by the drinks sector.  Almost &euro;2 billion in taxation revenue from VAT and excise is provided to the Exchequer through the sale of our products in Ireland.</p><p> Like many sectors of the economy, ours is facing significant challenges.  For example, our most recent mid-year drinks market figures show that sales volumes in the key on-trade sector have declined by 34% since 2007.  As a result, employment levels in our pubs have plummeted, with 7,000 full-time job equivalents lost in recent years.  Contrary to popular belief, the overall market for alcohol and <i>per capita </i>consumption have declined over the past decade.  Average adult consumption levels of alcohol have reduced by almost 20% in the ten years to mid-2012.</p><p> While prospects for the domestic drinks market in the short term are gloomy, Irish drinks exports have proven to be a consistent success story over recent times.  To quantify the extent of this success and to identify the markets where our products are thriving and the policy decisions that are required to build on this, DIGI commissioned the beverage exports report from Mr. Anthony Foley, who has previously authored a number of studies for us.  In essence, the report shows that Ireland significantly over-performs in terms of beverage exports.  Our brands of whiskey, beer, cider and cream liqueur are known and respected the world over, are available in more than 100 markets and are among some of Ireland's most celebrated and internationally recognised brands.  I include brands such as Guinness, Jameson, Baileys, Tullamore Dew and Magners.</p><p> The Irish share of world alcohol exports is 2.4%, compared with 0.8% for overall merchandise exports.  With regard to our international position, Ireland is ranked 11th in order of size of alcohol exports, compared with 33rd for overall merchandise exports.  For a small country such as Ireland to be in the top 12 global drinks exporters is something of which we should be very proud.  The value of our exports increased each year from 2000 to 2003, when it reached &euro;1 billion for the first time.  This peaked in 2007, when in excess of &euro;1.3 billion worth of products were exported.  While there has been some decline in recent years due to the international recession, growth has resumed and the future remains very positive, given the wider success of Irish food and drink products in key global markets.</p><p> The report shows that the United Kingdom and North America continue to be the main markets for Irish beverages, but it also demonstrates the very significant potential for additional sales to China, India and other major emerging markets.  For that reason, the drinks industry continues to work very closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in particular to identify new markets for our products and ease certain tariffs and restrictions that are in place and which are barriers to growth.  For example, the industry is involved in an ongoing dialogue with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Irish permanent representation to the European Union in Brussels regarding the treatment of alcohol under negotiations for the EU-India free trade agreement.  Currently, high tariffs are in place for imported spirits to India, a major emerging market.  There will be significant potential for Irish whiskey and cream liqueurs in India when these prohibitive tariffs are reduced.  I appeal to committee members to support all such efforts in this regard.</p><p> There is a very strong economic payback at home for our success abroad.  Increased manufacturing and sales of our global brands sustain local jobs.  The agricultural sector benefits significantly from purchases of raw materials, such as barley, milk and cream.  Local suppliers of glass, packaging, design and marketing services are major beneficiaries.  The impact of beverage exports on the domestic economy far outweighs that of other products manufactured in Ireland for international markets due to the high level of locally sourced inputs.  The figure for the beverage industry is 60%, compared with 15% or 18% in pharmaceuticals.</p><p> Our exports also provide international profile for Ireland and contribute to our reputation for hospitality and conviviality.  Large-scale facilities, such as the Guinness Storehouse or the Old Jameson Distillery, and the small rural pub at the country crossroads are unique parts of the visitor's experience of Ireland.  At a time when we are attempting to boost tourism into Ireland and the wider hospitality sector through initiatives such as The Gathering<i>, </i>it is important to remember that major tourism guides frequently state that a night in an Irish pub, enjoying some of our world renowned products, remains a key positive experience for visitors.</p><p> This demonstrates the important link between export success, tourism and a vibrant hospitality sector, of which the drinks market is a major part.  As I mentioned, this domestic market has suffered significantly in recent times.  Latest CSO data, for example, show us that bar sales volumes to July this year were 8.2% below 2011.  Such losses cannot be sustained indefinitely and we need to find ways to encourage consumer confidence to boost spending in the hospitality sector.  In this regard we believe the measures proposed in the EU-IMF-ECB memo to increase excise, if implemented, would likely lead to higher prices.  This would further deter customers from our pubs with a knock-on effect on local jobs, businesses and the wider economy.  At the same time it would contradict laudable initiatives such as The Gathering<i></i>and the reduced lower rate of VAT on food services and other tourism products.  Ireland has some of the highest alcohol taxes in Europe and the Government must take this into account when framing budgetary policy.</p><p> I hope the report and statement show the importance of the drinks sector to the economy, the success of our products abroad, our important contribution to tourism and the manner in which all of these are connected.  My colleagues and I are grateful for the opportunity to address the members and look forward to answering any questions they may have.</p></speech>

It is under-appreciated and easy to kick at times, as it were.  Bearing in mind the 34% decline in the on-trade, what is the figure for the off-trade?</p><p>  Mr. Tobin spoke a lot about the success of our exports, which is to be welcomed.  Where is the innovation in the industry in Ireland?  Where are the new Guinnesses and the new drinks?</p><p>  Mr. Tobin spoke about increasing the market share in the United Kingdom and United States in particular in recent years.  These are the traditional markets.  Are we coming up with products that are attractive to those who drink in the non-traditional markets?  In 20 or 30 years, will we have a drink the equivalent of Baileys that will come from Ireland and sustain such markets?</p><p>  What supports are in place?  Is DIGI receiving enough support from the agencies, including Enterprise Ireland, in terms of the innovation process and being ahead of the demand curve?</p><p>  Mr. Tobin referred quite a bit to The Gathering.  What ideas and innovations will DIGI bring to the table in that regard?  The group represents one of the industries that may gain the most from The Gathering.  One of the challenges of The Gathering is that private sector finance must be secured.  Has DIGI thought about that?</p><p>  This committee can highlight the Indian issue.  Are there other markets or blockages?  Commissioner Reding said on the radio this morning that it is a priority for her, as Vice President of the European Commission, to consider areas that have been blocking job creation.  Ultimately, this is what we are all about.  What are the key blockages to be addressed?</p></speech>

On the question of how much has gone to the off-licence trade, overall the market has seen a slight decline, by 3.2% this year to date.  Has Mr. Foley a figure for the off-trade?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-25a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Anthony Foley" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012092500004#C00500"><p>Yes.  Approximately two thirds of the 30% decline is due to growth in the off-licence sector.  It is not quite one for one; it is a case of approximately two thirds going to the off-licence sector.  The off-licence share has increased dramatically.  It is now responsible for approximately 55% of volume, with 30% of value.  Ten years ago, it was responsible for approximately 20% of value and 40% of volume.  Therefore, there has been a significant change.</p></speech>

Are the benefiting off-licences in the big supermarkets?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-25a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1071" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012092500004#C00800"><p>Yes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-25a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kieran Tobin" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012092500004#C00900"><p>Independent off-licences would be members of DIGI and we know they are losing market share in addition to the on-trade.  It is the multiples that have gained.</p><p>  The question on innovation was very good.  Baileys has been the great innovation success of the past 30 years.  One of the other great successes has been a very traditional product, Irish whiskey.  The company I work with, Irish Distillers, is the primary producer in this regard.  We are considering a range of products that were popular in the 19th century, such as pot still products, and bringing them to market.  Sometimes there is nothing new under the sun.  These are some of the products that are successful abroad as well as at home.  We are developing a new range in this area.</p><p>  Of the traditional products across the sector, I have no doubt that Irish whiskey has considerable potential as it stands, irrespective of innovation.  The innovation comes in terms of route to market, marketing, branding and positioning.</p> <p>The product has the heritage and the tradition and we know how to make it.  The innovation lies in its branding and promotion.  Globally, approximately 90 million cases of scotch - we measure in 12-bottle cases - are sold.  North American whisky sells 50 million cases.  Irish whiskey sells just over 6 million cases.  We could eat several people's lunches before they even realised, that is, we could double or treble our sales and still only account for a fraction of what the others are achieving.  We have a long way to go to return to where we used to be, but we will undoubtedly get there.</p><p> In terms of innovation, it is important that we play in the domestic market; that is, companies should develop and try out new products domestically to determine whether the latter will fly.  My colleague from Diageo might add something in this regard, as Guinness has been one of the more innovative companies.  Sometimes it has done that well and sometimes it has not, but it is active in this area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-25a.25" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter O'Brien" time="13:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012092500005#D00200"><p>Let us consider two brands, Guinness and Baileys, which one might believe have been around forever.  The latter's four flavours - chocolate, caramel, hazelnut and biscotti in addition to its original flavour - were developed in Ireland and represent more than 20% of total Baileys global exports.  Guinness Mid-Strength, one of the great innovations in terms of having a lower alcohol by volume, ABV, level, is growing in Ireland and overseas.  Another product is Guinness Black Lager.  Guinness has been Guinness for 250 years, but our black lager has considerable export sales in the US.  These are just three examples of innovation by a strong domestic company at St. James's Gate.</p></speech>

The Government has set out the Harvest 2020 vision of food and drink exports amounting to &euro;12 billion.  Drinks account for just over &euro;1 billion of that figure, but there is no reason they could not increase to &euro;2 billion in the medium to long-term.  In our experience, the State agencies have been supportive, although they are probably more important for small companies.</p></speech>

They have received a strong brief to support trade, which links with the issues of trade agreements, access to markets, etc., and are increasingly playing a role on behalf of all companies.  We should compliment the Department in this respect.</p></speech>

Both of our organisations have a significant presence in the tourism sector, for example, in the form of visitor centres.  Guinness receives more than 1 million visitors per year.  The two distilleries of my group receive more than 350,000 per year.  Negotiations are under way, although I am unsure as to the detail.  Perhaps Mr. O'Brien might be closer to the matter.</p></speech>

We are good at marketing and will take on the role of marketing Ireland for The Gathering.  Many of those involved have asked us to participate.  Money is involved, but so are skills and expertise, which our company, Irish Distillers and others are bringing to bear.</p></speech>

Russia's accession to the World Trade Organisation, WTO, recently bore fruit.  While Russia did not have tariff barriers, it had many non-tariff barriers to trade.  Our products, including Jameson Irish Whiskey, and other products had been doing well in Russia, but with the country's accession to the WTO, all of the non-tariff barriers will disappear and the market will become considerably more open.</p><p>  Our permanent representative in Brussels does a good job in this area and would be well allied with countries such as France and the UK, which are also large exporters.  They form a strong coalition, which is to be commended.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-25a.31" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1080" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="13:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012092500005#D00800"><p>F&aacute;ilte roimh anseo inniu.  I have a question about the industry's structure.  It was rumoured a number of years ago that several dominant organisations within the industry may have led to a lack of growth.  Increased diversity, particularly in respect of spirits, has led to an increased emphasis on exports.  What are the witnesses' opinions in this regard?  The Cooley Distillery created a competitor, on the back of which it attracted a foreign investor.  Some people believe that this stimulated brand competition.</p><p>  I might not be correct, but most of the market's large players are foreign-owned.  Does this have an effect on their view?  Are the products in question additions to their core products or are they focused on driving them?</p><p>  The micro-brewery industry is an emerging sector, but remains comparably very small.  I studied the issue and learned that the micro-brewery industry as a whole had received an investment of &euro;70,000 in 1996, which was equivalent to the promotion of Trinity's sports day by Smirnoff Ice, a tiny product of a large company.  Diversity among the micro-breweries seems to be creating product innovation in that industry.</p><p>  Regarding the structure of industry sales, on-licensed trade seems more valuable to the State than off-licensed trade.  If a fisherman catches a fish, it is worth X amount.  If a tourist catches a fish, it is worth more.  Perhaps the Government should consider ways of promoting on-licensed consumption as opposed to the more dangerous off-licensed consumption.</p><p>  MEAS is an organisation for the proper consumption of alcohol supported by the drinks industry.  We were trying to set up a pilot project in Navan, County Meath, in which all alcohol bottles and cans would carry the stamps of where and when they were sold so that the adults who gave them to young people could be traced.  Such activities would promote the proper consumption of alcohol and lead the Government to adopt a more relaxed attitude towards excise, etc.</p></speech>

The scale of a company is a major determinant of its exports' performance.  Historically, we have been a good exporting nation, but that has primarily been driven by multinationals.  Some 90% of our exports come from multinationals.  Scale is particularly a determinant where consumer branded products are involved, in that it would be difficult for many small companies to develop export capabilities abroad.</p><p>  Some members may recall our idea about building a trading house to act as a co-operative for small companies to export.  It never worked well.  Although admitting it almost sticks in my throat, one of the main issues encountered when trying to develop Jameson Irish Whiskey internationally had to do with the fact that its parent company is an international company, with access to shelf space, markets, etc.  An Irish company without those international connections would not have been able to do it.  When Grand Metropolitan took over Baileys Irish Cream, the former's international marketing capacity gave the latter space and prominence in duty free shops, etc.  As a straight Gilbeys of Ireland product, it would not have achieved that level of prominence.</p><p>  As to scale, the structure of the industry is dominated by large operators but, like the dairy industry, which is trying to promote amalgamations with an eye towards building capacity to do research and development and improving expenditure on marketing.</p> <p>That would be a major determinant of the export performance.</p><p> With regard to the on-licence and off-licence side, there are approximately 5,000 people employed in off-licences, with approximately 55,000 people employed in bars, including hotel bars, around the country.  Some 70% of the VAT receipts come from the on-licence side and 30% come from the off-licence end.  With regard to tax associated with employment, the on-licence side is clearly the contributor.  Receipts from excise are more of a 50-50 split, as it is the same excise whether alcohol is sold off-licence or on-licence.  Approximately 55% comes from the off-licence side, with 45% from the on-licence side.  The Deputy is absolutely correct in the basic comment that the on-licence side provides the main economic benefit in terms of employment, tax receipts and so on.</p></speech>

I work for a multinational company but it is interesting to see this type of industry.  In the United States there is an explosion in the use of micro-distillation or craft distillation, which we may begin to see here as well.  It will be based on whiskey but it will also take in white spirits like gin and vodka, which are more immediately saleable because whiskey must be aged for a minimum of three years before it can be sold.  That side of the industry will come to fruition as well, which will play with the concept of Ireland as a food and drink island.</p><p>  People will come to taste our products and it will be part of the tourist experience to go to the Guinness Storehouse and a small whiskey company in Dingle.  I know somebody starting such a business in Dingle, which is a great tourist centre.  Tullamore Dew has just announced it will build its own distillery and it has opened a visitor centre.  I am sure Jim Beam, the company which bought the Cooley Distillery, will upscale and upgrade the Kilbeggan centre and push that product.  There is a burgeoning expansion in the area and from our perspective in Jameson, the more competition there is, the better.  We are not competing against each other.  I have provided the statistics; there are 6 million cases of Irish whiskey, 90 million cases of Scotch whisky and 50 million cases of North American whisky.  There are probably 200 million cases of vodka.  That is what we are after.  We have managed to break out of that cycle.</p></speech>

What about an excise promotion structure for micro-distillation and micro-brewing?  It may not necessarily be in the direct interests of large multinationals but for the smaller producers under a certain volume of production, is there a system where lower excise is imposed?</p></speech>

In other words, for lower strength beers there is a reduction in excise.  That does not relate to production volume.  To reiterate the point and as a representative of a large beer manufacturer, our craft beer is Smithwicks, with Smithwicks pale ale the latest innovation.  Craft beers are growing and they have a significant role to play in pubs.  Beer consumption is declining in Ireland and it is being beaten by wine in many cases.  The more we can do to promote the micro-brewery business and get people back to appreciating and drinking beer, the more positive it will be in promoting Irish business.</p></speech>

That was put in place by the drinks industry approximately eight or ten years ago, and it has been building since.  It is the only significant initiative in terms of funding and presence, and it has achieved certain things.  Clearly it has not achieved all it set out to do but we would be very happy to work with the Government on this.  We would love to have a conversation with the Government about what we do, and how we have put in &euro;20 million or the equivalent into MEAS and DrinkAware.  We would like to see how to co-operate to address the issues facing our industry and society in general regarding misuse and abuse of alcohol.  We are certainly open to those kinds of discussions.</p></speech>

What are the threats?  Around Europe there appears to be a sense that too much alcohol is being consumed.  Will the witnesses provide figures for alcohol consumption per head of population in Ireland?  Many of us find almost unstoppable the calls for more restrictions, higher taxes, bans on sports sponsorship, etc.  Have we really got a much bigger problem than other countries?  We keep hearing that this is the case but every now and then we hear that we drink less alcohol than people in other countries.  On that basis, how will the companies look to handle those threats in future?</p></speech>

Our <i>per capita</i> consumption has decreased by approximately 20% since 2001, which was the peak of our <i>per capita</i> consumption of alcohol.  At that stage, per adult consumption was 14.4 litres, and that is now down to approximately 11.7 litres.  That is a decline of approximately 20%.  If a reduction in <i>per capita</i> consumption would solve our problems, we would be on that road.  The industry would argue that per adult consumption is not the issue but rather the misuse of our products.  That is against the total market or per adult consumption.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-25a.45" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Anthony Foley" time="13:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012092500006#E01200"><p>Mr. Tobin has provided the main statistics.  The measurement is litres of pure alcohol per adult, as opposed to <i>per capita</i>.  Funnily enough, that puts us at about the same level as the French, and we see those as sensible, moderate and organised drinkers.  The number is in the top third of European Union members, and by international standards it is relatively high, although not nearly as high - relatively speaking - as it was a decade ago.</p><p>  The Senator is absolutely right in that internationally there is concern about the abuse of alcohol.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n referred to one of our problems in Ireland, namely, that enforcement is pathetic.  Listening to Joe Duffy's radio show over the past few days we would have heard about drunk students on Grafton Street, and as far as I could see, not one of them was arrested.  They were lying around the place and urinating on the streets.  There are many laws but we just do not implement them.  We establish as many laws as we like but if we do not implement them, it will not do much good.</p><p>  A venture capitalist with a bunch of money would probably prefer to put it into information technology rather than alcohol, given the societal and political pressures.  I do not speak for the industry but I do not believe anybody would say that an industry can survive where its product is being abused and creating more negatives than positives.  The long-term interest of the industry is clearly better served by a sympathetic public policy environment, and that will only come about when there is moderate and organised consumption of alcohol.</p><p>  One of our big problems in Ireland is the way we consume alcohol and abuse through binge drinking.  It is not a nicely moderate drink with a meal but rather people going out to get drunk.  We must fundamentally change that culture.  That is difficult to achieve.  Although we have spoken about prices and taxes, we should remember where the temperance movement began, with Fr. Mathew when we were poverty-stricken.  Why is there a limit on the number of licences?  In the 1900s there were so many pubs and shebeens proliferating the authorities felt the need to put a stop to the process.  That did not come about because of wealth or income.  There is a deeply imbued cultural element in the Irish with regard to alcohol, and it will require a much more sophisticated and thoughtful approach to deal with the issue than most of the policy suggestions we have heard.</p><p>  The sponsorship of products by alcohol companies has been mentioned.  Does anybody really think a group of drunken 18-year-old students going to a local convent are influenced by a competition being called the Heineken Cup as opposed to a rugby cup?  If they are from my part of the city - the north side - they do not even know what rugby is.</p> <p>We have a major problem with the abuse of alcohol in particular ways and we need to be much more energetic and sophisticated in how we deal with it.  One criticism I would have of this Government and of previous ones is that at times they would criticise MEAS and so on but the amount of resources put in by Government for health promotion, alcohol education and proper leadership in terms of sending leading sportsmen into schools to persuade people against alcohol has been negligible.  I agree we have a major problem.  It does not help the industry in terms of growth and development but it is something we will have to deal with.  </p></speech>

Are more younger people drinking now than previously?  Mr. O'Brien mentioned that we have moved from beer to wine and spirits.  Has that changed as well?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-25a.48" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Anthony Foley" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012092500007#F00300"><p>The first thing, which we never talk about given gender politics, is that if one goes back 40 years, by and large, women did not go into pubs.  They might have had a glass of sherry whereas now they are equal partners in the drinking culture.  That, in itself, has driven up average measures of consumption per head.  People are consuming at a younger age and are probably consuming larger volumes at a younger age.  Many of us might have tried alcohol when we were 13 or 14 years of age but we would not have had the money to do so regularly.</p><p>  There is another feature which is fundamentally different.  I am displaying my age but my father liked his pint but he would never drink in the house, except at Christmas.  Why would one drink in the house when one could go to the pub?  It is now more usual to consume alcohol at home, particularly wine.  Wine now accounts for one quarter of all alcohol consumed and approximately 80% of that is consumed at home as opposed to in hotels, restaurants, pubs and so on.</p><p>  There have been changes, particularly in home consumption.  That has been widened with the regulatory environment - drink driving, the smoking ban and so on.  Much more alcohol is being consumed at home where children may see that happening more than in the pub.</p><p>  The bottom line conclusion is that much more alcohol is consumed in an unregulated environment where no one measures the measure, no one counts the number of drinks one has had and there is no cash register ticking as one buys another round.  That has increased the pressure to consume alcohol.  There have been very significant changes over the longer term in the consumption pattern.</p></speech>

The value of exports by the drinks sector performed very well increasing from &euro;854 million in 2000 to a peak of &euro;1.324 billion in 2007, or 55% over those seven years.  From the viewpoint of the direct benefit to the economy, the share of those exports which go directly into the Irish economy through wages, spending on Irish raw materials and on services is highly significant in sustaining our economy, thousands of households and many communities.</p><p>  The estimate that half of the value of exports flows into our economy in this way reflects the many raw materials sourced in Ireland, such as barley, apples and milk.  The Baileys example is one which illustrates this well.  According to the study, three quarters of its raw ingredients and packaging come from Ireland, including 220 million litres of fresh Irish milk.  I am familiar with the Baileys product as a co-founder of Lir Chocolates.  We use the unique Baileys liqueur in the production of our Baileys chocolates which are, in turn, exported.</p><p>   My job was to try to get Baileys to become a partner of Lir Chocolates and I spent seven years doing that because I had to deal with changes of managing directors over the years but eventually it was agreed with Mr. Ned Sullivan.  It was an extraordinary catalyst for Lir Chocolates and gave it an energy and excitement because we had a partner with a worldwide company to get into export markets.  Everybody around the world knows Baileys, so we are indebted to Baileys for that and for the continued success of the export of our Baileys chocolates.</p><p>  As Seanad spokesperson on jobs and innovation for Fianna F&aacute;il, my focus is on encouraging every sector of our economy which has the capacity to increase desperately needed exports and maximising the resulting domestic expenditures.  For us to help the drinks industry going forward, I would strongly encourage it to set out an ambitious three to four year export plan and the projected domestic expenditures which will benefit Irish companies.  The Jim Beam group purchasing Cooley Distillery and Irish Distillers expanding into the United States is tremendous and the Grant company developing Tullamore Dew is fantastic.  I do not need to be convinced if companies must be owned by other companies to get into a market.  Many Irish people do not really understand how difficult it is for small Irish companies which do not have the marketing spread or tentacles around the world, to get new markets.</p><p>  If the industry commits to strong export growth, it strengthens the case for very active Government, political and diplomatic action to overcome unjustified tariffs and non-tariff barriers by other countries to Irish drinks exports, such as the high tariffs imposed by India to which Mr. Tobin referred.  I would encourage our committee to fully support such action but stress that it would help if the industry set out its plans to contribute to exports and jobs in our economy over the years.</p><p>  Mr. Tobin referred to the drop in consumption of 20% over the past ten years.  Ireland still has a very high level of alcohol consumption.  We all know that.  There is no doubt it is embedded in our culture.  I travelled all over Italy and France for one month on my summer holidays with my husband and there is no doubt that other cultures do not binge drink.  They enjoy alcohol as part of their daily life and do not drink to extreme.  We have a cultural problem.</p><p>  Mr. Tobin referred to Ireland having some of the highest alcohol taxes in Europe but we also have extreme price discounting and special promotions of alcohol.  The industry should recognise these issues.  The current political debate on alcohol policy, including minimum pricing and the extent of sports sponsorship by the drinks industry, reflects the desire of the public and politicians to address these very issues.  </p><p>  This committee is the most important one in Leinster House.  The No. 1 problem in Ireland is employment - keeping people in jobs and creating new jobs.  If the industry can come up with something, we will help it.  The positive side of it is that it makes a tremendous contribution to the employment of Irish people.</p></speech>

It was an interesting thought to articulate what we do internally in our companies - looking at things five years and ten year out.  As an industry, it would be interesting to articulate that in a more coherent way than we have been doing.  As an industry we have looked at what the level of investment will be over the next four to five years, which is &euro;500 million.</p><p>  In Midleton, Irish Distillers will invest more than &euro;200 million in expansion of the distillery and maturation capacity.  Guinness will invest &euro;150 million in new brewing capacity in St. James's Gate.  Tullamore Dew is building a new distillery and Jim Beam is going to invest in Cooley so when we add all that up, we are talking about &euro;500 million over the next five years with all the construction jobs and all that goes with that.  Ultimately, there will be manufacturing jobs.</p> <p>Inevitably there will be additional employment in sales and spin-off jobs.  Several of today's newspapers carry a nice photograph of the 35 graduates Jameson is sponsoring to act as ambassadors for the company in 28 different markets.  That is a part of job creation which is sometimes missed.  It would be interesting to articulate that more clearly.</p><p> In regard to ownership, Irish whiskey has to be distilled and matured in Ireland, irrespective of who owns it.  Irish cream liquors are also subject to strict rules.  Pernod Ricard, which is ultimately a French multinational, owns Irish Distillers and it sells Jameson as an inherently Irish product.  It also owns Havana Club but it is not going to make a Cuban rum into a French rum.  It is focused on heritage and the origins of its products.  Ownership is less important than strong branding.  The French have <i>appellation d'origine contr&ocirc;l&eacute;e</i>for their wines and we have it for our whiskeys, cream liquors and other products.  </p><p> I take on board speakers' comments about pricing and other issues.  We endeavour to express our views on sponsorship and we engage with the Government where possible.</p></speech>

It is good that so many Irish products dominate the top ten lists globally.  Mr. Tobin outlined the importance of that success story and why new markets need to be developed.  He has also suggested some ways in which we can facilitate that task.</p><p>  In regard to responsible consumption of alcohol, has the issue of below-cost selling influenced the sector in any way?  Has Mr. Foley studied the issue?  We are considering whether we should introduce a floor price for the sale of alcohol.</p></speech>

Scotland has introduced a limit but virtually no alcohol is sold in Ireland at that price.  In Britain there is a wide variety of cheap spirits but that is not so much the case in Ireland.  If we were going to introduce a minimum price it would have to be much higher than the Scottish one to have any effect.  I am not sure that a minimum price would make a huge difference.  Suppose we state that a bottle of whiskey or vodka must be sold for &euro;15.  What is to stop the supermarket from then selling crisps at 1 cent per packet?  They can introduce all sorts of complementary products to get over the price.  As an economist, I would have to argue that the higher the price, the smaller the consumption, but the relationship is such that enormous price increases would be required to achieve a significant reduction in consumption and a significant effect on health.  An increase of 2% or 5% is not going to make much of a difference.  I would bet any money that if one polled a group of young teenagers who should not be drinking in the first place, they would not even know the price of the products they purchased.  They would estimate the price at &euro;4.50 or &euro;5 but they would not be able to accurately estimate a price of, for example, &euro;4.67.  An issue certainly arises in respect of the off-licence price of alcohol.</p><p>  There are growing concerns throughout Europe about youth drinking not following the patterns of parents' consumption.  For example, police in Rome are worried about drinkers congregating at fountains and squares, which was unheard of five years ago.  The drinking problem among Irish youth is also a wider international problem.  Price matters but one would need to create substantial price differentials to induce substantial reductions in consumption.</p></speech>

How big a factor do commercial rates play in sustaining jobs in the sector?  Several years ago there were 72 licensed premises in the small west of Ireland town in which I live but there are only eight today.  I see pubs closing on a regular basis.  Is this a big issue for publicans and has a submission been made to the Minister?  A national review of commercial rates is required across every sector of the commercial retail world.</p><p>  We do not yet know how the proposed property tax will be implemented but I am worried that small publicans will be required to pay commercial rates as well as property taxes on their overhead accommodation.  Sometimes people neglect to pay attention to the scenarios that may arise.  I saw a situation arise in respect of the second home tax, whereby small publicans living one or two miles down the road were told their overhead accommodation was liable for the tax.  Has a submission been made to the Minister on these issues in light of the impact they have on the drinks industry and small publicans?</p></speech>

A pub might have the same valuation now as it had in 2007 - there have been minuscule changes in the poundage rates in local authorities - and is in effect paying the same amount as it did when business was booming in 2007.  It is a significant cost element and both rural and Dublin publicans have made submissions to local authorities to seek improvements.  On a general basis, they believe the various proposals from the local government efficiency review group should have been implemented to reduce the cost of local authorities and pass on some of those cost savings in reduced rates.</p><p>  One of the worries about the proposed system is that the commercial sector will remain separate from the general population sector.  Even if there are electoral controls over local authorities when they are eventually given responsibility for the property tax, councillors may avoid excessive increases for fear of losing their seats but that will not apply on the commercial side because it forms a minor part of the electorate.  The ideal for much of the commercial sector is an integrated and uniform local authority tax which is levied in the same way on everybody and ideally reflects ability to pay.  They are certainly not happy with the present system or the efforts made by local authorities to reduce the burden.</p></speech>

We will look at our programme of work next week to examine the areas on which we can focus.  </p><p> On the issue of the effect on consumption of increasing the price of alcohol, which is probably more related to the health issue, my impression from working in the industry in the past is that if the price of alcohol is set too high, people will mix their drinks which is not a good result.  That consideration does not seem to feature in any argument.  Has any research been done on that?  If young people start mixing the wrong drinks, we will have problems.</p></speech>

A basic problem, as the Chairman indicated, is that there is a slightly na&iuml;ve view that if the price of alcohol is pushed up that will solve the problem.  However, there has been cross-border shopping with people going abroad.  Some 6 million people still go abroad and if the price of alcohol is very expensive here, people will bring back three bottles of whiskey instead of the one bottle they would have brought back previously.  The effects of increasing the price of alcohol are complex.  A recent effect of the high price of alcohol has been the switch to buying alcohol in the off-licence and home consumption of alcohol.  That means people are consuming more alcohol while saving money but they are doing so at home as opposed to in the pub.  The price-quantity relationship is more complex than is usually presented.</p></speech>

Has any research been done on how the problem of high alcohol consumption among our youth can be dealt with from the perspective of the drinks industry?  A huge change has occurred in the past 15 years in that young people now drink at home or drink high volumes of spirits before they go out, as opposed to going out and enjoying a few beers as was the case ten or 15 years ago.  That is a big cultural change not only in Ireland but across Europe.  Has the group done any research on that, particularly on the high number of alcoholic drinks such as alcopops that are sold?</p></speech>

Research would have been done in this area and people would have been asked what influenced them to drink, what age they started to drink at, were they influenced to drink because of peer group pressure and how much they drink.  There would be information on that.  Where we would be weak is on solutions, on what we can do to make people not do this.  I was under the illusion once upon a time that if people were heavily involved in sports they would not be out drinking because they would be training but someone pointed out to me the prevalence of a drinking culture at discos in rugby clubs.  Therefore, it is a much deeper problem.</p></speech>

The industry does not ask them questions.  That is one of the reasons we set up MEAS to explore this more fully.  MEAS, which owns the DrinkAware brand, might come before the committee sometime and talk about the research it has done and the activities it undertakes.  It talks to and carries out research among those under the age of 18.  Some of the numbers are disquieting and some of them are encouraging.  The problem is complex.  If this area is of significant interest to this committee, a short session with MEAS would flesh out the detail on this area.  The drinks industry does not get involved in this area.</p></speech>

The likelihood is that exports will remain the only significant source of a positive momentum in the economy for the next few years and, that being the case, safeguarding and expanding the export base will continue to be a critical important objective of the Government's overall economic strategy.  We are concerned that the stimulus measures being given to many of our competitor countries are not being repeated in Ireland and that obviously puts our exporters at a competitive disadvantage.  Moves recently by the Federal Reserve in the US in terms of Ben Bernanke's statement on quantitative easing whereby the US is going to stick at it until such time as it reduces the level of unemployment effectively means that our exports not only to the US but to the Middle East and Asia, where the US dollar is the main trading currency, will also be under competitive pressure.  That is not a good platform for us to be looking towards as we head into the last quarter of 2012 and into 2013 and emerge from a year that has been not particularly good for Irish exports on a relative scale.  In addition, the fact that the Bank of England has commenced quantitative easing once again will make our exports to the UK increasingly less competitive and, as a consequence, our cost base will look more expensive to an English buyer.</p><p>  Our main markets in the eurozone, which account for 37% of our exports, are dragging along; they are just coming out of recession and are now back into it again.  We seem to be facing a double dip scenario there and that makes it very difficult for our exporters to grow their exports.  It is a situation that needs positive stimulus by Government to help us to achieve a greater level of growth.   </p> <p>Many exporters are doing reasonably well but others are not doing as well as they could.  Due to the economic circumstances faced by many exporters in most European markets, they are nervous about investing and as a consequence they are not creating the jobs they potentially could create.  The jobs growth targets of the trade and investment strategy to 2015 are not being met.  The underlying export figures which lead to such growth in jobs are not what they need to be.  To have jobs growth we need to stimulate the export sector further.  We are all conscious the home market is difficult and it will continue to shed jobs.  In our submission today we have indicated a number of areas which need to be addressed which would assist exporting companies as well as those which would like to start exporting.  This would also assist companies doing a certain level of exporting and which could do more but need greater access to finance.  The committee must understand that companies already exporting to particular markets must be incentivised to enter other more distant and risky markets.  Otherwise they will take the safe option and who would blame them.  If the objective is to create more jobs through exports we must incentivise companies.  Issues with access to finance at present are not helping and we will delve further into this.</p><p> If the US and UK Governments reduce the cost base for their exporters and use a currency mechanism to help them to have stronger exports, then we must respond in some way, shape or form.  We have indicated a number of areas which need to be watched and addressed.  As we approach the budget we could hit the tipping point between increasing the cost base and keeping the export industry competitive.  We can steal a march by targeting fast-growing export markets, but these markets are more distant and new to exporters.  As a consequence there is higher risk and more working capital is required.  This brings us back to supporting mechanisms.  A  wide range of companies trade only on the home market.  With the proper incentives they could be introduced onto export markets.  This needs further addressing.</p><p> Committee members are familiar with the fact that our food and drink sector, particularly agrifood, is the largest of our indigenous export sectors, accounting for approximately &euro;8 billion.  In the first six months of this year it saw a downturn, having grown by 25% in the previous two years.  This is indicative of the factors I indicated to the committee.  Mr. Bernard Coyle heads our food and drink council and his company has been actively exporting for many years.  He will speak about some of the issues in the food and drink sector, in particular the cost of doing business.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-25a.82" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard Coyle" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012092500010#J00200"><p>Mr. Whelan has given committee members an overview and I will give the point of view of an indigenous company on the ground.  Mr. Whelan pointed out that for various reasons many good companies do not export.  It has been of concern for a number of years that from the artisan market up these companies do not progress and get involved in the export market.  Being pragmatic I believe many opportunities exist for Irish companies to export throughout Europe, particularly to our nearest neighbour across the water, but these are not being taken for a number of reasons.  Austerity is not only an Irish phenomenon and many companies in the UK are closing because of difficult trading conditions.  Many mergers are taking place and many larger companies are closing plants and reducing surplus in the marketplace because the prices of commodities are rising but they cannot secure price rises for their products from the multiples.</p><p>  I will go back to basics and ask what is happening in the marketplace and why we are so slow to get our indigenous companies to export.  Our focus on food companies is good, through Enterprise Ireland and Bord Bia which do a wonderful job, but we must strengthen this focus.  Much is happening in IT, ICT and farming and many opportunities to create employment exist; we are all conscious of employment.  A number of platforms are involved and it is about getting the artisan producers one finds in west Cork and at food markets to a level where they have the drive, motivation and initiative to reach a position where they are exporting.  It is not easy for them and we need to examine the supports available to them at present, for example, through enterprise boards.</p><p>  The food industry is and has been very regulated and this adds to the cost base.  People used to start by making soda bread, jams or chutneys at the back of their house, but now they must work in a food grade building.  One needs access to finance because of the cost of building.  One needs accreditation, in particular from the British Retail Consortium as it is demanded by all and sundry.  Problems also arise with middle management skills, which roll into the staff.  Mentors should be more relevant, such as people with a business background who were involved in exporting and who are recently retired or semi-retired whose contacts in the sector are still relevant.  They would still be able to open doors.  In many cases people move on so one needs those who are relevant.</p><p>  Increasing the number of employees to more than 15 requires access to finance and we are all aware of this.  The business expansion scheme is one of the best initiatives that has ever been brought to the table by government.  It has been a tremendous help and this needs to be stated.  Such companies will have accreditation and top-class food buildings but they need further finance to expand.  The availability of senior and middle management with relevant skills is still a problem.  We have a disjoint between our third level colleges and industry.  We continue to turn out people with skills which are not that relevant.  We are aware of the issues in IT and the issues experienced by PayPal with regard to languages.  Given that we have approximately 500,000 unemployed people, it is shocking that for the past two years food companies have been going abroad to recruit relevant people.  It is not uncommon for people to take a hotel room at Heathrow Airport and spend a couple of days recruiting development chefs, process technologists, food technologists, production managers and chill chain management.</p> <p> Technical quality is a major issue.  To make things worse, the UK is hitting a downward spiral.  It is seeking to recruit 137,000 people to join the food industry.  We must refocus on how and where we get people.  This has a bearing on our cost base, as Mr. Whelan alluded to, and salary levels at middle and senior management in the food industry are between 25% to 35% higher than our nearest neighbours.  We are all aware that finance and skills shortages are factors for the food industry.  </p><p> We are all aware that entrepreneurs take risks but when things go wrong there is no safety net.  I think they are afraid to put their neck on the block because they feel they are being unfairly targeted.  If their companies go pear shaped there is no safety net for them.  That stops some people from pushing on.  We need to adopt the American model.  When entrepreneurs fail within reason, they dust themselves off and start again, bearing in mind that creditors must be protected and so on.  Here, when an entrepreneur fails, he may be ostracised.</p><p> A number of issues need to be discussed, but we can come back to them and deal with them later.</p></speech>

It was agreed that one of the solutions to the issue of accessing additional working capital at a reasonable cost was the credit guarantee scheme.  This was discussed in both Houses.  It was raised in the D&aacute;il in June and the members of the Seanad voted on it on 4 July.  We were promised that funds would be released in July.  When that did not happen in July, we met the Taoiseach who said it would be released in September.  Now we are heading towards the end of September and yet this three year programme is not in place.  We met banking staff at very senior levels, right up to the chief executives.  The Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank and Allied Irish Banks were the three banking groups approved to run the scheme.  They have been expressing concerns about its operability.  The scheme should be at least pushed out.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation suggested that as an option the package could be reviewed after the first 12 months, if it is not working.  We have a concern that it will not deliver on the 1,300 jobs it is supposed to create and it will not assist the 1,600 small and medium sized enterprises that need extra working capital to expand.  We urge the committee to try to find the roadblocks to the proposal and deal with them so that the scheme becomes operational.  The sooner we test it, find the bugs and make the adjustments, the sooner it will be rolled out.  There are other issues with regard to bank bonds and we have issues with export credit insurance, but the low-hanging fruit immediately available to us is to have an operational credit guarantee scheme. </p><p>  I will now deal with the cost of doing business.  I am sure members are aware that the universal social charge has been a significant cost across the employment front.  It is paid on gross salary before one puts a penny into the pension fund.  We believe the level of income tax taken together with the universal social charge is now at the tipping point.  Any further increases are likely to have a damaging impact on trying to motivate the export industry to keep on driving.  The Department of Finance and the IMF indicate that &euro;3.5 billion needs to come out of the budget; however, we stress that direct income tax and the universal social charge should not be touched.  We believe to do so will immediately impact on our export industry.  We are very concerned on that front.</p><p>  The cost of doing business, including rates, rent and waste charges, are substantial.  We understand that these charges are necessary to fund local government but it is important that during recessionary times one does not increase these costs because it knocks another notch off the ability to get companies up and trading again.</p><p>  We also stress the issue of energy costs.  Oil prices are dipping up and down.  They have come down in the past week or two; however, that has not stopped Bord G&aacute;is from raising gas and electricity prices.  The rebate for companies that are major users of electricity, which is worked back to oil or gas prices, is scheduled to come off in the autumn.  In order to support a manufacturing industry that in the main exports its products, that rebate should be extended somewhat further.  Manufacturing industries create employment.  The food industry is part of the manufacturing industry.  Getting goods to the market is very important.  Transport as a percentage of the final costs of a product can be as much as 10% to 15% in the case of the food industry.  It tends to be in the region of between 3% and 5% for the pharmaceutical industry.  Other countries have brought in a special user rebate.  We have been putting this idea to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar and his team for the past 12 months.  We have also been putting this idea to the Department of Finance.  There are smart ways of applying it without losing income under the excise heading.  We stress that cost should be tackled.</p><p>  The Export Trade Council met last week.  I stressed to the Ministers the importance of making early announcements of the trade missions for next year.  In that way those in the export industry can start the planning process.  The Irish Exporters Association is happy to row in and roll out trade missions in countries that are not being covered by trade missions.  We completed a very successful trade mission to India three weeks ago as there was no official Government-led trade mission to India this year.  If we are serious about competing in these fast- growing emerging markets we need as many as possible ministerial trade missions.  The industry will move behind that.  </p><p>  My final key point refers to the export outreach programme.  We have indicated that about 14,000 to 15,000 companies who each employ 50-plus employees, employing a total of 447,000 people, are not exporting.  Mr. Coyle touched on some aspects of the ways to get these companies exporting.  Many will not survive on trading in the home market only.  These companies will not grow unless they get into the export markets.  Whereas Enterprise Ireland has a start-up programme for fresh food, it is touching on a very small base.  We need a wider initiative that involves many players in the various sectors, the export industry association being one to try to encourage these companies to start trading off the island.  That could create a whole wave of new exporters and create new jobs.  </p></speech>

Will they outline the concerns expressed by the banks and when was the last time the IEA engaged with either the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation or the Department of Finance on the scheme?</p><p>  Mr. Coyle referred to artisan producers and trying to encourage them to grow the business by getting into the export market.  He himself is an example of how that was done.</p> <p>I get a sense that in Ireland, food is regulated to death and that in so doing the artisan is regulated out of the market, whereas other countries to which we export and with which we are in competition seem less obsessed about gold-plated regulation and more obsessed about the quality of the food.  I seek the views of the witnesses on this.  As for the cost of doing business, I presume the Irish Exporters Association has the same views on the potential of changes in sick pay legislation as the other business organisations.</p><p> I am concerned that the association included ministerial trade missions as a warning point.  Has there been a fall-off in the number of ministerial trade missions since the trade function moved to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade?  Previously, there was always a Minister with responsibility for trade, who used to lead off that section.  Second, what countries were covered this year?  Finally, the overall presentation from both Mr. Whelan and Mr. Coyle suggests that within the Government system - and not simply the party political system - there appears to be a complacency about export markets.  There appears to be an attitude that it is all doing really well, exports are flying and large quantities of drugs are being exported from the country.  In short, one gets the story that exports are doing well.  However, I detect an overall sense from the witnesses that there is complacency within the entire system to the effect that it will be all right on the night.  Is such a perception wrong?</p></speech>

I have had the pleasure of visiting the Mr. Crumb site in Finea a number of times in the past.  It is a fascinating place and it is great to see such an industry located in such a relatively rural area, of which it is the backbone.  As for exports, I note the figures released in mid-September indicated 62% of all exports were in the chemical and pharmaceutical sector.  This is a massive area, probably mostly derived from the multinationals, and much of it has large capacity.  In other words, an increase in exports often does not lead to the addition of many extra jobs.  This is a significant issue for the Government to consider, as is the concept of the patents cliff with which that sector is faced.  Interestingly, the witnesses mentioned that 35% of exports go to eurozone countries and I have one question in this regard.  Some research was conducted in Germany to identify the value of the euro in the context of the euro being of a lower value than a potential Deutsche Mark.  It was worked out that it is worth &euro;50 billion to the German economy to be a member of the eurozone because of that differential.  Such a differential probably exists for Ireland but in the other direction.  Much of the recent increase in exports can be attributed to the decrease in the value of the euro.  Has work been done to ascertain the exact cost of the euro to Irish exports in that specific area?</p><p>  I am amazed that sometimes, especially in rural areas and for small food producers, there is not greater clarity between Leader partnerships and country enterprise boards.  I also am dismayed that as of yet, no fully State-wide export programme for small businesses of up to about ten people is in place through the county enterprise boards.  I note InterTradeIreland has done good work in providing resources for management in businesses with regard to exports to the North of Ireland.  Perhaps the county enterprise boards and Enterprise Ireland have much to learn from that sector.  I agree wholeheartedly with regard to redundancy rebate, possibly of sick pay etc., that costs potentially could be loaded upon this very important sector.  I am in favour of a progressive rates base in which the size and type of business is taken into consideration in the calculation of such rates.  Moreover, such a system would have some understanding of the profitability of a business with regard to rates and they would not be applied blindly in respect of a very profitable and a less profitable business.  These are the major issues that affect people.</p><p>  Another point concerns the extremely low element of exports to the BRIC countries, <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> our traditional markets.  While I acknowledge the IDA is for inward investment, in Australia, for example, I understand one IDA representative works part-time to cover all of Australia.  It is easier for us to export to Anglophone countries like Britain and the United States in which we have a diaspora.  It is very difficult for Irish companies to get into countries such as India or China.  The level of education and training must be improved in order that companies can approach this task with a level of confidence.  As for credit, it is shocking that the microfinance credit facility and the credit guarantee scheme are still not in place.  Opportunities and jobs are lost for every month that goes by with a lack of such measures being put in place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-25a.93" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1114" speakername="Deirdre Clune" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012092500012#L00400"><p>I thank both witnesses for their presentation.  On the credit guarantee scheme, the joint committee might take this issue up directly with the Department to ascertain its present status and what are the obstacles.  That is probably the best thing members can do at present.  I would be interested to hear Mr. Whelan's response to the comments of the banks.</p><p>  Members are aware of the importance of the food sector.  Mr. Coyle spoke about artisan food products and how to bring them to the level of being part of a strong export sector.  At present, Bord Bia does a great job in promoting abroad at food fairs and so on.  Where is the supermarket shelf space for all these products?  I am interested in supermarkets in particular, as previous Oireachtas committees have considered groups such as Tesco, Dunnes Stores, Aldi, Lidl and the Musgrave Group.  It is very difficult for a small producer to get shelf space in supermarkets, which is where most consumers shop.  While some people use the local food markets, delicatessens and so on, it is vital to get supermarket space for such exports.  Mr. Coyle might provide members with an insight into any experience or information he may have in this regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-25a.94" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard Coyle" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012092500012#L00500"><p>I will do my best.  It is not easy.  Fundamentally, there always will be a certain segment of people who wish to produce for the local farmers' market but not for the shop, or for the local shop but not for the supermarket, or for the supermarket but not for the multiple chain of stores or whatever.  Perhaps a case could be made that the agencies should try to segregate who from that group - be it 100, 1,000 or 10,000 people - is actually interested in going at the outset from stage 1 to stage 3, or from platform 1 to platform 3 in order that the agencies could nurture those people who wish to make that break for whatever reason.  Such people might have an ambition to make it a family business, a national business or an international business as opposed to those who will simply be content to go to the farmers' markets three days a week with what they or their family are able to produce to sell what they can.</p><p>  Another angle is that people need to be guided.  Traditionally, artisan food markets arose from the idea that people would make what they were good at.  Consequently one person might make soda bread, another might make chutneys, someone else might make jams and so on and off everyone goes.  However, if people want to reach the next level, they must stop and think about it at an early stage.  They must ask whether they are making something for which there is a gap in the market.  This reverts to Senator Clune's point on where are the gaps on supermarket shelves.  Unless one is going to make the most wonderful soda bread ever produced, there is no point.  While most people think they do, unfortunately many people make many wonderful products.  Consequently, at some stage people need to stop and think whether this will be a growth business that will become a national or an international company and whether there is a gap for the product in the market.  The agencies need to work with such people at that stage to tell them that while they make a wonderful product, it will never be any bigger than the local market, local shop or whatever.</p> <p> An element of segregation is required, which ties into research and development.  The multiples will tend to work with those with a good research and development facility or background in place.  It is cost neutral to them.  They want people coming to them and pointing out how they could supply an item better, more cheaply or with a longer life.  The biggest trap into which people fall is to approach the multiples with "me-too" products in which they are not interested.</p><p> Senator White will have come across this.  If we were to ask Bord Bia, Enterprise Ireland or the enterprise boards how many food companies were building plants, we would get a long pregnant pause and people would need to think about it.  Leaving out the bigger companies such as Glanbia and Kerry, there seems to be a major gap between the artisan producer and the medium-sized company with more than 50 employees which have the buildings, accreditation and management to enable them to move on to the export level.</p><p> Deputy Calleary stated earlier that food production seems to have almost gone to a pharmaceutical style.  The quality of buildings and the amount of accreditations required for food producers is at a pharmaceutical level and in some cases even greater.  They are required to have a number of audits in addition to the BRC, which is the accreditation sought even in France.  A considerable expense and management time is consumed on that.  Senator Clune asked how we could get artisan producers from employing two to five people up to 20 or 30 and onto 50, which represents the launch platform for export markets.  All the bodies need to review it and see what can be done.  By all means we should help everybody, but different help is required by different sections.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-25a.96" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Whelan" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012092500013#M00200"><p>I will deal with Deputy Calleary's comments first.  We have reservations about the credit guarantee scheme.  The 2% up-front fee to set it up effectively means that the cost of a loan to a regular business has increased by 40% before going anywhere else.  As the State takes 75% of the risk we had hoped the State in putting out the scheme would instruct the banks to charge 2% - or even 3% - below their normal rate.  At the moment an overdraft facility can cost anywhere between 7% and 9% so there is room for manoeuvre.  If the banks reduced it, it might become cost neutral or the same as would apply to a normal loan.  That is one of the reservations.  If it will cost more, it will not have the desired effect and will not stimulate companies to seek newer markets into which to expand and as a consequence will not create the jobs.  There is also a provision requiring that no more than 10% of the total loan portfolio the banks give to any company can be in this particular credit guarantee piece, which will make it very difficult to administer.  Our concern is that it will not be taken up and as a consequence will not create the jobs.</p></speech>

What were those concerns?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-25a.98" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Whelan" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012092500013#M00400"><p>They are concerned that the requirement with regard to 10% of the portfolio makes it very difficult for them to manage.  Based on the extent of dealings a client has with a bank, it is restricted to offering this 10%.  Bearing in mind that it is geared to help 1,600 companies with &euro;150 million each year for three years, it should go out in tranches of &euro;250,000 to each company.  However, having a maximum of 10% of the loan portfolio in it makes it very difficult for the banks to administer in a meaningful way, which is their biggest concern.</p><p>  At least if we get it out, we can prove to the Government that it is not working.  It has agreed to review it after year one.  The longer the delay, the further we are away from that.  We would be fairly confident it will not achieve what is expected of it without further adjustments, but it needs to be made operational.</p><p>  Deputy Calleary also asked whether there had been a drop-off in the number of trade missions since the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade took over responsibility for trade.  It was a very positive move which is working extremely well and has re-energised the embassies abroad.  We feel we do not have enough people in the embassies and would like to see more.  We made a submission to Government on a trade strategy for Africa.  At the moment 1% of our trade comes from Africa but 17% of our embassy structure is there.  Africa is also growing very rapidly and there is great potential.  We need to ensure that every embassy takes at least one member of staff on board with a trade brief.  While we have done great work there on the aid front, most of the other countries which are competing with us have come to the conclusion that Africa is moving rapidly and they are moving in on the trade front.  We need to do likewise and utilise the strength of our embassies to help us to do that.  On food and drink, the food side is doing particularly well there.  However, there are opportunities for considerably more food companies there.  Glanbia is expanding very well as is the Irish Dairy Board, but a number of other food companies could go in under the banners and become involved.</p><p>  On the trade mission front, those involved have upped their game considerably and have been getting out.  Our concern is that other countries are also getting out.  We need to benchmark ourselves against, for instance, how often UK Ministers are getting abroad.  We see them out often more frequently in various markets and it requires a continued push.  With the EU Presidency in the first six months of next year, we are getting signals that the number of trade missions will need to  be reduced as a consequence.  We make the point that Ministers get an extra halo when travelling abroad during the time when they have the EU wrap around them.  I hope they will buy into that.</p><p>  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n spoke about Leader, the county enterprise boards, EI and the jobs strategy.  There was a wide-ranging announcement under the jobs strategy 2012 with more than 100 different initiatives.  While most of them were pretty good, many of them need to be acted on because we are being asked for job strategies for 2013.  At the moment our position is that we should implement those in the 2012 strategy and we could do a considerable amount with them.  For example, the creation of a 400 ha salmon farm off the Aran Islands was announced.  Our salmon exports generally have dipped over the past decade - we now export approximately 10,000 tonnes of salmon.  That one salmon farm on the Aran Islands would create 400 jobs approximately, producing 10,000 tonnes and doubling our exports of salmon.  We need to benchmark ourselves.  Last year Scotland exported some 200,000 tonnes of smoked salmon.  The Scandinavian countries export approximately 1 billion tonnes of salmon.  If one ramps up the numbers, with the creation of 400 jobs for each 10,000 tonnes of smoked salmon, the opportunities in the sector are enormous.  We need to build on some of the strategies that were announced and push them as hard as possible.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney advised us that they are waiting for a foreshore licence and planning permission.  He is pushing this hard but, as in the case of the credit guarantee scheme, it is taking far too long to get it started.  If that salmon farm is tested and it is found to work, many more will follow. </p> <p>Our strategy must be to take the jobs strategy and put as much effort as we possibly can behind it.  In that regard it needs the members and their colleagues to push hard to try to get them delivered on.  </p><p> In response to Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, we have had severe difficulties with the announcement of the restructuring plan for the county enterprise boards restructuring plan, the body charged with supporting companies that employ fewer than ten people.  The CEBs are in a no-man's land as they are scheduled to be closed down and subsumed into the county council structures.  Many of the CEBs no longer have a chief executive, as they left under various schemes and nobody replaced them.  The CEBs did good work for many years and could continue to do so for companies that employ fewer than ten people.  We do not understand the reason for the restructuring.  The boards acted as a springboard for exporters at the early stage who could then be handed on to Enterprise Ireland or Board Bia.  That needs to be speedily addressed.</p><p> The Leader programme tends to operate separately and is very good at community level.  I have seen it work very well at a number of levels in the community.  It tends to be a much more community orientated programme. </p><p> The currency was mentioned, drawing a comparison between the value of the euro and the deutsche mark.  We have been doing reasonably well from our exports.  The German economy has been exporting at twice our levels by and large.  They are gaining even more than we have gained.  For them the euro and eurozone operates very well.  Should Ireland pull out of our link to the euro, the question then arises as to whether to link to sterling or the US dollar.  We could not float as the punt again as that would be unsustainable in the current bond market.  The eurozone is a better place for the average exporter than to be linked to sterling or the US dollar.  We regularly survey exporters and 90% would prefer to stay in the eurozone.</p></speech>

By its nature food requires a great deal of regulation.  I know some have raised the issue of over-regulation but by the nature of the product this should be expected.  The levels of regulation do not seem to be inhibiting Irish food in the export market because it is very successful.  Other categories of commercial activity are not exporting or are underperforming.  Are there particular skills that other companies could learn from the success of Irish food?  Is it a matter of exporting techniques or getting out into the world and being more proactive?  Irish food must have some X factor which other companies could learn from.  </p><p>  I read an article in <i>The Irish Times </i>last year which drew attention to the fact there were entire regions in France where Irish goods and services had no penetration at all.  That came as a shock to me.  The article was raising this as an important issue for export strategy .  What is the rationale of opening up the ground work for our exports? </p></speech>

The association has retained its iconic members.  That speaks for itself.  I attend the annual dinner of the IEA and I am over-awed by the members of the association.</p><p>  I empathise with every word of Mr. Coyle's contribution.  I could talk for a week on this topic but I will limit my contribution to two points.  First, Mr. Whelan wrote a letter on the outreach export programme in which he states that many mid-sized companies have difficulties in growing their business internationally and find themselves outside the State's support agency system for exports.  The IEA estimates that 14,700 companies employ approximately 500,000 people.  Enterprise Ireland has 1,700 of these companies as client companies, which leaves a large group of business with potential to become successful exporters and with the ability to create jobs.</p><p>  Our Chairman has kindly agreed to invite Enterprise Ireland to appear before the joint committee as soon as possible.  A new scheme was launched in March of this year by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, setting up a new department in Enterprise Ireland that will help 1,800 companies to export their products.  We will then be able to see how that programme is developing.  It is very timely to meet the delegations from the Drinks Industry Group of Ireland and the Irish Exporters Association because the prime issue today is jobs.  We have 309,000 people unemployed of whom 60% are in long-term unemployment.  They have been continuously unemployed for more than a year.  The only issue that matters is jobs.  </p><p>  I co-founded a business in the 1980 motivated by the need to tackle the severe unemployment at that time.  Mr Coyle is probably a bit like myself.

We used to question ourselves as to whether we were mad.  It requires a person to work 24/7.  Ms Connie Doody and I worked 24/7 for 16 years, including Christmas Day and New Year's Day.  We worked on Saturdays and Sundays because that was what the business required.  People used to ask me how I could get the product on the shelves in the supermarkets.  They would complain about the supermarket.  If they are complaining they might as well stay at home as they are not up to coping with the heat in the kitchen.  When one has a business it is not just a case of doing a job from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; it requires an extraordinary commitment, particularly if one is starting from nothing.</p> <p>We must remember that the Kerry Group started off as a very small company.  In the case of Baileys, Mr. David Dand carried the bottles of Baileys around Europe trying to sell the liqueur.  There are major opportunities.</p><p> My greatest disappointment is the Government's handling of the county enterprise boards.  On Friday last, the Chairman, Deputy Damien English, and I attended a very successful cross-Border meeting in Monaghan.  It was fantastic to see the co-operation between the enterprise boards in the South and the boards across the Border.  The Government has let this drift.  Ideally the county enterprise boards should come under Enterprise Ireland and not be devolved to the local authorities.  I understand that Enterprise Ireland will adopt a regional mentality that it will help the small companies in the regions.  The county enterprise boards have a significant contribution to make to help people to start up a business.  There is no question about that.  That is something that must be delivered.  It is not happening.  </p><p> I am sure Senator Clune has heard me complaining relentlessly about the lack of available credit to companies.  The Chairman has agreed that we invite Enterprise Ireland to respond to the request to get more companies exporting.  The bottom line is that every job created in production creates 2.5 jobs downstream.  A service job only creates 1.7 extra jobs.  We have significant opportunities.  </p><p> I compliment Mr. Coyle on what he has achieved.  He is fantastic.  We will do everything we can to help the Irish Exporters Association.</p></speech>

Our food industry has tended to export most of its product to the UK.  They have had difficulties going across mainland Europe and into Asia.  Targets have been set under the trade and investment strategy, Towards 2015.  Bord Bia has been moving well in meeting them.  We are getting more companies into mainland Europe.  We are getting good traction in terms of our food exports into China.  The exports are coming from a low base and it will be a slow process.  My colleague, Mr. Coyle, may wish to comment further on that.</p><p>  With regard to the X factor, we have been having some strong success from indigenous service companies in the past few years.  Our software services companies have been doing extremely well and the cross-over between services and manufacturing, particularly in clean tech-green tech which has been very successful.  We have seen growth levels of 20% from a wide range of these companies. </p><p>  These are small companies at the early stages that will need more financing, as we have indicated earlier, and they will need to have the doors opened for them through trade missions and so on, if they are to grow further.  They need a more stable eurozone.  When people get a bit more confidence, they will be happy to spend money.  At the moment nobody is happy to spend money.  That is holding us back.  There has been some very good growth.</p><p>  The food industry will have the X factor for the next decade.  World demand is just rocketing.  The second X factor on the export front will be clean tech-green tech, with the services overlapping.  </p></speech>

Needless to say I also admire all the great things Senator White achieved.  It does take hard work.  This brings us to the point that when Enterprise Ireland comes before the committee, I think there is a case for segregating companies, yet not disenfranchising any of them.  If one goes to the races and there are ten horses on the card, one must make a choice on who one chooses.  It is horses for courses.  There is room for the artisan food companies and there is room for the mid-tier companies but, as Senator White said, it is the people who will commit to work 24/7 for 365 days of the year.  Not everybody will have that level of motivation.  That is fine.  We are all told of the need for work-life balance, but the bodies should go out of their way to segregate those who have that level of motivation and drive to put that level of effort in.  That will help to pick winners that will get to platform 2 or platform 3 quickly.</p><p>  The UK is our nearest market but the market in France is starting to open up.  Let me give a quick example.  We are launching a new brand on the Continent this year but in January we set a minimum floor of &euro;250,000 to put behind it.  We have already exceeded that amount of money.  We are getting very good feedback but we will not get paid back until next year.  When we talk about artisan food companies getting ready to get on the export train, there must be some segregation because not everybody will be in the starting position.  </p><p>  Senator T&oacute;ib&iacute;n mentioned sick pay.  Sick pay is a significant cost for Government and it must be treated very delicately.  Again, if one is producing a product and people are out sick, as the producer one must replace them.  One will then have to pay the person that is sick as well as paying the person who is doing the job.  </p><p>  I know the Government has been considering the diesel rebate for some time.  It is beginning to affect our comrades in the haulage industry.  Hauliers are dropping like flies.  Agricultural contractors also experiencing the hit.  As an island nation we need a vibrant transport industry.  The number of haulage companies that are going under is shocking.  It also raised the allied issue of green diesel.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland is doing a very good job in difficult circumstances.  Bord Bia is doing extremely well, but it is time to start segregating companies and picking winners and putting the emphasis on them, whether it be cash or expertise.  Mentoring is fine but one needs people with the relevant experience, with all due respect to consultants.  One needs a person who has been there and done that.</p></speech>

I am concerned about it.  Is it still an issue for the IEA?</p></speech>

It works for Ireland and England.  If one tries to get invoice discounting with the banks from outside Ireland and England, they seek evidence of having export credit insurance in place.  This is where export credit insurance comes up again as an issue.  We have seen an increase in the number of companies that take out export credit insurance mainly because they have been forced to take it out by their buyers.  The export credit insurance is supporting the other bank funding instruments.  That is the reason it has raised its head once again and is necessary.  We have pointed out year in and year out that most of the governments in OECD countries support their exporters by having an export credit guarantee scheme in place.  The Americans do it extensively as well.</p></speech>

There is feedback from a number of companies in the enterprise sector.  Although we will not go into it in detail, it is allied to the issue of cash for gold and the robberies taking place around the country.  People are flagging that companies and industrial premises are being targeted in the same way as private houses were being targeted for jewellery.  The idea is to rob the stainless steel, copper, aluminium and so forth.  This will have a huge effect on industry if it becomes widespread.  Northern Ireland and the UK are dealing with these issues.  If one goes to a smelter's, one must have photographic identification, one's number plate is noted and one is paid by cheque.  We are a little concerned that the Government has not moved on any of those issues.  The pilferage, for want of a better term, is still widespread but is now moving up a gear and affecting factories and companies.  There is a downside to that.  Many companies, by their nature and following encouragement down the years, including the fact that entrepreneurs have wanted to bring companies to their native areas, can be in isolated locations.  If the owners arrive on a Monday morning and find that someone has been in the premises with saws and sawed up the stainless steel or other material, production will stop.  The issue is only now becoming quite apparent.</p></speech>

I welcome from the Irish Insurance Federation Mr. Michael Kemp, chief executive, and Mr. Michael Horan, non-life insurance manager.  I thank the witnesses for their attendance and for the federation's prompt response to our invitation earlier this year.</p><p>  I draw the attention of the witnesses to the formalities as they operate under Standing Orders of the House.  I draw their attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also wish to advise you that the opening statements you have submitted to the committee will be published on the committee's website after this meeting.</p><p>  Before commencing the presentation, I wish to say a few words.  Flooding is now a regular feature of Irish weather conditions and it costs a lot of money to repair the damage it causes.  The floods of earlier this year cost &euro;54 million in damage and sizeable costs were also incurred during the several major floods that have occurred since 2000.  They cycle of floods will show that regardless of whether it is for households or for businesses, the immediate shock of having one's property or business flooded comes with its own difficulties.  This is followed by the clear-up and the other processes, the final stage of which concerns the question of whether one can get insurance again into the future and the associated difficulties and concerns.  This is one of the main points of focus of the joint committee's deliberations this afternoon.  In so doing, I note we cannot facilitate a situation to develop in which large numbers of households nationwide are deemed to be uninsurable or outside the protection of the normal insurance schemes that are available.  I am familiar with the argument that insurance companies insure against risks but not against certainties and I do not think we will reiterate that argument this afternoon.</p> <p>It does seem insurance companies are geotyping parts of the country in a blanket approach.  Accordingly, a house deemed to be in a flood-risk or subsidence-risk area will not get cover.  For example, it is impossible to get flood insurance for a dwelling within 100 m of a river even if it is an apartment 100 ft. off the ground.</p><p> In the past everyone could get full comprehensive car insurance.  It is now being reported anecdotally that most policies are being stripped back to third party and fire and theft in some areas of the country because of the zoning approach applied by the insurance companies.  If this is the case, this is a major change in direction of insurance policy strategy.  The recent European report which examined flood risks remarked favourably on the model of practice used by the industry until now, which was to cover a broad range of insurance for non-specifics.</p><p> Another issue I wish the federation to address this afternoon is that, because regions are geozoned as being at particular risk of either flooding or other events, even if remediation works are carried out to reduce that risk, it is impossible to have this zoning removed.  Parts of the country deemed flood risks 15 years ago have had major relief works carried out to prevent further problems.  However, they are still zoned as being a flood risk.  Then there are floods caused by engineering problems rather than a natural disaster, which happened this year.</p><p> I note the federation stated in its written submission that no more than 2% of policies exclude flood cover.  However, 2% represents a sizeable number of people who must live with this uncertainty.  There is a question of fairness about this, as well as the broader systemic consequences such as difficulties in selling on the properties.  Except in the case of a cash purchase, an engineer operating for a mortgage bank will not allow the sale of such a property to proceed.  We could actually have whole hosts of properties that are unsellable because of an insurance classification that may not stand up to scrutiny.</p><p> The Government has spent large amounts of money rectifying the circumstances that allowed flooding to occur in the first place.  Why can the insurance companies not provide cover for houses in the areas where these remedial works have been carried out and flood prevention measures have been implemented?  Why are such measures not considered when determining house insurance premiums?</p><p> I invite the federation to make its opening statement.</p></speech>

There were 627 household claims costing &euro;15 million, 487 commercial property claims costing &euro;38 million and 146 motor claims costing &euro;1 million.  There have been seven other significant flood events since 2000.  The cumulative cost of these eight flood events was &euro;697 million.  At the time, the November 2009 floods represented the single largest insured loss ever in terms of overall cost, at &euro;244 million.  However, the new record did not last long as it was closely followed by the December 2009-January 2010 freeze, which cost &euro;297 million.  A further freeze in December 2010 cost &euro;224 million.</p><p>  Whatever side one is on in the climate change debate, there is no disputing the fact that in the past decade insurers have seen more frequent and costlier weather-related losses, not just in Ireland but globally.  To have the largest weather-related losses in such close succession has put significant pressure on the property insurance market.  However, insurers have repeatedly displayed their resilience and as a result injected over &euro;1.2 billion back into the economy following these weather events.</p><p>  In general, we believe insurers have coped extremely well with these weather events, with rapid responses to claims notified by policyholders, quick inspection of damage and approval of remedial work.  Insurers&rsquo; responses have included 24-hour telephone helplines, subsidising alternative accommodation and the provision of emergency funds.  When a property is badly damaged by flooding, it is necessary to dry, clean, repair and restore it.  This may take some months due to the time it takes for properties to dry out after being flooded.  It is insurers&rsquo; experience that in the boom years homeowners invested heavily in upgrading the fit-out of their homes, installing high-quality kitchens, wooden floors and electronic equipment, which has resulted in a large increase in the cost of flood claims.</p><p>  A feature of recent flood events was that local businesses and residents were given little or no warning.  That is a serious shortcoming in flood-prone areas, which needs to be addressed urgently through the development of better early warning systems when there is an imminent risk of flood.  The recent floods also highlighted the fact that too many agencies are involved in flood risk management.  They comprise the Office of Public Works, OPW, 34 local authorities supervising watercourses and drains, Waterways Ireland, the ESB - which owns 13 of 15 large dams - various Departments, amenity groups, recreational clubs and environmental and wildlife interests.  The number of agencies involved can lead to confusion and inaction in managing flood risk.</p><p>  Flood insurance receives considerable media attention but availability of flood cover is not a problem for the majority of householders.  The insurance market offers flood cover as a standard feature of household policies and the IIF estimates no more than 2% of policies have flood cover excluded.  The flood cover penetration rate is very high by international standards.  Penetration rates in many markets abroad are as low as 25%.  When assessing risks, insurance companies analyse the history of the property and any flood prevention measures implemented by the OPW or local authority in an area.  Some people will pay a higher premium because the flood risk is higher, while others have a higher flood excess on the policy.  Exclusion of cover is generally a last resort and usually only arises where a property has suffered previous flood damage and it is overwhelmingly likely that future flood loss will occur.  Insurance offers protection against a risk but not a certainty.  It is not tenable to ask policyholders in general to absorb the cost of inevitable losses.</p><p>  There are 12 insurers with offices in Ireland offering household insurance, with others without an Irish office also offering insurance under Single Market rules.  There is no shortage of suppliers and the market is very competitive.  As things stand, policyholders in low-risk areas already subsidise high-risk areas.  In the absence of this approach, flood insurance would become unaffordable in some parts of the country where flood insurance is still available but flood risk is above average.</p><p>  Insurance companies operate in a global market and spread their risks around the world using numerous specialist reinsurance companies.  It is therefore vital that the insurance industry acts with prudence on flooding risks to ensure that affordable reinsurance cover is maintained.</p> <p> The OPW is the lead agency for the Government's flood risk management programme.  The IIF welcomes the recent engagement of Deputy Brian Hayes with the insurance industry in his capacity as Minister of State with special responsibility for the OPW.  Insurers are major stakeholders in mitigating the economic effects of flooding.  However, minimising the financial impact of the cost of floods to property owners is critical to the sustainable provision of insurance.</p><p> The IIF has had constructive discussions with the OPW over the past year.  We appreciate the constraints within which the OPW is operating.  However, even within these constraints, we believe there is much that can be achieved.  Our efforts are aimed at improving the management of flood risk in Ireland, with particular reference to the construction of flood defences.  It is also important that the OPW communicates reliable information on flood defences to insurers in a format that is easily accessible so that underwriters can satisfy themselves that flood defences comply with acceptable and measurable standards when assessing risks.  In practical terms, insurers need to have confidence in the OPW's review of standards and commitment to the maintenance of flood defences once completed, as well as the items listed in my presentation.  The OPW has begun to develop some sample data, which it has forwarded to us.  We are now considering it with our members.</p><p> At a more general level, the IIF advocates the various items listed under point 13 of my presentation document, the more significant of which include the following: more investment in structural and non-structural measures so that the OPW can fulfil its brief as the lead agency for flood risk management; the establishment by the OPW of a national flood liaison and advice group comprising all stakeholders, including the insurance industry, to advise on planning strategies, flood risk management, etc.; more transparency on capital projects - that is, a clear, publicly available flood relief capital works programme specifying priorities, budgets, targets and timelines; and swifter completion of structural defences.</p><p> The Government's response to flood risk management in recent times dates back to 2002 with the establishment of the flood policy review group.  In 2001, the OPW was given the responsibility of being the lead agency for flood risk management.  The review group identified a work programme involving approximately 24 projects with an estimated cost of &euro;444 million, to be delivered over ten to 15 years.  In the seven years after the OPW was given responsibility for flood risk management - that is, up to 2011 - it was allocated a capital budget of &euro;257 million, but has spent only &euro;188 million.</p><p> The OPW's project implementation process has six stages, which are listed in the document provided.  It can take more than ten years for a project to go through this process.  In 2008, the OPW commissioned Goodbody Economic Consultants to undertake a value-for-money and policy review.  The consultants' report stated that the OPW&rsquo;s implementation programme had not met its targets for a number of reasons, including manpower deficiencies, the diversion of OPW resources to deliver unforeseen projects and the relatively lengthy design and planning process for projects.  Given the current state of the public finances and the embargo on recruitment, we are concerned that these shortcomings may not be addressed and may even get worse in the future.</p><p> In 2008, the then Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government published draft planning guidelines and invited submissions from interested parties.  We made a submission in November 2008 in which we highlighted that the guidelines were largely a copy of the UK guidelines which had failed to discourage development in flood-prone areas.  We suggested that the Scottish planning guidelines offered a more sustainable model and called for the establishment of a flood liaison and advice group with representation from all interested stakeholders, including insurers.  The deficiencies we identified in the guidelines are listed in my presentation document.</p><p> The insurance industry wishes to preserve the widespread availability and affordability of flood insurance as far as possible.  High penetration levels generally are necessary if the current model is to survive, with low-risk areas subsidising higher-risk areas.  The continued availability of flood reinsurance is vital as it allows insurers to provide cover for catastrophic risks by spreading costs over time.  Government investment in structural defences is needed to preserve flood insurance in high-risk areas.  Government action is also needed on non-structural measures such as addressing deficiencies in the planning guidelines.  We appreciate the increased engagement on the part of the Minister of State and the OPW but current levels of investment in and implementation of flood defences also need to improve.  I would be happy to elaborate on any aspect of this presentation on which members have questions.</p></speech>

Considering the year we have had and as we face into the winter again, it is worthwhile and opportune.</p><p>  Mr. Horan mentioned during his presentation that the industry had invested in the region of &euro;1.2 billion back into the economy.  Can he identify exactly where that might have been?  Has any of it gone into the area of flood relief, or does he feel that such investment is solely the remit of the Government and local authorities?</p><p>  He mentioned that 2% of the population is uninsured.  How does that figure compare to other years?  Has the IIF measured progress in this regard?  Have the improvement works carried out by successive Governments at various locations throughout the country, such as in Clonmel, Newcastle West and Athlone, been reflected in the IIF's records and figures?  Has the IIF seen a downward trend in the number of units that remain without insurance?</p><p>  The bigger question is my first one.  The IIF claims the sector has invested in the economy.  Where has that investment taken place, and has any of it been directed towards the provision of flood relief at flood-prone locations where major investment is required?  If the sector has not invested directly in flood relief, does the IIF feel an onus of responsibility in this area?  Can Mr. Horan see a role, from an investment and an expertise perspective, in moving forward in that area?</p></speech>

That is what I referred to when I spoke of the &euro;1.2 billion.</p><p>  We wish to preserve insurance availability and affordability in Ireland as far as it is possible to do so.  The way the equation works is that the Government, through the lead agency, the OPW, manages flood risk, puts in the structural defences where necessary and carries out non-structural measures such as clearing watercourses and drains where necessary, and that enables the insurance industry to provide cover against the risk of flooding.</p><p>  Overall, compared to other countries, the penetration rate for flood cover in Ireland is high, at 98%.  If one looks at other countries, the penetration rate can be as low as 25%.  Overall, the market works efficiently, certainly compared to other countries.  Ten years ago, when there was flooding in various parts of Dublin - for example, in 2000 and 2002 - remedial measures were taken in some of those areas.  Some areas of Dublin where there were problems relating to flood insurance availability ten years ago no longer have those problems.</p></speech>

My question relates to whether Mr. Horan sees a role for the insurance federation in future preventative measures.  Is that role based on the expertise within the sector or is it a monetary contribution?  Can the IIF lock horns with the relevant Department with a view to having a key role in preventative measures in the future?</p></speech>

Sometimes there was a failure to consult in advance or to ensure that the measures taken were adequate from the point of view of risk assessment, which is the role of underwriters.  One of the positive developments over the past couple of years is that there has been much more engagement on a bilateral basis with the OPW.  We acknowledge that the flow of information is much improved and we are much more involved in the process.  We would like to get to a stage, as we mentioned in the presentation, at which there is a standing liaison group, with others, not only us, involved.</p> <p>The expertise that is available within the industry could be utilised in planning and executing flood defence works and in identifying problem areas.  Over the past several years we have supplied information to the OPW to ascertain whether it can match its priority areas with locations where insurers have made significant pay outs on claims.  That is how we see our role in these matters, apart from the indemnification of policy holders who have cover in the first place. </p></speech>

The OPW does not have the final say over what happens in many water courses because other bodies, such as the National Parks and Wildlife Service, are responsible for them.  This creates significant problems.  Has the federation highlighted the issue to the Minister?  Deputies have raised the issue because it is problematic that the National Parks and Wildlife Service can exercise a veto on whether a sluice gate should remain open.</p><p>  In regard to works carried out by local authorities, in one case the local authority was required to carry out surveys costing up to &euro;10,000 in order to progress a project worth &euro;4,000.  Even in these competitive times, &euro;4,000 covers a small amount of work.  It would amount to a JCB being on a site for several hours.  This is an example of how ridiculous matters have become.</p><p>  I come from an environmental background but the National Parks and Wildlife Service is taking its responsibilities to an extreme, which results in properties being flooded or left under threat of flood because works cannot be carried out in certain areas.  I know of one area in which the staff of the local authority concerned are keen to proceed with the work and deal with the consequences afterwards.  They are prepared to take the rap from the National Parks and Wildlife Service, which seems to have the same powers as the Taliban used to possess.</p><p>  Is the federation aware of these restrictions?  They are impeding progress and had they been in place when the old Board of Works existed, half the country would still be under flood water.  A balance must be found between protecting humans and their property and securing habitats for birds and wildlife.  In some cases the prohibition on works has itself done environmental damage, such as wiping out the corncrake on the banks of the Shannon.</p><p>  Which body does the federation regard as the most suitable for exercising overall responsibility in conjunction with local authorities?  I agree that the buck has to stop somewhere.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-25a.141" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Horan" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2012092500006#J00300"><p>The OPW is the lead agency and it was given that role in 2004.  As the Deputy rightly noted, wildlife interests and various other interest groups are also involved in flood risk management.  This can lead to confusion and inaction.  We advocate that the OPW, as lead agency, should adopt a co-ordinated action plan with priorities for all agencies.  The OPW should be dictating to the other parties involved in the process.  At present, everybody appears to have an equal say in what happens and, therefore, it takes a long time for decisions to be made on flood remediation measures.  During that delay, residents have to live with the stress of possible flooding and insurers have to deal with a high risk of flood events in undefended areas.</p><p>  In regard to which body is most suitable, the flood policy review group sat for two years from 2002 to analyse the issue and it decided that the OPW should be the lead agency.  We are happy with the OPW acting as lead agency provided it is given the tools to do the job.  It currently has manpower deficiencies and in most years it underspends its budget.  It also has to deal with the various other agencies involved in flood risk management.</p></speech>

Local authorities and the OPW are paralysed and cannot act because of ridiculous restrictions placed on them by bodies such as the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  Does the federation have any information on how this relationship operates in other countries?</p></speech>

In many cases it requires between six and ten years to get from design stage to execution.  We would like to see that speeded up.  One way of achieving this objective is to bring together all interests in a body subject to a certain degree of control in respect of the time it takes to discuss the issues arising and reach a conclusion.</p></speech>

Many of these claims were initiated by burst pipes, which occurred across the country, rather than specific flood events which tend to occur over 30 year intervals.  It is unusual to experience two very bad winters consecutively.  We probably experienced two winters in one year because there was snow in January and December of the same year.</p><p>  We all use our own areas as examples.  I am based in Kildare North, where several flood events have occurred.  Some of these events were so traumatic that I can recall the dates on which they occurred.  The experience of co-operation between the OPW and the local authority has been quite positive in terms of responding and developing flood defences much more rapidly than the witnesses suggest.  A significant amount of public money has been spent on good flood defence systems that have held up against subsequent 50 year or 100 year flood events.  However, those who suffered damage in earlier flood events are unable to get insurance or else have to pay increased premiums on their policies.</p> <p>There was no certification available for people to expunge that record in areas where it had been properly tested and where there was public investment.  I believe that certification process is deficient.  Has the insurance industry engaged with the OPW on the return on investment from that point of view?</p><p> The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has advised that there are 1.8 million households in the country and the 2011 census indicated there are 1.995 million.</p></speech>

Mr. Horan indicated that 2% of people are not getting flood insurance.  Some people may not even be looking for insurance because they will not pay for insurance that will not cover flood where that has been the biggest exposure for them.  It may well be that they are so heavily loaded that they do not seek that.  Does the 2% reflect the real situation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-25a.148" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Horan" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2012092500007#K00400"><p>The Deputy suggested that we do not differentiate between the numbers.  All the numbers in the list - the eight incidents - are all flood events since 2000.  We mention the two freezes in the following paragraph simply because they were such extraordinarily large weather events that a property insurer could not ignore them.  As the Deputy has said, these are the major flood losses over that period.  Localised flooding happens everywhere on an ongoing basis, but we are just isolating the extreme flood events - very large weather losses.</p><p>  I believe the 98% figure is a reasonably accurate reflection of the situation on the ground.  The Irish Insurance Federation operates an insurance information service, which deals with queries and complaints from members of the public.  We do not deal with many complaints on availability of flood insurance cover, which would be in the low single figures each month.  We always say that it is not possible to generalise from one or two examples.  Overall we believe the flood insurance market operates efficiently.  We welcome the engagement we are having with the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, and the OPW.  Part of the purpose of that engagement is to allow the flow of information from the OPW on the work it is carrying out on flood defence works - big and small - to be communicated to the industry so that insurers can take those flood defence works into account when they are assessing risk.</p></speech>

I could bring Mr. Horan to places where that is happening today.  Huge investment has been made in flood defences.  There does not seem to be any kind of certification system to deal with areas that have had the flood defences built.  They do not seem to get any kind of benefit when seeking insurance subsequently.  I recently spoke to a person living in a housing estate on a hillside whose insurance policy specifically excluded flood.  There is no water anywhere near that house other than in the tank in the attic.  That seems very unfair.  Also, once work is done, there is no certification to recognise that those areas are not at the same level of risk as they would have been prior to the work taking place.</p></speech>

In an extreme case such as that, a person should not get a decision as bad as that.  To some extent that is the purpose of our information service.  That is the kind of issue a person can have reviewed and reassessed.  On a more general basis, we need to get more accurate flood maps to establish not just the area relative to a watercourse or something like that but where the risk is taking into account the local topographical features.  That is where we are now getting better information from the OPW, which will enable us to be more accurate in the future in dealing with those sorts of cases.</p></speech>

The witnesses are saying 98% of people are getting flood insurance.  The EU report indicated that Ireland is one of the safest countries for the insurance business and that we present a far lower risk than any other country in Europe.  Therefore, the insurance industry here should be performing at a high level.  However, if the model it pursues is to continue, it will not be 98% in the future, and at the centre of this is geocoding.  The insurance industry is not taking into account the specifics as Deputy Catherine Murphy has pointed out, but is considering the generalities of a location.  I am aware of a house in Cathedral Road in Cork - not in my constituency - which is at a height of approximately 500 ft. and cannot get flood insurance.  If Cathedral Road floods, nobody will be living in Ireland.  If I live in an area that has been geo-coded, why is there no mechanism for me to get my property out of that geocoding?  The insurance industry is not taking a specific examination of the property but is applying a general rule.  That is a summary of Deputy Catherine Murphy's contribution and the witnesses need to respond to it.</p></speech>

The European report, in which the Irish Insurance Federation took part and which was published last week, examines Europe in geocoding terms, whether for earthquakes, floods or subsidence.  The Irish Insurance Federation is a part of this report and geocoding is a methodology used in it.  I will put the question to the witnesses.  Does the Irish Insurance Federation need to examine geocoding by its members to allow households not at risk of flooding but which have been geocoded as such to get out of the tyranny of geocoding as it applies to them?</p></speech>

As Mr. Horan stated, various underwriting decisions are taken on the same risk by various companies.  We are not dealing with a monolithic industry attitude.</p></speech>

Whatever its members are telling the Irish Insurance Federation I can tell the witnesses their customers are telling us they are stuck with geocoding and cannot get out of it.  I strongly urge the witnesses to take on board this issue.  Businesses will close down because of geocoding and houses cannot be sold because of it.  We already have a mortgage crisis and the insurance industry is contributing to it because people cannot sell their homes to escape from a mortgage debt as the house cannot be bought because of geocoding.  I suggest geocoding must be seriously examined by the Irish Insurance Federation and solutions must be provided.  It is causing huge problems as the insurance industry increasingly moves away from blanket insurance to cherry picking where all conditions do not apply.</p></speech>

A significant number cannot obtain any insurance cover and the cost for the majority has doubled.  One lady responded that she had been insured for flood cover with Axa Insurance for 20 years and had never experienced flooding but her premium more than doubled.  She is afraid to move because she cannot obtain flood cover elsewhere.  Another respondent who had never experienced flooding was refused quotes from all companies, and she names the companies in question, despite a flood wall now being in place.  A woman who had been insured by Hibernian Insurance, which is now Aviva, for almost 40 years was flooded in 2002 and made a claim.  Her policy lapsed earlier this year because she was in hospital and did not renew it.  Aviva has refused to renew the cover.  Residents received letters from Zurich Insurance advising them it was no longer in a position to provide flood cover.  These are just a few examples from a wide-ranging survey.</p><p>  The OPW spent &euro;8.5 million over four years.  To my knowledge, this issue was also raised by the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, when he met the Irish Insurance Federation.  Given the presence of the flood defences the likelihood of these areas being flooded is minor but people still cannot obtain flood insurance.  As the Chairman pointed out, some people cannot sell their houses because they cannot get flood cover.  I put it to the witnesses that the presentation they made is very different to what is actually happening.  They mentioned the substantial work carried out by the OPW in 2002 at a cost of &euro;8.5 million, but the people in the area I surveyed tell the story of what is happening.  I can give the witnesses a list of the insurance companies people have contacted which have refused to provide household insurance or doubled the cost of it.  Will the witnesses tell me why this is happening?</p></speech>

There is scope for different expert views.  We pointed out the need of a number of stakeholders, including insurance providers, to be involved in the design of a scheme.  While well intentioned, some of the work carried out does not address problems adequately.  This may be the problem in the cases in question.</p></speech>

I will move on, as I will not get a proper answer.  The hardship being caused to people is significant.  Not only have they been flooded, but the damage done by being unable to get insurance or sell their homes is immeasurable.  The IIF needs to revert to us with strong and legitimate answers.  The flood measures were designed by the best international experts, yet insurance providers claim that the standards are inadequate.</p></speech>

Anecdotal evidence suggests delays in processing and delivering on claims.  What is the ideal timeframe for processing a claim and what is the reality?  We have heard about months of delays.</p><p>  The insurance industry is global and many international and national companies are examining their corporate social responsibility policies.  Do the IIF's members have a role in this regard?  Investing in the remedial efforts of the OPW to which the witnesses referred would be good for the insurance industry.  We must acknowledge the impact of climate change.  The industry and the victims of flooding would reap the rewards of such an investment.</p><p>  The witnesses mentioned that they had a liaison with the OPW that they might not have had previously.  A catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, study is being done.  As an interested party, should the industry make a submission?  Much of the information contained in the document supplied to us today reflects what the committee found following our recent investigations.</p><p>  Regarding the flood policy review group's proposals in respect of 24 plus projects, the witnesses mentioned that completion would take ten years under the OPW.  Are there examples of such lengthy projects?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-25a.215" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Horan" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2012092500009#M01200"><p>I will address the question on the length of time taken to deal with a flood claim.  When a property is badly damaged by flooding, it can take time for all of the repairs to be done.  It cannot be repaired immediately.  Rather, it must dry out and be professionally cleaned.  Only then can it be repaired and restored.  This process can take some months, given the time it takes for some properties to dry.  In extreme cases, as much as a year may be necessary.  Unfortunately, this is a fact of life where serious flood damage is concerned.  There is no point in trying to carry out rushed repairs on a property before it is fully dry.  The repair would not work and would need to be done again.</p><p>  We have suggested the establishment of a flood liaison group comprising stakeholders, including the insurance industry, to advise on flood risk management, planning strategies, etc.  We see a role for ourselves in that regard.  The IIF has a role as a conduit of information to insurance companies, for example, to update them on the remedial measures, large and small, that have been taken throughout the country.  The OPW has carried out large projects in a number of major towns and cities and local authorities have taken smaller remedial measures in respect of flooding blackspots.  If that information can be communicated to us, we can pass it on to the insurance companies, which can take it into account when making their underwriting decisions.</p><p>  In terms of liaising with the OPW, we have made submissions on a number of CFRAM exercises.  The briefing material that we have supplied is an abbreviated version of some of the points we made during those exercises.</p><p>  Deputy Corcoran Kennedy mentioned the flood policy review group and those of its projects that took ten years or longer.  We identified a number of cases as having taken longer than ten years.  For example, the St. John's river project in Waterford was at stage 4 in December 2003 and stage 5 in late 2009.  The Templemore project was at stage 2 in December 2003 and stage 4 in 2009.  The Fermoy project was at stage 1 in December 2003 and stage 5 in 2009.  It is a six-stage process.  In some cases, it took a project five or six years to move from one intermittent stage to another.</p></speech>

However, it tends to be a niche that individual companies like to carve out for themselves, for example, through sponsorships.  It can be considered, but the decision to make a financial contribution to remedial measures is one for individual companies.  It tends not to be the type of initiative that can be managed at industry level through the association.</p></speech>

I find Mr. Kemp's comments in regard to the Tolka works puzzling.  In the most recent floods in 2008, 2009 and on 24 October last, the Tolka region was almost unaffected.  There must be a communication breakdown somewhere.  I would like to put on record the trauma being experienced by these people in terms of their dealings with the insurance companies.  As pointed out by the Chairman, Deputies Murphy and Humphreys and others, these people are living in homes that are effectively worthless because, as everyone knows, without house insurance one cannot sell a house.  While some families are obtaining a level of flood cover, new purchasers of houses in the area will not get cover.  Leaving aside the trauma of living in an area of perceived threat of flooding, which threat has in many cases subsided because of remedial works, having this situation hanging over their heads is a life sentence.  Despite that works are planned, have been signed off on or completed, the attitude of the insurance companies has not budged, which is outrageous.</p><p>  I agree with the Chairman that the response in terms of the role of the federation in moving the insurance industry towards a situation whereby it can take individual cases outside the geocoding is disappointing.  A shift in culture and attitude is required.  It is difficult for any of us to offer support to residents in this situation when the attitude of the federation representatives is simply to throw their hands in the air and say they wished things were different but there is nothing much they can do.  We are all aware of the savage nature of market forces and what has happened to our economy.  The families concerned have been left once again to the mercy of the savage nature of market forces and are suffering as a consequence.</p></speech>

Insurance companies are in the business of providing insurance to as many people as possible.  Obviously, if it is totally uneconomic to provide flood insurance, it will not be provided.  However, that happens in respect of only a small minority of areas in the country.  We aim to keep those areas and the percentage of people involved to a minimum.  We believe we can do this if, through a process of engagement with the OPW, the flow of information about flood defences is improved to allow insurers to take it into account, thus preserving the model we have in this country.  That is what we are aiming to achieve.  We are trying to partner with Government to find a sustainable solution to the issue of availability of insurance cover.</p></speech>

The Government hopes to have its insolvency legislation enacted in the next couple of months.  This positive development, which will allow people escape from burdening debt, may also result in their not being able to insure their homes into the future because they will have been declared bankrupt.  Can the witnesses explain why it is not possible to get home insurance if one is declared bankrupt?  Why, if I was declared bankrupt today but can still meet the &euro;500 premium in respect of domestic home insurance for the next 12 months, can I not get insurance?</p></speech>

I checked this with some brokers this morning.  This has been a standard practice within the insurance industry for a number of years.  A declaration of bankruptcy is placed in the same category as conviction or charge in respect of arson or any criminal offence, other than a motoring offence.  Bankruptcy is not a crime.  It may be the result of bad business practice, for which a person is not imprisoned unless he or she has embezzled funds and so on.  Can the witnesses provide any explanation in regard to the reason bankruptcy is considered a valid reason for the non-granting of house insurance?</p></speech>

Yesterday a businessman in Douglas was informed that owing to recent flooding in the area, he would not be able to get insurance cover into the future.  Hundreds of millions of euros of taxpayers' money has been spent over the years by successive Governments on putting flood protections in place, which has resulted in a lowering of risk to the benefit of the insurance industry.  The insurance industry has not contributed one cent to lowering that risk.  The question that arises is how much the industry saves as a result of every euro of taxpayers' money spent in this regard.</p><p>  Paragraph 13 of the federation's submission lists nine specific recommendations, all of which are worthy.  However, what action will be taken by the Irish Insurance Federation?  The witnesses have advocated for swifter completion of structure defences, a more co-ordinated action plan from the OPW and so on.  If all the nine recommendations were implemented tomorrow, what could we expect in return from the federation?  In my opinion, there is a need for re-examination by it of the practice in regard to geocoding.  Households and businesses need to be able to remove themselves from it.  Also, business owners such as the one in Douglas who was informed he could not get flood insurance into the future need to be told what actions they need to take for them to get insurance.  What type of remedial action, if taken, would facilitate them getting insurance into the future?</p><p>  Non-provision of insurance cover could result in the closure of businesses.  Profit margins are so tight businesses cannot take the hit in a flood in terms of the destruction of &euro;20,000 worth of stock, never mind the cost of refurbishing the premises.  Business owners need to be told by Insurance Industry Federation members what they need to do to facilitate their getting insurance cover.  I would welcome some recommendations from the federation in this regard.  There are options.  The business owner referred to is locked out from obtaining insurance.</p> <p>Can we put in place an interim measure where insurance would be provided, although with an excess, so the first &euro;5,000 or &euro;10,000 in damage may not be covered?  Deputy Corcoran Kennedy mentioned climate change and this is another example of how the industry should be more innovative and modernise its thinking.  It must formulate solutions that are no longer based on a blanket insurance approach but rather target certain areas.  In particular, the industry must respond on a business level to the type of State intervention suggested in paragraph 13.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-25a.230" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Kemp" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2012092500011#O00200"><p>That is essentially what all the measures we are suggesting are addressed to.  They are meant to try to alleviate the issue.  It is very difficult to be specific about individual cases as every situation is different; there is different topography and risk from place to place.  In some cases, measures can be taken at the level of individual premises that would help to protect against flooding but in other cases, there is a question of physical defences, water courses and greater protection upstream.  We must also be aware that in some cases a problem is prevented by taking action in one area but it may create a difficulty somewhere else.  That must be taken into account.</p><p>  The idea and thrust of our argument is that if we can take effective measures, which will include participation in design from the insurance industry, and have an agreed standard of the built defences, there will greater availability of cover in areas that were previously a problem.  The claims cost associated with flooding, subject to frequency and climate change issues, will go down, all other things being equal, and therefore the insurance cost will go down.</p><p>  As we noted in the presentation, excesses in premiums are implemented before getting to the ultimate stage of having to withdraw cover because of the prognosis for a recurrence of damage.  All those tools are used on a daily basis to try to address problems as they arise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-25a.231" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/990" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Lynch" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2012092500011#O00300"><p>This is related to geocoding, which is subject to constant assessment and is not specific.  I can get car insurance in the morning and property insurance may be for property worth four, five, six or ten times the value of a car.  I would be asked more questions about my car.  Car insurance is mandatory but house insurance is not.  Nevertheless, in applying for car insurance I would be asked how many miles are on the clock, how many miles I drive per year, the value of the car, the effect of depreciation, what the car is used for, where it is located at night, etc.  As car insurance is so specific and there was Government intervention a couple of years ago because young people were being fleeced, that part of the insurance industry responded.</p><p>  I do not believe the Government has to make an intervention in the first instance with the insurance industry and I would much prefer the industry to respond to its problems.  Regretfully, the witnesses have not told us there will be a code of practice for members, although perhaps that is a response that should be given from the outset.</p><p>  Not providing specific insurance to companies goes back to what was mentioned by Deputies &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and Humphreys earlier.  The Office of Public Works, OPW, has implemented a host of remedial measures and people still find they cannot get flood insurance, so what is happening?  Is the relevant Department not informing the insurance industry or do customers not have the methodology to explain that their property is no longer at risk?  What is going on?</p></speech>

A similar model applies here, where the industry wishes to preserve the widespread availability and affordability of flood insurance.  There is increased engagement on the part of the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes, and the OPW, but current levels of investment and implementation of flood defences must improve.  There should be better communication of flood defences being implemented, both big and small around the country.</p></speech>

One of the issues which prompted me to invite the witnesses before the committee was a person ringing my office two or three weeks ago.  The person was looking to change insurance company, which is becoming more difficult with property insurance, as if one is without insurance, it is almost impossible to get back into it with some cases.  People are trying to hang on to policies.  Nevertheless, the person in question was shopping around.  A series of questions was asked, including whether a claim was made in the past seven years.  The person indicated that a claim had been made and significant underpinning was done on the property to deal with subsidence.  This work should mean the property was invulnerable to subsidence but the insurance company in question did not offer a quotation because of the history of subsidence on the site, although remedial work had been completed.</p><p>  This process does not make sense.  The property has had remedial work done.  It may have been a "no-brainer" for the insurance company at a business level because there was no risk involved, with the remedial work already done.  As a result of "geozoning" - being in a particular region - somebody seeking insurance is blown out of the water in trying to get a fair deal from an insurance company.</p></speech>

I have made a point regarding a certification process.  We heard a letter read out detailing a reputable certification process as it related to a case on the Dodder.  There does not seem to be any process between the OPW and the industry.  It is well and good for the industry representatives to ask to be told about the projects around the country, including cases of remedial works where there has been flooding.  What is totally absent is any kind of certification process, with a person being able to hand a certificate to an insurance company to prove that a problem has been sorted out.  The certification process should be agreed between the industry, the OPW, local authorities, etc., but it is totally absent.  We are getting more information on the issue, and several of us have provided examples.  We do not intend those individual cases for comment by the witnesses but rather to show how we have practical experience of dealing with people who are saying the opposite of what we are being told today.</p><p>  I have a concern about the catchment flood risk and assessment management study, CFRAMS, which is mapping all the flood areas around the country.  When something is captured in the study, remedial works can take place on the piece of land, which can then be returned to the system.  It appears that the risk is the insurance company will be given another raft of locations from the study that will be excluded.  This information will be public and will only make the matter worse unless we can come to grips with the issue.</p><p>  There was an argument that these processes can take ten years, with the implication that the OPW is inefficient, etc.  There have been many flood events in north Kildare, with several areas having had remedial work.  A cost-benefit analysis would be done which is pivotal to what gets funding, as there is limited funding for the OPW.  The worst cases are remediated first and where there is insufficient funding, not everything will get through the system.  It is not just about time but rather quantifying the problem.</p><p>  The witnesses have indicated that people contact the insurance industry but only a small number complain about not being able to get flood insurance.  How does the industry capture the number of people who cannot get flood insurance?</p> <p>How does one capture the numbers who do not bother getting insurance because they cannot afford it given that it is twice or three times the price it would have been?  How does one capture the number of people who are simply priced out of the market?  Does one measure this by the complaints received?  Do people know to whom they should complain?  Do they know this is something the federation is measuring?</p><p> In the town in which I live, Leixlip, there was flood early in the last decade.  A major job was carried out that cost millions of euro.  The Office of Public Works, OPW, was involved in it.  Most of those areas have not been flooded since then.  In Leixlip there are two hills with all the housing estates and the valley.  The valley was flooded and the people who cannot get flood insurance are in the housing estates.  How stupid is that?  There is no river near them.  It is because there is a blanket inclusion in this zone so they cannot get insurance.  This is the point that all of us are trying to press home.  We need a certification process that is acceptable to all.  When public money is spent alleviating the problem, it must be reflected by bringing people back in so they are fairly treated in terms of the insurance cover they would rightly expect to be able to get for an affordable price.</p></speech>

We should write to the OPW.  The opening statement states: "It is also important that the OPW communicates reliable information on flood defences to insurers in a format that is easily accessible...".  We should ask the OPW if it is providing reliable information given the fact that the witness raised it.  I have found the OPW to be very professional and to operate at a very high standard, so we should write to the OPW and pose that question.</p><p>  I have not received a satisfactory answer.  We know the work that was done and the information was communicated to the insurance companies.  The works were to the highest standards and were verified by senior engineers, but it made no difference to people's access to insurance.  Other things were mentioned in the statement.  It says: "It is insurers&rsquo; experience that in the boom years homeowners invested heavily in upgrading the fit-out of their homes &ndash; installing high quality kitchens, wooden floors and electronic equipment resulting in a very large increase in the cost of flood claims."  However, that also increased the cost of taking out insurance.  I wonder why that is included.  It is obvious that if one insures one's house for a higher figure, the insurer will charge the person more money.  That is part of the insurer's risk.  The insurers are saying that they will charge the person more but they do not wish to pay it out.  That is what hits me from that comment.  Homeowners invest in a fit-out of their homes but they pay a higher premium for that fit-out.  I am at a loss to understand why the witnesses included that.</p><p>  The operation profits for household insurance are still at approximately 125%.  Is it sustainable in that area?  Are we facing insurance companies opting out of high risk elements?  We have seen this in areas in Europe.  The European directive and other European countries have insisted that insurance companies carry the risk on high-----</p></speech>

That makes it easier after the event to be able to review the situation regarding the availability of cover.</p><p>  There was a suggestion that we were criticising the OPW for being inefficient in terms of the time taken to carry out some works.  That is not what we meant.  We were saying that the process the OPW is caught in, as much as anybody else, is such that it tends to slow things down to an unacceptable degree.  There should be an examination of that to try to streamline the process.  The OPW, like everybody else, is constrained by the process in getting projects to fruition.</p><p>  With regard to problem cases, our estimate of 98% plus penetration is based on an estimate of the level of cover provided to households throughout the country.  It is not based on a sampling of the complaints we get.  The point we made is that the complaints seemed to be relatively low in comparison to the amount of publicity the problem has had.  However, we are quite happy to look into complaints and we are usually very effective at getting results where there is a manifest injustice in the way a particular case has been treated.  There will be occasions when we will stand over the fact that we believe there is a logic to what is done in underwriting decisions in general, but there are cases where mistakes are made and in many cases we get underwriters to change their opinion and to reinstate cover or to change the terms clashing with the cover in those cases.  In addition, at area level, where works have been carried out, there have been changes in the attitudes of underwriters to insuring risks in those areas.</p><p>  The point about the higher standard of fit-out was not intended to be a criticism.  It was just an explanation.  It is one of the reasons that we have seen the cost of weather events increasing.  There is a higher sum at risk.  Certainly, it is charged for in premiums-----</p></speech>

I might not be making myself clear.  The insurance companies must pay out as a result of flooding.

Why is it assumed the State will always do this?  The insurance industry is a profitable global industry.  There must be some mechanism for the industry to help us out.  Earlier, the Chairman referred to the fact that Ireland is one of the safest countries to insure in and surely it must be possible to do what I suggest.</p></speech>

When Deputy Corcoran Kennedy says the industry will benefit, ultimately the consumer will benefit because the consumer will get cover at a lower price if the cost of claims reduces, as has happened in respect of motor insurance in the past ten years.  The point made in respect of corporate social responsibility is that it is an area where it could be considered but it is a matter for individual companies rather than an area in which we have a role.  We can examine it and talk to our members about it but it will come down to individual companies deciding whether they want to get involved.</p></speech>

Regarding the comments of Deputy Corcoran Kennedy on corporate social responsibility, the situation appears to be all of the gain and none of the pain.  On the GPS mapping system, the scene should be changing for the insurance companies.  Where houses are a certain number of feet above river or sea level, the likelihood of flooding is lower.  Some insurance companies group factors and do not isolate whether the issue is flooding, fire or something else.  One pays a premium and certain items are covered.  I would like to see a written statement from the insurance body on this point.</p></speech>

As with most industries, the insurance industry is in a competitive and challenging environment.  However, there are seven points of consideration the federation should take into account at the conclusion of today's meeting.  The first is the need for a code of good professional practice with regard to problems that arise with geocoding.  There must be a certification process to allow businesses and households to challenge difficulties that arise from geocoding or from remedial works being carried out.  The third point is that there must be a re-examination of the eligibility criteria for household insurance.  One concern is why bankruptcy precludes people from getting household insurance, particularly in light of insolvency legislation coming down the tracks.  There be may be another series of insolvency measures.</p><p>  Fourth, the industry has responsibility to respond in detail to situations where flooding insurance is refused, particularly in cases where a customer has an existing policy.  If the business or household has had flood or subsidence insurance up to now and can no longer get cover, the insurance company has a responsibility to explain why cover is not being offered.  In outlining the details, an explanation can be given to the household or business of the remedies necessary for the household or business to be covered in future.  As part of an interim measure, where a business may be unable to get flood insurance while it is carrying out remedial measures, the introduction of excess payments may be a solution to assist businesses and households.  The parties may agree that the first &euro;10,000 of damage is not covered.  The industry must meet the challenge in respect of climate change and the adverse weather conditions seen in recent years.  According to European reports, the Irish household insurance industry is in one of the lowest risk regions in western Europe.  This is also a country with the highest percentage of homeownership, meaning people are more likely to insure property than those in countries with a larger rental base.  The insurance industry is in a fortunate position.  As Deputy Corcoran Kennedy suggested, the Irish Insurance Federation needs to show leadership in this area and apply innovative measures and approaches.</p><p>  On a positive note, at a future engagement I hope that when we talk about good practice, there will be a more immediate response.  The Irish Insurance Federation should be seen as the body setting standards of good practice in the industry with regards to the areas mentioned.  I invite Mr. Horan and Mr. Kemp to make any concluding comments before drawing the meeting to a close.</p></speech>

While her portfolio deals with justice, fundamental rights and citizenship, our discussion with her today will focus on the broader theme of the future of Europe.  Ms Reding has during recent months been to the fore in an emerging debate on the future of Europe.  She has articulated a vision for a move towards political union in Europe by 2020, with an essential role for the citizen in that process.  We are delighted to have the Ms Reding here today to discuss Ireland's relationship with the European Union and to stimulate debate on what the future of Europe will be.  I now invite Ms Reding to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>

I greatly appreciate the opportunity to come here to help prepare for Ireland's Presidency of the Council of the European Union.  I know from experience that previous Irish Presidencies were great and helped to move Europe forward.</p><p>  Ireland and Europe have been working together since 1973 to overcome difficult and complex problems.  We have overcome those problems in a joint venture.  Do Members recall the Irish Presidency in 1975 and the decision on the European Regional Development Fund?  Irish citizens should certainly remember it given Ireland has in the past five years received &euro;751 million from it.  It is a real instrument for solidarity, of which there are many in Europe.  It is good to remind people of this as they have a tendency to forget quickly.  The Structural Fund was established to support the poorest regions in Europe and to share prosperity grounded on the system of solidarity.  I have already mentioned the amount of money which Ireland has received from the fund during the past five years.  Since joining the European Union, Ireland has received &euro;17 billion to help its citizens.  </p><p>  The Irish Council Presidency in 1979 was the first session of the freely elected European Parliament, which was a historical step and the beginning of the Europe of citizens.  In 1990, the Council Presidency brought forward the decision to convene the conventions on economic and monetary union and on political union.  In 2004, the Irish Presidency steered the biggest enlargement, welcoming ten new member states.  It is sometimes good to recall the past in order to see where Ireland stands.  I am confident that the forthcoming Presidency commencing on 1 January next will be a great one, and will move Europe forward.</p> <p>When we speak about bringing Europe a step forward and a great Presidency, it is not to hide that there are significant problems.  I need not tell the committee members because they are in day-to-day contact with their citizens but there is a crisis in Europe.  The citizens tell the members about the problems they have with making ends meet, with not finding a job and so on.  We have to work together to overcome this crisis.  However, I believe the most important crisis is one of confidence.  We see our citizens beginning to lose confidence everywhere, not only confidence in Europe, but confidence in the national government and the national parliament.  The Eurobarometer survey shows that the confidence of citizens has gone down steadily not only in this country, but also in other member states.  This is important because one cannot represent citizens, whether in parliament or in government, and make policies if the citizens do not trust that one makes the right policies.  It is of absolute importance to restore this confidence and we must work together in this endeavour.</p><p> I realise that some Irish citizens have questioned the fate of our common currency and Ireland's place in Europe.  I imagine this is one of those moments in history where, when things are going bad, one questions everything.  However, one should see that the euro is not the problem, but the solution.  If there had not been a euro or European solidarity, the fate of the citizens would be much greater.</p><p> We are riding out of the storm at the moment and it is important to be true in the analysis we make.  When things are going bad, one should say they are going bad and say what one is doing to get out of it, but when there is light at the end of the tunnel we should also say so without exaggerating or saying that everything is done and there are no problems to be solved any more.  We should also remember the efforts made by the European Union and, most of all, by the Irish people and the Irish Government.  They are riding out of the storm.  Ireland has gone back to the debt markets after two years of absence and that is an important moment.  The Irish economy will grow this year, reaching almost 2% growth.  That is higher than in the United Kingdom, France or Germany.  The Irish fiscal deficit is set to fall below 8.6% and this was the target for 2012.  This shows that the programme remains firmly on track and that things are moving in the right direction.</p><p> Having said this, we cannot ignore that there remains a long way to go.  The members may wish to hear from me where Europe comes into this.  They know perfectly well what they have been doing and what their citizens have had to do and how the Irish Government has been fighting to get out of the situation.  What have we done to help Ireland to get out?  As with many occasions in the history of Europe, a crisis is not a time to stand still but to go forward.  A standstill takes place when everything is fine.  We lean back and we say everything is fine and that we should wait and do nothing.  When there is a crisis, then we see where the deficits are and where we have to move to solve the crisis and not to allow a new crisis to develop.</p><p> Let us consider what has been done in recent months in Europe.  It is impressive.  As parliamentarians, the committee members will know all about the European semester whereby the whole of Europe examines the budgets of the neighbouring countries.  Why does this happen?  It is because we have seen that if one budget gets out of control, it has an impact on other member states.  Could we have imagined it two or three years ago if someone had said that we share a common responsibility for national budgets?  No one would have believed it could ever be done, but it is important that it is done in order that we can help each other and that we do not deviate from the right track.  The European Stability Mechanism will be a new testament to European solidarity.  It will act as a sail, pulling troubled economies out of danger and into calmer waters.  The proposed banking union is absolutely necessary to solve the problems of the banks and to prevent the build up of new problems such as those which people in Ireland have experienced.  The banking supervisor was put on the table by the Commission on 12 September.  All summer long, from the end of June to 12 September, our people were working to make this possible.  What is the aim?  Never again will banks remain unregulated and unaccountable.  Never again will a nation's people pay the price of its banks' mistakes and never again will problems in one country spread unchecked to the countries around it.  That is the aim of the European banking supervisor.</p><p> However, the crisis of confidence is not only a lack of confidence in the economic capabilities of the eurozone members, but also a crisis of confidence in politics in general and, specifically, in European politics.  It is important that we go back to the grassroots.  Do we speak with our citizens?  By "we" I include everyone in Europe: local government, regional government, national government, European government and the parliaments.  When do we go to speak to citizens?  We do it when we want something from them in election campaigns or in referendum campaigns.  In between are we really going to the grassroots?  We have 27 different systems where we proceed at a dazzling speed and at European level too.  There are complex systems and solutions but we have never really explained to our citizens where we are heading.  We have never really explained to citizens how the system works, unless the committee members have done so during the referendum campaigns.  It is of the utmost importance not only to gain the confidence of the financial markets, but also to regain the trust of our citizens.  We have moved from a growth compact to a fiscal compact and we must go to a legitimacy compact that includes our citizens.</p><p> Having said that, the European Union is already a very democratic system.  We have a directly elected parliament which is part of a co-decision system.  The European Parliament is one of the main players to decide for or against European laws.  A European Commissioner must go through a sound and hours-long hearing before securing the acceptance of the European Parliament.  I am unsure whether there is something similar for the Ministers in this country.  Anyway, that does not exist in most countries.</p> <p>There are checks and balances at European level but the process is much more under parliamentary control than the appointments of Ministers in most member states.  For instance, I can be removed at any time from my post as Commissioner by the European Parliament.  The national parliaments have also gained, with the new Treaty of Lisbon being a significant influence on the way European policies are decided.</p><p> The current crisis has served as a sobering reminder of how we are all in the same boat and a decision taken in Ireland, for instance, has an impact on the neighbouring countries.  The recipes of the past, which included individual and unco-ordinated action, have led to excesses of debt and endangered trust and confidence in our economies.  Member states have granted Europe greater powers but have also imposed new checks and balances.  One cannot have increased powers without a parallel system of checks and balances.  It is a question of how to achieve this balance by getting the necessary common decisions on policies in parallel with a necessary democratic common system of checks and balances.  I believe we need to go a step further, and this has already been inscribed in the decisions we have taken.  For instance, the decision to have a more economic Union, which is mainly intergovernmental so far, has inscribed in the text that this needs to become part of the European treaties as from 2018.  In order to implement the decisions of today we will need a treaty change in the future and it is a question of how to change the terms of treaties.  Will the decision be taken behind closed doors and then brought to the citizens?  I propose that it should be done another way.  For the first time in the European system we need to integrate the citizen before we sit down to decide on what treaty changes will be necessary.</p><p> With this in mind, on 9 May 2012 I launched a programme of dialogue with the citizens of Europe.  The first step was an Internet questionnaire for citizens and it was mainly young citizens who responded.  The Internet is a young medium and that is why young citizens responded.  However, they needed to take time to answer the questions posed and they took that time.  This illustrates that there is an eagerness and a willingness on the part of citizens to be consulted beforehand.  Before we start to think about the next step we must include citizens in the discussion.  That is the reason that 2013 will be the European year of citizens.  It will mean that all citizens, such as the committee members, rather than Commissioners such as me will play an active role.</p><p> I am speaking tomorrow to the European association of mayors and presidents of regions to explain to them that it is their responsibility to reach out to citizens.  All elected representatives have a responsibility to go to the grassroots and to have discussions with citizens.  The discussions will be about the meaning of belonging to the European Union, the added value of being in the Union and what improvements are required.  It is a means of finding out what the citizens think about Europe and what they think is working well or badly and also to hear what are their hopes for the Europe of the future.  This is to be a serious discussion with citizens outside of any voting imperative - there are no European elections in 2013, nor is there any European referendum planned.  There might be other referendums in this country and also national elections are planned for 2013 in other member states, but this discussion with the citizens of Europe will not be part of any election campaign.  The year 2014 will be the time for the election campaign for the European Parliament and it will be the turn of the political parties who will have to do their job to win votes.</p><p> In his speech on the state of the Union, President Barroso set out the way forward for Europe.  We will have discussions with citizens and with national parliaments to see how sovereignty needs to be shared in order to help our economies to survive and to make a place for Europe in a globalised world so that it is regarded as a significant entity.</p><p> The European Union is linked together by the rule of law and by solidarity among member states.  Decisions must be agreed by means of the normal procedures.  Once a new European Parliament is elected it will elect a new Commission from 1 January 2015.  It will then be time to call for a new convention, but only once the discussions with citizens have been held in 2013 and once the citizens have made their decision in the European elections in 2014.</p><p> We need to do things differently.  Everyone knows my position and also the position of the President of the European Commission in this regard.  We want a political union.  We have seen very clearly that in order for the Parliament and the national parliaments to have basic control of fiscal and economic matters we need to go a step further towards political union.  However, this political union must be decided by all.  That is why I have come to Ireland to say that the European year of citizens will begin during the Irish Presidency.  I hope that the first official meeting of a citizens' dialogue in 2013 can be held in Dublin Castle and that it will be attended not only by the Taoiseach but also by the people of Europe, and not only by the citizens of this country but by citizens of other countries.  This will be a great moment which will see power being returned to citizens where it belongs.</p></speech>

This is a very timely debate.  I read President Barroso's speech with interest and I know that many members of the committee, as well as others, have been very interested to hear his proposals and suggestions.  The Irish people are very engaged in the European project - more so now because of the economic situation but also because of our system of government.</p> <p>We had two referenda in the case of both the Nice treaty and the Lisbon treaty and, more recently, a referendum on the fiscal compact.  An issue that emerged in the first campaign on the Lisbon treaty, and a major factor in its rejection by the Irish people, was the perception that we might lose our right to have a permanent Commissioner.  The appointment of an Irish Commissioner is seen as essential for the good of the country.  By the time of the second Lisbon treaty campaign, the proposals regarding the composition of the Commission had changed, which was an important factor in the ratification of the proposal.</p><p> Ms Reding stated in a paper she delivered in May that the European Parliament should have the exclusive right to elect the Commission.  How does she see this proposal squaring with the need, as far as small countries like Ireland are concerned, to ensure each member state has its own Commissioner?</p><p> I agree with Ms Reding that involving citizens in the European project is essential.  The paper by ten foreign affairs Ministers, published last week, offers several interesting proposals, including the introduction of a second Chamber and a strengthening of the powers of committees.  Does Ms Reding have any particular views on how these suggestions might help to extend democracy in the European Union?</p><p> I will now take questions from members, beginning with Deputy Timmy Dooley.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-25a.289" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2012092500005#D00200"><p>I welcome the Vice President and thank her for her forthright presentation.  It is useful to be reminded, as she has reminded us today, of the benefits enjoyed by Ireland and other countries as a consequence of their membership of the European Union, not only in terms of funding transfers but also in regard to social interaction, access to markets, ease of travel for citizens and so on.  A range of positives has flown from our participation in the European project.  Perhaps most important of all, it has been one of the most successful peace projects anywhere in the world.</p><p>  As the Chairman indicated, this committee has done a great deal of work in terms of assessing public attitudes to Europe, largely as a consequence of the various referenda that were held.  Much of this work was concerned with exploring ways of addressing the disconnect between the citizen and the institutions of the European Union.  The impression we received from the various witnesses who appeared before the committee in the course of these discussions - witnesses who had engaged in an analysis of the outcome of the various referenda - was that the unsatisfactory level of engagement by the Oireachtas in European Union affairs meant that such matters were considered to be outside the sphere of regular political discourse and did not, therefore, receive the type of publicity within the general media which might encourage citizens to become more engaged.   Work remains to be done in this regard, although we saw some progress in the most recent referendum campaign.  The difficulty remains that national parliaments tend not to involve themselves in matters in respect of which they do not have clear decision-making powers.</p><p>  Ms Reding referred to the notion of a democratic deficit and the importance of democratic legitimacy.  In recent years, since the beginning of the most difficult economic crisis we have faced, we have seen two countries take the lead in Europe, namely, France and Germany.  That spectacle gave the impression to our citizens and perhaps citizens in other jurisdictions that all decisions relating to the European Union would ultimately be decided by two superpowers.  In observing that the Commission was largely sidelined during that period I do not mean to cast a negative reflection on that institution.  I am well aware of the tremendous work done by the President, Mr. Barroso, and all of his colleagues, the fruits of which are clear in the proposals that are now coming forward.  The difficulty, however, is that perception often forces reality.  In the context of media coverage and so on, the perception certainly was abroad that two individuals were steering Europe through the crisis or, depending on how one looks at it, steering the crisis itself.  Will Ms Reding comment on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-25a.290" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2012092500005#D00300"><p>I welcome the Vice President to the meeting.  I had the privilege of welcoming her to St. Vincent's national school for girls in Dublin Central this morning.  Ms Reding is fortunate to have had an opportunity to visit the best constituency in the country during her stay in Ireland and to see one of our finest schools.  The staff and pupils did an excellent job in demonstrating their ongoing efforts to learn about the work that is done in Europe.  I hope Ms Reding will agree that what she saw this morning was a clear example of how, despite the difficulties facing this country, our public servants, schools and communities are ensuring that everything which makes the country great continues to be in evidence.  I thank the Vice President for participating in that event.</p><p>  Will Ms Reding elaborate on what is envisaged in the reference in her contribution to the idea of political union?  We in this country are well acquainted with the challenges arising from economic union.  As a consequence of the recent referendum, there is a high level of understanding among citizens of what needs to be done to enhance that union.  There are different views, of course, as to whether it should be enhanced at all.  However, many people might struggle with the notion that because we are integrated economically, albeit still lacking effective governance mechanisms, this generates a platform for the proposal that we should have common foreign and security policies.  The argument seems to be that the response to profound economic crisis, of itself, provides the rationale for integration in the area, for example, of justice policy.  I am not convinced by the arguments for this linkage.  When Ms Reding refers to political union, does she mean a union across economic aspects of governance or does she have a broader vision in mind?  If the latter, how does she justify that as a response to an economic crisis?</p><p>  We have had proposals from the President of the Commission, Mr. Barroso, for a banking union.  A positive recent development in the ongoing efforts to safeguard economic union is the increased timeliness of responses.  The fiscal treaty, for instance, was successfully negotiated in a matter of weeks.  Does Ms Reding likewise expect the banking union proposal to be delivered by the beginning of next year, as Mr. Barroso has indicated is his intention?</p></speech>

As it stands, the Parliament elects but does not nominate the President of the Commission.  The Council of Ministers - that is, the bosses - presents a candidate and the Parliament can choose to accept or reject that candidate, just as it can reject a proposed member of the Commission and has done exactly that several times in the past.  In other words, the Parliament has a negative power, namely, the power to reject a nominated candidate.</p><p>  As members know, the political party groupings in Europe - the European People's Party, socialists, liberals, communists and so on - are not merely organisational groupings.  When the Parliament is sitting, Members are seated according to political grouping rather than country.  In other words, it is a political group fight that is taking place in the European Parliament.  What I expect will happen in the next election is that the national parties - say, for example, the party that is aligned to the EPP in this country, will present their candidates for the European elections on the basis of their membership of the national party.</p> <p>At the same time, if we get the power at European level then our candidate for President of the Parliament will be someone that we will all, as members of the EPP, have chosen together.  The socialists would do the same.</p><p> The election campaign would then go beyond purely national candidates for the European Parliament and would add to this the European dimension of what the parties are doing.  One can only have influence in the European Parliament if one has access to the allies of the other parties with which one is working.  This is one possibility of how to proceed and it would reinforce the idea that the elections to the European Parliament are not solely national in nature.  In many member states, people vote on purely national grounds and the European dimension is lost as a result.  We must bring that dimension back to the elections relating to the European Parliament.  In order to achieve this, we must work together.  That is why in 2013 we must inform the people about what is going to happen in 2014 when the political parties engage in that election campaign.  We must also make clear to them for what they will be voting.</p><p> I was very taken with what the ten Foreign Ministers did.  I actually pushed the entire thing when I published an article containing my five-point plan.  The German Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Guido Westerwelle, then brought his colleagues together in a reflection group.  This is very important and we need many such reflection groups in order to prepare for the future.  I do not know the choices we will ultimately make in the context of our common future.  However, we must begin the discussion now.  The fact that this discussion is starting everywhere shows that Europe goes beyond both national borders and also the market.  However, the market is of utmost importance and the Internal Market is the real wealth of the European Union.  That is why, for example, one of the highlights of Ireland's Presidency will be to bring to completion the projects I have put on the table in respect of justice for growth.  In this regard, I refer to how, with justice, it is possible to open the Single Market to the benefit of consumers.  This matter can be seen from different points of view but it is necessary to go one step further.</p><p> I was asked what the national parliaments are doing in the context of this debate.  I spent ten years as a Member of my country's Parliament.  I was also a Member of the European Parliament for ten years before I became Commissioner.  I am, therefore, quite well versed in how national parliaments function.  It is important that national parliaments understand that they are <i>de facto</i>European parliaments.  This is because the decisions which can be channelled through a national parliament will have an influence on European policy.  If I am not mistaken, a national parliament has a major task in the context of controlling the government.  That is the essence of what a national parliament should do.</p></speech>

Perhaps members will not bring what I am saying in this regard to the attention of the Minister for Justice and Equality, with whom I work very well.  Do Members of the Oireachtas really control what the Ministers with responsibility for social affairs, economic affairs and finance do when they attend Council meetings?  Doing so would be an extremely important task.  There would also be a need to organise, in the context of plenary sessions, discussions on proposals which the Commission puts forward.  For example, would the members present suggest that the Minister for Justice and Equality support the proposals I have put forward in the context of justice for growth, which contemplate many elements of reform?  Would they instead inform him that they do not agree with him in respect of the matter?</p><p>  I am of the view that national parliaments must take an increasing interest in European politics.  This will show the citizens in Ireland and other countries that European politics are not foreign politics but rather they are national politics.  If this Parliament engages in regular debates on matters relating to Europe, the public will understand that European politics are also national politics.  They will also come to see that their national parliamentarians care about those matters to which I refer.</p><p>  A not so positive way to proceed within the European Union would be to take the intergovernmental approach.  The fiscal compact is an intergovernmental mechanism and it states that the intergovernmental system must be included in a treaty by 2018.  That is why I stated that 2018 is an important year in the context of treaty change because there is already something which we must include in a treaty.  The Deputy inquired about a Europe led by France and Germany, with all the other member states following behind them like poodles.  It appears that this is the case because when one switches on one's TV, one sees Francois Hollande and Angela Merkel clapping each other on the shoulder and agreeing with each other.  Citizens looking at such pictures often think that France and Germany have made a decision and that their countries can do nothing but follow.  Things are not like that.  Since the creation of the European adventure, we needed the engine of the German and French understanding.  If that engine does not work, then Europe has a problem.  However, an engine is not enough.  We need an entire aeroplane and a pilot to fly it.  Decisions relating to the European Union are taken by 27 member states, not by two.</p><p>  I am a Luxembourger and the people in my country know that there are other states which are bigger than ours.  Ireland is one such example.  However, that does not prevent Luxembourgers from trying to exercise influence in the European Union to try to bring it to that place where we want it to be, to persuade, and not agree with, our larger neighbours of the fact that they are, as we see it, on the wrong track.  The essential aspect is that democracy in the Union relates to the fact that we are 27, we are not two.  I accept, however, that all the shoulder-clapping might give the wrong impression.</p><p>  This brings me to the political union.  Such a union is not one where two decide and 25 follow.  It is, rather, a union where we have parliamentary systems which can have an impact in respect of the fiscal compact and the intergovernmental approach.  The Parliament must also have an input in respect of banking union when we go down that road.  There is a need for checks and balances.  I say this as a Commissioner and I am well aware that it is not always very comfortable to go before the Parliament, offer an explanation and then be grilled by the Members.  However, those are the checks and balances we need in order to reinforce the European Parliament.</p> <p>We do not need intergovernmental decisions but European Union decisions and not only economic decisions.  The European Union decisions are also citizens' decisions.  I will give a good example in this respect.  During Ireland's Presidency, the protection of personal data, a project I have put on the table, will be a very important element.  I hope Ireland will make a gift to Europe and reach the completion of this or at least arrive at a political decision between the Council and the European Parliament on data protection rules.  This is a system where both can be done together.</p><p> With regard to what are the new rules on data protection, I am talking of a market opener because there are 27 different conflicting national laws on data protection.  If a company wants to work in 27 different member states, it has to apply 27 different conflicting rules.  This costs the business world &euro;2.3 billion per year, which represents a loss of money.  As to what to do, we need to open the market, eliminate the 27 conflicting rules and replace them with a system of one continent, one rule and one regulator and in that way such companies can work.  The data protection rules protect the individual.  That means we must also reinforce the protection of the individual's rights in this system, and we can do both.  We can open the market in an internal market without barriers and better protect the individual.  It is not a case of one or the other; it is one and the other.  Europe is about the economy but it is also about the rights of the citizens.  It is about the free movement of citizens and citizens being protected when they move across borders.  That is exactly what we need to do and to do it well.</p><p> Why can we not have, in terms of governance, a common policy, a foreign policy and a justice policy?  What I am doing in justice is building bridges - bridges between different systems - not to change the system <i>per se </i>but to ensure the systems can function together and that a citizen is not completely lost when he or she crosses a border.</p><p> On the question of moving at great speed on the fiscal treaty and the banking union, one might ask are we not at times moving too quickly and at times too slowly.  The member is right in respect of both.  When we are in a crisis situation, we cannot lead a long discussion on the system of the firefighters to be established.  We need a firefighter in place if the fire has erupted.  That is exactly what we are doing and we have to do it quickly.</p><p> It was decided in June that a banking union would be put in place and that the ESM would lend to banks when we have a common central supervisory system in place.  The Commission put the system on the table on 12 September.  I hope the wish, which was also expressed by the Taoiseach, will come to completion, namely, that the Irish Presidency will start with the banking supervision system in place.  I hope that those who agreed on the necessity to do that very quickly in June will not now disagree behind the scenes and think that we can do it more slowly.  We need all this to be done quickly.  The Commission has put the project on the table.  It is with the European Parliament which has often shown it can act very quickly, mainly on my projects, which sometimes were dealt with from the beginning to the end in nine months, like all good things.  The Parliament can act on this very quickly.  I hope the Council will not hide behind closed doors in order to have more time.</p></speech>

She is carrying out a very important function.  I also compliment the Chairman on his opening remarks, which were interesting.</p><p>  This situation reminds us of a number of matters.  We have more referenda experience in this country than any other member state of European Union.  We have given our approval or disapproval more often than anyone else and usually we have had to go back to the table and repeat the performance if we did not do it right the first time, to such an extent that our citizens are suspicious of us.  They claim now that if we do not get the right response, we will go back to them repeatedly, and that is not good for democracy.</p><p>  However, we passed one referendum which consented to the free movement of people, money, goods and services within the European Union.  That was quite a long time ago.  That was an important one, the implications of which the European Union did not fully examine in terms of what might happen in a crisis.  What happened in the crisis is what we all know about.  It appears, as Deputy Dooley said, that a number of countries were dictating the pace but they were dictating it to the weaker countries with obvious serious political consequences for the weaker countries.  That was very worrying from the point of view of citizens, whom the Commissioner mentioned on a number of occasions, but it had a serious unnerving effect on our people.  Allied to that, we as national parliamentarians had met our colleagues in Germany, France, Denmark, the Netherlands and all the other member states and we found there were expressions of disunity and doubt by the elected members of the national parliaments for several years as to whether the European Union was going in the direction it was intended to go.  We also raised some questions.  The Commissioner mentioned the question of the lack of confidence, and that is from where it came but, more especially, it  came from a lack of unity of purpose.  It was perceived by people throughout  Europe and by the Irish people during the course of the crisis that there was a lack of unity of purpose.  Some countries wanted more of one thing and less of another.  Some people wanted more involvement and integration and other countries wanted less.  The Chairman and members will be aware of a serious issue, namely, that what integration means to many other European countries, especially those which have become accustomed to a federalised system in their own countries, does not necessarily mean the same to us.</p><p>  We should also be careful about citizens' views as expressed to the national elected parliamentarians or to the European Parliament in that there is a big difference.  If we undermine the confidence in the nationally elected parliamentarians, we will indirectly undermine the European process.  Everyone requires greater powers, the European Parliament wants more powers, but what about more responsibility?  What about taking political responsibility for what we do wrong or what we do right, as the case may be?</p> <p> The final point I wish to make is an important one that was raised by the Commissioner.  Nice 1 was about the losing of a Commissioner.  We should never have got to the stage where any country sought or felt they had ownership of a Commissioner.  Ms Reding and all Commissioners are supposed to be equally available to all member states without exception.  Unfortunately, we moved from that to individualisation, which was a major weakness when the crisis came.  I refer to Deputy Dooley&rsquo;s point in that regard.  Some countries felt they were obliged to give leadership because of their size and strength, but it had a seriously debilitating effect on the rest of us.  We must learn from that.</p><p> Let us not forget that we had a European Central Bank, ECB.  We can now ask what it was doing.  It was representative of the eurozone member states but it was representing the European community globally, for the want of a better expression.  It did not do so.  It avoided its responsibilities.  It shied away from the task it was supposed to do and as a result it weakened the European Union and its ability to deal with the crisis.  I could go on about this but the Chairman will be pleased to know I will not.  I have heard this debate for the past ten years at various fora throughout Europe.  There was always talk of the need to do what we should do but we never did it.  We almost paid the ultimate price because there were in Europe among the national parliamentarians in the past five years expressions by people elected to public office that were not in consort with the European ideal.  They were far from it.  We all know who they were.</p><p> As to whether there can ever be a successful European Union without a single currency, I believe there cannot.  It is fundamental to the cohesiveness of what Europe is about.  I say to those who say we can have a separate currency in the United Kingdom and the various other countries, that it will not work.  I am sorry for going on for so long but that is my opinion based on what I have seen over my time in public life.  It is a long time ago now since I first attended a meeting in Luxembourg.</p></speech>

I had the pleasure of being in Luxembourg a couple of weeks ago at a European Court of Justice hearing.  It is a beautiful city.  I did not have enough time to spend there but I will return for a visit.</p><p>  Given Luxembourg&rsquo;s location it is inextricably linked to France, Germany, Holland and Belgium.  This country, which is on the periphery, is linked to the United Kingdom.  I questioned the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, last week about the Future of Europe report and how it plays to euroscepticism within the United Kingdom.  Some newspaper articles suggest that it will lead to the United Kingdom dissociating itself further from the EU.  There are always groups that wish to put the issue to a vote of the people in the United Kingdom and that, accordingly, it would leave the European Union.  I accept reports are discussion documents, they are not binding and Luxembourg's Foreign Minister was part of it, but does the Commissioner accept it will have consequences for this country in terms of our relationship with the United Kingdom?  Does Ms Reding believe that based on the report and the five points made on the treaty of European political union that it would cause a detachment of the United Kingdom from the European Union?</p><p>  In the context of the Future of Europe report, the Commissioner referred to a European army and changing the majority required for decisions.  That is contrary to this country&rsquo;s position on neutrality.  Concerns were raised in previous referenda, for example, in Lisbon 1, where it was stated the treaty would lead to conscription in this country.  Specific reference was made to the issue in protocols prior to Lisbon 2.  The Future of Europe report compiled by Foreign Ministers is a discussion document but it leads to concerns in this country on those issues to which I referred and also in terms of our relationship with the United Kingdom.  I invite a comment on those points.</p></speech>

She is quoted in the Irish media this week as saying Irish people should place their trust in political leaders trying to build a stronger Europe.  Why should people place their trust in a system that has in many cases overseen a collapse in their incomes and is now actively dismantling the social infrastructure that holds the more positive elements of society together in the name of the god of austerity?</p><p>  Ms Reding outlined that never again will a nation's people, as in the case of this country, pay the price for their banks' mistakes.  That is reassuring for many but it is not for those who have to pay for those mistakes.  Is the Commissioner saying that in future the private debt of wealthy individuals, gamblers and speculators will not become the sovereign debt of a country?  That is the message people want to hear.  I do not know anyone who caused this debt or contributed to it.  It was an elite in society that seemed to contribute to it and an elite in Europe seem to come up with the answers to it.  It is not reassuring for those who have children with special needs that cannot get support, for those who are waiting for an operation or a hospital bed, or for those in society whose children go to bed hungry.  I would like to hear the Commissioner say that it will never happen again.</p><p>  In Spain youth unemployment is at 50%.  In this country youth unemployment is at 30% but that is because young people in this country are going to Australia, Canada and other parts of the English speaking world to try to get jobs.  In the constituency I represent many of the young people cannot go to those countries because they cannot gain access to them as they do not have the required educational qualifications.</p><p>  I wish to see a free federation of free people in Europe but I want to see answers coming from Europe.  In Ms Reding's interview with <i>The Irish Times</i> she said that everyone recognised the problem of bank debt relief and that it remained unsolved.  Similar to other senior politicians she said that this country was an exemplar for other stricken countries, that it was going in the right direction.  We have a problem with the direction in which we are going.  Other federations around the world and in Switzerland and the United States have a different opinion on issues such as safety nets for people who have not done well in society and many of the things we hold dear in Europe.  I am concerned about the future of Europe.  It is healthy for citizens to question the direction in which Europe is going.</p></speech>

This fear can develop when the country is bombarded through the media with what is happening.  For instance, I still remember the beach walk between President Sarkozy and Chancellor Merkel in Deauville.  One could ask whether they took decisions at that time.</p> <p>Did they?  Not one of their proposals was put into practice but all the media at the time said that Sarkozy and Merkel were deciding where Europe would go.  That is a problem, and members, as politicians, know about the perceived reality.  The media showed two leaders walking together and taking decisions.  The media did not show that none of those decisions was put into practice.  A great deal is done because of this perception, and this perception is dangerous.  I should not have spoken as a Luxembourger.  As a Commissioner I am no longer a Luxembourger.  I am not speaking about Luxembourgish policy.  I speak about the importance of small nations in this European Union.</p><p> In terms of what the Council is doing, when we reinforce democratic control by parliaments, and by the members as a national parliament, it is for not allowing decision making by big countries against the other countries.  We have to reinforce democratic control in Europe if we do not want that to happen.  We have to ensure the decisions are not taken on an intergovernmental level but on a European Union level because the European Union always gives a certain power of co-decision to the smaller nations.  What is dangerous is if this Europe drifts towards intergovernmental decision making.</p><p> Deputy Durkan spoke about a lack of unity of purpose.  In a large European Union such as we have now with 27 member states, with their different historic and economic development backgrounds, we do not always have the same purpose in terms of what a Government can do, and what this Government can do, and its position in the European Union.  It was much easier to agree on aims when we were a smaller European Union.  That is more difficult today, and because of the political, cultural and historical diversity sitting in the Council and also in the European Parliament, control mechanisms have to be reinforced.  That is the only way out.  The control mechanisms are at the end of a process, but the process has to be democratic.</p><p> In this Parliament, and in the European Parliament also, the minorities have the possibility to express themselves, even those who do not agree with building a common Europe, but the small countries have the possibility also to find allies to show the way.  The future of Europe report is a welcome discussion document.  It contains many points with which I agree.  There are others with which I have difficulties but that is exactly what we should speak about.  Where are we heading?  What do we want to share in our common future?  What do we not want to share and leave instead at the national or even the regional level?  That is what we need to discuss.</p><p> I believe that our goal is to have one currency for all member states, but then comes the moment - I have put this in my five point plan for which I was nearly torn to pieces, so to speak, in the members' neighbouring country, which it knows so well - when the question must be asked whether we want to participate in that.  There should be no more cherry-picking but we must decide whether that is our common future and whether we want to be in or out.  We have had this discussion previously and I hope we can have this discussion in the future.</p><p> I do not want to interfere with this country's specific relationship with its neighbour and how it will take its decisions, for instance, in the field of justice where, increasingly, we do important work together without dismantling the national justice systems but which is in the interest of our citizens.  Does this country want to participate or not?  That is a decision it has to take; no one else can take it.  It must also clarify how it wants to exercise its relationships with its neighbours.  I will leave that to the wisdom of the Irish people and their elected representatives.</p><p> Dismantling the social system is something I hear often.  What about the solidarity that was shown to this country by the European system in past decades?  For instance, in recent years, the Structural Fund and regional funds pumped &euro;751 million into this country.  That is European solidarity.  Much can be said about Europe, that it is not perfect here or there, but not to be a solidarity model would be against any reality on the ground.</p><p> What did we do in recent months, for instance, when we saw that the banks were in trouble, not only in this country but also in many other countries?  They are no longer lending to the real economy, although we believe the main purpose of a bank is to lend to the real economy.  The European Investment Bank came in and put money on the table to ensure that money could be given to the small and medium-sized businesses, SMEs, which are the backbone of our industrial development.  While it is not possible for the time being to have an agreement on euro bonds, the Commission came out with project bonds to the value of several billion euro for electricity, transport and broadband infrastructure which we put on the table to proceed in a concrete way.  That is what we should do.  We should not have ideological fights but see in a realistic way what we can do to solve the problem and make Europe a safe place for those Europeans who want to share a common future.  We will not force anyone to be in Europe or to share the common future.</p><p> On the "F" word, I was told I must not speak about a federation in Ireland.  I will speak about a federation because for me, with all I believe in politics and the way societies work, a federation could be a solution.  What is a federation?  A federation does certain things together and leaves other things to the national responsibility.  We have several federations in Europe.  Germany is a federation, with power of the lender.  Switzerland is a federation.  The United States is a federation.</p> <p>Why should that be bad?  Let us at least think about how we can proceed and about what name we will give to what we do.  That can be discussed also.  I would like to have a political union and I would have no problem calling it a federation.  This is on the table to be discussed.  This time, it is to be discussed with our citizens.  I am ready to go out to do so.  As I told members, tomorrow I will be in the south of Spain to discuss the matter with some mayors and the presidents of the regions of all European countries because I believe everybody, including those elected at local and national levels and not only those who are elected at European level, must accept responsibility.</p></speech>

I will make a brief opening statement outlining our position on the selection panel and the appointment of the members of the proposed new Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  My four colleagues, Professor Gerard Quinn, Dr Mary Keys, Professor Gerry Whyte and Ms Sylda Langford, shall in turn make individual statements about their professional involvement in the field of human rights and equality generally.  We will then answer any questions that members have which are within our capacity and remit to answer.</p><p>  Each of us was approached individually by the Department of Justice and Equality over the last number of months to serve as a member of the selection panel for the proposed new IHREC, and each of us agreed to so serve.  Our understanding was, and is, that the appointment process would be fully independent and that only in exceptional circumstances, and with reasons given, would the Government refuse to accept a selection panel nomination to the commission.  The committee is aware that this marks a significant change from previous practice, under which the Government could pick and choose from a slate of candidates proffered by the selection panel.  We had also noted the Minister for Justice and Equality's stated intention to abide by the UN Paris Principles in ensuring the independence and effectiveness of the future commission.</p><p>  In late July, we met for the first time as a group with two Department of Justice and Equality officials and discussed in general terms the selection process and certain other issues around the proposed creation of the new body.  Some of those issues were not within our strict remit but were of interest none the less because of our individual and collective interest in the need to create a well-functioning and effective new institution.  Some concerns were expressed by the panel about the absence of any public announcement of our appointment and the senior official at the meeting said that would be done in a number of days, which it was.  We concluded the meeting by agreeing a date in early September when the work of the selection panel would formally begin.  The Department would have no role other than to provide an official to a panel secretariat.  I had also agreed to appoint an official from my office to the secretariat.</p><p>  On the following day, we came into possession of a letter that had been sent earlier in July to the Minister for Justice and Equality by the UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights in response to the Minister's request for observations on the general scheme of the IHREC Bill.  The letter, <i>inter alia</i>, expressed concerns about the transparency of the appointment process for the selection panel.  In view of those concerns, the panel members decided unanimously to step aside until further clarity on this matter had been achieved.  We wrote to the Minister accordingly.</p><p>  On 6 September, at his invitation, the panel met with the Minister, the Secretary General of the Department and a number of other officials.  The Minister expressed his concern at the delay in making appointments to the interim bodies and stated that the process of consultation with the UN Deputy High Commissioner was ongoing.  He stated his commitment to the creation of an independent, effective commission and pointed out the sections of the general scheme which, he said, enhanced the independence of the new body as compared with the legislative provisions governing the outgoing Irish Human Rights Commission in particular.</p><p>  The panel outlined our concern about the apparent disquiet of the UN Deputy High Commissioner about the appointment of the selection panel and said that it was our wish that the Oireachtas, through this committee, would satisfy itself that our appointment was transparent and that we would act independently.  We pointed out, and the Minister agreed, that this approach accords with the so-called Belgrade Principles on the relationship between national humans rights institutions and parliaments, drawn up earlier this year, which have at their core the desire to deepen the engagement of parliament in the creation and the work of human rights institutions.  That is why we are appearing before the committee today.</p><p>  No doubt the committee will have questions about the way in which we might approach our work if our appointment is approved by it.  We have not yet had the opportunity to have substantial discussion about this.  The guidelines in the general scheme and those put forward by the review group are quite vague but it is very clear to us is that there is a strong desire for some degree of public consultation around the work.  There is undoubtedly pressure to have the interim commission appointed and the logistics of public consultation will have to be worked out.  However, I speak for all of my colleagues when I say that we have a very strong sense of the importance of the task.  Any human rights and equality commission is only as good as its commissioners.  Yes, expertise is important, but equally so is the ability to be effective and to know how to use hard and soft power to persuade Governments to live up to their legal and other responsibilities on human rights and equality.  We intend to cast a very wide net in order to secure a highly skilled and effective commission, headed by an outstanding chief commissioner.  It is also important to appoint a balanced commission that works closely and harmoniously as a team.</p><p>  I will now briefly outline my own involvement in this area before inviting my colleagues to speak.  I have been the Ombudsman and Information Commissioner since June 2003 and am midway through my second term of office.  Prior to that I was a political journalist and author.  I also serve as an <i>ex officio</i> member of the Standards in Public Office Commission, the Commission for Public Service Appointments and, when they are operational, on the Constituency Commission and the Referendum Commission.  I am also the Commissioner for Environmental Information.  The institution of the Ombudsman is a recognised human rights body and my office has regular engagement with similar international bodies and with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.  In 2009, I was awarded an honorary doctorate in laws from the National University of Ireland in recognition of my work in the broad area of human rights through my journalism and my work as Ombudsman.  I also serve on the international advisory board of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University and was the first Irish chairperson of the British and Irish Ombudsman Association.</p></speech>

I am a lecturer in law at the National University of Ireland, Galway, and I lecture mainly in the areas of disability law, mental health law and human rights.  I have been a member of the Mental Health Commission for five years, and was reappointed again this year to represent the public interest on the commission.  I was also involved in another statutory body, the National Disability Authority, and in mental health advisory groups over a six-year period, which ended two years ago.  I am involved with community groups and NGOs in disseminating legal information, particularly on disability and mental health law.  Examples include my presence on the board of the Brothers of Charity Services in Galway, on the Jigsaw group, which works in the area of youth mental health, and a wide range of other groups that contribute to research interests in NGOs.</p> <p>I contribute on an ongoing basis to Amnesty.  I am a former psychiatric social worker and have front-line experience and have worked with the Traveller community.  That has driven my ambition for human rights and equality in the dissemination of information to the people who use services but also for front line staff.  I am very aware of the lack of that and how it impacts on the people who are delivering and involved in services to our community.  </p></speech>

I am a post-graduate student of University College Cork and the London School of Economics where I had a background in social policy and social work.  I have personal experience of front-line and delivery of child care services, dealing with the needs of people who are disadvantaged in society and also dealing with the impact of wider social and economic policies on such people.  I acquired much of my experience in my working life as a public servant, a civil servant and a member of various voluntary organisations.  I have been retired for three years and continue to be involved in a voluntary capacity in various activities relevant to my experience.</p><p>  The background details of my working life are as follows.  I worked in the then Eastern Health Board in the area of child protection.  I was an investigator in the Office of the Ombudsman.  I worked in the then Department of Social Welfare, where I was involved in EU poverty programmes, MABS and the community development programme for family resource centres.  I also carried management responsibility for the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  I worked in the then Department of Equality and Law Reform where I had responsibility for the equality area, which included policy, legislation and international work.  I had management of the development of equal status policies and legislation.  This involved consultation with NGOs and representatives of civil society on the nine grounds of anti-discrimination under the Equal Status Act.</p><p>  On the international front, I was the senior official on the Irish delegations to the UN General Assembly special session known as Beijing +5 on gender issues.  I was at the World Conference against Racism in Durban in 2001 and I also led on the UN committee on economic, social and cultural rights when Ireland presented its second report on the international covenant in economic, social and cultural rights.  While I worked in the Department of justice, I managed a review of youth justice services, where we had concerns about young people in trouble with the law and in detention centres.  As a result the Government establish the Irish Youth Justice Service.</p><p>  My last job as a civil servant was in the office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, where I helped develop programmes for improving equal opportunities for children, families and young people.  I am currently the chairperson of the Citizens Information Board, which has responsibility for citizens information centres, MABS and the National Disability Advocacy Service.  As a member of the children's detention school board, I have concerns about trying to improve the lot of the most vulnerable children in those schools.  I was a member of the advisory board of We The People and I am involved with Limerick regeneration as chairperson of a joint committee of statutory and philanthropic funders.  I have worked as a volunteer counsellor with the marriage counselling service and also with Parentline.  I am delighted with the honour of being asked to be involved in this process.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-25a.321" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Gerard Quinn" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2012092500005#D00400"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for inviting me here today.  I feel very honoured and humbled to present myself at this meeting which is essentially a confirmation hearing.  It is incredibly important that the enhanced role of Parliament is not just a nice thing but is vital to enhance the democratic legitimacy and the transparency of our processes going forward.  I have provided a detailed one page r&eacute;sum&eacute;.  I do not intend to dwell on it.  I will pick out three points that may be of relevance in the committee's deliberations about suitability for confirmation.</p><p>  I spent about six to seven years as first vice president of the Committee of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in the Council of Europe, which is a treaty monitoring body that essentially watches over the implementation of a Council of Europe Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights - something that is more important in Ireland in the vastly changed circumstances.  I spent quite a period working at European level.  I was a researcher in the EU <font color="#222222">'</font><i><font color="#222222">Comit&eacute; des Sages</font></i><font color="#222222">'</font> in the 1990s, reflecting on the future of human rights in the European Union.  I was a temporary civil servant in the European Commission working on equal opportunities, law and policy.  I have directed many research networks for the European Commission and recently produced a report with the EU Fundamental Rights Agency on the status of people with intellectual disabilities in Europe.  I led the delegation of Rehabilitation International in the UN in the drafting of the new UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities.</p><p>  In terms of my engagement with the issues in Ireland, I was a member of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities in the 1990s.  I was for a period director of research at the Government's Law Reform Commission.  I was a member of the Irish Human Rights Commission for two terms and in January this year I had the great honour of being appointed to the Council of State by President Michael D. Higgins.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-25a.322" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Gerard Whyte" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2012092500005#D00500"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for this opportunity to speak briefly about my experience and expertise in this particular task.  This expertise and experience falls into three categories.  First, my academic work.  I am a professor of law at Trinity College Dublin with a particular interest in Irish constitutional law, with a particular focus on the fundamental rights provisions, including protection for socio-economic rights.  I also teach and research in an area called public interest law which examines how the law may be used to protect the interests of minority groups.  In that capacity I have engaged in research on the rights of people with disabilities, Travellers, children with learning difficulties and social welfare claimants.  I have also written on the area of access to legal justice and general equality in social welfare matters.</p><p>  The second context in which I refer to my experience relates to my voluntary work with a number of NGOs working mainly in the area of social exclusion.  I have served on the management boards of the Northside Community Law Centre and am currently involved with the Mercy Law Resource Centre.  I have also worked fairly extensively with NGOs such as the Free Legal Advice Centres, the Irish Traveller Movement and Amnesty, both in relation to individual cases and on particular projects.  I was also a member of the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace for a number of years.  </p><p>  Finally, I will note my work with some public bodies.  I was a ministerial appointee to the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction and I was also appointed to the steering group on the Irish Council for People with Disabilities.  That latter appointment, in particular, gave me insights into the position of people with disabilities.  I was also retained by the Department of Social Protection to do some work on the compliance of the social welfare code with the principle of equality.</p></speech>

I now invite members to ask questions.  I call Deputy Mac Lochlainn and Senators Bacik and Zappone.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-25a.324" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/998" speakername="P&aacute;draig MacLochlainn" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2012092500005#D00700"><p>I thank the panel for their presentations.  It is an honour for me to have such an esteemed group of people making the very important decision as to who will oversee and ensure that those who are most vulnerable in our society have their rights enshrined in compliance with our responsibility under international law.  I am immensely impressed with the calibre of the panel and I have no doubt that the outcome will be an equally impressive commission, when it is appointed.</p><p>  In recent years groups that were advocating on behalf of disabled persons, Travellers and others have seen their allocations from the State reduced dramatically.  We know there was considerable controversy, with high profile and respected personnel resigning from senior positions in protest.  It fundamentally undermined their work and their ability to defend the interests of those who are most vulnerable in our society.  Is the panel satisfied that the appropriate financial resources will be provided to the commission to carry out its very important work?  Are the members satisfied the commission will have the necessary independence from Government?</p> <p>I commend the members of the selection panel on their insistence on coming before the joint committee.  Democratic legitimacy and transparency are essential elements of the selection and appointment process.  As part of the ongoing engagement between the Irish Human Rights Commission and the joint committee, it will be critical to examine the plans of the new commission and make sure it has the resources and capacity it needs to ensure Ireland complies with its international responsibilities.  For example, the failure to ratify many of the international agreements we have signed must be addressed.  Those are my concerns. </p><p> Professor Quinn spoke of being humbled.  I am humbled to have the members of such an immensely capable and appropriate panel before us.  While I have no doubt the outcome of its work will be excellent, I would like to learn more about the issues of resources, capacity and independence as well as accountability to the Oireachtas.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-25a.326" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emily O'Reilly" time="16:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2012092500006#E00200"><p>I thank Deputy Mac Lochlainn for his comments.  The Deputy highlighted two interesting and critical areas.  The issue here is how one makes sure the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission will be effective and do what it is supposed to do, namely, protect and promote human rights and equality in this country.  There is only so much the selection panel can do - if it is approved by the joint committee - but we will do our bit and ensure, in as far as we can, that the commission will be effective.</p><p>  The issue of resources is one for the Government and, critically, Parliament.  The Government has indicated it intends to establish a commission that will be resourced and effective.  However, as members are aware, this can only be achieved through the expertise and effectiveness of the commission and the support the Government gives it.  The only way the Government can be encouraged to provide the commission with the necessary support is through Parliament.  This is where the role of the joint committee comes in as this role is not specifically one for the selection panel, although we will do our bit in ensuring, in so far as we can, that the commission appointed by the Government will be as effective as possible in terms of its expertise and ability, if one likes, to work the system, be effective and be listened to.  After that, it is very much a question for Parliament and the political will of the Government.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-25a.327" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1176" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="16:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2012092500006#E00300"><p>I welcome the members of the selection panel and I am most appreciative that all of them have come before the joint committee.  I concur with many of the comments made by Deputy Mac Lochlainn.  We are all trying to get this right and the panel is before us because its members are also trying to get it right.  I appreciate the commitment they and the Minister have shown and the leadership the Chairman has provided as we look for new ways to deepen the engagement of Parliament and, in this context, the committee with the establishment and operations of the new commission.</p><p>  Most members of the selection panel will be aware that I was a member of the Irish Human Rights Commission and experienced some of the difficulties that occurred in its early days.  We are all trying to avoid a repeat of that. </p><p>  The witnesses provided an effective presentation of their experience and credentials.  I am most impressed with their expertise and all that they bring to this role, both as a group and individually.  They may have noticed that one of the first recommendations the joint committee made to the Minister was to achieve gender balance when appointing the selection panel.  I am particularly appreciative that this has been achieved.</p><p>  I hold the members of the panel in high regard, having worked with many of them previously.  They bring expertise in law, academia, research, policy and management expertise and have front-line experience.  They have also demonstrated independence in much of their work, have engaged with members of the public and have acquired experience at European and United Nations level.  The panel contains a lovely mixture of experience on the equality and human rights sides.  In light of what they bring individually and as a group and as the choice of the Minister, the panel has a terrific mix and I strongly believe it will do its utmost to ensure the independence and effectiveness of the new Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission. </p><p>  Given the different language used in this regard, I am not sure whether the role of the joint committee is to satisfy itself that the appointment of the selection panel was transparent and its members will act independently, or approve its appointment.  The briefing provided to members suggests we will exercise oversight of the ongoing appointment process to ensure transparency and independence.  The Ombudsman indicated that our role is one of approving the panel.  Perhaps our role is to engage in an exchange and confirm and note our own sense of what the panel presents and how effective it can be.  The witnesses are free to comment in this regard.</p><p>  As we move forward, I understand that an interim arrangement is to apply to the selection and appointment of commissioners, with some of them to be appointed to the Irish Human Rights Commission while others are to be appointed to the Equality Authority.  How will this process work?  Does the panel envisage having ongoing communications with the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights?</p><p>  What are the panel's thoughts on the criteria for selecting commissioners?  While the selection process has not yet commenced, do members of the panel have any thoughts they wish to share on how the public could be involved in the process?</p></speech>

It is our understanding that we will be tasked with making recommendations in respect of the new or joint body and we will advance 12 names to the Government for appointment.  Time is obviously pressing.  While the heads of the Bill have been produced, the actual Bill has not yet been produced.  It is our understanding that we will do this work at this point but that the legislation, when it comes to the Oireachtas, will include what I describe as a "bridging clause" which would, in a sense, retrospectively validate what we have done.  This will allow us to do this work ahead of the legislation being enacted.  We have had some conversations about this with the Department and discussed some issues that may arise in relation to the appointment of the interim bodies.  That is how we see our role.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-25a.329" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Gerard Quinn" time="16:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2012092500006#E00500"><p>I will revert to one or two points raised, in particular by Deputy Mac Lochlainn, especially on the issue of resources.  This pushed in me a response which is not necessarily tied to the question of resources for the new commission.  It is merely the observation, one that the panel has yet to share collectively, that the Ireland of 2001, when the first Irish Human Rights Commission was appointed, was vastly different from the Ireland of 2012.  The outgoing commission did much valuable work exploring the area of economic, social and cultural rights.  I will venture a personal opinion, while offering the heavy caveat that the panel has yet to discuss this issue, that the question of social justice and, in particular, principles placing a floor beneath regression, should be a main concern for the next commission.  This may play on our minds in terms of the profile of the kind of person or persons we would like to see on the commission.</p><p>  The issue of appointment criteria was raised.  Again, I include a heavy caveat that the selection panel has yet to have an in-depth substantive discussion on this matter.  However, as a crude, ready reckoner in my own mind, what I will look for is real competence with respect to international human rights law. </p> <p>This is pretty scarce on the ground, but at least we would have some presence in that regard on the commission.  We would need to have representatives also of social forces in the country.  It is critically important that it be a broad church rather than a narrow one.  I would also look for evidence or proof of acumen, a proven track record in getting the job done and, in particular, making the case for reformed government, because the case must be made in a way that is cogent and cohesive.  This is my response in substance.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-25a.331" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emily O'Reilly" time="16:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2012092500007#F00200"><p>I used the expression "casting the net wide".  We have had a brief discussion on this and we have been looking at ways of doing that.  We do not want the selection to be just a rounding up of the usual suspects or of the usual suspects thinking they are the only people in the frame for this.  We want it to be so widely known that we are looking for potential commissioners that everybody with a vital engagement with these issues knows about it and sees himself or herself in that frame.  We want it so that they need not think that because they are not an academic or a lawyer, they could not possibly be part of it.</p><p>  We will look at ways to ensure that engagement happens and that the net is cast as wide as possible.  For example, we intend using social media and inviting younger people to participate.  There is no reason that particular part of the demographic cannot be reflected also.  We know there is a certain urgency with regard to doing this, but we really want to do it well and do not want people to have preconceptions about the sort of people who, potentially, will end up on the commission.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-25a.332" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1148" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="16:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2012092500007#F00300"><p>I thank our witnesses for their presentations.  There is no doubt regarding the high calibre of the panel nor about the high level of their CVs and experience.  I speak as somebody who knows several members of the panel as colleagues and friends, but we are very impressed by the expertise they bring to the panel process.  The fact they stood aside as a group when they had a doubt about the method of their selection, confirmed for me the high status they have as a group of people who are extremely well equipped to choose the new commissioners.</p><p>  This committee had public hearings on 14 July on the heads of the Bill and at that hearing some concerns were expressed regarding the method of selection of the panel.  The issue of the Paris Principles was raised and, in particular, the issue of the role of Parliament and of the Oireachtas committee in scrutinising appointments to both the panel and the commission.  We teased that out in some detail with the NGOs before the committee and referred to it in our report.  The fact the panel has specifically looked for a stronger role for Parliament is a good indication of the understanding all the panel members have of the need for democratic legitimacy.  </p><p>  One of the things on which this committee and all of the NGOs agreed was that the process Ms O'Reilly heads is infinitely better and more transparent than the appointments process for the previous human rights commission.  Senator Zappone referred to some of the controversy around that and we are all conscious of that.  There is no doubt the issue of scrutiny is very important, but if we have the power of approval - I am not sure we do - undoubtedly we approve the appointment of the five members of the panel.</p><p>  The questions I have concern the future.  The panel stood aside until further clarity on the issue of the UN deputy commissioner's comments had been achieved, but now it is back in and we are delighted it is here before us.  We have been briefed on the fact that the process is now under way and that after this public hearing with the committee, there will be continued engagement with the Department of Justice and Equality and the Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights.  Presumably, the panel will have ongoing discussions with these.  Can we have some more clarity on that process?</p><p>  Mention has been made of the interim commission and much of what has been done will require retrospective approval.  Is the panel as a group satisfied with the process that has been agreed?</p></speech>

When we met with the Minister two weeks ago, he shared with us the response he had made to the UN Deputy High Commissioner in that regard.  He has agreed to keep us informed of the ongoing conversation and I believe it is important we are kept aware of that so that we can deal with any issues that directly affect us.</p><p>  I am not sure whether the committee will approve us or not, but when I became Ombudsman, I learned a lot of public administration phrases, one of which was "running the rule over".  I think what the committee is doing is running the rule over us.</p></speech>

I believe there will be quite an amount of work in designing the process and getting it right.  There will be a parallel process between moving to select the commissioners and involving in public engagement around that.  We will not be looking for specific names, but we want an idea from the public of the sort of well-functioning, effective commission that should be put in place.  After that, as Professor Whyte has indicated, one commission will be appointed.  It will be appointed initially to the Equality Authority and then there will be a process of convergence.  I imagine this committee will be involved in that also.  It is all a bit of a work in progress currently.</p></speech>

They stem from the idea that there is a bit of a gap between certain human rights institutions and their effectiveness in terms of the government doing what they would like them to do.  Part of the reason for this gap or flaw in the architecture has been identified as the fact that parliaments are not sufficiently engaged with the institutions.  If there is greater parliamentary engagement, there is a greater sense of ownership.  Therefore, the idea is that parliament will help to support the human rights commission by encouraging and putting pressure on governments to do what they can.  That is where we come from in terms of our approach.</p></speech>

I thank the panel and wish it the best.  With regard to head 13 of the draft Bill, is the panel satisfied with the method of selection for the commission?  It has been pointed out and we are all conscious that it states the Government shall accept the recommendation of the selection panel and goes on to give exceptional circumstances.  There is also provision for a resolution passed by the D&aacute;il and Seanad prior to the actual appointment.  Is the panel satisfied the stages envisaged in head 13 are sufficient?  I do not know whether the panel has a chance to examine the heads.  Will it have any input into the final version of the Bill?</p></speech>

Looking at the heads of the Bill, I was satisfied that our recommendations will be fairly effective and that they will be taken on board by the Government in selecting the human rights and equality commission, unless there are exceptional circumstances.  One could envisage a situation in which the Government might have information we would not have which might call into question the appropriateness of a particular appointment.  However, in that regard, the Government must make the case to us.  If we are not satisfied with the case, we can return the matter to the Government and stand over our original decision.</p><p>  Personally, I feel there is sufficient independence in the process for the selection panel for me to feel comfortable in agreeing to act in this capacity.  I was also reassured when I heard who the other four members of the panel were.</p></speech>

One often wishes one was working in finance, business or on the legal side as that is always considered important.  Therefore, the Belgrade Principles are the most important part of this.</p> <p>Human rights and equality work is more about the humdrum, everyday aspects of people's lives.  That is where one needs the support of Parliament and one needs dialogue and transparency.  The people who work in that area need support.  Just to keep society interested in that area can be a challenge in itself.  I welcome the Belgrade Principles and the fact that Parliament will have a role in human rights and equality into the future.</p></speech>

I welcome the witnesses and thank them for coming.  I wish to make an observation, if I may.  I note the immense qualifications of all who have been chosen to sit on the selection panel.  It is very important that the Parliament is seen to ensure that there is openness and transparency and that those who are making the selection are not doing so for political reasons.  That is why it is important that this particular panel of people are independent and highly qualified.  I echo the point made by Senator Bacik that when there was a question over that independence and the role of the selection panel, it stepped back immediately, which was good.  It indicates the degree of seriousness with which the panel is approaching this process and members should be complimented for that.</p><p>  The witnesses have dealt with the point I was going to raise regarding the process but perhaps they might allude to any form of timeline, or take a poke at it, as one might say. </p></speech>

As I just said to Senator Bacik, the design of this will be important.  We will endeavour to do this as speedily as possible over the next few months but we really feel that the onus is on us to get it right.  Once we get the design element done, then we can push ahead and, hopefully, work quite speedily.  Obviously we must consider what the architecture of the process is going to be and we must give time for people, through the public forums, to respond to us and also to apply for the positions.  We must give the applications a certain amount of time and then the interview process will follow.  It will take a couple of months, I would imagine.</p></speech>

What is the range of engagement with the obvious stakeholders?  There is a plethora of NGOs operating across Ireland who are profoundly interested in, and hopeful about, this commission.  Ms O'Reilly referred earlier to a delay with the publicity and the appointment of the panel.  Is she satisfied that she has sufficient resources now to get out there and publicise the commission and actively engage with the NGOs, to encourage them to put relevant people forward for selection?</p></speech>

That is going to be an important part of the process.  There has been a lot of engagement around this process and we read a lot of the submissions that were made to the review group and so forth.  It is our intention that everybody who needs to know about the commission, for the sake of the public interest, will know about it.  Our first meeting will focus on how we do that.  My office will give resources to it.  An official from the Department of Justice and Equality will be acting in the secretariat.  Some of my officials have become very adept at social media, as we have moved into that area, because they are the way people converse and communicate now.  Social media will be a very important part of the process.  All I can do is assure the Deputy that it is our intention to reach out as far as we can.</p></speech>

The first one relates to Ms O'Reilly's opening statement in which she spoke about the commission being headed by an outstanding chief commissioner.  Has she had any thoughts or discussions about designing the criteria for the selection of the chief commissioner, as distinct from other commissioners?  That was not really discussed in the heads of the Bill.</p></speech>

We must decide whether people should apply to be members of the commission and articulate their interest in becoming chief commissioner or whether we have a separate application process for that position.  We do not know yet.  Equally, there is an issue around who applies for these positions and whether people expect to be tapped on the shoulder.  How do we access people who might be exceptionally good but may not want to go through the application process?  It is a bit of a conundrum and we do not have the answer to it because we must be very transparent.  That is still in the discussion pot.</p></speech>

Most of those who came before us said that was in conflict with the Paris Principles.  I also note that the communiqu&eacute; from the Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights, which Ms O'Reilly considered and which was probably the primary reason for her stepping aside, raises a similar question about that particular head and the transparency and independence in the establishment of the commission if it is contained in the final Bill.

Some people have suggested that the inclusion of more specific criteria in the Bill to guide the panel in its selection might be helpful.  What is the panel's view?

One could fall into that trap by itemising the particular expertise one should have.  In fact, human rights belongs to the people and therefore it is from the people we should seek leadership.  If one has expertise in international human rights it would be an added bonus.  To ensure the organic integrity of the process we should be reaching abroad.</p></speech>

This is new for all of us.  We are running the rule over it and feeling our way somewhat.  Thus far, the process has been transparent.  We have seen the heads of the Bill and we have engaged with NGOs and others.  We sought submissions and so on.  It was refreshing for all of us to have this engagement.  This is a further step along the road today and it has been refreshing.</p><p>  Reference has been made to the role of Parliament and the Belgrade principles.  I have read the principles and they are rather progressive.  They represent an exciting development for the Parliament as well.</p><p>  Since this committee was formed the Minister for Justice and Equality has been sending us heads of Bills and draft Bills.  This is a new process for us.  It is exciting and we are getting a great deal more work.  We do not complain because this is what we are here to do.  We should be a part of the legislative process at an early stage and at all stages rather than having a Bill presented as a<i> fait accompli</i>, which was the case in the past.  This is new and exciting.</p><p>  It is important that the process is transparent and is seen to be transparent.  I agree with my colleagues who congratulated those on the panel for standing aside when there was a doubt.  We do not want to have doubts arising at any stage, especially at a later stage when the panel is doing the important work of appointing commissioners.  That should be done without a shadow of a doubt.  I am satisfied, as are my colleagues, that this will be the case, because the members of the panel are independent individuals and they have shown themselves to be part of an independent panel.  This is what we want and I speak for the committee when I say as much.  I congratulate the panel in this regard.</p><p>  I am also pleased with the notion of spreading the net as wide as possible, to use the term of the Ombudsman.  As a result of this process there will be a public awareness of the commission, which is important.  Professor Quinn noted that human rights belongs to the people.  It would be useful if the panel could raise awareness of the work of the commission, its role and formulation.  There is a danger of commissions becoming somewhat elite and the ordinary person may believe he or she cannot engage because those involved are so important with the title of &quot;Commissioner&quot;.  We should watch out for this and it should not be allowed to happen.</p><p>  I wish to ask Professor Quinn about one remark which I found intriguing.  He referred to the idea of placing a floor beneath regression.  Will you expand on this?</p></speech>

It is purely a personal view but I believe it would be an excellent project for any incoming commission to articulate these principles with clarity.  My personal faith - it may be blind faith - is that if people see that there is transparency and some attempt to set bounds beneath which people cannot fall, then they are willing to accept more of the necessary constraints that we all need to move forward.</p></speech>

I know the media are watching and I thank them for their support.  This issue has received some positive coverage and I encourage the media to do its part in spreading the word about what is taking place here, which is rather exciting.  This concludes the engagement with the selection panel.  Is it agreed that the committee will inform the Minister that we have concluded our discussion and that we will forward a copy of the transcript of the meeting to the Minister for his information?  Agreed.  I thank those on the selection panel for their attendance today and for assisting us in our deliberations.  They have an important task ahead and we invite them to resume this important task.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I wish them every success.</p></speech>
