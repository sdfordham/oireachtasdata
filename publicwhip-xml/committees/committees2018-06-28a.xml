We will certainly speak about that RT&Eacute; correspondence.  I turn now to correspondence.</p><p>Category A is briefing documents and opening statements.  First is No. 1415A from Ms Brenda McVeigh of the Tax Appeals Commission and is a briefing note for today's meeting.  We note and publish it.  No. 1420A is from Niall Cody, Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, and is a briefing note for today's meeting.  We note and publish that.  No. 1431A is from Mark O'Mahoney, commissioner at the Tax Appeals Commission, and is an opening statement for today's meeting.  We note and publish that.  No. 1434A is from Niall Cody, Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, and is also opening statement for today's meeting.  We note and publish that.</p><p> Category B is correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers following up on previous meetings.  The first item is held over from the previous meeting.  Some Deputies were not present and asked for documentation and correspondence to be held over.  The first item is No. 1371B from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, in response to a committee request to clarify the process and criteria for designation as a technological university, in particular stage 3 of that process in 2014 regarding the Munster technological university consortium.  We note that correspondence as published.</p><p> The next item is No. 1380B from Dr. Graham Love, chief executive of the Higher Education Authority, dated 13 June and providing follow-up notes requested by the committee on the cost of the Munster technological university merger to include a table setting out the figures; the borrowings and funding of institutes of technology, any changes that may happen following the transition to technological university status and how this compares with existing universities; and the various skills mixes of the boards and governing bodies of the third level institutions.  Can we note and publish that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-28a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018062800002#B00200"><p>I have a related issue on the HEA which is not on correspondence but is one which I have raised before.  This is the HEA report on Waterford Institute of Technology.  I received correspondence personally from the Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, and I was in contact with some of the officials of that trade union.  A number of current staff members met the author of the report, and while I do not know whether what they said would be considered protected disclosures, they feel vulnerable in the sense that drafts of the report have been given to individuals within the institute of technology.  It might be easy for individuals and management to discover who exactly said what to the author of the report.  Given that there is a delay in the publication of the report, they feel a bit let down as well as apprehensive and nervous at having been left hanging.  It would be appropriate for the committee to write to the HEA outlining that.  I asked the TUI to write directly to this committee and, if it has not done so, that is a matter for it.  It has written directly to me, however, and I can send on a copy of the letter.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-28a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018062800002#B00400"><p>They are genuine concerns.  More than 50 people were involved, some of whom have left the organisation and some of whom still work there.  Some of them are going for interviews for promotion.  Given that they spoke to Mr. McLoone and provided him with information, they feel vulnerable.  It is something we did not raise with Dr. Love when he was here.  It was one of the concerns I did not raise with him, at least.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-28a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018062800002#B00500"><p>We will also ask for a timeline on the report.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-28a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018062800002#B00600"><p>Another issue we were to come back to under that heading involved Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board.  In the past week or so, there was a television programme which outlined some of the procurement issues there.  Some of those will fall under a criminal investigation.  Some of the issues, however, will not.  Certainly, I am picking up deep concern about the waste of public funds in a sector that is under pressure.  People are being asked to pay voluntary fees while others are having meetings at the K Club.  That is how people are, understandably, absorbing what is happening.  We need to determine those aspects of it that have been referred to the Garda and will be investigated so that we can come back to this issue because it is not just about Kildare and Wicklow ETB but the oversight by the Department in the context of the historical connection.  A previous report was done and the oversight simply was not there.  We cannot leave that one, although I accept that some of it is not within our remit because it has been referred to the Garda.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-28a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018062800002#B00800"><p>There is another thing in relation to the HEA.  I have just looked at the transcript of our meeting with the HEA and I have a concern about the way in which it is managing protected disclosures and how the various institutions under its remit are handling such disclosures.  I flag to the committee that this is something we may wish to come back to.  I am due to have a conversation with Dr. Love.  In fact, I have been trying to have it for the last week but we have not been able to talk.  I have a concern that there is an issue here about historical disclosures which should be interpreted as disclosures but which are, perhaps conveniently, not being.  I record that I believe I may have to come back to this issue in the coming weeks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-28a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018062800002#B00900"><p>We will have a discussion on protected disclosures during the course of correspondence as there are one or two items there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-28a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018062800002#B01000"><p>I know that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-28a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018062800002#B01100"><p>There is a big picture here on protected disclosures so we will have a chat on that in a few minutes.  We will write to Dr. Love on that.  We will also write to the Department regarding where we are on the Kildare and Wicklow ETB.</p><p>Next is No. 1385B which is held over from the previous meeting, is dated 15 June, and is from the director general of RT&Eacute; in response to an email received from an individual querying information provided to the committee regarding the possibility of an RT&Eacute; 2+1 channel.  Ms Forbes clarifies that RT&Eacute; 2+1 as a channel does not exist.  We have a separate item of correspondence from Mark Griffin which I will put on the screen.  It is No. 1421B.  He is the Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  His correspondence on the exact same issue is dated 22 June as departmental officials were here that day.  He states:</p><blockquote>I refer to the letter from the committee dated 18 June in relation to a letter from Ms Patricia Cronin, Assistant Secretary of the Department, which was discussed at the committee's meeting on 14 June.  At the committee's meeting on 3 May, Ms Cronin stated that RT&Eacute; had made an application to initiate an RT&Eacute; 2+1 service which is with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland for consideration.  This was not correct.  The factual position is that RT&Eacute; had forwarded a draft proposal for discussion with the Department but has not submitted a formal proposal to date.  Therefore, the BAI has not yet been requested by the Minister to conduct a sectoral impact of any such proposal as provided for in the Broadcasting Act 2009.  I apologise to the committee for the fact that Ms Cronin's evidence to the committee was not accurate and appreciate the opportunity to correct the record.</blockquote> <p>We will happily do that.  I give that as an example in the context of the next item on the same topic.  The evidence presented was not accurate.  People should just come in, tell us that and let us correct the record.  People should not dance around or try to justify it.  This is a straight correction of the record and that is the way we want to proceed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-28a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018062800002#B01200"><p>People make mistakes.  Just admit it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-28a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018062800002#B01300"><p>We accept that.  We want to move on now to the correspondence from RT&Eacute; on the same topic.  This is No. 1413C.  RT&Eacute; spoke at the same meeting on the same issue, even though the Department made that particular statement.  I had asked about this RT&Eacute; 2+1 channel.  It started off as a harmless issue, but the fact that I am not getting a straight answer says something about the people responding.  Mr. Hurley was watching proceedings and took it up.  I do not know who he is.  He said regarding what was being said at the committee on RT&Eacute; 2+1 that the channel did not exist and we were not being given the exact position.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-28a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018062800002#B01400"><p>Thanks, Mr. Hurley.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-28a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018062800002#B01500"><p>Thank you, Mr. Hurley, whoever you are.  I want to go to the third page of this correspondence.  Mr. Hurley has been corresponding directly with RT&Eacute; and that is what I want to deal with.</p><p>He sent a copy of the correspondence to RT&Eacute;, which wrote directly back to Mr. Hurley and copied the committee.  I want to put on record that RT&Eacute; are dancing around this.  If it would just come up like the Department and set the record straight, we could move on.  However, for some reason, it is not inclined to do that.  RT&Eacute; stated it had asked for the RT&Eacute; 2+1 to be on the Sky platform.  I will now read the letter from Ms Forbes to Mr. Hurley, which the committee did not get but which Mr. Hurley sent to us.</p><blockquote>Thank you for your email of 5 June 2018.  <br /><br />By way of clarification, Mr. Jennings response at the Public Accounts Committee ... [on] 3 May 2018, relate to RT&Eacute;'s submission to the BAI's five-year public funding review, which on the date in question was still under ... consideration ...  This submission confirmed RT&Eacute;'s intention to formally request permission for the creation of an RT&Eacute;2+1 channel.</blockquote><p>By definition, she is saying that it does not exist, as she says that they had not yet made a formal application.  She is now saying, which is not fair to the committee, that when we asked a straight question about RT&Eacute;, the response given related to an RT&Eacute; 2 submission to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI's, five-year public funding review.  There was no such reference at the meeting.  She cannot now state that the reference to RT&Eacute; related to some document that it had sent to the BAI as part of a five-year review.  She is actually giving Mr. Hurley the run-around.  There was no reference to that and I cannot accept the validity of the assertion that what was said here related to the submission to the BAI five-year public funding review by RT&Eacute;.  I am not buying that.  I think we have agreed to write back to RT&Eacute; and ask if it could please look at what the Department did, correct the record and let us move on, and not drag things into it that we know were not part of the discussion at the meeting.  I hope that will be conveyed to RT&Eacute;.  They are only putting trips on us and on themselves and they are doing themselves no good by dancing around in circles.</p></speech>

Item No. 1428, from Deputy Cullinane dated 26 June 2018 requests that the committee write to RT&Eacute; to request a copy of the Eversheds Sutherland report, which we note and publish.  Will the Deputy speak on that?</p></speech>

I have not seen the report itself but I have seen the media coverage and RT&Eacute; responded to it.  It states there are issues with bogus self-employment and confirms that about one quarter of RT&Eacute; staff are on these contracts.  Worryingly for RT&Eacute;, although it is good news for the staff, it states there may be issues in respect of back pay and a cost to RT&Eacute; in implementing the report's recommendations, which it should do.  This is something that we might return to because indirectly that would be a cost to the taxpayer.  The committee should certainly write and get a copy of the report as it came directly from a hearing of the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is good that there has been a response.  There is an independent report and it confirms there are issues.  There are also wider issues for other media outlets.  If we could, we should write to the sectoral committee, which I think is the employment affairs and social protection committee, to ask it to examine the wider issues associated with bogus self-employment in semi-State bodies, as it might not be something peculiar to RT&Eacute;.</p></speech>

However the report that was being prepared was referred to constantly and, as a consequence, it is unfinished business.  We have no choice but to return to it to close off that topic and get a full understanding as to whether people genuinely have the option to change from self-employment to direct employment.  It gives us an understanding for other sectors, as the Deputy noted.</p></speech>

Next Tuesday, we will have a short private meeting to consider a draft report, which will have a chapter on RT&Eacute; and it would be good to have it before then.  I suspect we will want to include reference to this in our periodic report, which we hope to clear next week before publication.</p></speech>

Writing to the sectoral committee is a possibility but I ask the Deputy to hold off on that until next week.  We might include a recommendation that the sectoral committee examine that in our report.  We will deal with the issue next week and we will be able to move on immediately after that.</p> <p>  I now return to correspondence.  Item No. 1384 is from Dr. Graham Love, which was held over from the last meeting.  It provides information on what constitutes a part-time and a full-time student and whether the HEA is satisfied that UCC adheres to the requirements in respect of declaration of numbers of part-time and full-time students.  We note and publish that.  Deputies are free to pick up this issue as they wish.  </p> <p>  The next item is No. 1385 held over from the last meeting from Dee Forbes, RT&Eacute;, which we have dealt with.  I am asking Ms Forbes to help the committee dispose of the topic.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 1387 from Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, providing information requested by the committee regarding protected disclosure to Cork Institute of Technology.  I want to link the next item of correspondence to this, namely, No. 1397 from Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 18 June, providing information -----</p></speech>

There is so much there, we may have missed it.</p><p>The next item is No. 1397.  I want to deal with this broad issue.  It is from Robert Watt about protected disclosures.  This committee has people coming to us with protected disclosures.  The committee probably needs to take a bit of time to consider how we deal with these.  We have had them from justice, education, and third level institutions.  They are coming from a variety of sources.  Rather than deal with each one on an <i>ad hoc </i>basis, telling one person to go here and another to go there, we, as a committee need to get a briefing on how we will handle all these in a consistent manner.  The final paragraph of his circular to us, Robert Watts states:</p><blockquote>the Protected Disclosure Act is subject to statutory review, which is almost complete and will be published shortly.  This will review the operation of the Act since its commencement in July 2014 and has included a public consultation process in which 25 submissions were received ... A report will be made by the Minister to each House of the Oireachtas by early July on the findings of the review and conclusions drawn from those findings.</blockquote> <p>According to the Secretary General, there will be a report on how the Act is operating in the next week or so.  We know there are serious deficiencies and inconsistencies all over the place in public bodies.  We have a group of protected disclosures before us and we might set aside an hour to deal with them together rather than dealing with each one.  That is only a suggestion but I want to be sure that we are dealing with them properly.</p><p>I do not want to be accused of dealing with one in one way and another in a different way.  I am not trying to rule anything out; I just want to be comprehensive in what I am doing.</p></speech>

There are protected disclosures that the committee receives and, because of the nature of the committee, protected disclosures that we receive as individual members.  It would be worthwhile and useful having a session at which we would be briefed on the process and how we could protect ourselves.</p></speech>

We are not going to have a set formula that will work for all because the inconsistencies are so diverse.  It would be great to have a briefing, but we cannot be trenchant in defining in advance an approach to each one.</p></speech>

This a box ticking exercise.  As Deputy David Cullinane said, there is a difference between the protected disclosures legislation, the process by which Departments are dealing with them and the process by which we, as individuals, receive them.  I will have no issue with sitting down with them once this is done, but I have two concerns.  Learning how well it is working and about its failings is one thing, but time is a big issue.  Many protected disclosures are current and if we do not act on or deal with them, I am afraid that they will be lost.  Some genuine issues will not be addressed promptly.  I have no problem with sitting down to engage in a review and a discussion, but I find it unusual that the committee was not contacted.  I am concerned about holding it up to look at these issues in the meantime.  The letter refers to early July, but it could be the end of July or September because we will not be back until then, if we do come back.</p></speech>

The letter from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform reads:</p><blockquote>Expired unclaimed prizes are transferred on a regular basis from the Prizes Bank Account to Premier Lotteries Ireland DAC General Bank Account where they are used for the purposes set out in Clause 6.9.2 of the Licence [agreement].  When expired unclaimed prizes are transferred from the Prizes Bank Account to Premier Lotteries Ireland DAC General Bank Account, there is a corresponding journal to release the transfer amount from the Prize Liability balance.  The amount of that journal is then accounted for in accordance with the use to which it is put under Clause 6.9.2 of the [agreement]... as a special, additional or top-up prize, as an offset against the costs of incremental marketing or in accordance with [the] basis approved by the Regulator.</blockquote> <p>We will write to the regulator to ask what mechanisms are in place to implement clause 6.9.2 of the licence agreement and what is covered in the letter.  That is our line.  It is incumbent on the regulator to be on top of this issue as part of the agreement.  As the regulator comes within our remit, we will send a letter straightaway to ask for the full procedures as to how he ensures full compliance with the licence agreement as mentioned in the letter.  It is like pulling teeth, but we are not finished yet.  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien can come back to the issue.  I expect to receive a response from the regulator.  </p><p>The next item is No. 1404B from Ms Oonagh McPhillips, acting Secretary General in the Department of Justice and Equality, in response to a request for information on the restructuring of the Department.

We have thrashed out the issues involved in detail.  I ask the committee to express a concern about the length of time it is taking to come to conclusions on the implementation of the report.

I ask the committee to express concern considering the evidence given here.  I also want to flag, as part of the review of the Department of Justice and Reform and its handling of the matters in question, that we will have to focus in on the Irish Prison Service.</p><p>Specifically, I would like to see what progress is being made by the Department of Justice and Equality on restructuring, review and implementation.  There are two issues.  The first is the overall implementation, the timelines and the speed at which this happening, based on the evidence that was given here today.  Dare I say it, I went into the justice committee as well.  The second issue is how much progress is being made on implementation of review and change, specifically in the area of the prison service.</p></speech>

We will also consider all the responses as part of periodic report, but that is in the autumn.  There are three items from the Health Service Executive.  Correspondence No. 1406 from Mr. Ray Mitchell is a copy of the contract for the CervicalCheck provider.  One relates to the master contract for MedLab Pathology Limited, while the other relates to a copy of the main contract with Quest Diagnostics Incorporated and it includes a copy of the contract, the signature on the contract and the extensions which were issued in each case.  In the case of Quest Diagnostics, an extension was issued on 15 June 2017 and on 19 December 2017.  In the case of MedLab Pathology Limited, there was an extension granted on 15 June 2017, on 18 December 2017 and on 9 January 2018, confirming extension of the contract.  Some of those had already been put in the public domain.  It is by way of reference.  We asked for a copy of the contracts.  People are free to deal with those issues.  Correspondence Nos. 1412 and 1417 both deal with the topic, which I just referred to.  We will note and publish them.</p> <p>  Correspondence No. 1407 is from Mr. John McCarthy, the Secretary General at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, providing a response about CCTV and the role of local authorities.  It appears local authorities discharge this role within the policy, legislative framework and statutory instrument as set down by the Department of Justice and Equality.</p></speech>

I am as confused now as I was beforehand.  For a bit of background, a number of years ago, when I was Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government, a community group in your county came to me about putting in CCTV.  Everyone believes in CCTV on motorways.</p></speech>

They set a precedent and did it very well.  In fairness, the superintendent there played a blinder in everything.  We have an issue now where funding has been given - it came under community grants when I was there - to put up CCTV around the country in a number of locations.  As a result of success and pressure, in fairness, this Government has given a substantial amount of funding for this to be replicated by groups all over the country.  Very little of it has been drawn down, I understand.  </p> <p>  Communities are looking to local authorities and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As no one can take responsibility, particularly about where the data will be stored, these CCTV groups cannot conclude and put in place the CCTV.  We have a situation where many areas, in particular, motorways, are not being surveyed or reviewed by CCTV cameras, even though the infrastructure is available, can be put in place and is supported by the communities and the garda&iacute;.  The local authority and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na cannot agree where the information will be stored, who is going to monitor it, general data protection regulation and so on.  The public and the communities have no idea why this is the case.  In fairness, this letter does not clarify anything.  This is taxpayers' money.  The fact is that crimes are being committed.  CCTV will be able to help in solving some of these crimes, particularly on motorways.  You and I are both in constituencies with motorways running straight through them.  People are at a loss because of the difference between the two organisations.  If we cannot force an answer, some protocol or some pathway by which this can be solved, this will go on forever.</p></speech>

In Kildare, a protocol has been agreed and our money has been drawn down.  The expectation from CCTV very often does not meet the reality.  We have plenty of motorways in Kildare.  I would say we have more than in any other county.  There is an agreed a protocol.  Maybe a suggestion is that the City and County Management Association, CCMA, would tell us which ones have and, if there is a model, it may well be that it does not have to be duplicated all over the place.  There is no point in having this scheme unless it is usable.  If this is an impediment, that is a way to get through the impediment.  Maybe we could write to the CCMA to see where the best practice is and where it is working, and we might be able to see if that can be replicated.</p></speech>

There are two parts to this.  One is that it is not working.  There are only four drawdowns on this.  I asked a parliamentary question about this.  It is not working from a practicality point of view because many of the community groups cannot find the 40% balance that is required for the implementation of this.  Previously, when this worked well, the chambers of commerce worked with local authorities in delivering the fundraising, with the Department of Justice and Equality, to accomplish the CCTV schemes across the country.  Deputy Murphy talked about best practice.  In my county, we retain the data and the garda&iacute; have a live feed, but if they require any of the data, they have to go to the chief executive and put in a request for the film.</p></speech>

The local authority in my county has contacted me.  Funding was provided but they cannot agree on issues like those I outlined because of data and all that.  If we are going to the CCMA, and it is a good suggestion, we should also write to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

Ultimately, this is a situation where in some cases they can do it while in other cases they cannot.  There is no consistency.  Surely, they can create a protocol that works for the whole country.  If we are writing to the CCMA, we should also write to the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

We wrote to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government because local authorities are involved.  The last of this paragraph essentially says to talk to the Department of Justice and Equality, which is the appropriate Department to deal with our queries on this matter about local authorities.  That is the last paragraph of that letter.  One can see in a previous paragraph that this matter was decided under the SI 289 of 2006 - Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006.  We will write to the Department of Justice and Equality asking it to give us a report on where agreement has been reached on a local authority-by-local authority basis.  We will also write to the CCMA, as you asked, and to the headquarters of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which implements it, but the Department of Justice and Equality wrote the statutory instrument.  We are writing to all three.  We have to close this circle.  We are asking them on a local authority-by-local authority basis for a report.</p></speech>

We dealt with No. 1407B on CCTV.  Next is No. 1408B from Mr. John McCarthy, providing a response on the number of statutory inspections of rented accommodation supported by the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme.  The Secretary General states that the Department is working to identify a streamlined process.  I will not read the note any further.  The Department is in breach of its statutory duties.  A housing authority must either have inspected and been satisfied that the property meets the rental accommodation standards within 12 months prior to the HAP application or have arranged to inspect the property within eight months of HAP commencing.  The Department and the local authorities under it are in breach of their statutory duties in this regard.  I am not interested in what plans, processes and arrangements are to be put in place.  According to the letter, the Department is targeting a 25% inspection rate, but I see nothing in the letter explaining why it can ignore the other 75%.  We discussed this matter as part of our periodic report, which we will revisit next week.  The function of these bodies is to implement the law, not to cherry-pick and inspect on a sample basis.  I am rejecting what is in front of us as unsatisfactory.  These bodies should comply with the law.</p></speech>

As we discussed during our periodic review, this sector must be on our work schedule in its own right.  I believe that is what we will recommend.  According to this letter, property standards were cited as the reason for 210 exits.  All of those must be in my constituency, given that I encounter this problem constantly.  People make a complaint about mould on the wall in an expensive property that is being rented under the HAP scheme.  Invariably, they then get a notice to quit.  We are all encountering such cases.  Large sums of public money are involved.  That the tenant has to complain about these conditions puts him or her at risk of being excluded from the property.</p></speech>

An authority can know that a property is not up to scratch and give the landlord a notice to improve it, but even before that work is done, tenants can still be moved in under HAP.  A property is not accepted for HAP, however, if there is a prohibition notice or the property is subject to legal proceedings.  The threshold for standards is low, even in the legislation.  We will revert to this matter as part of our report.  We could usefully discuss costs in the rental sector in the autumn.</p></speech>

It will be in our autumn work programme, but we will also refer to it in our periodic report which we will issue in the meantime.  We will note and publish No. 1408B.</p> <p>  Next is No. 1419B from Ms Katherine Licken, Secretary General of the Department of Culture, Heritage and Gaeltacht, about whether Foras na Gaeilge considered in its business case the purchase rather than rental of a building.  The attached business case states that Foras na Gaeilge believed that this purchase would not have been supported by the sponsoring Department.  We will note and publish this correspondence.  If members wish to pursue the matter, they are free to do so.</p> <p>  Next is No. 1422B from Mr. Fergal Costello of the Department of Rural and Community Development, dated 22 June, providing information on a review of the Dormant Accounts Fund's disbursement and other matters.  This will feed into our periodic report.  We will note and publish it.</p> <p>  Next is No. 1423B from Ms Maria Browne, Chief State Solicitor, dated 22 June, providing information requested by the committee.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's 2011 report made a recommendation regarding planning compliance.  It related to the waste of &euro;4 million of taxpayers' money on the Probation Service's office, which we are dealing with as part of our periodic review.  The Office of the Chief State Solicitor did not accept the report, stating that it was bound to follow the Law Society's guidance on planning compliance.  However, it has not communicated the difficulties that this presents with the Law Society and that contributed to the loss of &euro;4 million in respect of the building on Wolfe Tone Street.  There is a thread of emails relating to the 2011 report dating back over a period.  The Office of the Chief State Solicitor says that, although it followed the Law Society's standard guidance, this is now an issue.  We asked the office to take the matter up with the society, but there has been no communication between the two.  The office has ignored the previous recommendation.  Our views on how the Office of the Chief State Solicitor contributed to the loss of &euro;4 million to the Irish taxpayer will be included in our report.  We will be firm on this point in our report when drawing our conclusions in the coming week or so.</p> <p>  Next is category C, correspondence from private individuals.  No. 1342C was held over from a previous meeting, as were Nos. 1355C (i) to (vi), inclusive, and 1362C from an individual, dated 24 May and regarding wards of court.  This is a major issue.  Can we hold it over again?</p></speech>

We will support the justice committee in its work and will not duplicate exactly what it has done.  We will hold this correspondence over.  Regarding the third item of correspondence from this individual, I propose that the secretariat start working on providing the information requested, but with the exception of legal advice from the Attorney General, which is mentioned.  We will revert to this matter next week, having had a look at the justice committee's report.</p> <p>  Next is No. 1347C from Mr. Se&aacute;n O'Reardon, Office of the Garda Commissioner, providing a response requested by the committee regarding a report on the operation of GoSafe cameras.  This is quite a comprehensive response that members may wish to consider.  I propose that we forward a copy to the individual who wrote the report and publish the correspondence.  I propose that we note and publish this correspondence.  If any member wishes to raise the matter, he or she is free to do so.</p> <p>  Next is No. 1350C, which was also held over, relating to a submission to the committee regarding another protected disclosure.  We will have a discussion on protected disclosures next week and hold this correspondence over to be part of that discussion.</p> <p>  Next is No. 1386C, an anonymous letter requesting the committee to make inquiries with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection from an individual who has made a protected disclosure about alleged wrongdoing in St. Munchin's community centre in Kileely, County Limerick.  We will also hold this over until our discussion on protected disclosures.</p></speech>

I do not know whether something has happened in the past 24 hours but I was informed in recent days that his salary has been stopped again and that does not seem consistent with the judgment under the review by Judge William Early or letters from the Prison Service to him to apologise.  We should seek answers to the issues raised in the letter.  We should seek an agreement on mediation if possible.  It was only accepted by the Prison Service in 2017 that his September 2016 disclosure was the first disclosure.  Following a freedom of information query, I saw an email that highlighted knowledge of it in February 2016.</p></speech>

This is not just a protected disclosure.  There is a process here, which does not make sense, as to how the Irish Prison Service is dealing with this.  It links in to what I spoke about earlier about the Toland review and the issue of how the Department of Justice and Equality updates its implementation of justice in the Prison Service.  The disclosure is one thing.  I have met this individual and have had much correspondence with him.  The issues that he raises are one thing and need to be dealt with.  I believe that there has to be mediation to deal with this.  The Prison Service keeps stopping his salary even though he gets permission from his superiors to take leave.  This happened multiple times.</p></speech>

I do not think this is happening to every other prison officer who gets leave from local line management, who are not the problem here.  He obviously has issues and has raised them in a protected disclosure, the timelines of which, as Deputy MacSharry has pointed out, have been contradicted with regard to how they have been dealt with.  His situation has to be mediated so that he can continue to work or whatever else the mediation process will involve.  The issues in his protected disclosure have to be dealt with comprehensively.  There are issues relating to the process by which the Prison Service deals with protected disclosures.  I do not think anyone, based on the information and conversations I have had with him and others, would feel comfortable in the Prison Service in making a protected disclosure in any way, shape or form.  I know they would not.  That is not right.  It is completely wrong.  There is a situation in Irish prisons where prison guards who do their job of finding drugs, mobile phones etc. feel that they get penalised because it looks bad for a prison for things to be found, the governor does not like that the statistics for these findings are getting higher, and then comes down on the prison officer.  That is insane.  I am telling the public that that is the reality in some cases.</p> <p>  There are three issues.  There is the way the individual is dealt with and the need for mediation, which should be done quickly.  I hope the Department of Justice and Equality is watching this.  The issues in the protected disclosure are severe and serious, need to be dealt with, and correlate with other people who have had issues in the Prison Service.  The third issue is the process by which the Irish Prison Service, supervised by the Department of Justice and Equality, has dealt with this, and the contradictions as outlined by Deputy MacSharry and me.  That last bit is quite serious.  The people watching this need to know that, as a committee, we will deal with these issues.  Before we finish this term, if we do not see progress on these items, I will ask this committee for support to have the Irish Prison Service and the Department of Justice and Equality sitting here in the first meeting we have after the recess.</p></speech>

People are brave enough to put themselves at risk and come forward with protected disclosures, and protected disclosures are intended to reduce that risk.  We are seeing something that does not fall into that category.  This is not the first time an individual has come forward about the Prison Service.  I agree with what has been said.  I have no difficulty with it being timetabled.  I do not think it is about this one individual.  A problem in dealing with that individual and individual complaint is that when some things come forward, the wider issue of it not repeating itself is the message that the Prison Service has to hear.</p></speech>

The last paragraph of his letter says the first question in our correspondence related to non-delivery of a contract service.  It is about JobPath.  It says the second question at the joint committee related to the operation of the payment model.  They are two slightly different aspects of the same issue and he makes clear that he was answering different aspects.  There is no contradiction and he is making that clear.  We note that and will forward it to the person who sent it to us.</p><p>Nos. 1401C and 1402C are dated 11 May 2018 and request that the committee investigate matters relating to the censorship of a play authored by the correspondent and make inquiries about a programme broadcast on UTV.  These matters do not fall within the remit of the committee and I propose that we write to the correspondent accordingly and do not circulate other items on the matter.<br/><br/>No. 1413C dated 21 June 2018 was received from an individual regarding the items we dealt with earlier in regard to the RT&Eacute; 2+1 channel.<br/><br/>No. 1414C is from an individual requesting the committee to make inquiries regarding a landfill site at Whitestown, County Wicklow.  I propose that, with the individual&rsquo;s permission, we forward the item to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government for an initial response and we can decide then how to proceed.  The individual states that major remedial work was carried out.  High Court proceedings were heard by Mr. Justice Humphreys.  According to the correspondent, the judge excoriated various public bodies, Wicklow County Council and the Department as the job done is so bad that public moneys were wasted and a further remedial project must recommence.  Much money has been expended on this matter.  The topic was discussed by the committee recently and we will ask for a very detailed and comprehensive response on the matter and follow up on it when that is received.<br/><br/>No. 1416C, dated 22 June 2018, relates to the dossier submitted to the committee by John Miskelly.  Deputy Catherine Murphy submitted No. 1412 in respect of the same item.<br/><br/>No. 1426C, dated 26 June 2018, was received from Ms Susan Gilvarry, solicitor to the Cooke commission of investigation, regarding documentation received by the commission and the committee.  I ask that the letter be put up on the screen because I wish to read it into the record to set the context.  I will then call Deputy Cullinane.  The letter is addressed to Mr. Kieran Lenihan, clerk to the Committee of Public Accounts, from Ms Susan Gilvarry, solicitor to the commission, and is dated 25 June 2018.  It states:</p><blockquote><b>Re: Commission of Investigation (National Asset Management Agency) Project Eagle</b><br /><br />I refer to our conversation of last Wednesday, 20th June 2018, in relation to the statement and dossier of Mr John Miskelly.  I can confirm that following a preliminary review of the statement and documents provided, the Sole Member has formed the view that some of the information provided by Mr Miskelly may be relevant to the Commission's Terms of Reference.<br /><br />Accordingly, I am to inform you that the Commission has written to Mr Miskelly, to ask him to provide sworn testimony under s. 16 of the Act, in relation to the matters contained within his statement and accompanying dossier. The Sole Member has asked me to draw your attention to s. 11(3) of the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 and the constraints imposed on witnesses before the Commission in disclosing evidence to third parties.</blockquote><p>Mr. Justice Cooke stated that he has asked for sworn testimony and is dealing with the matter.  He highlights that witnesses before the commission are restricted from disclosing evidence to third parties, including the committee.  All members are aware that the Oireachtas set up this commission of investigation.  We asked for it and the Oireachtas established it.  The commission is up and running.  Mr. Miskelly is a witness before the commission and I think the letter deals with the issue.  I call Deputy Cullinane.</p></speech>

It was not addressed to the Chairman but, rather, the clerk to the committee.  That does not set a good precedent.  If correspondence is sent to the clerk of the committee, it is for the committee to decide how it will deal with it.  I wish to put that on the record.  I do not wish to be overly critical.  All members were given a copy of the dossier and is a matter for each member as to what he or she does with it.  We received that from Mr. Miskelly.  However, this letter was sent to the committee and the Chair was wrong to put its substance into the public domain before the committee had an opportunity to discuss it.</p></speech>

Today's edition of the <i>Irish Independent </i>contains an extensive article on the correspondence received by the committee that we are now discussing.  There have been many media inquiries on the matter.  It featured on the front pages of some Sunday newspapers.  It would be a bit unreal to pretend we did not receive the correspondence.  I had it in my own right.  I was speaking in a personal capacity rather than on behalf of the committee.As I am Chairman of the committee, it might have been reported that I was speaking on behalf of the committee but I received the letter in my own right and was giving my own view.

All members had that letter yesterday and any of us could have given it to a media outlet but we chose not to because the committee agreed, during a private session at which we dealt with the periodic reports, that we would deal with the matter today in private or public session. As a Deputy, the Chairman is entitled to do as he wishes.  However, as Chair of the committee, it was wrong to put that information into the public domain before it was discussed by the committee.</p></speech>

The committee should not encroach on matters which are the subject of another process.  This issue is being seriously scrutinised by the commission of investigation.  The letter states, "the Sole Member has formed the view that some of the information provided by Mr Miskelly may be relevant to the Commission's Terms of Reference".  Do we know what information that is?  It might be one line of the 600-page report.  It probably refers to the witness' statement.  We need to know what that is in order to decide on how to proceed and whether there is anything in that very extensive correspondence that it is appropriate for the Committee of Public Accounts to investigate.</p></speech>

She knows as much as I do; I have no further information in that regard.  We should not second-guess Mr. Justice Cooke, who states that some of the information is relevant to his terms of reference.  We have no idea whether it is a little of the information or all of it.  I do not think we can ask him to explain what part of the information is relevant to him and which is not.  I do not think we can question the judge on that matter.  Each member received a copy of the information and that is a matter for each Deputy.  The information was sent to the committee but the commission has indicated it is dealing with it to some extent and has asked for a sworn statement on the matter.  I do not want the document to be put into public circulation or taken on board as a committee document.  As Chair, I am clear on that.  Parliamentary privilege could be claimed in regard to the allegations made.  I do not wish for the Committee of Public Accounts to be used as a vehicle for people to make very serious allegations that may or may not have a basis in fact and have parliamentary legal privilege in that regard as a result of the committee taking a document on board.</p><p>The Committee of Public Accounts would not be wise to allow this document to be retained by the secretariat and I propose to return it to the sender, along with the letter from the judge.</p></speech>

Before we do that, the vast majority of the issues are allegations of a criminal nature that should absolutely be dealt with by the Tax Appeals Commission.  I fully accept that the commission is saying it cannot allow itself to be used by somebody who is under investigation - let us be honest about it - and then give privilege to the person who is under investigation.  This committee must because of what it does in this regard in order to protect its own integrity.  I have no difficulty whatsoever with that.  There are, however, small aspects of the matter that encroach on governance issues and compliance with the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009, for example, and it might be prudent for the committee to keep a copy of the document.  I want to get clarification on whether the committee keeping a copy confers privilege on the individual.  I am not sure that it does.  If it does, however, then we should hand the letter back.  If it does not, then we should retain it in case we need it at some point.</p></speech>

We made the choice to not bring them in.  In this instance, I would be of the same view; we have chosen not to go there.</p></speech>

We took issue with the fact that people who could be the subject of a disclosure may have a hand in putting together the terms of reference for the investigation.  The Secretary General has written back to state everything was okay because the Higher Education Authority, HEA, has advised that the terms of reference were set by independent legal advisers for CIT's audit committee.  We established that somebody who was on that audit committee was the subject of some of the disclosure.  The audit committee is retaining solicitors to do a job and gives the solicitors a brief.  Its members write the brief for the solicitor.  There is no way that this is above reproach.  What if I were to employ a solicitor, having told him or her that I do not want to be shown anything but that he or she should go off and do the job as best he or she can?  It is a laugh.  If a committee brings in solicitors and tells them the committee wants them to prepare the terms of reference, they will ask the committee what the brief is, what are the terms of reference and what does the committee want them to look at?   They will get the brief in advance and then they will draw up terms of reference that suit those who are paying the bill, namely, the audit committee, some of whom were the subject of the disclosure.  It is a laugh.  This is totally unacceptable.</p></speech>

I am glad we have it.  It is making the situation worse for the Department and the HEA.  I do not know who is pulling whose chain here.  Did the HEA consult with them?  On what basis was the letter written?  It is full of contradictions based on the evidence we have seen here on multiple occasions.  CIT is the organisation that still keeps giving to us here in the Committee of Public Accounts.  It opens up more doors for us all of the time.</p> <p>  There are two issues here.  As Deputy MacSharry has said, if one checks how the terms of reference were set, it transpires that they set their own terms of reference.  This is just a continuation of that argument that it was okay.  It has just gone another layer down the ladder.  We have established this is totally wrong.  The whole process by which they conducted the investigation was wrong and was corrupted  - I use that term in a generic way - by them setting their own terms of reference.  This is going down a further layer of explanation.</p> <p>  Second - I revert to what I said earlier on - based on the transcript of what was said by the witness who sat right in front of us, it also contradicts how the institute manages protected disclosures.  The second half of this letter is deeply concerning to me as regards how a 2012 protected disclosure was handled because there is a contradiction in what is being stated by the institute.  In addition, I note we asked the individuals when did they have protected disclosures.  Based on the evidence given to us, it was my understanding that there was no acknowledgement that there was a protected disclosure.  The documentation provided to us here, however, relates to a debate on whether there was a 2012 protected disclosure and if it came under the Act.</p><p>The HEA and the Department have a serious problem.  I acknowledge we will discuss how protected disclosures are being dealt with next week but there seems to be something going on here and we need to get to the bottom of it.  First, I am deeply concerned that the Department of Education and Skills is willing to buy the line, and continues to do so, that it is okay for one to set the terms of reference to investigate oneself.</p><p> Second, it is quite obvious that there are issues with CIT declaring what was or was not a protected disclosure.  Now with the HEA and, potentially, the Department, this line seems to have been spun, which I believe will be contradicted in the very near future.   </p></speech>

We have spent an awful lot of the past year dealing with this sector.  I believe it would be fair to say that we were not impressed with the oversight by either the Department of Education and Skills or the Higher Education Authority.  The oversight is part of several of the problems that we discovered.  They have not learned the lesson that separation is necessary in this regard.  I echo the concerns that have been expressed about the process.  If we do not get the process right then there is no point pursuing such a disclosure because it will be undermined right from the word go.</p></speech>

He did not give a detailed specific reason but I suggest that we add the matter to our work programme.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

Before we went into private session I read into the record a copy of the letter received from Ms Susan Gilvarry, solicitor to the commission of investigation into Project Eagle.  I confirm that the clerk to the committee received a letter from KRW Law-LLP in Belfast, in respect of its client Mr. John Miskelly.  We have considered the letter of correspondence and legal advice in private session.  While there are matters of corporate governance involved that are within the remit of this committee, the matters are also under the remit of the commission of investigation.  We have decided to take no action in respect of the dossier at this stage and the clerk will return the dossier received to the law firm that sent it to us.  We will state for the record that as NAMA has not been before this committee for a considerable period, we will schedule NAMA to come before the committee in September when we will review its most recent set of financial statements.  We also will review the section 226 progress report on NAMA that the Comptroller and Auditor General is producing and which we hope to have before then.  We can raise whatever issues we choose at that stage.  Does the Comptroller and Auditor General wish to add something on the timing of the report?  </p></speech>

As members will know, I have an interest in the IBRC liquidation going back over the past year.  On my recommendation, as a committee, we included in our last periodic report a recommendation to establish a committee of inspection within the liquidation.  We discussed that it would include, for example, representatives from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p> <p>  I had also made the unorthodox suggestion that we would consider making an approach to the person who has a legal case against the Department of Finance and the Minister for Finance, for effectively the same reasons, to have increased oversight of the liquidation.  There was agreement in principle by the committee to do that and I was to come back with a recommendation of what shape that might take or how we would proceed.  In a personal capacity, and not on behalf of the committee, I contacted the plaintiff in that case and asked, in a personal capacity, how he envisaged such a thing would happen.  He sent me some documentation that I received in the past couple of days and which I will circulate to committee members.  His documentation seems to indicate to me that the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and the Department of Finance clearly listened to our deliberations and have taken the unprecedented step to contact the plaintiff with a suggestion of exploring the possibility of withdrawing the case and that they would defer to the Committee of Public Accounts.  While the suggestion is very unorthodox, it is something that could save the State a lot of money.  It might also enable us to ask questions and provide the level of oversight that are required.</p> <p>  In the past number of weeks we have had the fifth progress report on the liquidation.  On reading that report I am concerned that while probably legal in terms of accountancy law and practice, perhaps morally it was not as transparent as I would prefer, particularly from a legal fees perspective.  I have been shown documentation, and I see that the matter was covered in the media last weekend, where Arthur Cox, which is one legal firm, received &euro;23,000 in a given year.  I have also been shown documentation that in one case alone, the company had billed out nearly &pound;980,000, which is not obvious from reading the presentation.  </p> <p>  The underlying issue is the kind of questioning and second guessing that ought to be required and is normal practice in a liquidation has not been done in this instance.  Perhaps the Department and KPMG are doing the best possible job anybody could do.  Given the hundreds of millions of euro that are now involved and the likelihood that the costs will grow substantially - this liquidation being the biggest in the history of the State and, perhaps, one of the biggest in European history - it requires a greater level of scrutiny.  </p> <p>  I will circulate the documentation I have been given, which then will leave it up to members.  I will pass it on.  I sought the information in a personal capacity and I think it is useful.  On the back of the documentation, when it arrives, we should write to the Department of Finance or the Office of the Chief State Solicitor or perhaps both and ask how we can assist.  There is a basis for this case to be discontinued, which would save money for everybody.  More importantly, we, as a committee, may be able to participate and provide the necessary level of scrutiny in terms of looking after taxpayers' money.  At the moment, this matter reeks of autopilot.  I found, having read the progress report, that while potentially it is perfectly legal in accountancy terms, it lacks the kind of transparency to which I believe the public is entitled. </p></speech>

What would be the basis of the IBRC coming before the Committee of Public Accounts?  Is the Office of the Chief State Solicitor in agreement that a committee of inspection is required?  Who would make that decision?</p></speech>

He has copied what are a set of terms of reference under which he feels the case could be staged, which would involve the establishment of a committee of inspection.  It suggests who would be included on that, namely, representatives of the Comptroller and Auditor General, a representative of this committee and others normally associated with a committee of inspection.  It is not that this committee would become the committee of inspection.  We would oversee its establishment and perhaps, given the unique circumstances, a member of the committee might be appointed to it.  I imagine that it would certainly have representation from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General because the expertise would be there.  If there is no case, we can then invite representatives from  KPMG, as the joint special liquidators, to come before us, together with the departmental officials who were here before and who told us that they had a great story to tell but that they could not answer questions because there was a case before the courts.  We could bring them in on that basis, but a committee of inspection would operate separately to this committee.</p></speech>

I do not know whether the courts have the right to do that because it has to do with the separation of powers.  The worst of all worlds would be that we have the IBRC in and not get the committee of inspection, and the case would be withdrawn.  A degree of caution is required.  I know what Deputy MacSharry is trying to achieve and I agree with him.  However, the basis of withdrawing the case is important and it would have to be that a committee of inspection was set up.</p></speech>

I would have to be very careful and put down a marker that it may not be appropriate for me to be involved because it could compromise independence and it might leave me, as Comptroller and Auditor General, in a position of not being able to report on a matter.  I have to protect that first.  Certainly we will look at whatever proposal is made.</p></speech>

Irrespective of the plaintiff's case, I raised the matter in the D&aacute;il yesterday and asked the Taoiseach about it but he could not answer the question.  He told me that he would come back to me in writing on the current status.  We made a recommendation in January.  Is the Department embracing this?  Is it setting up a committee of inspection?  Clearly, it has done something because it seems to have made contact with the plaintiff in the case to ask whether there is a basis on which he would withdraw.  I understand he indicated quite clearly that he would defer to this committee.  I do not think the Department was offering a committee of inspection but, equally, I do not think this man will take back his case unless there is such a committee.  It is what is needed and I agree with the Deputy Catherine Murphy 100%.</p> <p>  I take the point made by the Comptroller and Auditor General absolutely in terms of his office not being the right body.  However, the important thing is to have a committee of inspection and a representative from this committee, as an independent voice, would be good to have on that.  As an accountant, the Chairman knows that committees of investigation are pretty prescriptive about who sits on them in normal liquidation situations.  I will send this stuff around and I recommend that we make contact with the Department of Finance or the Office of the Chief State Solicitor or both, whichever the secretariat feels is appropriate to ask how can we assist with this.</p></speech>

The appropriation accounts for the Vote of the Department of Health, the HSE's financial statements for 2017, which were recently issued, and matters relating to consultants' pay, are on the agenda for next Thursday's meeting.  The following week, on 12 July, we have the National Treasury Management Agency before us.</p> <p>  I want to make two comments on the work programme.  I want to put the HSE on notice that we want it to deal with the following matters next week and I want to get this information to it.  One is consultants' pay, which we already have on our schedule.  This arose at our meeting earlier in the year.  We are all aware of the situation whereby the HSE has private investigators following certain consultants.  I asked a parliamentary question on what robust measures were in place to ensure that consultants comply with their contractual obligations.  The reply I received from the Minister by written answer on 14 February stated it is the responsibility of management to make sure the contracts are being enforced, and that he had asked the HSE to ensure robust measures are in place in 2018.  For next week, we want to know what measures have been put in place by the management of each hospital whose job it is, according to the Minister, to ensure that consultants comply with the contract.  We want to know the hospitals where the private detectives were brought in.  I do not know why they needed to be brought in if the hospital managers were doing their job.  We want details of this.  We also want the HSE to explain whether measures are in place anywhere to ensure that consultants comply with the contract.  The parliamentary question to which I received a reply on 14 February can be referred to the HSE in order that it will be aware of the topic.</p> <p>  I will come to the CervicalCheck issue in a moment.  However, the other issue I want the HSE to deal relates to a particular point.  We received a letter from a dental surgeon about the dental treatment service.  The scheme is very limited and covers people with medical cards and those classified by the HSE as high risk.  That high-risk group includes individuals with intellectual disabilities or sensory deficits.  Recently, the dental surgeon to whom I refer sought approval to carry out work on behalf of people considered high risk.  They are all patients the dental surgeon has dealt with for years.  One was a blind patient, another was a deaf and dumb patient and the third was a patient in HSE residential care.  It would be normal for this work to be approved.  The HSE wrote back to the dental surgeon seeking written medical evidence of the patients' sensory and intellectual deficits before it would approve the dental treatment, although they had nothing to do with dental treatment.  It wanted medical evidence of the disabilities.  The dentist claims the disabilities had no relevance.  I know the HSE needs procedures in place but the dentists cannot do their work.  The HSE has asked for medical evidence for every high-risk patient  It is awful for the dentist to have to say to his blind patient, his deaf and dumb patient, and his patient with an intellectual disability in residential care that a medical report on their position is required before he can do the dental work.  This seems to be creeping into HSE.  I want the HSE to give us a full briefing note to explain why it is going down this road.</p><p>It states in all its correspondence that it needs this information for other purposes in order to ensure that no claims that are not valid are  being processed under the system.  I think it has lost a bit of humanity in its approach.</p><p> That brings us to our second issue.  I want the HSE to give us a detailed report next week on where the process of recruitment relating to the new director general of the organisation stands.  I do not know whether the HSE or the Department of Health is here next as well.  Brendan Drumm was the first director general or chief executive officer of the HSE from 2005 to 2010.  Then we had Cathal McGee from 2010 to 2012 and Tony O'Brien from 2012 to 2018.  John Cunningham is currently in the role in an acting capacity.  A lot of people will feel that over the period since 2005, women's health has not been adequately dealt with by the HSE.  We have had the recent cervical cancer issue, breast cancer issues and maternity services issues.  I might be challenged on this but I urge those who are responsible for recruitment to give strong consideration to the argument that a woman should be the new director general of the HSE.  We have had excellent men but I believe a woman could bring something to the role in terms of putting patients first.  I ask that it be given a high mark on the scoring of any application.  People may say we are straying off track.  It is my own view and I am not asking the committee to endorse it.  I will make that point to the witnesses next week.</p></speech>

Deputy MacSharry raised the first one and I do not know the answer.  When Quest Diagnostics, MedLab Pathology and the Coombe laboratory compiled their reports, they went back to the HSE for sign-off.  We want to know who signed off on them when they came back to the HSE.  Was is somebody with a clinical or an administrative background?  These laboratories were only contracted by the HSE.  Somebody in the HSE had to take responsibility that the contractors did their job properly.  We need know the qualifications of the people who signed off on the reports when they came back to the HSE.</p></speech>

I have looked at her press release on a few occasions and the phrase used is "step aside".  I want to know if Dr. Flannelly is still in the employment of the HSE.  If so, she should be here.  She cannot say that she is taking her salary and is just doing another job next door.  I want to clarify whether she is still in the employ of the HSE.  If she is, she should be responsible for her tenure.  If she has resigned, that is a different issue.</p></speech>

A consultant operates in the public and private spheres.  The public sphere is headed by the HSE so in that sense, a consultant is contracted to the HSE, so there is a line.  As a committee, can we leverage that line in order to ensure that she turns up to answer questions?  Dr. Flannelly is central to all of this.  The role was part time but it was overseeing the whole thing.</p></speech>

The public is looking to the Oireachtas, although I know we have Professor Scally's inquiry and we are going to have a commission of investigation.  When the cervical cancer issue blew up, the director general of the HSE resigned, Dr. Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly stepped aside and Charles O'Hanlon, who was the programme manager, has been unavailable.  The three senior people are nicely off the pitch and it leaves a vacuum.  If it is possible next week, we want that vacuum filled.

The Chairman is probably encountering the same issue that I am in the context of home care packages being available but not being available.  I do not know if this is a matter for the Committee on Health or the Committee of Public Accounts but it certainly indicates a poor way of spending money if very expensive hospital beds are being occupied because less expensive home care packages are not available.  That has become quite a sizeable issue.  It may not be universal throughout the country.  I am just basing this on my own experience.  The money is gone since February.  With the agreement of the committee, I would this to be discussed.</p></speech>

Sometimes a good home-care package might be adequate but they say they have not the funds to do that although they will pay for the more expensive option of the nursing home.  The lesser option might be to provide a greater service at home.</p></speech>

The last thing on the work programme is that I want to arrange to send a letter to the Department of Education and Skills.  Our work went down very successfully with the HSE and it has thanked us publicly on several occasions for the section 38 and section 39 arrangements in respect of which many of their accounts were years out of date.  There was a lack of proper accounting, traceability and governance.  We now know from the HSE that all the organisations in those categories have their accounts in a proper manner.  They do not fall under our remit but it is good that they have achieved improved accountability in respect of the funding the HSE allocates to them.  I want us to do the same in the education sector.</p><p>We have improved the situation with the education and training boards.  In our report on the third-level sector last year, we referred to time limits for producing accounts for the universities and ITs.</p><p> There is another group in respect of which I want to write to the Department of Education and Skills.  This relates to a parliamentary question I tabled and a letter I received on 28 February 2018 from the Minister following that parliamentary question which I will put in the committee's documents today.  I asked the Department to provide a list of all organisations to which the Department provides funding of more than &euro;1 million per annum where the bodies concerned receive over 50% of their funding from public sources.  I did not go down to every small grant.  I have a list of 20 or 30 organisations.  They may or may not be under our remit.  We want the Department to give us a report on when it received the last financial statements in respect of each of them.  We are moving to ensure that it does the same with these funded organisations as the HSE has done in respect of section 39 organisations.  It will include the ETBs and third level.  The organisations include the Educational Research Centre, Grangegorman Development Agency, the National Council for Special Education, the State Examinations Commission and L&eacute;argas.  Some of them might already be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and some might not.</p></speech>

The commission is an independent statutory body tasked with providing a modern and efficient appeals process for the hearing and adjudication of tax disputes.  The 2016 appropriation account of the Tax Appeals Commission shows that the total spend by the commission in 2016 was &euro;890,000.  The amount provided for the commission for the year was &euro;1.5 million.  As a result, almost &euro;600,000 was liable for surrender at the year end, reflecting delays in recruiting staff and underspending on the commission&rsquo;s ICT system.  The commission has been reliant on the Revenue Commissioners for many support services.</p> <p>  Chapter 9 is a short report examining progress by the commission in putting in place the necessary corporate governance arrangements and the management of overtime payments in 2016.  While the commission was established formally in March 2016, we found that by September 2017 it was not yet fully compliant with its corporate governance obligations.  The commission published a governance framework that outlined the proposed governance structures, including audit, assurance and compliance arrangements.</p><p>It had not, however, established an audit committee, did not have in place a formal risk management system, and had no formal risk management policy or risk register.  An effective risk management process should assist the Tax Appeals Commission in achieving its objectives by allowing it to identify and manage threats to delivery in a timely and effective manner.  The Accounting Officer will be able to update the committee on progress in developing its governance systems.  We are examining them again in the context of the 2017 appropriation account.</p><p> The commission's 2016 Vote appropriation account records overtime payments of &euro;65,400 to one employee, which was very substantial given the scale of the Vote.  Because of the additional expense involved, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform guidelines require that overtime working does not occur unless it is both authorised and unavoidable.  When the 2016 payments were examined by the audit, it was found that the records kept by the commission were not sufficient to substantiate the payments.  The claims for payment of overtime went back a number of years and there was no record that the claimed overtime work had been authorised by a more senior official.  The commission&rsquo;s then head of administration was not involved in review or authorisation of the payments and only became aware of them when Revenue's payments section queried the amount of overtime being processed on behalf of the commission.  Overall, the circumstances surrounding the overtime payments made in 2016 indicate a very weak control environment at the time.</p></speech>

I am before the committee in response to matters highlighted by the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General in relation to internal controls in the TAC in 2016.  As members are probably aware, the decision to establish the TAC was made following a lengthy process of consultation, consideration and review by a number of different bodies.  It was established pursuant to the Finance (Tax Appeals) Act 2015 and commenced its activities on 21 March 2016.  The TAC is an independent body with its own Accounting Officer and Vote, although under the aegis of the Department of Finance.</p> <p>  The legislation made clear that the commission was to be a new body whose independence was enshrined in statute and which would have the power to adopt flexible and active case management procedures with a view to progressing and finalising appeals as efficiently as possible.  The former right of appeal to the Circuit Court was abolished and the TAC now makes findings of fact which are binding on the parties.  The only right of appeal from the TAC is to the High Court by way of a case stated on a point of law.  Perhaps because of this change, the Legislature also introduced a requirement for the Appeal Commissioners to give written determinations in every case, an obligation to publish those determinations and the right to apply those determinations to appeals which raise similar issues of law.</p> <p>  Ms Lorna Gallagher and I were appointed as Appeal Commissioners at the end of 2015, prior to the establishment of the Tax Appeals Commission, following a recruitment process conducted by the Public Appointments Service.  We were then reappointed pursuant to the 2015 Act when the TAC came into being.  We have been appointed for a seven-year term, which expires in 2023, and we may then be reappointed for one further term.  In June 2017, Mr. Conor Kennedy was appointed as a temporary commissioner, primarily to deal with the legacy appeals received from the Revenue Commissioners in the second half of 2016.  His appointment is for a two-year period, which may be extended by the Minister for Finance.</p> <p>  Following its establishment, the Tax Appeals Commission took over the operations of its predecessor, the Office of the Appeal Commissioners, working with the same staff and from the same premises.  When I was first appointed the office had a staff of four, including a principal officer seconded from the Department of Finance to assist with the planned establishment of the TAC.  The TAC now has a staff of 14.5, including a part-time official responsible for human resources and training and our current head of office who is not a permanent staff member of the TAC but rather a principal officer on secondment from the Department of Finance.  One member of staff has been absent on sick leave since August of 2017.</p> <p>  The staff of the TAC work in three distinct units, namely, scheduling, case management and administration.  Of the 14.5 staff, 11.5 of those were appointed in 2017 or 2018.  The most senior member of our permanent staff is an assistant principal.  While it is clear from the foregoing that there has been a growth in our staff numbers, particularly in the past 12 months, it has taken us a long time to recruit suitable people and we are still significantly short of the necessary staffing levels.</p> <p>  The workload of the TAC is considerable.  We assumed the existing caseload of the Office of the Appeal Commissioners and in the second half of 2016 a total of 2,731 legacy appeals were transferred to the TAC by the Revenue Commissioners.  The 2015 Act furthermore provides that all appeals are now made by taxpayers directly to the TAC, whereas under the previous regime appeals were notified to the Revenue Commissioners in the first instance.  This has resulted in a significant increase in the number of appeals which the TAC is required to process.  In 2016, the total number of appeals received was 901 but in 2017 that figure had jumped to 1,751.  The TAC is currently receiving an average of 150 appeals per month.  The TAC had approximately 5,500 appeals on hand during 2017 and we believe the total amount of tax currently under appeal is in the order of &euro;1.6 billion.  By contrast, our budget, at &euro;1.6 million, is approximately one thousandth of the amount of tax under appeal.</p> <p>  In addition to the appeals received, the TAC receives a significant volume of correspondence on appeals, all of which has to be logged, filed and responded to.  The TAC may receive as many as 100 items of correspondence per day.  In addition, the TAC is now the first point of contact for many taxpayers when they are dissatisfied with a tax issue or if they have a query in relation to same.  Queries that may formerly have been made to the Revenue Commissioners are now being made to the TAC.  The committee will appreciate that all of this absorbs a great deal of staff time and resources.</p> <p>  In addition to the appeals and correspondence workload, the TAC also has to meet all the governance requirements of a Civil Service body.  With regard to governance, the TAC is akin to a small Government Department, with all necessary obligations having to be discharged alongside our primary task of hearing and determining appeals.  While a Department might have several sub-offices such as a press office, corporate office, accommodation unit, a Minister's office and so on, the position in the TAC is that many staff cover several dedicated areas of responsibility as the TAC does not have sufficient staff numbers to assign specific members of staff exclusively to specific roles.</p> <p>  Our recently published annual report for 2017 shows that we have made very significant progress, both in addressing our appeals workload and in meeting our governance obligations.  Headline achievements during 2017 include closing 693 appeals; listing 106 appeals for hearing; conducting 89 case management conferences relating to 479 appeals; publishing 35 determinations; conducting a public consultation exercise on our procedures; producing new guidance notes for appellants; populating our case management database with quality checked data relating to thousands of individual appeals; establishing case management and scheduling units within the TAC; publishing a comprehensively revised code of governance; producing a three-year statement of strategy; and appointing internal auditors and established an audit group.  We have closed a further 821 appeals to date in 2018.  As of yesterday, that figure stood at 860 appeals.</p> <p>  We are proud of all that we have achieved with the resources available to us and Commissioner Gallagher and I take this opportunity to acknowledge the enormous commitment the staff has shown to date, the unrelenting pressure through which they have worked, the multitude of different tasks they have managed and the daily co-operation, assistance and support they continue to provide.  Notwithstanding the progress made, however, we are very much aware that a great deal more needs to be done for our stakeholders, particularly appellants and the Revenue Commissioners.</p> <p>  On the matter of staff and resources, the Tax Appeals Commission faces a significant risk from corporate memory loss if staff choose not to continue under the current pressures they face.  Also, as the TAC does not the resources or adequate levels of delegated sanction, staff operate in the awareness that the TAC cannot, as it stands, offer them a career path.  Leaving aside for a moment the issue of sanction and budgets, staffing risks are higher and more critical in a small office such as the TAC, as it does not have either the capacity to absorb the memory loss or the time and resources necessary to continuously recruit and train in new staff.</p> <p>  In addition to the main business of the office - being the adjudication and determination of tax appeals - there are strategic and structural issues that need to be addressed in order for the TAC to operate optimally.  In this regard, we have dealings with and rely upon the Department of Finance, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Revenue Commissioners and the Office of Public Works.</p> <p>  The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General for 2016 correctly highlighted significant governance and related issues in the TAC.  We fully accept the criticisms made in the report and we accept the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We have implemented those recommendations to the best of our ability with the resources available to us.  I believe the TAC's annual report for 2017 clearly shows that a great deal of progress has been made.  We fully accept that more progress needs to be made but we cannot do more without additional resources.  We have formally reported to the Minister for Finance pursuant to section 21 of the 2015 Act on the issue of additional resources, and we have met the Minister and officials from his Department to discuss this issue.  We have commissioned a resource review to obtain an independent analysis of resources and the Minister has recently appointed a retired Secretary General to carry out a resource review for his Department.  We hope that both these processes will be completed in the very near future and will enable the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform to make an informed decision on our requests for additional resources for the TAC.</p><p> An efficient and impartial tax appeals body is an integral part of a state's system of taxation of its citizens.  To meet our statutory mandate, there are legislative amendments that could assist the TAC in operating in a more efficient and effective manner.  In this regard, the TAC recently suggested certain legislative amendments for consideration by the Department of Finance.</p><p> Our statutory mandate requires us to put in place the independent, effective and efficient tax appeals system envisaged by the 2015 Act.  However, this cannot be achieved without adequate resources and the level of independence needed to apply those where we identify the need.  Our 2017 annual report shows how much more was achieved in circumstances where, although we remained under-resourced, our resources had improved from the very low base obtaining at the commencement of the TAC in March 2016.  Appellants should not have to suffer undue delays in the hearing of their tax appeals, but we are currently unable to prevent delays in the system in circumstances where we remain so significantly under-resourced.</p><p> In order to improve the tax appeals system and deliver an independent commission that will process tax appeals in as efficient and effective a manner as envisaged, it is our duty to assess the needs of the commission, identify the assistance we require and communicate that information to the relevant Departments in the form of a request for additional resources.  It is to be hoped that the relevant authorities accept that we are driven to provide the optimal service for our stakeholders and that we are best placed to assess our needs.</p><p> I am attending today to answer whatever questions the committee may have, and we will be happy to follow up with any information that we are not in a position to provide now.</p></speech>

I have never seen anything as bad as this at the committee.  Some &euro;1.6 billion of taxpayers' money is hanging out there when it should be in the State's coffers.  Most of it probably will be once the cases are settled.</p> <p>  According to its report, the TAC received 1,751 appeals in 2017 and settled 693 of those.  Its waiting list increased by more than 1,000.  That anyone would need a retired Secretary General to say that the agency needed more staff is a joke.  It is obvious.  I hope the Minister is listening.  By not resourcing the commission enough to do its job of efficiently collecting moneys due to the taxpayer, he is letting the taxpayer down.  Given the size of its office, the commission has my sympathy in trying to cope with the tsunami of appeals.  It is outrageous.  We will get into further detail, but those were my initial comments.  Whoever set up the office had no concept of, or did not adequately anticipate, the number of appeals.  It should have been obvious after six months and was totally obvious after 12.  Now a former Secretary General is being brought in to consider the staffing issue.  Whoever made that suggestion still does not get it.  I could not let the meeting commence without saying that.  We are here to support the commission.</p></speech>

The establishment of an independent appeals office was well flagged and was one of the recommendations for our tax code, but the Comptroller and Auditor General's report presents a chaotic picture of what has happened since the office's establishment in March 2016, for example, a haphazard approach to internal controls.  The commission is seeking extra resources, so it is surprising that &euro;596,000 was surrendered to the Exchequer in respect of 2016.</p> <p>  I would like to get a picture of how the commission is managing its existing resources.  The first matter that comes to my attention is that of the commission's internal controls and overtime payments of &euro;65,400 in 2016.  Does that figure reflect nine months of the year?</p></speech>

I apologise for interrupting the Deputy, but I am unsure as to whether he is aware that the overtime claim represented six years in total - 2010 to 2016, inclusive.  It had a significant historical element.  All of the moneys were paid in 2016 because that was the year in which the claim for overtime was made and processed, but the claim referred to a period long before Ms Gallagher and I were appointed.</p></speech>

We have done everything we can in that regard and we have addressed most of the issues highlighted by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We updated our overtime policy in February 2017 and again in June 2017 to make explicit reference to circular 14/2014, which is the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform guidelines on overtime.  We took a step back and created a work environment where overtime does not take place.  We are managing things so that nobody has to work overtime unless it is absolutely extraordinary and unusual and there have not been any overtime claims.</p></speech>

Assessments may be raised by Revenue where taxpayers have not kept proper books and, therefore, it is important the TAC, in leading the charge on transparency, ensures it gets the best possible advice and has the most robust structures in place before it makes payments of this nature.  It is unfortunate that the office fell short in this regard.  It is important that the commission be seen to lead.</p> <p>  There are delays in hearing appeals.  Some appeals have been in the system for a long time and one case, with &euro;60,000 in dispute, has been in the system for six and a half years.  The potential is for that taxpayer to be hit with an interest payment of &euro;30,000, half of the assessment under adjudication.  Does Mr. O'Mahony think that is fair?  There is a penal interest rate and the clock is ticking while the commission is doing its work.  If the appeal takes so long, there is no incentive for a taxpayer to make an appeal within the 30-day period and they will be concerned at having to bear the cost of inefficiencies in the commission.</p></speech>

As regards delays in determinations, we had no support until the beginning of this year for preparing determinations.  When we prepare a determination we have to sit down with a file which can run to ten bankers' boxes.  We have a blank computer screen in front of us, on which we start typing.  It is not satisfactory and is not an efficient use of our time.  However, we have appointed case managers and we are trying to get them to start shouldering some of the more routine stuff, such as preparing summaries of the facts, printing out the relevant legislation and doing research on the case law, which we have been doing ourselves to date.  It is not a clever way of doing our work.  A judge does not go away to look for an Irish report but has an assistant to do it, speeding up the process.</p></speech>

We would like to get our determinations out faster and we would like to satisfy taxpayers.  We both came on board because we felt it was an exciting time to be involved in the tax appeals process.  We have so much ambition and we want to do it properly but it is incredibly difficult when there are so many demands on one's time.  We often deal with complicated cases that require a lot of thought.  We are the sole arbiters of facts and, in fairness to Revenue and the taxpayer, we need to get it right.  One cannot do a slipshod job or do something that is 80% correct.</p></speech>

In the last process in which we used the PAS, they said it would take 19 weeks, or five months, after which there would have to be a Garda vetting process and a notice period for successful candidates.  It is hugely time consuming.</p><p>I do not say that as a criticism of the PAS.  It is a fact of the system.  We simply do not have that time.  The PAS and the Commission for Public Service Appointments, CPSA, both said to us that we need the power to recruit directly.  We applied for, and were successful in obtaining, a recruitment licence which means that we do not have to go through the PAS if we are looking for people up to principal officer, standard grade.</p></speech>

We have a project manager working for us on a contract basis who has significant IT experience and he has prepared a list of what he believes is appropriate and necessary for us to have.

We moved to new premises on 9 June, which has eased matters, but depending on what additional resources we are or are not allocated following the outcome of the two resource reviews, there may be increased pressure on accommodation at that stage.  The accommodation issue was a huge one for us.  It got to the stage where, for the second half of 2017, we did not have any hearing rooms.  We were going out to hotels in the area to book hearing rooms so that we could conduct hearings and case management conferences.</p></speech>

It is good that we can highlight that.</p> <p>  I have a technical question to finish up.  When a taxpayer gets a notice of assessment and has 30 days to appeal it, the taxpayer can sometimes be in the dark about the methodology of how Revenue arrived at the assessment.  At later stages, it is difficult to introduce new aspects to an appeal except in limited circumstances.  Could more be done for taxpayers to highlight how Revenue arrives at certain figures in the notice of assessment or at the tax liability?</p></speech>

It was a common complaint in a number of submissions received in our public consultation process.  We are constrained regarding what we can do in looking at Revenue conduct.  We do not have the statutory jurisdiction to do that.  What we can do and have actively been doing, as the Deputy will have seen in the annual report and statement, are case management conferences.  They were originally envisaged as a means by which we would give directions.  We have been much more flexible and creative in our approach.  That is a forum where if there is, as we see it, a genuine difficulty or lack of clarity affecting a taxpayer's ability to form a view as to whether something is appealable, that is an opportunity for us to invite Revenue to clarify its position.  The Deputy is right that the scope to extend one's grounds of appeal is quite prescribed by statute.  The approach of the TAC has always been that we will be flexible and sympathetic to a taxpayer faced with an assessment where he or she honestly does not know how the figures have been arrived at.</p></speech>

It is, as far as I understand, and perhaps the Tax Appeals Commission, TAC, can explain more, that it would have been aware for quite a length of time that it would have been moving out of this building because it was scheduled to be refurbished in its entirety.  There has been a process up to the past year of looking for alternative accommodation that would suit TAC and it has looked at alternative premises before the current one it has moved into.  It is certainly that it is ongoing for that length of time.  We would not have been involved with the final say with the OPW as to the date of moving.</p></speech>

There was a period when we knew the building that we were in was going to be demolished.  We got very sudden notice, because we had pushed back against the exit date for a while, saying that until something was ready, we could not move.  We kept pushing back until eventually we were told we were moving.  That was it and when we got there, the weekend we moved in, the walls were still going up.  There was certainly no furniture, no walls and no IT system.  There was nothing when we moved in.</p></speech>

The SLA dates back as far as 2005 and has been renewed or rolled over informally on a number of occasions since then.

I can highlight two or three for the committee, if it believes time is a pressure.  I will start with the one that has been obvious to all of us from the get go, which is the matter of cases stated.  The Deputy asked whether we had been judicially reviewed, to which the answer is "No".  However, there is an appeal mechanism in the tax legislation whereby an appellant or the Revenue Commissioners, if they are so minded, may appeal us directly to the High Court to have what is effectively a point-of-law rehearing.  That provision requires an Appeal Commissioner himself or herself to draft the case stated document, which is a detailed and exacting document for the benefit of the High Court judge who will hear the case.  A series of questions must be set out, the determination must be clearly put forward, the points of appeal clarified and all of the exhibiting, supporting documentation included.</p> <p>  I believe we have asked, and will do so again, for this provision to be amended in a manner that will alow usl to request the appealing parties to draft a case stated document for review by us so that we can then alter or amend as necessary.  Drafting case stated documents takes many hours, consuming a great deal of our time.  We will ask for that change.  When our body of determinations grows, the number of appeals will inevitably grow as well.  The interesting thing about the case stated legislation is that it provides a tight timeframe of three months within which an Appeal Commissioner must draft, finalise and sign the case stated.  As such, if I receive a case stated application, I must prioritise that ahead of determinations that have been sitting on my shelves and awaiting my attention.  If the parties could draft the case stated document for my review and my final sign-off, it would be of great assistance.  This is one of the recommendations we have made.</p> <p>  Another recommendation that may be of interest to the committee relates to our section 949 new jurisdiction provision.  This jurisdiction is helpful for taxpayers because it allows them to opt to have their appeals heard without oral hearings.  They can furnish to us in writing their submissions, statements and points of view, the points of law and anything else they feel is relevant.  The Commissioner will then sit down at his or her desk and draft the determination on foot of that paperwork, as per between Revenue and the taxpayer.  This facility has been taken up significantly by taxpayers.  However, the legislative provision as drafted does not allow us to make the final call on whether a case is determined in this way.  In circumstances where we feel that a small case, for example, of under &euro;10,000, or a non-complex case is appropriate for a section 949 new determination but the taxpayer disagrees with us, unfortunately we have to schedule a hearing and the matter will go through that process.  We have asked for consideration of whether we might make that decision.</p></speech>

We identified that we would not be able to get on top of this, given all of the other work we had to do and the fact that we have such a small complement of staff to do everything.  The main focus had to be on getting the appeals moving.  Through the procurement mechanism, we hired consultants to help us put a draft risk register and a risk management policy in place.  We have the register and are still working on it.  While I cannot say that it is populated or working, the whole ethos of risk management is there among all staff every single day.  We provide governance workshops to them and talk to them about risks.  No issues have arisen that cause us unwarranted concern.  Staff are well aware that, because they are so inexperienced and junior, they should come to someone more senior and experienced if they have doubts or concerns about an issue.  I cannot say that we have a risk register in place today, though.</p></speech>

They get a password but it is not on their personal computer at home; they are actually logging into the Revenue.  Is the Tax Appeals Commission separate?</p></speech>

The Tax Appeals Commission is a bit like the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  It makes a decision and sends it back to Revenue to sort out the figure by saying, "Here's our decision; implement it."  None of the money comes through its office.  It is important that the public get that and it is on the public record that it is back to the Revenue.  Surely the Tax Appeals Commission gets some analysis back from Revenue of all the cases the Tax Appeals Commission ever dealt with.  I think the Tax Appeals Commission determined 700 cases last year.  Of those 700 cases, what was the level of tax in dispute and what was ultimately the settlement.  Then I presume it is up to Revenue to collect the interest.  That is not the Tax Appeals Commission's area.</p></speech>

For example, if a case is settled between the parties midway through a hearing or if a case is settled between the parties during the correspondence processes when we are building up a file to create a file that can then be transferred to a hearing, it usually does so on a confidential basis and we would not necessarily be apprised of the terms of settlement of such a case.

If a case goes to the appeals office and it is withdrawn at local level, it is no longer in the Tax Appeals Commission's system and not one of its live cases.  There is probably a percentage of cases that came to the Tax Appeals Commission but were withdrawn and did not have to proceed.  We are not looking for the withdrawn cases because the commission ultimately did not have to conclude on those.  However, there may be a gap in the system in respect of the 700 cases.  The Tax Appeals Commission makes a decision on certain details and then it is a matter for Revenue to calculate the figures.  We need an understanding of what is happening here.  We do not know if the cases with a total value of &euro;1.6 billion will translate into &euro;2 billion, &euro;1 billion or &euro;500 million for the Exchequer.  We need to have some yardstick.  I accept that Revenue will produce the figure.  It is a bit like social welfare cases.  I believe there is a gap in public understanding of what is happening if we do not have the headline figures of what went in under appeal and if the case was adjudicated what the success rate was.  Does Mr. O'Mahony understand my question and where I am coming from?</p></speech>

We have a liaison role with the Tax Appeals Commission, TAC.  What is important to state is that each time the Tax Appeals Commission has come to us with resource requirements we have assisted to the best of our ability.  To take 2017, for example, we secured sanction for an additional five temporary commissioners to be recruited in 2017.  The commissioners had input into the selection and recruitment process and, as a result, only one candidate was selected.

We are very much aware that resources are needed.  We just want to make sure that the correct resources go in.  To put this in context, one can see from the increase in staffing that the commission has gone from having two commissioners and four staff in 2016 to having three commissioners and 15 support staff.  That demonstrates the engagement the Department has had in improving the staff.</p> <p>  As of our liaison meeting on 18 January, we were still aware that additional shortlisting was going on for new case managers at assistant principal level, and that process was under way.  Three weeks later, we got a request for resources that would include an assistant secretary, two further principals, an additional assistant principal and a higher executive officer.  The fact that this came three weeks after a liaison meeting where none of that had been raised gave us serious cause for concern and that is why we have said we are not disputing that more resources are needed, we just want to make sure that the correct resources go in.  The Minister is very conscious that a fully functioning appeals system is an essential part of the tax system.  It is as much in our interest that this system works as it is in the interests of tax and taxpayers that it works.  We want this to work and we want it to be appropriately resourced.  The Minister is fully engaged with this.  That is why we have appointed a single reviewer to go in to do the review as quickly as possible.  It is someone with experience, who can essentially put the business case to the Minister with his Public Expenditure and Reform hat on, and say these are the resources that are needed to make this an effective and fully functioning body and then we will have the basis on which to resource it.</p></speech>

We got a briefing note from a body other than the Tax Appeals Commission showing there has been an almost exponential increase in the number of cases.  In 2012, the figure was 247 but this increased to 356 in 2013, 498 in 2014 and reached 667 in 2015.  That is based on information received in response to parliamentary questions.  In 2016, the figure was 960 and in 2017 it was 1,405.  The more people know about the office, the more people will make appeals.  There needs to be some way of triaging cases.  Perhaps Revenue needs to step up to the plate and deal with some by having a review.  Revenue might say that is the job of the commission; I do not know.  The figure was 1,405 last year and will be at least 1,800 this year.  Only four years ago, the figure was 500 and it will have increased to well over 2,000 next year.  The number is increasing exponentially.</p></speech>

My main criticism is that, given the importance of the issue, the new system established has not been on the scale required to allow it to be up and running.  It seems the approach has been one of allowing the Department to work it out in that it will provide two commissioners and four staff and then increase staffing little by little.  This was all foreseeable.</p></speech>

There are two very distinct issues here.  There is an unforeseen backlog that has been delivered to the Tax Appeals Commission and has to be addressed, and there is then also the necessity to have a fully functioning ongoing system that can deal with the new appeals coming through on a day-to-day basis.  That is something we need to take into account with the resourcing.  That was originally the intention with the temporary commissioners.  There is an element of possibly needing shorter term staff to clear the large backlog and then we need an assessment of what is required on an ongoing basis to make sure that new appeals are coming through and are being dealt with in an effective manner.</p></speech>

There is probably more information available.  As the other members of the committee are not here, we would like to have that information on record.  When we are reaching a view on the issue we want to be able to collate all the information.</p> <p>  Does the commission get a recruitment agency to do the work on its behalf or will it have to devote existing and limited resources to the recruitment process?</p></speech>

We are out of sanctions at the moment.  It will not matter if we get additional temporary commissioners because without the support team to support them, we will not be able to move forward because there is a significant processing job to be done on these appeals.  It has to be addressed.  It will not be addressed by a commissioner.  That would be a complete loss of money.  All of our Civil Service obligations have to be addressed.  That needs something apart from a temporary commissioner.  The only sanctions we have at the moment are for a temporary commissioner.  We do not have sanctions for additional staff to run the office.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-28a.640" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018062800002#JJ00700"><p>The account of the receipt of revenue of the State collected by the Revenue Commissioners comprehends receipts of taxes and duties remitted by Revenue to the Exchequer and receipts collected by Revenue on behalf of others.  The 2017 account shows that net receipts of taxes and duties amounted to a total of &euro;50.8 billion, an increase of &euro;2.8 billion, or 5.8%, by comparison with the figure for 2016.  Receipts related to VAT, income tax and corporation tax together accounted for over 80% of net tax receipts.</p><p>Receipts collected by Revenue and remitted directly to non-Exchequer agencies and funds also increased substantially.  Net receipts totalled &euro;10.8 billion in 2016, increasing to &euro;12.2 billion in 2017, an increase of around 13.5%.  Pay related social insurance, PRSI, contributions account for the majority of this category of receipts.  A significant part of the increase in that category of receipts in 2017 was in respect of the VAT mini one-stop-shop, MOSS, scheme, which implements place of supply based VAT rules for businesses engaged in electronic supply of services cross-border.  Transfers to other EU member states increased from just under &euro;400 million in 2016 to almost &euro;1.2 billion in 2017.</p><p> Revenue's administration and operational expenses are charged to Vote 9, Revenue Commissioners, rather than the Revenue account.  The 2016 appropriation accounts show that the total spent by Revenue in the year was &euro;397 million.  Taking account of appropriations-in-aid of &euro;75 million, net expenditure under the Vote amounted to &euro;322 million.  The surrender for the year was &euro;8.8 million.</p><p> There were three chapters in last year's report on the accounts of the public services dealing with Revenue-related issues.  The committee has already examined and reported on the chapter dealing with corporation tax.</p><p> Revenue is obliged under legislation to collect tax in a timely and efficient way, including the pursuit of any tax debt outstanding.  As at 31 March 2017, the total value of gross tax debt outstanding was just under &euro;2.3 billion.  The value of outstanding debt has increased since 2015, reversing the downward trend of the previous five years.  Revenue has attributed the increase in recent years to an increase in the value of tax debt outstanding under appeal and, therefore, not currently available for collection.  Tax debt under appeal in March 2017 accounted for 48% of the total.  Our analysis also found that &euro;661 million or 29% of the total tax debt was classified as collectable, but it was not subject to either payment agreements or enforcement proceedings.  About one third was recently identified as debt.  Much of the remainder was at various stages of investigation or review but some debt was not under investigation.</p><p> Revenue wrote out a total of &euro;211 million of debt in 2016 and active pursuit of that payment ceased.  It included &euro;1.6 million in around 512,000 cases where small balances, an average of just over &euro;3 per case, were written out automatically.  The remainder was higher value debt which was written out on a case by case basis, with more senior authorisation for higher debts written out.  The most frequent reasons for such debt write-outs are liquidations and businesses ceasing to trade.</p><p> Chapter 22 deals with delays in transferring certain tax receipts to the Exchequer, which resulted in the accumulation of deposits in a Revenue holding account at the Central Bank at year end.  The problem arose because the receipts for the two tax heads had not been matched with the appropriate taxpayer records in a timely way.  Encashment tax is a standard rate income tax deduction made by banks and stock broking firms when they make or receive certain payments.  Encashment tax receipts of just under &euro;31 million which had accumulated in the period 2012 to 2016 remained unallocated to taxpayer records at the end of 2016.  </p><p> Since the start of 2015, companies which qualify for a film tax credit are required to apply film withholding tax when they make certain payments to non-resident artists from outside the European Union and remit the amounts collected to Revenue.  Accumulated film withholding tax receipts of &euro;1 million remained unallocated to taxpayer records at the end of 2016.  Revenue subsequently developed systems to ensure more timely allocation of such receipts to taxpayer records.  The accumulated receipts of both taxes were allocated to customers records during 2017.</p></speech>

The focus of the meeting is on chapters 21 and 22 of the 2016 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, entitled Tax Debt and Write Outs and Allocation of Encashment and Film Withholding Taxes, respectively.  The meeting is also to consider the 2016 appropriation accounts, as well as the Revenue accounts for 2016 and 2017.</p> <p>  I will first address the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General in the two chapters of his 2016 report, setting out some of the background for context, as well as providing an update on progress in implementing the recommendations made.</p> <p>  Revenue plays a vital role in the economy by collecting taxes and duties due to the State.  In 2017 we collected a net &euro;50.76 billion in taxes and duties.  This is the seventh consecutive annual increase and was &euro;2.8 billion more than in 2016.  Provisional net tax collection to 31 May 2018 was &euro;20.48 billion, which was &euro;1.2 billion ahead of the figure for the same period last year.  Revenue's core strategy is to maintain and improve timely voluntary compliance, tackle non-compliance and prevent the occurrence of tax debt.  The maintenance of high rates of timely compliance, categorised by case size, in other words, by the amount of tax at risk in the event of late or non-payment, is a key measure of our performance and closely monitored.  Table 1, attached to my opening statement, sets out the rates of timely compliance each year in the period from 2013 to date.</p> <p>  It is clear the overwhelming majority of taxpayers want to be and are voluntarily compliant.  We acknowledge and value the important role of compliant taxpayers, businesses and their agents.  One of our core targets in the next three years is to reduce debt levels by increasing the rate of timely compliance for all other cases from 89% to the mid-90s range.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's 2016 report explains that tax debt falls into two main categories, namely, debt that is available to collect and debt that is not available to collect.  The latter mianly comprises debt that is the subject of appeal to the Tax Appeals Commission and insolvency related debt.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report reflects &euro;2.29 billion in total tax debt outstanding as at 31 March 2017.  Of this, &euro;1.19 billion was not available for collection, while &euro;1.1 billion was available for collection, equating to 1.68% of gross collection.  By comparison, at the end of March 2018, total tax debt was down 4% to &euro;2.2 billion.  This includes &euro;1.24 billion not available for collection and &euro;958 million available for collection, representing 1.35% of gross collection.  The committee will be interested to hear that the amount available for collection in 31 May 2018 was down to &euro;845 million.</p> <p>  To safeguard tax receipts due to the Exchequer and in support of the compliant majority, Revenue intervenes early when tax payments and filing obligations are not met.  Recognising that the more entrenched the debt becomes, the more difficult it is to resolve, our approach offers businesses and taxpayers an opportunity to deal with tax payment problems before they become unmanageable through early engagement.  When viable businesses or taxpayers with temporary payment problems engage with us honestly, we work with them to reach an agreed solution.  On 31 March 2017 there were 12,437 such businesses and taxpayers in phased payment arrangements in respect of &euro;116 million in tax debt.  At the end of March 2018, there were 10,833 phased payment arrangements in place, covering &euro;99 million in tax debt.</p> <p>  The small minority of taxpayers who either refuse to engage with us or refuse to pay their tax are met with enforcement action.  On 31 March 2017, &euro;328 million of debt available for collection was subject to enforcement proceedings.  During 2017 we referred more than 40,000 warrants to the sheriffs, while over 3,700 cases were referred for court recovery action, yielding a combined &euro;181 million in debt collected.</p> <p>  In order to secure a tax debt, Revenue may place a notice of attachment on a third party.  Attachment is an escalated option and normally used only where sheriff or solicitor enforcement has failed to secure payment of a debt or it is likely to be the only effective collection option.  In 2017 we issued 6,440 notices of attachment, yielding &euro;32 million for the Exchequer.  During 2017 we successfully petitioned the courts to liquidate 34 defaulting companies, while 22 individuals were adjudicated bankrupt by the courts on foot of a Revenue petition and 273 personal insolvency arrangements were agreed .</p><p>The Comptroller and Auditor General reported that, at the end of March 2017, &euro;661 million in debt available for collection was not the subject of either a payment agreement or enforcement action.  While &euro;390 million of this was more recent debt, &euro;271 million was more than one year old, had no payment agreement in place and no enforcement action initiated.  The Comptroller and Auditor General recommends that Revenue conducts an annual review of such debt.</p><p> I assure the committee that entrenched debt is always the subject of regular close oversight and, as at 31 May 2018, the recovery process has been finalised in respect of &euro;148 million, or 55%, of that older debt.  Of the remaining &euro;123 million, 93.5%, or &euro;115 million, is under active collection involving direct engagement between Revenue and the taxpayer, while the balance of &euro;8 million is likely to conclude in write-off as uncollectible debt due to the circumstances of the taxpayers involved.  As at 31 March 2018, the comparable figures to the &euro;661 million and the &euro;271 million are &euro;569 million, down 14% and &euro;221 million, down 18%.</p><p> Turning to debt write-out, it is inevitable that business failure or individual circumstances will sometimes make collection impossible.  In such circumstances, Revenue may write out the debt and suspend all collection activity.  Most debt write-out is on a case-by-case basis.  Debt may be the subject of partial write out, where the taxpayer is able to make some payments towards the tax due but unable to pay the debt in full.  Our write-out procedures and controls facilitate closer focus by Revenue on the debt with a reasonable prospect of collection.  During 2017, Revenue wrote out &euro;147 million in tax debt.  This related mainly to insolvencies and ceased trades, and represented a reduction of 30% on the write out figure of &euro;211 million in 2016.</p><p> The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General refers to receipts of almost &euro;31 million in encashment tax in the period 2012 to 2016 and &euro;1 million in film withholding tax in the period 2015 to 2016 that remained unallocated to taxpayer records at the end of 2016.  Unallocated receipts are transferred daily to the Exchequer.  The only exception to this occurs in December each year when the transfer is suspended to facilitate the end of year balancing of the Revenue account by its accountant general.  Unallocated receipts are reported in the annual revenue account on the balance sheet as an asset and under the corresponding liability.</p><p> In June 2016, Revenue introduced RevPay, an online payment facility for all major tax liabilities, including encashment tax and film withholding tax.  RevPay facilitates online payment by debit or credit card, or by using a single debit authority, and the taxpayer record is updated when the payment is made.  This new facility reduces reliance on electronic funds transfer, EFT, as a payment method and over time will help to reduce the level of unallocated tax balances for all taxes.  In 2017, Revenue completed a project which updated the customer record for all payments of encashment tax and film withholding tax, and there are currently no unallocated receipts of encashment tax or film withholding tax.</p><p> The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General recommends that systems should be quickly updated when new taxes are introduced, and this is in keeping with the objectives of Revenue.  However, the prioritisation of IT development resources requires proportionate allocation.  For example, PAYE modernisation and the introduction of real time PAYE reporting on 1 January 2019 is a priority project for Revenue this year.  As such, smaller developments may not always be completed as quickly as would otherwise be the case.  However, like film withholding tax and encashment tax, all required changes will be assessed and prioritised in the IT development schedule and integrated with other taxes at the earliest opportunity.</p><p> In keeping with the responsibility Revenue has to protect Exchequer funds, our resources are allocated based on risk.  Our debt management framework prioritises early intervention and action to drive positive taxpayer behaviour.  This gives the taxpaying public confidence that the system is fair, which, in turn, drives the very high rates of voluntary compliance.  In 2017, Revenue introduced a new case segmentation and compliance tracking system, providing greater oversight, enhanced whole case management and flexibility in matching debt management resources to business needs.  The new system is being implemented on a phased basis and all key elements are planned to be operational in early 2019.  The system has contributed to strong compliance outcomes and will also provide enhanced online customer services, thereby supporting positive compliance behaviour.</p><p> I will be happy to answer any questions raised by the committee.  In that context, I draw attention to my obligation to uphold taxpayer confidentiality, as provided for in section 851(a) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and which prevents me from commenting on the tax affairs of any individual or entity.</p></speech>

This morning, the Tax Appeals Commission, TAC, appeared before us, and to say that we were shocked by some of the things it said to us is putting it mildly.  It said there is no external phone system, that nobody can ring out or ring in, and that the computers of directors have blown up.  It reminded me of Manuel from "Fawlty Towers".  However, as the Chairman pointed out this morning, this is serious business, not just for those who are collecting tax but for the wider public and society.  Every time the witness appears before us, I state that we rely on tax revenue when we debate issues in both Houses every week, such as schools, hospitals and roads.  The witness knows this better than anyone; it is reflected in his remarks.</p> <p>  This morning, Mr. O'Mahony from the TAC said that he felt he was being stymied.  He also repeated the words of another person when he said that the TAC was being used as a back office by the Revenue.  Is that a fair comment?  Is there any truth to it?  Is it fair to say that the TAC did not create the backlog but rather inherited it from the Revenue?</p></speech>

We have also appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, to discuss the same issue.  It is useful to put the issue into context.  The TAC inherited a tax appeals system that was not fit for purpose.  From 2009 or 2010, my predecessor made it one of her lifetime ambitions, as chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, to reform the tax appeal system.  The previous Minister for Finance launched a consultation on tax appeals in, I believe, 2013.  It was one of the few times that Revenue, as an office, actually made a submission to the Department of Finance.  The TAC is independent of Revenue.  The office which preceded it was also independent.  We do not control the tax appeal system and we did not control it before the TAC was established.  The legislation to deal with tax appeals was very limited before the Finance (Tax Appeals) Act 2015 was commenced.  The TAC was then set up in 2016, and has been a major reform of the tax administration system.  The TAC did not create the problem because there was a legacy system which did not have the proper system around it to provide for the listing of cases.</p> <p>  I pay great attention to proceedings of the Committee on Public Accounts, particularly when tax is being discussed.  I watched the discussion this morning with the TAC.  Some of the statements made, which Mr. O'Mahony did not make but which he reported, are based on a submission that was made to a recent consultation provided for by the TAC.  I would be very wary of relying on submissions being made by what I see as vested interests.  The legal framework for how the appeals system works is set out in legislation.  We raise an assessment, or make a determination, or disallow a repayment.  Those are formal processes that are then, by law, subject to appeal to the TAC.  It is not a back office for the Revenue nor could it be.</p><p>In certain cases, there are issues around whether there are grounds for appeal.  Sometimes, people make appeals without having the grounds to do so, and the TAC must rule on that matter as well.  I do not in any way agree that we use the TAC as a back office.  However, there are a number of issues with the process, and I am willing to set out for the committee the detail around the transition to the TAC.  If the committee wants us to write-----</p></speech>

I cannot remember what phrase he used, but he mentioned that the transfer posed challenges.  What kind of review took place before the transfer from Revenue to the TAC?</p></speech>

We had to write to each taxpayer and ask him or her a series of questions.  Some appeals were in a legacy position and the taxpayers did not realise that they were still open.  They had to fill out a questionnaire, the first question on which was whether the appeal was still in existence.</p> <p>  The legislation also provided for an opportunity for agreement between Revenue and the taxpayer about the issue.  Subsequently, some practitioners said that they had believed they were going to get an opportunity to reach settlements, but I imagine what they thought was that, if the liability was X amount, we would settle for half of it.  We cannot do that, however.  We are obliged to interpret and apply the law.  What the legislation provided was an opportunity for engagement to see whether there could be agreement around the interpretation of the law or the quantum of the liability.  A good number of cases settled at that stage and did not proceed.  However, the taxpayer might have replied that he or she was interested in the appeal continuing.</p> <p>  The cases were transferred in three tranches, with the details set out, a spreadsheet all the cases and the notes on each.  In the period between the first and final tranches, there was a Supreme Court judgment on a case, which led to the settlement of approximately 100 follower cases.  It was a tax planning case that we lost.  Those cases had gone over in the first tranche, but they were then withdrawn because the assessments fell.</p> <p>  A process would have been followed at the end of November or December.  I have many details on when the cases went over.  The final set would have been transferred over and summarised in a final file transfer of all legacy cases-----</p></speech>

The difference between the two numbers is because, if there is an assessment of two years, for example, that is counted as two appeals even though there is only one taxpayer.</p> <p>  Regarding the commentary, and as if the legacy issues were not clear to everyone, the finance committee undertook pre-legislative scrutiny of the legislation before it was enacted.  The Chairman mentioned a few points he recalled from that process.  All of these figures were on the agenda.  One of the reasons the Minister authorised up to five temporary appeal commissioners was the significant legacy issues.  One temporary commissioner was appointed to join the two permanent commissioners.  If the committee would find it useful, I can set all this out in detail.  We cannot have an assessment that is then subject to appeal without us putting on an appeal stop to stop the collection.  While the appeal is waiting to be heard, the money is not due.  This morning, it was asked whether that interfered with someone's tax clearance certificate.  If an assessment is under appeal, the person is entitled to a tax clearance certificate.  The tax is not due.  That is just a bit of information.</p></speech>

What quantum of money is under appeal and what is the backlog?  The head of the Irish Tax Institute said that it could take ten years for the backlog to be cleared.  Should more be done at the Revenue stage to reach settlements before they go to appeal, given the ever-growing size of the logjam and the quantum of money involved?</p></speech>

We do not stop the engagement process just because there is an appeal.  The issue is that we have raised an assessment.  If that is as a result of an intervention by us, for example, an audit, we will have engaged with the taxpayer and his or her agent and set out our reasons for believing there is a liability.  Most of our audit settlements are reached without the raising of an assessment and the issuing of an appeal.  If there is an additional liability, it is settled by agreement and, hopefully, paid.  Where there is a disagreement at the end of an intervention, most appeal cases relate to an interpretation of the law whereas others relate to the quantum of the liability.  For example, the best records not necessarily being kept was mentioned this morning.  In such an instance, we would have assessed the liability and raised an assessment, which would then have been appealed.  Those cases are less precise because, if there are not proper records, we make assumptions.  However, we must have grounds to make an assessment.  Before we do, there will be an engagement with the taxpayer.  Assessments do not get entered lightly.  Following the appeal, we are open to dealing with reasonable grounds for settling the case.</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General has pointed to a reversal in the trend and an increase in gross debt, more than a quarter of which is classified as collectable but has been subject to neither pay agreements nor enforcement proceedings.  He also stated that &euro;271 million, or 41% of the debt, was over one year old.  Given the Comptroller and Auditor General's conclusions on the lack of payment agreements and enforcement proceedings on this collectable debt, why were they not in place in the first instance?  Mr. Cody has addressed the question of the subsequent process.</p></speech>

As to the figures set out by the Comptroller and Auditor General - I have since supplied the updated figure - approximately one third of the debt at any time is less than two months old and is in the process.  Before we refer debt to enforcement, we go through a process.  We do not refer cases to the sheriff as the first action.  We engage with the taxpayer and try to arrive at a debt agreement.</p><p>Of the &euro;271 million that was not subject to an enforcement and in respect of which there was no phased agreement, 55% has been recovered in the intervening year.  The equivalent figure in March 2018 was &euro;221 million, which is &euro;50 million less than it was at the equivalent time in 2017.  Obviously, &euro;221 million is not the same.  There is always a cycle of debt.  There is a table that sets out some figures.  We were looking at percentages.  In 2010 the debt available for collection was just under &euro;2.5 million and in 2015 and 2016 we were back at that level.  However, as a percentage of total tax it is a significant reduction.  In 2010 we collected &euro;30 billion.  In 2018 we are collecting &euro;50 billion, so it is a much smaller proportion.</p></speech>

Since then nearly &euro;1.8 billion in tax has been written off, which averages out to &euro;250 million a year.  In any man's language, or in layman's language, that is a significant amount of money, notwithstanding the increases in tax revenue in the eight year period.  In terms of getting that average down and reducing the proportion of tax collectable that is written off, does Mr. Cody have any assessment on whether that level of write-off is acceptable as a percentage of tax collected?</p></speech>

I was looking at it and the biggest proportion of it related to liquidations of companies in the property development and construction area arising from the collapse of the building industry.  Sometimes these liquidations take that length of time.  Some of them were unfortunately cases that had gone through a whole legal process of appeal, in which Revenue won at every level of appeal.  When these cases were settled the companies went into liquidation, leaving substantial debts.  That is one of the reasons we would be very keen to make the appeals process much speedier.  Some cases enter the appeals process partly as a strategy to ensure that those involved do not end up paying the money at all.  In the last figures the amount written off had decreased to &euro;147 million.  That reflects the recovering economy, but even in a recovering economy businesses will run into difficulty through no fault of the business itself.  Business failure is not all down to people engaging in sharp practice.  It is an inevitable part of the business cycle.  As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we are really keen to improve the timeliness of compliance in order to prevent moneys owed becoming debt.  On that increase in timeliness, our large cases have a 90% compliance rate in the month following the date of payment.  Compliance in medium-sized cases, which is to say cases involving a tax liability of &euro;200,000 to &euro;500,000, is now up to 98%.  Compliance in cases involving total liabilities of less than &euro;200,000 has increased from 81% in 2009 to 89%.  I would be really interested in having a target to improve that to approximately 95% over the next three years.  The Collector General will not like me giving that figure.</p></speech>

People sneak a look to see whether their neighbours are on it.  The 2017 annual report shows that the yields from audits and interventions came to &euro;500 million.  Some &euro;196 million of that came from audit and &euro;295 million from intervention.  I know the witnesses have done so before, but will they speak on the cost to Revenue of the audit process in comparison with the yields or the amounts brought in?  Will they comment on the types of business audit teams would focus on?  Does Revenue look at small operations at grassroots level with regard to back street operations or is the focus on larger operations?</p></speech>

We have discussed our compliance programmes here a good few times.  Over recent years we have probably become more sophisticated in that we now do fewer audits and more targeted risk-based interventions.  We obviously retain the right and need to do a significant number of audits but we are increasingly targeting single issues where there are risk indicators based on third party information.  I believe 2014 was the first year in which there was a comprehensive review of expenditure.  We made a submission to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform around that comprehensive review of expenditure.  In that submission we said that the return on investment from a fully-trained Revenue auditor is in the region of 10:1.  In the last number of budgets and Estimates processes, the Minister has supported that case.  While Deputy Michael Noonan was Minister he supported the case to Deputy Paschal Donohoe, who was Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Minister is now supporting that case to himself.  In the last four budgets we have been allocated additional resources but we have been given back a compliance dividend in the budget arithmetic.  That is the process.  We have our risk intelligence systems and carry out targeted risk-based audits.  We have discussed the return on targeted risk-based audits as opposed to the random audit programme here.  Approximately 70% of risk-based audits produce a yield compared to less than 30% of random audits.  In random audits the average yield is much lower than in targeted audits.</p></speech>

There were 24,000 such reports from financial institutions on something they were unsure about, such as an unusual lodgement.  We have a whole bank of information in our systems and we have it linked in and matched to the individual taxpayer.  That will inform our debt management team of what might be the appropriate recommendation.  We will then refer a debt to the sheriff.</p> <p>  As a result of the sheriff engaging with the taxpayer and where there are no assets or there is no engagement, some of the cases that have gone to the sheriff may be returned because there is not an appropriate method for the sheriff to follow up.  That case could then go to one of the solicitors perhaps for a judgment mortgage on a property.  Cases will be escalated to the appropriate intervention and then reviewed.  In some of the figures not subject to any payment arrangement or enforcement action, it can be seen that they have gone back from enforcement action because nothing can be done.

That is all I can say at this stage.  Revenue has an idea of the amount of tax that was due, as far as it was concerned, and that arrived in the appeals office.  Is that right?  Then, when the cases come back out, Revenue must know because the cases will come in and out.  Revenue either pays or collects the tax.  Mr. Cody is the person in receipt of the information.  The Tax Appeals Commission has no knowledge of this.  It does not handle the tax, as in what goes in and what percentage comes back out.  In other words, if 700 cases were decided last year, as the Tax Appeals Commission said, Revenue knows about the 700 and knows what it was hoping to get from those 700 when they went in.  How much did Revenue actually get out of those 700?  We just want to see this.  It is a mechanism of knowing how this operation is working.  If everything that went in came back out as it was, what is the point?  If there is a change, it tells us something has happened but no one seems to have any information on this.  It is akin to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  In social welfare, if somebody disputes his or her allowance or an entitlement to something and goes to the appeals office, the appeals office is there to adjudicate on A and B and reject C and D and it sends the case to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to go back and work out the figure.  The Social Welfare Appeals Office does not do the calculation.  It sounds as if the Tax Appeals Commission is akin to that.  It is up to Revenue to work out the figure, so Revenue has the information.  Has Revenue done any exercise yet on what comes in and out of the appeals office?</p></speech>

Perhaps it might help reduce the flow of cases into appeals if Revenue had something in its notification giving people the right of a review because it is said there is not much of that.  Again, in social protection, for example, if someone is not happy with the decision of a deciding officer, he or she can seek a review and it will be done by a different deciding officer.  The turnaround is quick and it probably eliminates some unnecessary cases going to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  Is Mr. Cody with me?</p></speech>

It is all available.  We publish this.  It is on our website.  The tax practitioners do not like it because the results of the reviews show that Revenue is predominantly successful, and the numbers are quite small.  Once the assessment is issued, the review process does not apply but before an assessment is entered there is a process, and we set out how many interventions we deal with.  The number of appeals went up in the 2017 process.  Some of this is accounted for by the fact that previously, when people used to write to us at assessment, they used to tell us they did not understand the process.  This is lost a bit because of the formal appointment of the Tax Appeals Commission.  We are open to exploring this.  We made a submission to the Tax Appeals Commission asking whether there are ways we can tidy up some of these smaller cases.  It is important to recognise that it is really a new office.  There are procedures that we would definitely be interested in exploring to see how we could do them.  We are open to anything that speeds up the process because the speedier it is resolved, the sooner we can collect the amount if it is due.</p></speech>

Did Revenue advance &euro;57 million?  Then there are the nursing home support scheme receipts, with the figure of &euro;19 million.  Did Revenue collect &euro;19 million?  I ask Mr. Cody to explain the two entries because people will probably be surprised to know about this.  I am looking at pages 8 and 9 of Revenue's 2017 accounts.  I ask Mr. Cody to explain this system to the public.  Revenue approaches these people.  Is it in scenarios where people defer their payments to later years?  I ask Mr. Cody to explain what has happened because I know this gets lost between the HSE and the Department of Health, but Revenue seems to handle the actual transaction.</p></speech>

Somebody applies for the fair deal scheme.  The HSE deals with the applications, and if people have property, they can enter into essentially a loan scheme with the HSE.</p><p>We are the collection agent for the HSE once the period is finished.  The legislation caps the amount of the repayment at 7.5% of the value of the property, capped at a three year maximum.</p></speech>

The maximum is 22.5% of the value of the house at the time the person goes into the nursing home.  Once the person dies or leaves the nursing home process, the amount of the loan repayment is fixed by the HSE and referred to us for collection.  The HSE has the facility to defer the process if, perhaps, a member of the family is still living in the house.  In the period from November 2010, when the first case was referred to us, until March 2018, a total of 5,327 were referred to us at a loan repayment value of &euro;101.6 million.  Of those, 3,921 have been finalised, resulting in repayments of &euro;69.8 million.  In 632 cases, involving &euro;16.3 million, that have been referred to us the amount is not yet due because there is a year from the date of death until the amount becomes due.  These are people who died or left the nursing home within the year.  There are 461 cases in which the HSE has advised us it has deferred collection of &euro;7.7 million.  In these cases the people involved did not apply for referral.  The cases were referred to us for collection but the people involved then went back to the HSE and they had a reason for deferral.  We mark them and do not follow them up.  In 313 cases, we are looking at a liability of &euro;7.9 million, and that is the debt available in these cases.  Obviously it is a sensitive area and we deal with them in a very sensible and safe way.  We sent the letter to the committee yesterday.</p></speech>

We have spoken previously before the committee about subcontractors and employees.  It is an active part of our job.  Recently, I was chatting to somebody in the building industry who told me that Revenue was out on a job he was on the other day.  He said he was delighted to see it.  There will be times we will arrive at the front gate and somebody will go out the back.  There are probably limited examples of this, but it does happen and it has always happened.</p></speech>

With regard to tobacco, periodically we see good news stories, predominantly through An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na tweeting and sending notices to the media about large-scale seizures, which are always very good to see.  Customs and Excise plays a considerable role in this.  In terms of small-scale tobacco sales in high street venues and markets, I want to focus on markets because I have a couple of markets in north county Dublin of very long standing.  If they are not decades old they are possibly over 100 years old.  They have been moved around a wee bit but they are still there and there is still quite a significant amount of illegal goods available.  It is of huge concern to people in the constituency because the markets have been there for so long and it is a tradition.  People do not like to break traditions just because some people are ruining it for others.  It is a general observation as opposed to something specific about these locations.  I know it is very common nationwide.</p></speech>

There are a couple of things we try to do with regard to illicit tobacco.  The big seizures are at point of importation and we seize a big container.</p><p>Generally, when it involves tobacco, Revenue leads.  In certain cases we are supported by the Garda, depending on who is involved.  We seize significant quantities of tobacco.  In 2017, it was 34.2 million cigarettes and this year to date, it was 27 million.  In 2016 it was 44.5 million cigarettes and in 2015 it was 68 million.  Those are mostly large consignments.  We also try to disrupt the supply chain within the market.  That is much more difficult because one will never catch someone with thousands of cigarettes.  They might have a few sleeves of 200.  We are regularly at all the markets across the country.  There are challenges, as the stock of cigarettes will often be somewhere down the road and be stocked up.</p></speech>

Of the large scale shipments that it captures at ports, does Revenue go back to the country of source?

On the large operations, we work closely with the Garda, the joint agency task force, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs and the PSNI.  We work closely with the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, which part-funds our major scanners.  If we come across new methodologies of smuggling or the involvement of international crime gangs or international hauliers, we feed that intelligence to our sister agencies across Europe and further afield, where necessary.</p></speech>

One thing that happens with trends is that they change as Revenue and customs agencies are successful at countering and intelligence.  Some of the things that are happening in Europe have had unexpected impacts on illegal trade.  The migrant crisis and tightening of borders have had a significant disruptive effect on tobacco.  The most interesting thing to happen in 2018 was the discovery of the illicit, illegal cigarette factory in County Louth in March, which we seized.  We discovered 23.5 million cigarettes which were being manufactured in what one could describe as a hay shed.  The Deputy may have seen some pictures of that.  We found some 71 tonnes of tobacco from which 71 million cigarettes could be produced.  That was a big operation, which is now before the courts.  That was the first illegal cigarette plant found in the State, but also nearly the first in western Europe.  It was an international operation.  The cigarettes would have been due for export, as well as for domestic service.</p></speech>

It was a really significant problem from 2012 on because there were changes to the system of sulphur content.  The diesel was indistinguishable once laundered.  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General did a report last year on mineral oil and the work Revenue has done there.  There has been a significant legislative process that culminated in the introduction of the new marker in conjunction with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs.  The level of retail traders engaged in selling illegal diesel has reduced significantly.  In 2016, we closed nine and in 2017 we closed four but around the middle of the decade, multiples of those figures were closed down.  The proportion of the vehicle market in diesel has increased anyway, but we have examined the additional revenue as a result of our work on fuel laundering and it has been really successful.  While I would not be complacent, the levels of sludge found and reported by local authorities, which was a very serious problem four or five years ago, have gone down significantly.  We are very careful about that process.</p></speech>

I recall them being in Meath or Louth or something like that.</p> <p>  This question relates more to process than to revenue but is it practical or feasible for such a firm to mix 10% of the capacity of whatever their forecourt tank is with an illicit product?  Is it detectable?  I know there are ISO standards and so on, but my question is are they really?  In the past four or five years, rather than more recently, I received many complaints about suspected green diesel.  About a decade ago, a former Fingal councillor's car was destroyed by green diesel.  I wonder if it is prevalent.  Is it as simple as watering it down to the point where it is not detectable?</p></speech>

There is the dye, green in our case and red in the North, and then the Accutrace marker, which is a detectable chemical marker.</p><p>The level of detection is quite sophisticated and the State Laboratory does all of the sampling for us, if a case is for criminal prosecution.  The levels will be detectable if road diesel is diluted with washed green or orange diesel.  Trace elements will be detectable and the case will be subject to prosecution.  The Comptroller and Auditor General made a recommendation in the chapter on the issue - the random sampling of retailers across the board.  We have done this and had no detections.  This is not to say it cannot get into the supply chain by direct hauliers or direct couriers, for which we will still check.  When we make interventions in businesses that have significant haulage interests, we look to make sure they are buying enough legitimately sourced goods from legitimate traders.  We pay a lot of attention to this area.  If members have details they wish to provide for us of retailers about whom they may have doubts, there is a good citizen report on our website.</p></speech>

If a business deals with a range of customers who suddenly disappear and do not buy from it anymore, generally it will know the customers who are buying from it.  We regularly meet trade groups and are told about the generality of shadow economy activity.  One of the things we have said, through the hidden economy monitoring group for trade interests, is that if we are given specific details, we will follow up on each of them.  It is not enough to say stuff is being sold somewhere down the road; we need hard facts.  Legitimate traders generally knows what is going on in their local business community.</p></speech>

I may have already asked this question, but it was a few years ago.  It comes as a surprise to a lot of people when we read the tax settlements published in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>and realise the money has not necessarily been paid.  It is a surprise to a lot of people who assume Revenue has collected the money.  I do not expect Mr. Cody to have the details, but for the settlements published for last year, how much did Revenue actually collect?  If he has the information, I will take the headline figure, but it would be a useful chart for the committee to receive.  I believe 99% of the public assume that if a person's name is in the newspapers having been caught for a sum of &euro;300,000, he or she has actually paid it.  The committee has previously established that this is not necessarily the case.  Revenue may just have got a judgment against the person concerned and not collected the money.

Revenue will probably conduct a big campaign ahead of its introduction to explain it, or perhaps people might only find out about it when they have a problem and so on.

Usually with the P35, there is a balancing statement - a balancing liability when things are fixed up at the end of the year.  It is one of the periods in which we have a spike in tax due.  After 2019, that system will be gone.  We will have a real-time feed and I hope we will be collecting the right amount as it falls due.  The payment dates for the employer are still based on a monthly arrangement.  They are still the same, but the reporting arrangement is different.  We are engaged in a significant information campaign.  We are out and about with employers and holding seminars, but the key stakeholders are many of the payroll providers - software providers - and they have been actively involved in the project for the past two years, developing their systems in conjunction with us.</p></speech>

We have had many significant days since this began.  This is probably the most significant one because it allows us to ask the committee directly to finish what we have started and to at least challenge the ECB on the injustice that has been done to Ireland and on the injustice that is still being inflicted on us.  I also pay tribute to the work of Fiona Fitzpatrick in securing this date for us.  Unfortunately, due to circumstances beyond her control, she cannot be with us.<br/><br/>There has been much coverage in the past few weeks of Anglo Irish Bank and events in the build-up to the banking crisis in Ireland.  There has been no coverage of the ongoing consequences of those events.  I am not only speaking about the billions in interest we will pay every year for many decades on the loans taken out to repair that damage; I am speaking about the promissory notes and Anglo Irish Bank debt legacy - &euro;500 million destroyed by our Central Bank in 2014; &euro;2 billion in 2015, &euro;3 billion in 2016; &euro;4 billion in 2017; and the &euro;1 billion that we know of destroyed so far this year.  That is &euro;10.5 billion destroyed by the Central Bank of Ireland since 2014 and a further &euro;3 billion in both 2011 and 2012, which is &euro;16.5 billion in total, with another &euro;14.5 billion still to go, giving &euro;31 billion in all. <br/><br/>Ballyhea Says Know began in March 2011 simply as a protest against this socialisation of private bank debt, that is, the massive bill presented to the people for the greed and excesses of so many in the private financial sector.  We realised quickly we were going to get nowhere simply through protest so we morphed into a campaign group.  We went to Brussels three times and met senior officials from all three major EU institutions - the Commission, the Council and the Parliament.  We went to Frankfurt to the ECB headquarters and presented a petition to a meeting of the governing council.  We nailed our list of protests to the door in the manner of Martin Luther more than 300 years earlier.  We sat down and spoke directly to senior ECB officials in Dublin, met the Governor of the Irish Central Bank on three separate occasions and had a Private Members' motion introduced in the D&aacute;il.  All this was backboned by a weekly march in Ballyhea and Charleville, joined by others in Ratoath, Dublin, Tralee, and Clonmel.<br/><br/>Through all those actions, we learned two outstanding lessons.  First, there is a willingness on the part of the institutions to engage with Ireland on this issue.  Second, willing as we are, that engagement will not be with the Ballyhea Says Know campaign.  It has to be at official level, which is principally why we are here today.  We ask the Oireachtas to set up a cross-party committee and to take this fight to Europe on behalf of the Irish people.  It will be a fight; we are under no illusions on that score. <br/><br/>I refer to the background to the crisis.  A currency requires many fundamental structural elements to enable it to withstand the shocks it will inevitably face.  When the euro was being designed in the 1990s and as politics took over from monetary common sense, member states understandably point blank refused to make the kind of sovereignty concessions such a common currency requires.  One by one, many of the critical supports were removed to such an extent that when the inevitable shocks came the currency inevitably collapsed.  This is not coming just from the Ballyhea Says Know campaign; this comes directly from those who were up close and personal to the euro design.  <br/><br/>In the early 1990s, Bernard Connolly was head of the European Commission unit responsible for the European monetary system and protecting the euro.  In his book &quot;The Rotten Heart of Europe: The Dirty War for Europe's Money&quot;, published in 1995, Connolly warned at length of the potential consequences of what was happening.  For his pains he lost his job.  Though his professional credentials and expertise in the area cannot be questioned - he now operates successfully in New York - it has been argued that Connolly is a sceptic and that it colours his views.  No such accusation could be levelled at Paul De Grauwe.  Highly respected and often used by the European Commission, a professor at the London School of Economics, De Grauwe also warned of the disastrous potential consequences if the euro was launched with those in-built flaws.  In an article published in the <i>Financial Times</i>in 1998 headlined, &quot;The euro and financial crises&quot;, he predicted almost to the letter what happened in Spain and Ireland.  He said:</p><blockquote>Suppose a country, which we arbitrarily call Spain, experiences a boom which is stronger than in the rest of the euro-area.  As a result of the boom, output and prices grow faster in Spain than in the other euro-countries.  This also leads to a real estate boom and a general asset inflation in Spain.  Since the ECB looks at euro-wide data, it cannot do anything to restrain the booming conditions in Spain.  In fact the existence of a monetary union is likely to intensify the asset inflation in Spain.  Unhindered by exchange risk vast amounts of capital are attracted from the rest of the euro-area.  Spanish banks that still dominate the Spanish markets, are pulled into the game and increase their lending.  They are driven by the high rates of return produced by ever increasing Spanish asset prices, and by the fact that in a monetary union, they can borrow funds at the same interest rate as banks in Germany, France etc.  After the boom comes the bust.  Asset prices collapse, creating a crisis in the Spanish banking system.</blockquote> <p>In 2013, he published a paper entitled, &quot;Design Failures in the Eurozone: Can they be fixed?&quot;, and, in 2015, he published &quot;Design failures of the Eurozone&quot;.  Others such as Milton Friedman in August 1997 and Martin Feldstein in November 1997 argued likewise that the design was fatally flawed from the outset.  This is all proof the euro as designed should never have been launched.  When it was, all that was predicted by De Grauwe and warned by Connolly happened and Ireland, as we know only too well, was particularly hard hit.  Billions of euro poured into the country.  Banks, trying to keep up with each other, with Anglo Irish Bank to the fore very early on, lowered their lending standards.  Regulators and central bankers lowered their guard.  Property prices ballooned until eventually it all exploded. <br/><br/>According to its website, the ECB manages the euro and frames and implements EU economic and monetary policy.  Its main aim is to keep prices stable, thereby supporting economic growth and job creation.  What was it doing as the various banking crises developed all across the eurozone?  What was it doing on keeping prices stable as property prices inflated to ludicrous levels in Ireland especially and in Spain?  While regulators and central bankers ignored the kind of major breaches of legislation such as those reported by Jonathan Sugarman here, where was the ECB?  It was neither seen nor heard.  That all changed after the crash as the ECB suddenly appeared front and centre as the Commission&rsquo;s enforcer as the troika came to town.  <br/><br/>One of the first measures taken to address the banking crisis was the establishment of the emergency liquidity assistance, ELA, funds, the clue for which is in the name.  The ECB website states that ELA aims to provide Central Bank money to solvent financial institutions that are facing temporary liquidity problems.  The Irish banks did not meet this criteria but came up with a way around it.  Using the Asset Covered Securities Act 2001 and the Asset Covered Securities (Amendment) 2007, they applied pre-crash historic valuations to the assets they held on their books.  This is in direct conflict with the most fundamental of accounting laws, which require that a true and fair reflection of the state of affairs must be presented.  An <i>AccountancyAge</i>article in June 2014 said:</p><blockquote>The true and fair accounting concept should be used to override compliance with reporting standards in exceptional circumstances, the UK&rsquo;s reporting watchdog has sa[i]d.  <br /><br />In a statement, the FRC [which is the Financial Reporting Council] reconfirmed that the presentation of a true and fair view remains a fundamental requirement of financial reporting and said that, in the &quot;vast majority&quot; of cases, a true and fair view will be achieved by compliance with accounting standards. <br /><br />However, where compliance with an accounting standard would result in accounts being so misleading that they would conflict with the objectives of financial statements, the standard should be overridden, the FRC said. <br /><br />&quot;The requirement to present a true and fair view in financial statements is enshrined in EU and UK law ...&quot; said Stephen Haddrill ... chief executive of the FRC.</blockquote> <p>Those hugely inflated values hid the true position of the Irish banks in the lead-up to the infamous blanket bank guarantee.  They hid that position again when applications were made for funding to the tune of billions of euro from the ELA funds.  As we were to finally discover in late 2008, those banks were not suffering temporary liquidity problems.  Had the true and fair valuations been used for the property collateral, they were, in fact, insolvent.<br/><br/>The most reckless of all the Irish banks throughout this period was Anglo Irish Bank, a point that was driven home by the publication of the so-called Anglo tapes.  The eventual cost to the country is enormous; &euro;35 billion was poured into the bank, &euro;25.5 billion by way of promissory notes and a further &euro;5.5 billion for INBS.  They were notes signed by the then Minister for Finance, the late Brian Lenihan, offering a guarantee to the ECB on behalf of the Government if Anglo should fail to repay those billions of euro.  Given how Anglo was disguising its true financial situation, those guarantees were offered under false pretences.  Given that the ECB, as the central bank of central banks in the eurozone, should have been aware of this misreporting, those guarantees are null and void.</p><p>Under enormous pressure from the ECB, however, that is the &euro;31 billion currently being borrowed by the NTMA, given to the Central Bank in exchange for the promissory note bonds, and then destroyed, taken out of circulation.  This ongoing obscenity must end or at the very least it must be challenged.  That brings me back to the start.<br/><br/>The troika&rsquo;s intervention in Ireland in 2011 has been presented as a bailout for Ireland.  It was not.  It was a bailout by Ireland of the eurozone, a bailout in which successive Governments were strong-armed by the EU, with Germany and France in particular abusing their combined political and economic muscle.  Including the &euro;5.5 billion from NAMA, we poured a mind-boggling total of &euro;69.7 billion into our banks &ndash; a world record of the undesirable kind.  Against that we got loans, not gifts, of &euro;67.5 billion from the troika at inflated interest rates.<br/><br/>We are told that Germany is a rock of financial sense.  All those interventions by the ECB were not to save Irish banks &ndash; it was to save the megabanks in the bigger EU countries.  A Bloomberg article from May 2012 quotes a report of the Bank of International Settlements, which outlines how:</p><blockquote>German banks had amassed claims of $704 billion on Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, much more than the German banks&rsquo; aggregate capital.  In other words, they lent more than they could afford.<br /><br />When the European Union and the European Central Bank stepped in to bail out the struggling countries, they made it possible for German banks to bring their money home.  [That is exactly what has happened].  As a result, they bailed out Germany&rsquo;s banks as well as the [German] taxpayers who might otherwise have had to support those banks if the loans were not repaid.  Unlike much of the aid provided to Greece, the support to Germany&rsquo;s banks happened automatically, as a function of the currency union&rsquo;s structure.</blockquote><p>They were in over their heads in Wall Street as well.  This was exposed by Mr. Michael Lewis in his brilliant book, later a film, which I recommend to everybody, <i>The Big Short</i>.<br/><br/>We accept that when the bank crisis hit, the ECB and everyone else involved faced an emergency situation and took emergency measures to save the eurozone&rsquo;s banks, some of which meant a very loose interpretation of rules and regulations.  We accept also that as a full member of the eurozone from day one, Ireland must share the cost of what happened.  What we do not accept is that the banking collapse was Ireland&rsquo;s own fault, and it was most certainly not the fault of the people.  We also do not accept that Ireland&rsquo;s own bankers acted any worse than bankers elsewhere and certainly were no worse than bankers in Germany.What we will not accept, now or ever, is that we should be forced by the EU, and by the ECB in particular, to bear a disproportionate cost for that banking collapse across the eurozone.  That cost has a direct impact on all the current crises being suffered in this country, from homelessness to housing, and to what is happening in our health service and all points in between.  We have taken this as far as we can and it has not been easy.  Today, we are asking the elected representatives of the Irish people, as a cross-party committee, to step forward, take over this campaign from us and right a wrong that has been done to all of us in this country.  Those promissory notes must be challenged.</p></speech>

They are behind us and accompanied by Senator Wilson and colleagues from the representative office of Taiwan in Dublin.  The Control Yuan is a very powerful body within government in Taiwan and does work similar to this committee and the work of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General etc.  They are here to meet their colleagues in Ireland.  I wish them well with all of those meetings and thank them for their attendance.  I also acknowledge the work done by the Taiwanese representative in Ireland, Mr. Simon Tu, over the last number of years.  His engagement with members here has been positive and helpful and he has grown a great relationship in respect of trade, commerce and cultural links with Taiwan.  Long may that be the case.  They are very welcome and I hope they enjoy their stay in Ireland.  I call Deputy Paul Murphy.</p></speech>

I pay tribute to all of them, and Ms Fiona Fitzpatrick, for the work they have done against the powerful forces they are up against.  It is a community and a campaign fighting for debt justice for people in this country.  I agree with the call for a cross-party committee but I also warn that I do not think they will be able to wind up their campaign.  It will be necessary to keep pushing because if they were not pushing from the outside then the pressure will not be there.  Even if a cross-party committee is set up, and I support that, I encourage the witnesses to keep going with their campaign because they have got to this point but it will take more to do it.</p> <p>  The work Ballyhea Says Know has done is valuable in two broad respects educationally.  One is the myth busting that this was a bailout for Ireland.  I agree it was not - it was a bailout for the European banking system, paid for by ordinary people through years of austerity and the misery that caused.  Less than 1% of Europe's population took on more than 40% of Europe's banking debt.  The second point, and the one I want to home in on, is the other even more dangerous myth.  That is the idea that we are where we are - this is all very unfortunate, it is something that happened in the past, we were pressured into, maybe we should not have done it back then but we are where we are, it is done and there is nothing that can be done about it.  I want to focus on that.  Will Mr. O'Flynn explain what is happening now regarding the destruction of money by the Central Bank?  There has been &euro;10.5 billion destroyed since 2014 and there is another &euro;14.5 billion to go.  Will Mr. O'Flynn explain how that works, why it does not make sense, from the point of view of people in this country, and what the alternative is?  </p></speech>

It is difficult to get information on what is happening at the moment.  Deputy Michael McGrath asked a parliamentary question last year which uncovered how much had been destroyed up to now.  We were speculating because sometimes one misses these reports, another &euro;500 million has been destroyed, but one does not know it has happened.  The only place where it is reported is on the RT&Eacute; news website and in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  That is basically a copy and paste report and it looks to me like something that has been fed out from either the Central Bank or the Department of Finance.  Every time something happens, the reports are almost identical to the previous one issued.<br/><br/>They declare it to be almost a good news story - the Central Bank has made a profit on this IBRC wind-up note.  It was declared that a profit of &euro;150 billion went to the Exchequer because a &euro;500 million bond was sold for &euro;650 million or whatever.  It is presented as a good news story because the country has made &euro;150 million.  What is not told is the full story and that is why I have a major problem with some media here.  They talk about fake news but there is also incomplete news and that is almost as bad as fake news - in fact it can be worse.  We are not told what happened to the &euro;500 million.  Let us say that the Central Bank got &euro;650 million and it gave &euro;150 million to the Exchequer but what happened to the &euro;500 billion?  That is never mentioned.<br/><br/>That &euro;500 million is destroyed.  I backed the former Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan, into a corner one day when in the company of two MEPS, namely, Mr. Luke 'Ming' Flanagan - I was not working for him at the time - and Ms Nessa Childers, the late Deputy Peter Mathews, who was a brilliant friend to this campaign, and Deputy Stephen Donnelly, who should also know his finance.  What Professor Honohan eventually said, when I pressed him on what happens to the money, was that the money was extinguished.  That is what is happening with this money.  The &euro;31 billion was printed by the Central Bank and given to these banks.  The ECB allowed this to happen but because these banks were wound up and were unable to repay that money, the aforementioned &euro;31 billion must be taken back out of circulation.</p><p> Under the deal done by Deputy Noonan, there were ten &euro;500 million bonds, five of which were to be sold at a rate of one per year under a new arrangement from 2014.  However, with interest rates going down, these bonds were bought by the NTMA, although people are not being told this.  The Central Bank is getting &euro;650 million but it is from the NTMA so it is all borrowed money that is buying these bonds.  Even the &euro;150 million which is declared as profit is money that was borrowed by the NTMA.  The &euro;650 million is given for the &euro;500 million and the latter is destroyed, with the rest declared as a profit for the Exchequer.  All that is being reported is that we are making a profit of &euro;150 million.  It is not being reported that the transaction is circular.  The &euro;650 million becomes new debt which attracts interest and which will have to be repaid in full when the bond matures.</p><p> This country has been crying out for money over the past four years.  When people such as Deputy Paul Murphy suggested that money was needed for Irish Water or to fix the hospital system, highly-paid radio presenters were asking, "Where would we get the money from?"  Our Central Bank has destroyed &euro;10.5 billion in the past four years with borrowed money.  The NTMA could have used this money for other things but it, along with this Government, chose to accelerate the destruction process.  People say this is computerised money but the debt is real and the interest we are paying is real, as are the suffering and deprivation of services.  There is &euro;10.5 billion or &euro;14.4 billion still to go but this is an obscenity at a time when our services are struggling for finance.</p></speech>

We did not have much of a clue when this started.  We went to the ECB and to all the various officials, including the most senior that work for the Commission.  We met the official responsible for Ireland's finances at the time of its intervention, and who had responsibility for the macrofinances of three countries.  He was one of the most senior economists and had a string of letters after his name.  We sat and debated with him for an hour but he could not show us how what they were doing was right.  We met senior officials from the troika for nearly two hours, having met Patrick Honohan of the Central Bank.  I have never been so depressed coming out of a meeting because that guy just patronised us.  He almost patted my colleague on the head and suggested it was way over our heads.  We laid out our case to the ECB and they said it could be tackled.  They said it would be very difficult but that is was not impossible.  I come from a small parish and we have teams trying to get to the under-14 final, the junior final and the senior final.  They are all difficult but just because they are difficult does not mean it should not be attempted.  One picks one's best team and trains to the nth degree to go into battle.  This battle can be won.  The ECB said things could not be done - such as quantitative easing - when we were at the beginning of the crisis before going on to print &euro;80 billion per month.</p></speech>

In reality, the fact that we are burning money means what is happening is quantitative squeezing.  If we froze the sale of the bonds and wrote down the debt, would there be any negative implication in terms of inflation across the eurozone?  What other negative implications might there be?</p></speech>

It is difficult to take on the ECB but that is what we should do.  It is not just on the basis of morality that this can be challenged - and it is immoral - but it can also be challenged in terms of legality.  We have commissioned reports suggesting other avenues that can be explored, which I can send to members.  The ECB must be challenged and we must stop the sale of further bonds now.  As members will know, if a person owes another person money, once the money has changed hands it is a lot more difficult to get it back.  We should also be fighting to get back what has been lost.  All the ECB would have to do is reprint the &euro;14.5 billion as it would be a drop in the ocean for the ECB.</p></speech>

I went to London and did accountancy for a year and a half but I could not take London because the weather was like this.  I came back and was involved in construction for over 20 years as an engineer and subcontractor.  Then I got into sports journalism and worked in the cartoon section of the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, where I was for over 20 years before being recruited by Luke &quot;Ming&quot; Flanagan to advise him on economic matters in Brussels after this issue emerged.  I have no qualifications in this area.<br/><br/>We know what we know but there is an awful lot we do not know.  This is not just a question of economics, there is also a question of right and wrong.  That is the bigger question for me.  What was done to us was wrong and even the guy from the IMF accepts this.<br/><br/>We did not have the support structures in place for a new currency when it was launched and they are trying to put them in now, with the Single Supervisory Mechanism, the Single Resolution Mechanism and the ESM.  They were needed at the very beginning.  If they had been in place when the banking crisis hit Ireland, the shock would have been absorbed across the entire eurozone and we would not have been landed with that bill.</p></speech>

I am not the most diplomatic of people.  We had been due to meet Mr. Rodriguez, the head of ECB delegation here.  I believe his father died that week.  When we went to meet the two men, I expressed my disappointment that we were not meeting the senior person, which, to me, reflected bad manners on their part.  One of the men who did most of the talking explained to us that he was senior to the other fellow.  He was the most senior official.  We have not lied about anything, but they did not want their names to be used.  I explained that we were producing a report on the meeting with both the Central Bank and them and he said it was okay, that, by all means, we could do so, but he asked that we not mention their names.  Ms Fiona Fitzpatrick was there with me.  That is a significant point.  When he said it was would be very difficult, we mentioned that it would not be impossible.</p></speech>

A case has been heard before the Supreme Court, but a verdict on the point I mentioned about the use of historical valuations for their assets has not yet been delivered.  There is a major difference in that respect.  Accounting standards were changed and international accounting standard, IAS, 39 was introduced here in 2005.  Under the accounting standards, it allowed bodies to use historical valuations.  If one had a property, one could have used a mortgage valuation from two or three years previously.  That is a standard, but there is major difference between a standard and the law.  Where there is a difference between a professional accounting standard and the law, the law takes precedence.  The official said that in Britain in 95% of cases - Deputy Michael McGrath is an accountant and will understand this - if one went by the standards, one would also be complying with the law.  If one was to give a lower value to one's house which had appreciated in value, one would not be misrepresenting it in the sense that somebody might be investing in it.  However, in this case they were overstating the value of what they had on their books by a ratio of almost  2:1.</p></speech>

I thank the delegates for appearing before the joint committee and the work they have been doing for many years.  There is no doubt that the actions of Mr. O'Flynn's group were  instrumental.  The blog he wrote in the early stages which showed, on a weekly basis, the guaranteed and unguaranteed debt being paid by the State was instrumental in shaping the debate at the time.  Information is power and by putting it into the public domain it forced the then Government to deal with some of the challenges from groups such as his and others within the Houses.</p> <p>  It important to hear again the fact that we are continuing to pay Anglo Irish Bank's debt on a month by month and year by year basis and that that will continue to be the case for many years to come.  There is much debate about the state of the economy and the upcoming budget, reducing debt and not borrowing to deal with other social crises, but, as Mr. O'Flynn has made clear, we are continuing to borrow money to nullify the promissory note given to Anglo Irish Bank in 2010 and that will continue to be the case.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Flynn has made the point that it is not just about economics, it is also about the rights and wrongs of this.  I could not agree more with him.  There is not anything in his presentation with which I do not agree, except in the case of the some of the bankers.

Does Mr. O'Flynn believe that provides additional scope for a more robust challenge in that regard?  For example, if I was to enter into a contract with him based on information he had provided for me that was proved to be fraudulent, it would nullify my contract with him.</p><p>Is there an argument in that regard?</p><p> The sin of all this is that it is occurring nearly every six months.  The Central Bank is selling off at an accelerated rate what are now the Government bonds.  When the Government liquidated IBRC, it did a terrible thing.  It changed the promissory note into State-owned bonds.  This was absolutely appalling.  Worse, it presented it as a victory for the Irish people.  While there was an important reduction in regard to how we dealt with this on a year-by-year basis, the debt still remained and the bill still existed.</p><p> Of the &euro;34 billion that was in the promissory note, only &euro;14.5 billion has not been paid back so far.  Does the argument now centre only on what remains?  That question is on the strategy.  Some &euro;14.5 billion in bonds are now held by the Central Bank of Ireland.  The other bonds do not exist anymore.  As the delegates said, the money has been destroyed.  Alternatively, does the delegation argue we should revisit the issue of the &euro;34 billion?</p></speech>

For us, this has just been about getting bank debt justice for Ireland.  With regard to justice on foot of the actions of individuals who did whatever they did, we never got involved.  That is an issue for the courts and the people here.  We know white-collar crime in this country is not punished anyway.  Our view is that jailing somebody only costs us money.  Where people are found to have committed white-collar crime, especially on this scale, the fitting punishment is to strip them of all their assets and put them on a Government pension if they are of an age and in a council house, just as they did to an awful lot of people in this country.  Jailing them costs us money.  The only way to teach manners and lessons regarding white-collar crime is to hit people where it hurts.  Since greed is the cause, they should be hit where it hurts, namely, their pockets.</p> <p>  On the issue of whether fraudulent behaviour is a ground for appeal, of course it is.  We are talking about the declaration used not only by Anglo Irish Bank but also by all the other Irish banks.  In the lead-up to the blanket bank guarantee, the banks deliberately and knowingly misrepresented the true and fair value of what they had in their books.  They were actually insolvent at that time.  They were not suffering from liquidity problems; they were insolvent.  This would have been revealed had they declared the true and fair value, which they were legally obliged to do.  I am not referring to standards because they were complying with the standards.  Standards comprise one thing; the law is another.  They were not complying with the law.  Therefore, they completely and deliberately misled the Government in the lead-up to the blanket bank guarantee.  They also misled the European Central Bank.  I do not believe the European Central Bank was fully aware of what was happening.  It should have been but I do not know whether it was.  That is why Mr. Trichet clamped down so hard on the Irish banks.  They were using a standard that no other country in Europe was using to misrepresent their true circumstances.  It was on that basis that they were the getting money from the emergency liquidity assistance fund.  On those grounds, the promissory notes are invalidated.</p> <p>  Our fight now is not just for the &euro;14.5 billion.  In fact, it is not just for the &euro;31 billion.  Thirty-five billion euro was put into Anglo Irish Bank.  People forget that a lot of money was taken out of our National Pensions Reserve Fund.  Nearly &euro;20 billion was taken out of the fund to be put into banks.  It was not just what was borrowed.  We took this out of our own pockets and put it into the banks.  It is not just a question of that money because one should also consider the interest lost on that money over the years.</p> <p>  A conservative estimate with regard to the National Pensions Reserve Fund is that &euro;25 million to &euro;30 million was lost.  We should ask the European Central Bank and perhaps the Council not just for the &euro;31 billion.  Some &euro;69.7 billion is involved.  It would not take a genius or actuary to calculate what we got back from the sale of the AIB shares lately and what we got back from Bank of Ireland.  The relevant figures should be offset against one another to determine the figure we were forced to put in and what we believe we should have put in proportionate to our population in the eurozone.  This is what we are arguing about.</p></speech>

It is very short.</p> <p>  The promissory note has caused serious damage, as Mr. O'Flynn said.  The Government does not intend to reclaim a penny of the &euro;34.7 billion.  As the injections went in, starting at figures of 12,000 in 2010, up to 34,000, not one debate or vote was required in this House regarding any of the promissory notes signed by the Minister.  As we approach the tenth anniversary of the guarantee, does Mr. O'Flynn believe it would be appropriate to repeal the legislation that allows for a Minister solely to provide that type of financial commitment to financial institutions?  This committee scrutinises every line of expenditure from Departments but the provision to which I refer allows a Minister to commit billions upon billions of euro of Irish taxpayers' money without any scrutiny or recourse to a vote within the House.  Is legislative repeal something the delegates call for or support?</p></speech>

We elect people to look after these matters.  It is not something we get involved in.  Personally, I find it absolutely extraordinary that it could happen.  As the Deputy said, the D&aacute;il can examine line by line what is proposed to be spent in a budget but a Minister for Finance can still do what the Deputy described.  It does not stop at &euro;31 billion because no limit or figure is set, which means any amount can be committed by a Minister.  Absolutely, the matter should be examined.</p></speech>

I also welcome Deputy Joan Collins.  I thank Mr. O'Flynn for his presentation.  I join others in commending the group.  It is a group of immense conviction.  It has stayed the course on this issue.  As Deputy Pearse Doherty said, it has helped to shape public debate and has had influence - more than its members might think.</p> <p>  Based on the figures Mr. O'Flynn is presenting, more than half of the debt, as such, has been sold on in the form of Government bonds.  Another &euro;14.5 billion, Mr. O'Flynn says, is still resting with the Central Bank.  Is his position that we should not advocate that Ireland take any form of unilateral action?</p></speech>

Its argument is that this funding was temporary and has to be taken out of the system, as such, because otherwise it would increase the amount of money in supply, resulting in the printing of money and so on.  Who should pay this bill ultimately?  The senior bondholders were repaid.  The junior bondholders took losses of approximately &euro;15 billion across the banks but the senior ones were all paid in full.  More than half of the money is now Government debt, which is sovereign debt.  The balance is debt also but it is with the Central Bank of Ireland as opposed to being held by third parties.</p><p>Ultimately, who should share this burden?</p></speech>

It is already out there; it is in circulation.  What the Central Bank is doing is taking it back out of circulation.  That is what the destruction of the money is about.  Nobody would actually be paying for this.  It is just money that is in circulation.</p> <p>  On the use of the emergency liquidity funds and the ECB's responsibility in that area, the argument we are putting forward is that the grounds on which the emergency liquidity assistance was granted were wrong.  Its granting broke the ECB's rules and regulations.  This assistance was for banks suffering from liquidity problems.  It was specifically not for insolvent banks.  Those banks presented a false picture of their true state of affairs.  It was a false picture of which the ECB should have been aware.  They were using accounting standards as opposed to the law in order to get around those EU rules and regulations.  I have the actual promissory note; it is literally just a note.  The ECB must have known then that these banks were not suffering liquidity problems.  There were insolvent banks.  That money should never have been issued.  That is the argument we have made.  It should never have been issued.  As the bank of last resort and as the central bank of all the central banks of Europe, the ECB should have said "No".</p> <p>  The ECB at the time feared that if any bank in the eurozone failed, even one of the smaller Irish banks, the system would break down because of the domino effect.  This is on the record.  It felt that it would bring down the entire eurozone banking system.  It was right.  As I have shown in my presentation, the Bank for International Settlements calculated that, at that time, the German banks alone were exposed to the banks of the periphery to the value of more than $700 billion.  If they went down, the big banks across Europe - Deutsche Bank, Bank BPS and so on - were also going to come down.  There was a study done late last year by a German university on where the so-called Greek bailout funds went.  I can send the Deputy the link.  It found that 91% of the &euro;240 billion or &euro;250 billion that supposedly went to Greece actually went straight out the back door to the German, French and other banks that were exposed to Greece.  I have read that in there as well.  The ECB was right in its fears.  That is why it demanded that the Irish banks pay everything and would not let them to fail on anything.  That is also why it allowed the use of the emergency liquidity assistance fund for insolvent banks.  It wanted them to keep their doors open.</p></speech>

The members of the committee are meeting the ECB in September.  There will be an opportunity to follow up on this in Frankfurt at that stage.  I hope to be there.  I will also raise the issue with colleagues.  We can liaise with Mr. O'Flynn prior to that.  What would he say to the argument we are likely to hear back, namely, that the general political narrative across Europe is that Ireland is doing exceptionally well?  The economy is one of the fastest growing in Europe.  While our debt, at &euro;200 billion or so, is large, in nominal terms it is falling quickly as a proportion of the size of our economy.  It will also be said that there are far bigger priorities including the migration crisis and Brexit and that there is really no justification for making an exception to policy for Ireland because we have recovered well and the model worked.  We are likely to hear that we should move on.  That could well be the response.</p></speech>

It would not matter whether Ireland was still in the very depths of despair - which an awful lot of people are and a huge proportion of this country still is - what happened was wrong and has to be challenged.  It is that simple.  The argument members are more likely to hear is that which the Deputy presented earlier, namely, that it was a Government guarantee so it is the responsibility of the Government and our banks and bankers.  The main thing here is that German banks and German bankers were the most irresponsible.  I can send the Deputy another link.  Much like the big short on Wall Street, the German banks were reckless beyond belief, even more so than their Irish counterparts.  They exposed themselves and they are still exposed.  Danske Bank is still massively exposed and in massive danger even now.  People have this notion about the responsible Germans.  We bailed them out.  The committee should make no mistake about that.  We bailed them out, as did the Greeks, the Spanish and the Portuguese.  The money that came into these countries in the form of loans, which are now being repaid by the people, went to German, French, Dutch and other banks.  That is where it went.  It did not go to bailing out the people.  This is what the socialisation of debt has meant.  It means that we are carrying the can not only for the Irish banks.  A few of them should have just been let go.  There is an argument that the entire system had to be saved, but we have been presented with a disproportionate and much larger part of the bill than we should have been.  That should be our argument.</p></speech>

Was the restructuring of the promissory note just as important as the promissory note?  Prior to the restructuring of the promissory note, the State paid &euro;3.1 billion in 2011, which came out of current spending and had a drastic effect on the resources available.  I know that there is interest on the moneys being borrowed but did the restructuring in 2013 not remove the need for that draconian measure and alleviate the pressure on the State in the context of what it could allocate per annum regarding day-to-day expenditure for services for ordinary citizens?</p></speech>

The then Minister for Finance, the late Brian Lenihan, said on numerous occasions that it was a liquidity problem.</p><p>He did not think that up himself.  He was going on advice from the Department of Finance.  How complicit were the Central Bank and the Department of Finance in the negotiations that went on behind the scenes to give that advice to Brian Lenihan, who wrote the document?  He was not going on his own advice, he was advised.  Behind the scenes, there must have been a great deal happening.</p></speech>

The reason they thought it was a liquidity problem was because that was what was presented to them by the auditors and accountants of the banks.  They did this because they were using historic valuations.  They were not using the true and fair valuations.  They were presented with a false picture.  That is why they thought it was a liquidity problem when actually the banks were insolvent.  We cannot blame them because they were presented with a false picture, because of the accounting standards that were used, but they did not comply with the law.</p> <p>  On the other issue, Deputy Pearse Doherty already referred to the changeover in 2012 by the then Minister, Deputy Noonan.  That is when this could and should have been challenged, because at that stage it was not actual Government debt.  It was on the basis of a promissory note.  It was at that stage the ECB should have been challenged and told we are not doing this and that we would simply not destroy &euro;3.1 billion every March.  The ECB should have been challenged at that point because Ireland had the high moral ground.  In addition, the ECB was very vulnerable at that time.  It was still in panic mode and searching all over.  It was blindly reaching all over the place.  Ireland was in a very strong position at that stage.  Instead, what the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, did to alleviate his own financial position - he was taking &euro;3.1 billion out of the spending every year simply to alleviate his own position as Minister for Finance - was that he restructured.  The value was not dropped by 1 cent.  He restructured what remained of the entire promissory note and kicked it out to be paid by future generations.  It was a sell-out of future generations of massive proportions.  He did not have the bottle to take on the ECB, which he should have done.  He was in a strong position to do so.</p></speech>

In the case I took the Supreme Court, the court stated that the time was exceptional and that it was an exceptional measure in exceptional circumstances.  The court backed the Constitution.

First I want to thank the committee for the opportunity to speak here today.  I represent a number of former EBS agents, many of whom have given up to 33 years committed service to EBS Limited, formerly EBS Building Society.  All have suffered financial and personal stress as a result of the difficulties experienced by EBS itself.  Our reputations were also impaired even though we were committed to an honest service and recognised the importance of the duty of care we owed to members.</p> <p>  The EBS tied agency business model is unique to EBS in the Irish market.  The tied agent is an independent business entity exclusively tied to EBS.  Tied agents sell the full suite of EBS products, operate on a licence agreement with EBS and are regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland.   The customer experience is the same as that from an EBS branch outlet.  The branding, look and feel and back-office operations are all the same as with the branch, and the business is run by a local agent and staff.  Beginning in 1935 the Educational Building Society built up a very positive reputation among its members.  Agents, including myself, were paid commission for the mortgages and investment products that were sold.  We had no control over whether mortgages were approved or not.  From this commission from the mortgages that were executed, however, we covered the costs of running the agency including office rental, staff and all of the usual costs associated with any small SME.</p> <p>  In January the management surprised the agents and the network in general by introducing an incentive scheme which focused on maximising sales.  There is potential for incentive schemes to encourage mis-selling.  Potential investors may buy unsuitable products without fully realising the risks.  Under the new structure the survival of agents depended heavily on the commissions they generated instead of focusing on ensuring that the needs of the member were actually met.  In our view the incentive scheme was far too short-term in focus, at the expense of the long-term reputation of EBS and their agents.  After expressing our concerns, one non-executive director offered to support us.  An independent investigation was proposed.  Sadly both the report that was concluded and the terms of reference were not made available to us, so this initiative was of limited use. </p> <p>  A second underlying but equally important problem was the inability of EBS to provide mortgages that agents could sell.  This resulted in a considerable loss of commission and put the agents under pressure to make up the shortfall by selling investment products.  This is a very unsatisfactory situation to be in, as the desperate desire to earn commission from investment products may weaken the fiduciary duty that agents owe to their members.  As Mr. Cormac Butler will explain, there were a few policy decisions taken by EBS which, in hindsight, contributed significantly to the avoidable problems that EBS and their agents faced. </p> <p>  We spoke to the officials from the Central Bank and we note the comments from a member of the Irish Bank Officials Association, now known as the Financial Services Union.  The problem is widespread.  The Central Bank is now attempting to examine and change the culture of Irish banking, but there are considerable hurdles in their approach.  We have attempted to engage with EBS on this matter but, after seven years trying, a solution seems unlikely.  I thank the committee for listening and will pass over to Mr. Butler now.</p></speech>

I am a risk consultant based mainly in the UK, and cover issues like the Basel Accords and the international financial reporting standards, IFRS.  Previously I have given evidence to the UK House of Lords on the UK banking crisis.</p> <p>  The failure of EBS to originate new mortgages has put considerable pressure on the tied agents.  Many were not able to meet the commission targets from investment products and risked compromising their reputation through aggressive sales in order to make up for the commission lost on mortgages. </p> <p>  A number of weak policy decisions taken by EBS may have contributed to this problem.  EBS faced closure from the capital markets when it came to raising funds and in the end had to receive Government bailouts, as well as cutting back considerably on the amount of mortgages it offered, a factor that caused considerable distress to the tied agents. </p> <p>  One matter that contributed to the banking crisis, that is not yet corrected, is the obligation to reveal the financial position of the society to existing and potential investors and depositors.  According to some, building societies are not allowed to reveal their solvency position, with the result that it will be very difficult for them to attract investors and fund mortgages.  The cost of capital for Irish banks is unusually high, and this is because investors do not find Irish banks a safe and attractive proposition.  The result is that tied agents cannot sell mortgages as they once did.  </p> <p>  EBS received a State bailout of about &euro;2.3 billion and suffered a 57% discount on assets sold to NAMA.  Its failure to attract funds forced it into a firesale of assets which in turn led to further losses.  Tied agents were naturally unready for this change in circumstance and in my view would have benefited considerably if the correct financial position was disclosed. </p> <p>  I am convinced that the difficulties of the tied agents could have been avoided if the directors were permitted to reveal their financial position correctly at an earlier stage.  There is a lot of misleading information on this matter which I believe the committee should look into.  In the UK there are the same concerns.  Thames Valley Police Commissioner, Mr.  Anthony Stansfeld, has suggested examining how banks measure their solvency and believes that many financial transactions may be overturned unless this matter is corrected.  Thank you.</p></speech>

In 2011 we were told that lending had dried up and we were asked to focus on bank assurance sales, which is investment model selling.  As agents, we had a number of concerns.  We were a mutual building society and as such we did not have customers, we had members and we had a duty of care to them.  We were previously told that approximately 10% of our client base were suitable for this kind of product but then that changed and we were told if the EBS was to survive we needed to sell more and ramp up customer numbers.</p></speech>

We have plenty of documentation.  At the management meetings the name of the game was selling.  It was all about sales.  We were not allowed to engage with mortgages or people in financial difficulty.  We were told to leave them alone, that they would be only wasting our time and we would not make money on them.  We were told to focus on sales.  It was awful.  We had built up trust with our members at local level.  People had trusted us for years.  We were told not to engage with people whom we had helped to get mortgages and were now in trouble and to direct them to head office or a particular helpline.  Given our culture, this did not sit right with us.  It upset us that we had to turn our backs on our customers.  We were located in local communities and towns and these were people and families for whom we had processed mortgages and other financial products throughout their life cycle and we were told not to engage with them and to direct them to head office in Dublin.  We did not like that and we raised concerns about it.  It is not that we were being negative; we just felt it was not the right approach.</p></speech>

We would have known our customer base for years and we would have known who would be happy to buy these products.  This was in 2011, when there was a lot of fear in terms of the bank guarantee and the safety of savings and so on.  We were told deposits were guaranteed but we need to sell bank assurance products.

That would be okay.  I have been aware of this issue for some time.  I raised it in the past, for example during Deputy Michael Noonan's time as Minister for Finance.  The response from the Department and the Minister then and now has been that the EBS is at arm's length and has nothing to do with the Department, and that all commercial and operational decisions are matters for the institution.  There does not seem to be any political will to become involved in this dispute.  I have an understanding of what the issues are.  I ask Mr. Kavanagh to clarify what he thinks would justify redress and engagement from the EBS side.  Does he think the treatment of the agents was unjust and unfair?  Does he think there were legal breaches of the contract that was in place?  How would Mr. Kavanagh characterise that?</p></speech>

The chief executive officer made a point about shareholders at the last meeting.  From a fiduciary point of view, as agents we have the same responsibility to our members.  All we were doing was bringing that to the attention of the EBS.  The contract side of things has yet to be sorted out properly.  The EBS has always maintained that it has acted within its legal rights, but that has never been proven before the courts.  As far as I am concerned, it is easy to make such a statement until it is proven not to be the case.  Our primary concern at the time was to act in an ethical and professional manner.  We raised issues that were of concern to our clients.  Rather than being facilitated with meaningful engagement and having our concerns heard, for our troubles we were told, "You are not team players so you are gone".  That is how ruthless it was.  The suggestion was that those who were no longer willing to play the game were no longer considered to be team players and were therefore gone.  When we asked why we were gone and whether we had done anything wrong, we were simply told that this was happening on a no-fault basis.  When we asked why this was being done, the simple and callous answer we received was, "Because we can".</p></speech>

As we know, the EBS got into liquidity and solvency difficulties.  As a result, the mortgage commission went down to close to zero.  That was a decrease of close to 80%.  My view is that if this was not expressly stated in the contract, the EBS should have alerted the tied agents as far back as 2005 that there were potential liquidity problems on the basis that if the EBS was unable to fund the mortgages, the agents' entire income would come from investment income.  Apart from putting a strain on the tied agents, there was a risk that if their income depended solely on investment income, they would be tempted to sell products which were unsuitable to customers.  This would have put the tied agents into a difficult situation.  If they went along with this and kept their heads down low, they might have kept their jobs, but they would have been risking their reputations and creating damage for potential costumers with this new approach.  My view is that the EBS should have said in 2005, and certainly in 2008, that it would have to deal with potential liquidity difficulties.  It should have consulted the agents in that context to say that the contracts which had been signed would have to change considerably.</p></speech>

How was that process conducted, in Mr. Kavanagh's view?  Is there a suggestion that the EBS had certain preferred people in mind to take on the role?</p></speech>

The culture we came from has to be understood.  Over the years, there was a very strong relationship between the agents and the management of the EBS.  When we raised issues about the new agreement, we were told we should not worry because there was nothing of concern in it.  The reaction we were getting from management was that because we had been with the EBS for years, everything would be fine.  Nobody predicted that the rug would be pulled from underneath us.  I would say that the spirit of the agreement was withheld from us.  We were hoodwinked into believing everything would be okay.  We did not think the EBS would do anything to us because we had been working with it for years.  That is an important point about the way the contracts were dealt with at the time.  Was there a second question?</p></speech>

It is very interesting.  We raised our concerns when we met the non-executive director.  We have seen a copy of a memorandum that was issued to the board of the EBS at the time.  I cannot share it with the committee.  The memorandum clearly stated that the board had decided that 20 underperforming offices would be closed as part of the EBS restructuring plan for the EU.</p><p>We understand that.  It is business.  The reality is that many offices of agents who lost their contracts are still open, are still running and there are still people in them.  We vehemently deny that we were underperforming and we have proof of that.  We were not underperforming.  Some 20 offices were going to be closed and we were used as an example to cut offices.  As I have said, many of those offices are still open so the underperformance argument does not stand up.  I would question it, and we believe there was a personal side to the determinations.</p></speech>

We need to hear directly from EBS and have its representatives in front of us.  The note we received from EBS is unsigned and there is no name next to it.  Each time we engage with AIB to ask about EBS we are told that AIB speaks for EBS but EBS is a separate legal entity within the AIB structure.  They should be here to answer questions on this directly.  I support that.</p></speech>

He also spoke of the non-executive directors.  Who were the non-executive directors?  What type of products was EBS not providing?  Mr. Kavanagh also said "there were a few policy decisions taken by EBS which, in hindsight, contributed significantly to the avoidable problems that EBS and their agents faced".  Will the witness tell us what those policy decisions were?  Mr. Kavanagh has spoken about his own situation from his business' perspective.  Perhaps he could explain how long was he a tied agent with EBS and how he built up the business.  Did he operate from a town, a city or a village?  Over the years - for example the period from 2002 onwards - what happened and what were the changes?  He was at the coalface.  People were coming in and Mr. Kavanagh's business was processing mortgage applications through EBS.  I was in practice at the time and we had a lot of people who came to us through a person they knew, such as auctioneers in the towns and so on.  Will Mr. Kavanagh give the committee his personal perspective on looking through the prism of those years?</p></speech>

I worked in customer service also and a number of other different offices.  I was on the relief panel at one stage where I would go to different offices if they were short a staff member.  That was my starting point.  I am not exactly sure of the time but it was around 2002 or 2003 when I began to work for an agent of EBS who then asked me to work for him as his assistant manager in a local office.  From there I grew my own reputation within EBS for being a good employee and a good worker.  In 2006 there was a call to the network with regard to growing the offices and the businesses and they were looking at other opportunities.  At the time, in my wisdom, I saw a greenfield site and I went to EBS with a plan for an opportunity to open an office in that growing, affluent area.  EBS listened and agreed we should go for it</p></speech>

I elaborated on this earlier.  We came from a mutual building society background.  We did not have customers - we had members.  It was all about care for the member, proper customer service and growing the membership locally.  One was using trust and building on trust to build a proper steady business based on proper fiduciary rights and duties, as a person in a proper financial position to do that.  Our members were made up of people who were great clients and we had a great business with them.  There was nothing to stop that business continuing to this very day, but EBS wanted to change the structure and convert the business from safe products into what I regard as non-safe products.  The products were okay if they were sold correctly and to the right people, but the products did not suit everybody.  We were not selling shoes, we were selling complex financial products.  That is the bottom line.  We were not selling shoes.  EBS wanted sales, sales, sales.  We did not like that much.</p></speech>

There was one situation where we were supervised to make sure we were actively selling.  If a client had a lump sum investment but very much wanted his or her money kept safe, we were actively told to try to get some of that money into a protected bond.  In the sale of protected bonds, with the word "protected" one would assume that the money is protected.  The small print, however, indicates that the money is only protected after five years.  If the person wants the money before that date, then it is not protected.  We were given instructions to make sure our paperwork was right.  The paperwork included a freetext box, which is the piece we put in, where the wording was inserted in such a way that "you" decided.  This is even though I tell a person to put his or her money into the product, and the person trusts me because he or she always has dealt with me.  They may say that Shane was a nice fellow, that they trusted him and that they would do whatever he said.  Some customers were like that; they trusted one.  While I do not state that people did this, the opportunity was there to do it because people were under pressure to get their sales.  They might put somebody into one of these products and the forms stated that "you" chose it and " you" were made aware of the charges and have been told that after five years, the capital is protected etc.  That part of the paperwork is in the freetext box but this is manipulation.  If the client decides suddenly, two or three years down the road that he or she did not want that and goes to the financial services ombudsman, the ombudsman will then look for a copy of the paperwork, where everything will be in favour of the bank.  I felt it was very underhanded and so did the rest of the agents.  When we queried it we were basically thrown out.</p></speech>

Perhaps Mr. Kavanagh will give the committee a note, without accusations, with some further information.</p><p>Will Mr. Kavanagh let us know, as he was doing with Senator O'Donnell, exactly how the general body of people who were tied agents were affected overall?  An overall note on that would be useful.  He gave us the number of legal cases.  How many tied agents are there now?  How many are now taking cases?  We would like the information on it when we deal with the banks.</p><p> Will Mr. Butler fill out a little bit on the three paragraphs that he gave us on the decision taken by EBS?  He went on to talk about the banking crisis and so on, and then he addressed the &euro;2.3 billion.  Will he give us a deeper sense of the points he is making there?</p><p> What I suggest to the members this morning, arising from what they asked, is that we give a right of reply to EBS and AIB, that we talk to the Central Bank and send it transcripts of this meeting, and that we arrange an appropriate engagement with each one, EBS, AIB and the Central Bank, to determine how we can move forward from where we are right now.  This is a first meeting to get agreement from members.  We have that agreement.  They are the steps we will take.</p><p> In everything that has been said, I find it extraordinary that neither the terms of reference or the final report ever emerged in the process entered into.  In terms of the legal cases and challenges that are there, I cannot help but think that those on the other side of this argument have legal muscle and money, and that might be a way of dealing with it, which is unfair.  A bank which has got &euro;2.3 billion is answerable to this committee.  The Central Bank and the regulator need to be more accountable than they have been to date.  That is my view.  The members are anxious that we see more information and that we engage as soon as possible with the Central Bank and AIB.</p><p> I thank the witnesses for coming to the meeting today and opening this paragraph of the investigation.  I also thank their colleagues, all the tied agents and all the families affected.  I appreciate them coming here.  We look forward to engaging with them again.</p></speech>

The introduction and implementation of a child tax credit or allowance of up to &euro;1,654 per annum for each child up to a maximum of four, even where a worker does not have any tax liability, as is the case for many low-income workers, would be very progressive.  A minimum wage worker with three children earning &euro;18,958 from working 39 hours per week would receive a tax credit or allowance of &euro;4,962 which would in turn increase his or her net income by 26% to &euro;23,920.  An identical family with a gross income of &euro;70,000 would gain only 10%.</p> <p>  I set about compiling this analysis based on the experience of dealing with many families depending on social welfare and many more who are depending on low-income employment.  Many here will have had similar a experience to me through their own constituency work.  Through the years it has become clear that many issues exist which must be addressed to eliminate discriminatory quirks in both our welfare and taxation systems while incentivising work and also providing the necessary supports to families, whether working or not.</p> <p>  As the committee will be aware, in Ireland wages and our taxation system do not differentiate between workers with or without children.   This is in contrast to the welfare system where there is an increase paid for every qualified child in addition to a personal payment and an increase for a qualified adult dependant if applicable.</p> <p>  The costs associated with raising a child as having a significant impact on the ability of a worker to bear the burden of taxation were acknowledged as far back as 1799 when a tax on income was first introduced.  Any working parent of a child was consequently entitled to relief.  The method varied through the years but working families with children continued to pay less than those without until 1986 when the then child allowance was abolished.  As things stand our taxation system provides a tax credit for an adult dependant but gives no recognition to children or the associated costs of raising a family.  Our welfare system, on the other hand, provides &euro;1,654 in additional support per year per child for no fewer than 27 different welfare schemes together with likely qualification for a number of other benefits such as medical card and housing support among others.</p> <p>  This paper outlines some of the many anomalies that exist in both our tax and welfare systems.  The analysis shows clearly, for example, that a low-income worker, such as a worker on the minimum wage, is better off choosing not to work and claiming jobseeker's benefit or allowance if he or she has a number of children.  Clearly, such a situation is unsustainable.  One such example is a married couple with three children.  If they are on jobseeker's allowance of &euro;17,129, it is further supplemented by &euro;1,654 for each child, a total of &euro;4,962, giving an overall total income of &euro;22,091.</p><p>They would also qualify for secondary benefits in terms of the medical card, housing support, etc.  If we looked at the equivalent family working on the minimum wage for 39 hours per week, its income would be &euro;18,958.  The family gets no allowances of any description for their children, as with the welfare system, and so &euro;18,958 is the family's total income.  This indicates to me - I am sure many of us have come across it - that it incentivises people in those circumstances not to work as opposed to seeking out gainful employment.  The research outlines much of the detail regarding existing welfare supports, anomalies therein relative to working families and the clear need for tangible action to address the problem in a way which is fair and supportive to those often referred to as the working poor - in other words, low and middle-income workers.<br/><br/>On foot of the research reflected in this paper, my conclusion is to propose the introduction of a child tax credit or allowance thus ensuring that our taxation system treats children in the same way as our welfare system.  For the purposes of preparing a paper only, I pitched the child tax allowance or credit at the same level as the child social welfare qualifying payment of &euro;1,654 per child.  However, to seek to do so at that level in one year or in a short period of years would, in light of the enormous cost of more than &euro;1 billion per annum, be reckless.  It is worth considering that if we accept the principle, which is what I am seeking to promote, of the need to introduce such a child tax credit or allowance, we could build towards it over time.  The research carried out by my team and me included a detailed analysis of the cost of such a child tax credit or allowance with the use of excellent support by way of data provision from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which I would like to acknowledge.  Our estimate is that 638,000 children under 18 will benefit at a total cost at just over &euro;1 billion per annum with the credit set at &euro;1,654 per child.  A start might be a Government committing to &euro;100 million to &euro;150 million per annum to such a measure, which, subject to sustainable resources, could be built to mirror the child qualifying social welfare allowance over the lifetimes of two to four Administrations, namely, ten to 20 years.<br/><br/>Working families are the bedrock of our nation.  The removal of existing anomalies and the provision of adequate support through the reform and reorganisation of parts of our taxation and welfare systems are essential.  The <i>status quo</i>should not and cannot be allowed to continue.  Following research, it is my considered opinion that this group should be given a level of priority and should benefit from changes to tax bands and tax rates over the coming period via the introduction of the proposed child tax credit or allowance.  As the language of surplus slowly begins to replace that of deficit and given the emergence of growing fiscal space, the time is right to consider the implementation of such measures.  I very much hope that this paper can act as a catalyst to commence a meaningful discussion and can lead to the necessary and overdue acknowledgement of working families with children in our society.<br/><br/>I again thank the committee for its invitation.  I hope it can concur with the merit of this proposal and advise the Departments of Finance, Public Expenditure and Employment Affairs and Social Protection of its support for the adoption, in principle, of the need to incentivise work while supporting those who cannot work with an appropriate child tax credit or allowance.</p></speech>

Everyone has had sight of the discussion paper prepared by Deputy MacSharry.  I genuinely commend him on this initiative.  It is very evident to anyone that a huge amount of work has gone into this proposal.  The research is excellent.  It certainly contains innovative thinking and is very well presented.  This is what a mature parliament does.  Proposals should come from parties and individuals within parties.  What the Deputy has asked for is that we engage in an open and honest discussion about the merits of what he has proposed and I am happy to do that.</p> <p>  The Deputy has chosen the tax credit model.  If the issue we are seeking to resolve is the trap whereby people on social welfare chose not to work because it is not worth their while - an issue we have all come across in the course of our constituency work - why is Deputy MacSharry proposing this model as a opposed to, for example, one involving secondary benefits, such as helping people to keep their medical cards, tackling child care costs and the issue of people losing the housing assistance payment if they attain a certain level of income from employment?  Could Deputy MacSharry set out the rationale for opting for a tax credit-based approach in respect of each child as opposed to dealing with secondary benefits to make it worth somebody's while to work?</p></speech>

It is in place in the UK, the US, Canada and some other countries.  In addition, we would be giving people the money directly by way of savings in terms of taxation or because, due to the structure of it, if somebody had no tax liability, it would in effect be a payment.  This happens in Northern Ireland.  We would be giving the money directly to the people who need it.  While we all acknowledge that there are issues with child care and the cost of education, which was raised in the D&aacute;il yesterday in terms of parents having to contribute, we would be giving the money directly to the people.  As all of us here and those in the committee room next know all to well given the sort of administrative costs involved, if we start saying "Let's deal with the medical card issue, child care and all of that", it will cost us a great deal more.  We would be giving the money directly to the people to ensure that it has the maximum impact in terms of what it is intended for rather than having to redesign the medical card scheme overall.  There are anomalies in all of the schemes and these probably need to be addressed.  However, putting the money where it needs to be is why I felt that the tax credit or allowance was the way to go.  Ultimately, it is about the things it will bring in apart from the secondary benefits anomaly.  It is also money.  If people feel their brother or neighbour is earning more in cash per week for doing nothing, there is a psychological impact in terms of dignity.</p></speech>

One could argue that they do not have the costs associated with child rearing but how would Deputy MacSharry address the question that it is unfair for those people to not get a tax break?  What about the argument that this would result in taking far more people out of the tax net?  The general view among some international bodies is that it is a mistake to take more and more people out of the tax net completely and that everyone should make some contribution, however small.  Would Deputy MacSharry have any concerns on that front?</p></speech>

The taxation system is used in a variety of different way.  For example, one could argue that we are all subsidising the knowledge box in terms of corporation tax but, obviously, Marc MacSharry or Joe Bloggs is not deriving a direct benefit from it.  I am not saying we should levy taxation to increase taxation to pay for this.  While it is pitched at the high rate of &euro;1,654, I am at pains to point out that it would be reckless to seek to do this in a single year.  Rather, it would be dependent on the sort of fiscal space that is available to us.  Within the two to one split that is being employed in terms of budgeting, we would seek to ask whether we can afford &euro;100 million or &euro;150 million per year for this within the existing space.  Subject to sustainable resources, we would then add to it as time passes.</p> <p>  The fairness model is somewhat of a red herring because there are so many different things within the Taxes Consolidation Act that may be there to benefit different sections of society in quite an honourable way.  This is just another one.  I certainly would not be seeking to penalise or add to the tax burden of people who do not have children.  We would provide a measure like this from our existing revenue base.</p></speech>

It must be remembered that our entry point for the marginal rate of tax is quite low by international standards.  Where would Deputy MacSharry rank this proposal in terms of priority with those or would he see progress on this being made in parallel with reductions in income tax generally?</p></speech>

It is the principle I would love to see embraced.  That is why the document has no party logo, it was not written in a political context and when I published it in April, I sent it to all Members of the House, all committees and all Departments.</p> <p>  I would love to see general acceptance that this is a route we need to go.  It is not that it trumps the need for the abolition of or a reduction in USC or the movement of bands, rather that it exists in parallel and subject to space.  Prioritising the taxation system support, in the same way as the welfare system, to the cost of raising children is a basic principle that was embraced from 1799, the beginning of taxation in this country, right up to 1986.  We would serve the nation well if we re-embraced that principle.</p></speech>

The beauty of child benefit is that it reaches all children on the basis of equality.  I am not sure that one can say that Deputy MacSharry's proposal would treat children the same, that one can do that the same in the welfare system as in the tax system.  If we look at table C which shows the impact on a family earning &euro;70,000, they would have an extra &euro;5,000 after this charge.  I would not call that a progressive change.  When we look at the percentages, the minimum wage workers could earn 26% extra and they stand to gain the &euro;5,000.  Would that be right, in the case of the person on &euro;70,000 and the person on the much lower wage?</p></speech>

As a proportion of their income, it would be much less for a higher income but they would be getting the same amount.</p> <p>  Let us say a Government was to commit &euro;150 million to this.  With 638,000 children, that would equate to approximately &euro;240 per child.  If one has three children and one's salary is &euro;70,000, one will have a tax allowance of &euro;240 per child.  The person on the minimum wage is likely to pay little or no tax, and will get that in cash.  In some countries, it is called a refundable tax credit.</p></speech>

Senator Conway-Walsh will see in the other tables we included quite a number of secondary benefits in the analysis.  For example, we include FIS.  We did not include eligibility for SUSI grants but how SUSI is allocated is something we should focus on in any event.  It is a good, reasonable question.  I would not like to complicate a support such as this for children with a flaw in the eligibility criteria for SUSI, for example, where I am sure there are issue - we all have come across them.</p></speech>

There are too many in the squeezed middle we often talk about who are not in a position to educate their family.  The struggle of families who do not get SUSI grants and must provide education, particularly up to third level, for their children works out costing between &euro;12,000 and &euro;14,000 annually.  Historically, in my own family, there were four of us in college at one time.  While there is a perception that some families have good incomes and a reasonable degree of wealth, the reality is, if they are not entitled to some form of tax break, some are struggling.</p> <p>  If we are talking about it as a child tax allowance, it is my firm belief - in the same way child benefit is to help families, particularly to get through the education system - the concept here needs to be seriously looked at.  It could be tied into suggestions that we made previously about providing people who are struggling to make savings and are living hand to mouth, with incentives such an SSIA facility or an incentive for children to save as they grow older.  For example, I have mooted to Deputy Michael McGrath previously the issue of not charging DIRT on students' accounts when they go to college.  It is a simple measure and it would not cost a great deal.  We need to look at the principle.  Education, whether in a trade or in a university, is everything.  That squeezed middle needs to be considered for some form of incentive in the tax regime; that will be a learning for life for their children, for example, in taking up the badly needed trades.  This is one of the hidden problems to a large degree.</p> <p>  As a public representative, I meet people daily who have problems with social welfare and are looking for additional support.  We all recognise those people need help.  However, there is a middle-income earner out there who needs an incentive.  I fully support Deputy MacSharry's principle and it should be thrashed out.</p> <p>  This is a classic issue that should go to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  I take it Deputy MacSharry cannot be 100% sure that everything outlined in this document is correct but it should be analysed by the Committee on Budgetary Oversight and offered as a suggestion.</p></speech>

This is a very good discussion document and I compliment him on bringing it forward.  I am not so sure why he threw in the knowledge box because I believe only a handful of companies have availed of this and only &euro;5 million or &euro;6 million have been paid in corporation tax, so it would not make much of a dent in the &euro;1 billion that this is going to cost.</p></speech>

I am delighted the Deputy has brought forward a paper for discussion that brings all those together.  I would welcome the amalgamation of more of these schemes.  When one looks at schemes and brings them forward, there is always somebody who will fall off the wagon.  Has the Deputy analysed any areas where there will be people who will fall off the wagon?</p></speech>

I am not precious about the contents of this, in the sense that if this can be a catalyst to begin a meaningful debate on the tax allowance and credit for working families with children, my ambition will have been realised.  This went to all of the committees but this is the only one that came back.  I would love if the Committee on Budgetary Oversight ran with this and if the Department of Finance and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection responded.  The only Secretary General who wrote back, ironically, was the Secretary General at the Department of Education and Skills who probably would not have much input into this area at all.  However, I would like it to be examined.  I would not be caught up in this regard.  There is a very significant cost in terms of where we have pitched it, but it would be reckless to set out to do this in a short number of years.  It is about embracing the principle and seeing what can be afforded and as resources are freed up or become more available on a sustainable basis, one could then build it at the level of the allowance for the welfare recipients.</p></speech>

One would be introducing a tax credit allowance at whatever level was affordable in terms of the Exchequer.  I was proposing that &euro;150 million would equate to an allowance or tax credit per child of about &euro;240.  That would be the level, if we could afford &euro;150 million on an annual basis.  That is a huge amount of money in the context of the budget and what is available.  It is not about changing the whole system but introducing a new measure which would channel resources directly to the people who need them, which is cash in hand, in order to meet the bills and costs of raising a child.</p></speech>

Is there a danger that this could create a poverty trap and could be abused by employers?  What the Deputy is proposing to do might be more correctly dealt with through family income supplement, FIS, and through amending the FIS rules?  There is a danger here that if someone has a low-paid job and has children, the employer will use this proposal as a subsidy and continue to pay that person a low wage.  It would be better to allow a system where social welfare deals with people who need assistance, where they are fully unemployed or where they are on FIS.  Perhaps FIS needs to be amended rather than looking at this solution.  The Deputy is differentiating between categories.  He is saying that someone who is unemployed can do this through the social welfare system and someone who is working can do it through the tax system.  I am asking about the unintended consequences.  I am wondering if what the Deputy is looking to do here could be more correctly and efficiently done through reform of the FIS system.</p></speech>

The issue of rogue employers is an issue now, where employers are taking advantage of the fact people are entitled to FIS.  That argument will continue regardless.  This is not recommending the abolition of FIS.  FIS would remain, where necessary.  I respectfully disagree with the Senator's point on that.  I do not think it would be any more or any less of an incentive to an employer, after the introduction of something like this, to take advantage of employees any more than is already happening.  That is an issue of enforcement and an issue for society where unscrupulous employers would price the cost of labour by taking into account what they could take off the State in terms of supports and instead of paying-----</p></speech>

Each one of us, regardless of our politics, must prompt each other to think beyond the box, and not to be controlled either by parties or by bureaucracy in the delivery of that personal message, policy or point of view.  Members from other parties are here this morning.  I firmly believe the committee structure should allow for this type of examination of policies and then parties can take them on.  I refer to Deputy MacSharry's figures and proposals.  It is good that he has said that getting the principle of this accepted is something that should be encouraged.  I compliment the Deputy on the very professional way this is presented in terms of the analysis provided for us.</p> <p>  With the agreement of members, I recommend that we send this to the relevant Departments - it may be only the Department of Finance but if there is another one, fair enough - for their views, costings and commentary on it.  We should also send the transcript of this meeting to the Departments and to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight to encourage them to analyse the document and to support the principle the Deputy has sought support for.  The other principle of bringing one's brain inside the gates of Leinster House, that is, that one is not just in a political straitjacket but one has a contribution to make beyond that, should also be supported.

We are part of Crosscare.  Crosscare is a social support agency of the Dublin Catholic archdiocese which has supported Irish emigrants for over 75 years.  We were officially established as Emigrant Advice in 1987, and about ten years ago changed our name to Crosscare Migrant Project and we have continued to support both those leaving and coming home.  We are here to discuss the findings of our report "One Hundred Thousand Welcomes?".  We present this report as a contribution to the implementation of Ireland&rsquo;s diaspora policy, in particular the aim to reduce barriers for returning emigrants.</p> <p>  In the past few years the discourse around returning home has begun to identify the experience as one of &lsquo;re-emigration&rsquo; &ndash; a very demanding move, as significant as leaving the country, despite the fact that emigrants are "coming home".  We found that returning emigrants can face many barriers, and we have a great deal of experience in this area.  One of the main barriers we will speak on today is the issue of accessing social protection and safety nets for those who need them on their return.  The major issue for them is the habitual residence condition, HRC. </p> <p>  Our work is funded by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, specifically the emigrant support programme.  We aim to provide a quality information and advocacy service in particular to those who are vulnerable or marginalised.  Through our engagement with the people who use our service, we aim to effect change in the policies that affect migrants and returning emigrants.  We have worked extensively for changes to the HRC guidelines for more than ten years.  We made a presentation to the committee in 2008.  Changes were implemented at that stage that made quite a difference for people returning and we saw a major improvements.  However in the past couple of years, issues are beginning to affect people who are returning now.  This is important in the context of the wave of people returning.  More than 105,000 Irish emigrants have returned home in the past four years.  The issue will start affecting more people and we have seen this as a growing trend.  The report presents an overview and is evidence based.  We hope it will be useful to the Department and to the committee in its role of addressing some of the inconsistencies we have seen in the decision making.</p> <p>  I will now hand over to my colleague, Ms McLaughlin, who has done all the hard work and can talk members through the technical and complex bits. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-28a.1171" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Danielle McLaughlin" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2018062800002#D00700"><p>The recurrence of issues that we have experienced is the basis for the report.  We have encountered during the past two years an increase in the number of returned Irish emigrants who have been disallowed social welfare claims based on the habitual residence condition.  The habitual residence condition is an assessment that was introduced in the European Union in 2004 that must be satisfied for an individual to be eligible for most non-contributory social welfare payments in Ireland.  It requires an applicant to show that he or she has a strong connection to Ireland and that it is their home again.  It is not based on nationality and is therefore applicable to both Irish and non-Irish citizens.  The operational guidelines are adopted by deciding officers in the Department to assess applications with regard to all relevant conditions.  There are five factors that are considered by deciding officers when assessing if a person is habitually resident: first, the main centre of interest; second, the length and continuity of residence; third, the length and purpose of any absence from Ireland; fourth, the nature and pattern of employment; and fifth, the future intention to live in Ireland as it appears from all the circumstances.<br/><br/>These have been amended and updated during the past few years, in particular, a specific provision was introduced in 2010 which particularly affects returned Irish emigrants.  It states: &ldquo;A person who had previously been habitually resident in the State and who moved to live and work in another country and then resumes his/her long-term residence in the State may be regarded as being habitually resident immediately on his/her return to the State.&rdquo; <b></b>How does this affect returning emigrants?  Irish emigrants who were previously resident in Ireland should be found habitually resident immediately upon return to Ireland, once they can demonstrate that they are resuming their residence.  The interpretation and appropriate application of this guideline is what we are concerned with here.  We have seen evidence of varying degrees of inconsistencies in the application of the HRC assessment.  In the majority of these cases, the individuals are experiencing very vulnerable situations such as homelessness or risk of homelessness, with no income or support networks.  Additionally some have children or further health and social care support needs. <br/><br/>On a daily basis, we provide information on access to social welfare and the HRC assessment criteria to all clients who have recently returned to Ireland or are planning to return.  We have seen an increase in the number of queries relating to HRC within recent years.  We dealt with more than 280 queries in 2017 and worked directly on 18 cases of HRC-based disallowed claims.  We submitted 12 cases to the social welfare appeals office and every case was successfully overturned.  Two thirds of these cases came from dual citizens who were either born here to non-Irish parents or who naturalised as adults, some of whom were forced to return in crisis from conflict zone areas such as Libya and Sudan on the advice of Irish consular authorities.</p><p> Our report illustrates some of the issues in case studies we have dealt with.  All these cases concerned individuals experiencing very vulnerable circumstances who had to wait on average five to nine months for their cases to return and to access their entitlements.  The long delay and stress involved had a significant adverse impact on them and their welfare.  To supplement our case studies and our direct work in the service, we conducted new research through an online survey to capture the experience of other individuals who have been disallowed a claim based on HRC on their return.  A total of 11 people, that is, half of those surveyed, told us they had been refused based on the HRC, mainly for jobseeker's allowance.  These were mainly people looking for work on their return.  Only two of them had made an appeal against the decision and were still awaiting an outcome.  All these individuals may have been left with very limited options and were possibly put in quite a vulnerable situation.  They told us they felt the process was "intimidating", "demeaning" and "humiliating" and they were made to feel guilty.  These expressions echoed comments from respondents in a broader survey which we carried out last year with 400 returned emigrants in our report Home for Good?  More than 100 people gave us negative comments on their experiences of access to social welfare payments on return.  Furthermore, we included in the report contributions from other emigrant support organisations across the world on the experiences of emigrants who are planning to return with urgent support needs.  They talk about misconceptions among Irish emigrants of their rights and entitlements.  They perceive these misconceptions as caused by inaccessible information on access to entitlements, particularly in respect of clarity surrounding the HRC assessment.  They perceive the lack of information and misconceptions on the HRC to be actively deterring emigrants from returning to Ireland on the presumption that they may not be able to access a safety net of income while they re-establish their employment in Ireland.</p><p> Our recommendations circle around two areas and functions of the Department.  I will quickly go through the recommendations in respect of the administrative function.  We ask the Department to ensure appropriate and consistent application of the guidelines for the HRC for returning emigrants as resuming previous residence through updated and ongoing training and supervision for deciding officers; to provide a user-friendly bespoke guide to the HRC for returning emigrants on the website and to regularly update it; and to introduce a mechanism, such as a declaration form or an option for inclusion in the current HRC application form, not dependent on proof of secured housing, that returning emigrants can confirm that they have returned to reside in the State on a permanent basis.  Figures released by the Department on claims disallowed on the HRC currently do not include a breakdown of those that were referred to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  In our experience, all the cases with which we have assisted have been overturned on appeal and thus are recorded as awarded claims.  We recommend that published figures reflect all cases that have been referred to the appeals office.  This will allow us to identify some problems at the initial application stage.</p><p> In respect of the customer service function, we ask the Department to provide clarity on required documents and evidence for social welfare claims in all forms of communication with returned emigrants, including the HRC leaflets, website and communications by email and phone and in person; to ensure referral of returned emigrants to the community welfare service for basic supplementary welfare allowance, as many people are unaware of this, a decision made in advance of the primary claim, as per the guidelines, and the exercise of appropriate discretion in the issuance of exceptional needs payments where needed in vulnerable circumstances; and to ensure referral of returned emigrants to the appeals process and to other support services for further support needs, such as our service, Safe Home Ireland and local services such as citizens information centres.</p><p> I thank the committee for its interest in this matter.  We ask that members consider the issues raised and support the recommendations put forward to the Department to ensure that returned emigrants are not disproportionately affected by the HRC or at a disadvantage solely due to the fact that they have lived abroad.  This commitment would be in line with the aims of Ireland's diaspora policy, as Mr. King mentioned, supported by the Minister of State for diaspora affairs, to facilitate the return of Irish emigrants in a recovering economy.</p></speech>

I will ask one general question and then go to my colleagues.  The rules and regulations concerning habitual residency are not the problem; it is their interpretation and implementation.  The witnesses are dealing with this as a national organisation.  Are they seeing regional differences in this?</p></speech>

As Mr. King explained, I do the information and advocacy work with the clients face to face.  I find in my work that deciding officers in more rural areas sometimes do not see as many people returning home and their understanding of the rules can sometimes be a little patchy.  This is not to say that deciding officers in Dublin do not have the same issues.  I have been in touch with many deciding officers who really want to help someone with whom I am in touch.  I have spoken to them on the phone and they have said they really would like to award a certain entitlement but they cite habitual residence and the two-year rule.  Some people still think there is a two-year rule.  There is not.  Sometimes there is a fixation on one particular factor out of the five, such as time away, perhaps.  To come back to the Chairman's question, this does seem to happen a little more in rural areas.  In places such as the homeless persons unit in Dublin, we do not really tend to have as many issues now as we once did.</p></speech>

Theirs is an excellent piece of work and long overdue.  It is an issue in respect of which I get people coming to my constituency offices expressing concern and frustration at how their cases are being handled and in many ways stymied.  This is all reflected in the experiences highlighted in Crosscare's submission.  Cases similar to all these have come through my constituency offices.</p> <p>  Another issue that has presented itself, albeit not in huge numbers, is the breakdown of relationships whereby one party has had to return home.  This has presented itself as a huge challenge.  People try to access various information, whether bank statements or information on property they may have been renting or may own.  Some deciding officers really do not know what to do and essentially put a red line through it and force that person then to go through a lengthy appeal process.  At the same time, there is no referral to community welfare officers or anything like that.  It is a real problem.  However, the witnesses highlight in their submission that all of the 12 cases they have represented that have gone to appeal have been overturned.  This in itself sets off alarm bells that many deciding officers' interpretation in adjudicating on these cases is really not at the level it should be.  In many cases they probably do not have the knowledge or the know-how.  I see this even with disability allowance payments and other areas.  The easy option is just to put a red line through it and let the applicant then go through a lengthy appeal process.  The fact that these 12 cases which the witnesses represented were all successful just highlights this.</p> <p>  The recommendations the witnesses have put forward are all common sense and very basic, and I agree with every one of them.  This committee has heard evidence on exceptional needs payments and community welfare officers and the huge levels of discretion they have in offices right across the State.  This is posing problems.  There does not seem to be one set of criteria from which they all work.  There are huge anomalies and issues here in that one community welfare officer will grant something and another will not, and the two could be identical cases.</p> <p>  I welcome the report.  As I said, they are all basic recommendations, and it is something we as a committee need to look at.  There is a big push to try to get people back home, but there are problems actually doing so, which this report highlights.</p><p>There are problems which make it difficult to come home, and this highlights it.  We need to cut through the red tape and make it easier for people to come home.</p><p> An applicant must show that he or she has a strong connection to Ireland.  How does one go about showing that one has such a connection?</p></speech>

There are questions on the form which ask an applicant to describe any connection that he or she has with Ireland.  This might include membership of a group or something of that nature.  When I meet an applicant, I ask if he or she is a member of a library, if he or she is registered to vote, if he or she has family here or if he or she has a letter from family saying that he or she used to holiday here.  It can be absolutely anything.  The same is true when it comes to showing future intention to remain.  It is very broad.  That is good and bad.  It is great for appeals but, at the initial stage, it is very difficult to get a person to present all of that evidence.  I do not like to use the term "wishy-washy", but it applies here to a certain degree.  It is very hard to get concrete proof that someone has a strong connection to the country, other than the fact that he or she is Irish and has returned here.</p></speech>

I also thank them for highlighting the very important issues in this area.  I am afraid I have to leave to attend a meeting on climate change, a matter on which I will be tabling a Bill next week.  I apologise that I will have to leave but I will ask a couple of questions before I do so.</p> <p>  That 109,000 people have returned to Ireland in the last four years is very good news for us.  There is a shortage of labour in the hospitality industry.  There is a shortage of chefs.  There are also shortages of nurses, teachers and construction industry workers.  One would think that the Government would be saying "C&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte" and welcoming those people back with open arms rather than putting obstacles in their way by means of these kind of mechanisms.  One such obstacle I have come across is that many young people who left when the economy collapsed in 2009 and 2010 and who have returned are trying to work and educate themselves.  When they go to college, however, they are not entitled to have their fees paid, even though this will be the first time many of them have attended third level.  Can the witness comment on that and indicate if there is something we can do to address it?  This is a big issue that young people are facing.  The Government, instead of making obstacles for these people, should be bending over backwards to encourage them to come back and work because there is a labour shortage on the horizon.  They should also be paid to undertake further training and education.  These people contributed hugely to society before the recession via taxation and social protection measures, but are now being told that they are not entitled to an education.  Can the witness comment on this?</p></speech>

I had a call yesterday from a person who was extremely upset.  He or she had been away for the last seven years and wanted to do a masters degree, but would have to pay non-resident fees because of his or her absence.  He or she was extremely upset; his or her plan has fallen through.  He or she could not understand, as someone who was returning to the country and who had contributed to it for so long - and, indeed, who had great experiences working and studying overseas - why he or she would not be allowed to do something to improve Ireland further by going back to college.  There is a rule for undergraduates only whereby if one has been at school in Ireland or the EU for five years, one can access EU fees, but-----</p></speech>

If one has not been in the country for three out of the past five years but has been in school for five years in the EU or Ireland, one can avail of EU fees but not the free fees.  That only applies to undergraduates; it does not apply to postgraduates.  That is a major problem.  It is a barrier for people and is extremely upsetting.  We advise these people that it is possible to appeal.  The final decision rests with the dean of the relevant college, but I have no idea how often those appeals are successful.  We have not heard about any that have been successful.  It is a real barrier for people, and is very frustrating and confusing for them when they are planning to come back.  Usually, these people are returning to Ireland because they have had families and want to settle down with their families and friends and build a life here.  However, experience overseas is often not recognised on pay scales, including for occupations such as psychology.  A person returning from Australia might have been in college in Ireland, have ten years experience of working as a psychologist in Australia and would be put at the bottom of the pay scale upon his or her return to Ireland.  That is also an issue.  I am hearing about such things all the time.  It is extremely upsetting and very frustrating for people in those situations.</p></speech>

They are being told that, even though they grew up here and their parents grew up here and they paid into the system, they are not even entitled to undergraduate fees.  Having to wait three years before being able to access Irish education fees is a big disincentive in the context of returning home.  It is no wonder the Government is making a mess of inviting people to come back to settle here when these stupid clauses exist.</p></speech>

An interdepartmental committee is looking at all of the barriers for returning emigrants.  The Indecon report contained 30 recommendations, covering a broad spectrum, which will span all Departments and which will require much cross-departmental insight and commitment.  The HRC is one of the issues, as is the idea that there should be more consistency in the context of decision-making.  One of the recommendations concerns recognition of experience and training abroad.  The issue of education is also raised.  There is much to work on.  We are advocating for commitment and investment in these recommendations.  Our diaspora policy seeks to facilitate over 100,000 emigrants as part of a long-term policy.</p></speech>

It has been very important for multiple generations of emigrants and, indeed, immigrants to Ireland.</p> <p>  I echo what Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith stated.  Over 200,000 young people left Ireland.  In this same committee we have heard presentations about pensions - another key focus - which constantly reminded us of the demographic gap.  It seems extraordinary, not just in terms of employment but also in terms of the base and the balance of our demographic in the future, that there is not more proactive encouragement for people to return to the country.</p> <p>  From the presentations we have heard, it seems that catch-22 situations are arising.  I note the recommendation on housing.  We already know how extraordinarily difficult it is for people to secure housing.  I imagine that one of the conditions is that a person knows that they can commit to a year's lease at a minimum.  For many people, however, committing to returning home can be quite difficult if they know that they are going to be unable to access social supports.  Are the witnesses finding that people are caught in catch-22 situations?  Are they seeing situations where one member of a household or family is returning who has employment and another member of the family does not?</p><p>Do the witnesses find the people they work with are struggling to balance possible potential employment, possible social protection reporting and housing?  Another concern, which overlaps with Roma and Travellers who are also groups affected by the habitual residency condition, is that there is a strong emphasis on secure housing, leasing a home, having family members who live here and have homes and what is called "settled residence".  Do the witnesses find the intersection between housing security and being able to demonstrate one's centre of interest arises?</p></speech>

People returning as homeless with no income are the main part of my work.  It is a problem because not having an actual fixed abode can count against a person because they did not arrange housing or have somewhere to live.  I find that often naturalised Irish citizens are held to a higher standard for return and can be asked why they did not secure employment or housing although many people cannot do that before they come back.</p></speech>

We have great links with many of the emigrant groups abroad.  There are people returning with families or who are about to have families.  Someone might arrive back who is pregnant and accessing maternity benefit can be extremely difficult, or impossible.  On the question of employability and having one person working, in some cases the spouse or partner might not be Irish.  People are forming families in other countries.  A separate issue that we are considering is the right of people to live and work here which is a secondary barrier.  People might come back, say, a pregnant woman and her partner, who will not be able to work for six, eight or even 12 months, for example, and will also be stuck with the issue of accessing payments.</p> <p>  A more overarching point within that is that many of the people who left in 2010, many of whom went to Australia, is that many of them are now interested in moving to other countries.  Their time in Australia is up for various reasons, whether tighter visa regimes or the end of their work, and they are now looking at going to Canada.  Wh</p> <p>  There is a broader related point.  It is interesting that many people who left in 2010, many of whom went to Australia, are interested in emigrating to other countries.  Their time in Australia is up for various reasons, such as tighter visa regimes or their work has ended, and they are looking at going to Canada.  That raises the question of why they are not looking to come home.  There is a perfect storm of many barriers, any of which one might be able to get past, and probably will, but they amount to the perception of returning to Ireland being very difficult.  Many will return to work, and they want to work, but they want to know there is a safety net.  We have heard so many people say that one cannot get a payment for two years after returning.  They wonder if it does not work out, what will happen to them, and that is a big disincentive.  Even if we tell them that we think they will do it, it is amazing how this idea spreads.  There are Facebook groups of more than 10,000 members where this disinformation spreads through large numbers of people.  One thing we are trying to do here is what we see as our responsibility to raise this and bring it to the committee and the Department so that we can get past that.  One key thing is making that information freely available through the Department.  There could be a guide on how to achieve habitual residency conditions.  </p></speech>

First, I was very concerned about what Ms McAvoy said about naturalised citizens and particularly that they might be having a humiliating or degrading experience.  Is there concern, if not about racial profiling, then about persons who do not come from Irish parents?  Second is the concern about persons who return to care, which this committee shares.  That often happens very suddenly and they face difficulties, such as the habitual residency condition.  It has both short-term impacts on matters such as accessing carer's benefits but also potentially long-term concerns regarding the recognition of pension contributions later on.  That is an issue that has arisen over care credits.  I want to check that I am correct that if one has not been working for a period prior to becoming a carer, then one's time as a carer might not be recognised for pension contributions.</p></speech>

The habitual residency condition is a greater problem for them because they are not being treated as, for instance, a young Irish person who went away, worked and came back.  They might be people who came here as refugees, might have gone to school and college here and then went away to work, like any other Irish young person before, before perhaps returning with their family.  They are being held to a higher standard and it is not seen as them coming home.  Their previous residence is often not recognised.  It is another quite serious problem with the habitual residency condition and the idea of resuming residence.  Sometimes only the resumption of residence, that its, the return, is taken into account rather than the previous residence.  The whole other half of the picture is missing and not taken into account.  Naturalised Irish citizens are having a tougher time.  We have one case study which shows how exceptional needs payments are sometimes withheld from them if they do not satisfy the habitual residence condition, even though it is no way related to the habitual residence condition.</p></speech>

However, we are concerned that when we look at figures for disallowances based on the habitual residence condition, they do not include carer's allowance.  Some people have contacted us on this and anecdotally, through surveys which we did last year and this year, we see that people would return to look after a parent, probably temporarily, and leave again, but they might not have an income because they will not satisfy the habitual residency condition for carer's allowance.  People take quite a financial risk to do that but they have no other option.  That is something that concerns us.  We are aware that the system for recording disallowances is being worked on to include carer's allowance but there are still no figures for last year.</p></speech>

I am particularly interested in this matter and have raised it with the Minister.  We are letting our emigrants down.  They are a legacy of the Government's failure and they are being failed again on their return.  We need to break down any barriers and unfortunately there are too many of them.</p> <p>  Rural Ireland has been hit badly by mass emigration.  If we are serious about rural recovery, surely it would make sense to assist our emigrants in every way possible.  I am aware of families who have returned to Offaly who met serious barriers.  One student managed to get herself a loan to pay her fees for the first year of college.  She could no longer afford it and had to take time out to work.  It is so unfair.  These families were forced out of this country because of the failure of Government.  They could have stayed and availed of every assistance but they chose not to and to go and work.  They are treated in an appalling manner and we need to look at that.</p> <p>  We have heard a great deal about the undocumented Irish.  It is shameful that an undocumented Irish emigrant can open a bank account in the US but cannot do so here on their return.  We must get serious about tackling this and breaking down those barriers.  There are pragmatic approaches that could be taken, and Crosscare has listed these in its report, which is very good.  We often hear about the cost of making changes but we could use the existing infrastructure, dedicated assistance within citizen's advice, within our financial institutions and within the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, as the issues that I hear relate mainly to these areas.  Of course matters related to social protection and opening bank accounts are significant.</p><p>There are some simple steps we can take here in the immediate to short term to alleviate the hardships and the burdens faced by these families.  How would the witness view such an approach?</p></speech>

We have made efforts as well to provide a lot of information on our website.  We respond by email and by phone.  Citizens Information has a lot of information.  MABS would also be useful for people in mapping out a budget for returned emigrants.  A lot of our advice is on pre-departure and preparation for return and our key advice, especially regarding access to entitlements, is to do their research, to be prepared and to look into what documents people will need on return instead of scrambling to find something that is in Australia or America when they are back in Ireland.</p> <p>  As to work the Department can do, the information that is available is very limited.  It is buried somewhere in the website and it is hard to access information specifically about the habitual residence condition, HRC.  The guidelines on the assessment are specifically written for deciding officers.  They are not bespoke or user-friendly for the public.  It is hard for advocates to work around that as well.</p> <p>  As for the training aspect, we are aware there is a large training programme within the Department but we know most of it is not mandatory but is optional.  We believe the aforementioned discretionary power or just in the decision regarding the HRC can have an adverse impact in many of the cases we have seen or on people who potentially we are not seeing.  I refer to many families who are returning who will get work and are entitled to child benefit and there probably are thousands of such people.</p> <p>  In very severe cases where people are left destitute or accessing homeless services, which has such a significant impact, deciding officers may not have been adequately trained or there is no ongoing updated training for new staff.  That issue really needs to be looked at.  Officers on the front line have such an impact on people and should have adequate training.  They should also have the back-up of management support in terms of reviewing a case when it comes in to management, rather than deferring it to the appeals office.</p> <p>  The appeals offices are backed up and the delays are long.  This is a huge resource to continue with long-term decisions that are affecting people and which really could - in our experience with the 12 cases we highlighted - have been avoided.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-28a.1205" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1298" speakername="John Curran" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2018062800002#H00300"><p>Any of the witnesses can respond but I have a number of specific points.  One issue raised by the witness was that the figures released by the Department on claims disallowed on the grounds of the HRC do not include a breakdown of those that have been referred to the appeals office.  That is a critical piece of information because this would then give an overview.  The only figure we have is CROSSCARE's sample, if we want to look at it in that way, where it appealed 12 cases and won them all.  From the committee's point of view, I believe we should try to contact the Department to see if we can get further information in this regard.  That would substantiate or support the claim that is being made that deciding officers are inappropriately or not properly equipped to make the decision and that it is only when it gets to the appeals office that these decisions are looked at.  I believe as a committee we should have a look at this first.</p> <p>  As for my second question, I may have missed it in the report but generally speaking - this applies to anybody making a social welfare claim, the claim is made and one is asked for supporting documentation.  The slower one is in responding with the documentation, the longer the application process takes.  Where somebody is trying to prove habitual residency, I presume the standard length of the application process is longer than most because he or she is probably grappling with something that is not as well-defined and is trying to prove a point.  Even if the case is successful, because such people are dealing with the HRC, it is making their overall application time longer.  Is that correct or is that the experience of the witnesses?</p></speech>

Often, however, a decision on the HRC will be made and it will be refused but the Department will not have asked for additional things it could have asked for and which would be quite useful at an appeals stage, after we have gathered these documents together.  I almost find there is a rush sometimes to make a decision on HRC and that the Department can be quite quick to refuse it, rather than giving a bit more information on what would be useful to have in the application.</p></speech>

Ms McLaughlin referred to the guidelines and ensuring appropriate and consistent application of HRC guidelines for returning emigrants etc.  Should there be something more specific, almost like a checklist of what would be appropriate?  In other words, by having a more structured approach to dealing with habitual residency we would be giving less discretion to deciding officers.</p></speech>

In a way, it is broad, in that deciding officers may have more flexibility in accepting one document over another, if there is an absence of one.  We still need an element of that flexibility.  We have highlighted in the report a couple of examples of good practice.  One of them is where there is specific reference to deportees who are returning who will have a document confirming that they are under deportation orders.  The officers will automatically issue this payment.  We do not seem to have any issues with those cases, in particular, in accessing further supports like homeless services.  That transition seems to be quite quick for that group of people and we know that it is a good practice.</p> <p>  Another good practice comes from another organisation somewhat like ourselves in County Mayo, called Safe Home Ireland, which provides some support for people, particularly around housing, and can assist them with securing housing and can provide a document to confirm that.  Not everyone would be in that position, as it is targeting an older group of people in particular.  </p> <p>  There are such different practices that can be learned from to smoothen transition for people.  The HRC is provided on every application form.  It is taking longer for applications from returning emigrants only where there is difficulty in obtaining the evidence and the documents-----</p></speech>

Often, however, that is not enough.  In some cases that should be exactly enough because somebody cannot return to Libya in any reasonable capacity.  Documents like that really should be capable of standing alone, in those cases..</p></speech>

How does that have an impact?  I know it affects persons who have been resident in other common travel areas of the EU for a period and who have previously moved over.  In terms of the contexts we have mentioned earlier around families, or even those who may not be married families but who are couples, partners or family units, has that issue arisen around one part of a returning household proving right of residence?  Do these issues intersect?  It seems to me that it became slightly different to what the position was in 2005.  In 2009, it changed and basically, how is that playing out?</p></speech>

If his or her partner has been added to the application, the partner is not assessed on HRC, it is only the main applicant who is assessed.  The partner's circumstances will be taken into account but the main applicant is the only person who must satisfy the HRC.  It can impact on it but usually we advise the Irish citizen with the history of living in Ireland to apply, rather than somebody whose permission in Ireland might not be stable at present.</p></speech>

To return to the Senator's point about the intersection of the right to reside and how it is assessed, we have found that the lack of understanding of the difference between an EU citizen exercising his or her rights and an Irish person coming back from Canada or Australia comes into it at the initial deciding officer phase.  They get a little bit mixed up.  Those cases might be viewed along the same lines although that should not be the case.</p></speech>

It is unusual for somebody to turn around here and say that he or she made 12 appeals, all of which were successful.  That underlines the fact that there is an issue.  Deputy Brady is no different from myself.  We all assist constituents in making appeals, which are not all successful.  We might have a good return, but it is not 100%.  Therefore, 12 out of 12 is an unusual figure.  We will certainly do further investigative work on that.  I thank the witnesses for their attendance.</p></speech>
