    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1106" speakername="Simon Harris" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12015111800002#A00700"><p>I move amendment No. 43:</p><blockquote>In page 43, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:&ldquo; &lsquo;Member State&rsquo; has the same meaning as &lsquo;relevant Member State&rsquo; has in section 766;&rdquo;.</blockquote> <p>Most of these amendments are technical in nature with the purpose of correcting minor drafting errors and ensuring the legislation that implements the knowledge development box, KDB, operates as intended.</p><p>The main substantive amendment is amendment No. 49, which extends the amount of time that a company has to make a claim for the KDB relief.  As initiated, the legislation provides that a company has to make a claim for relief within 12 months of the end of the accounting period.  However, I am now extending the period to 24 months to recognise that the KDB is a new tax incentive, there are significant documentation requirements that must be met before any claim is made, and that it will take time for taxpayers to become familiar with its operation.  This will provide some additional flexibility and allow taxpayers to respond to the requirements of the KDB, in particular those that relate to the documentation that is required support a claim.</p><p>Amendment No. 43 clarifies the definition of member state used for the purpose of the KDB refers to the EU and EEA regions, not just the EU as per the original legislation.Amendment No. 44 is a technical amendment correcting the reference to the appropriate section of the Patents Act 1992.  Amendment No. 45 clarifies the criteria that should be applied by an agent for the purposes of certifying patents that are not subject to an examination for novelty and inventive step.  This is aligned to the standard criteria for examined patents.</p><p>Amendment No. 46 makes it clear that all qualifying research and development expenditure that leads to the development of a qualifying asset may be included in the KDB computation.  This will ensure that even unsuccessful research and development may be included, so long as it sought to resolve the uncertainty that the ultimately developed the qualifying asset resolves.  Amendment No. 47 clarifies that an amount of research and development expenditure does not have to be excluded for the purposes of the KDB computation simply because such expenditure is capitalised only for accounting purposes.  At present, the legislation already provides for this to be included in respect of intangible assets, for example a business process or know-how.  This change will ensure it may also be included for tangible assets, for example aspects of a piece of equipment protected by a patent.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 48 and 51 are technical amendments which are necessary to remove a circular calculation, thereby ensuring the KDB computation works.  Amendment No. 49 provides a claim must be made within 24 months, rather than within 12 months.  Amendments Nos. 50 and 52 are technical and are necessary to clarify that the obligations to keep records and documentation as set out in section 769I and 769L apply only to a company that claims the KDB relief.  Amendments Nos. 53 to 58, inclusive, are technical amendments to delete a superfluous subsection in section 769O and amend all consequential references within that section.</p><p>Amendments Nos 59 and 60 are necessary to clarify that the criteria which apply to the additional category of assets for small companies is within both the OECD rules, but also the EU state aid rules.  This follows the definition of a micro, small or medium-sized enterprises as set out in Commission's Recommendation 2003/361/EC of 6 May 2003.  Specifically, this change will clarify that to qualify for the additional category of assets, the Irish taxpayer must have less than &euro;7.5 million of income from all intellectual property per annum; employ less than 250 people; have a balance sheet of less than &euro;43 million; and have a global annual turnover of less than &euro;50 million.  If the Irish entity is a member of a group of companies, then this turnover requirement applies to not just the stand-alone Irish company but to the whole global group.</p><p>I commend these amendments.</p></speech>

One of the problems with the economy we have created in this State is its over-reliance on foreign direct investment.  There is an inherent imbalance within the Irish economy at the moment, with 90% of exports coming from FDI companies, for example, rather than indigenous business.  Any imbalance will cause exposure and will make us susceptible to shocks in the future, whether they be shocks in the context of Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, BEPS, taxation, exchange rates or the competitive realities of emerging markets.  Foreign direct investment is very mobile in comparison to indigenous business and therefore it is far easier for it to go elsewhere.  Indigenous business does not have the same level of mobility.  Typically the attraction of FDI companies is used by emerging economies as a strategy to grow their own indigenous sectors in the longer run.  The attraction of such companies is very seldom an objective in its own right but Ireland has not been able, so far, to strike a balance between the two.  Of course, FDI must be welcomed and every job that can be created in times of difficulty must be supported but the current imbalance must be addressed.</p> <p>  This Government has been dragged, kicking and screaming, into changing the taxation environment for FDI companies.  Sinn F&eacute;in has long been calling on the Government to resolve the so-called double-Irish problem and the various loopholes that were in existence which allowed companies to pay very low effective rates of tax.  This year I attended a committee meeting addressed by the chief economist of the Department of Finance and have tabled parliamentary questions to the Minister on this issue but there seems to be confusion around the fact that corporation tax receipts are so far ahead of profile this year in comparison to other years.  The trading environment and exchange rates have been suggested as reasons for this but there is a large body of opinion that holds that corporation tax is so far ahead of profile this year because some companies are locating their profit generation base for tax and accounting purposes in Ireland which has resulted in a ballooning of the corporation tax take here.  If that is the case, it means we have lost the opportunity which existed for the last four or five years and the State has lost out on those funds because of this Government's reticence to become up to date with international best practice on taxation.  </p> <p>  My worry is that the knowledge development box is simply another method by which the Government is seeking to ensure that we maintain a competitive advantage through our corporation taxes.  Foreign direct investors will tell one that they want to make a profit.  The infrastructure of profit for any business is based on having access to customers, low input costs and a skilled workforce.  The availability of most of those components is falling in this country because we are reducing our investment in education and infrastructure and therefore, our competitive advantage is our bargain basement corporation tax rate.  We are putting all of our competitive eggs into one basket and making it difficult for ourselves to broaden out and re-balance the economy in the future.  I am concerned that the knowledge development box is simply another way of going down this route.</p> <p>  I understand that the knowledge development box is designed to replicate the patent box which has been introduced in other countries.  Will the income generated from products developed from patents or intellectual property be identified as income under the knowledge development box structure?  Will it cover not just the sale of intellectual property or a patent but also the sale of a product developed from same?  The cost analysis from the Government indicates that it will cost about &euro;50 million but I ask the Minister of State to outline how this was calculated.  My understanding is that this can only be calculated by determining the income to the State if the effective corporation tax was 12.5%, then determining the percentage of profits made by FDI companies which would be booked under the knowledge box and working out the difference.  If that is the case, we have to be talking about billions of euro in costs to the State.  </p> <p>  Much of the work being done by FDI companies at the moment is contract work which leaves employees in a precarious position.  Does the Minister of State know what percentage of the employment created by FDI companies is contract based as opposed to direct labour?</p></speech>

It is not fair to say that the Minister was dragged, kicking and screaming anywhere in the context of his approach to ensuring that this country promotes best practice when it comes to taxation and plays a prominent, leadership role within the OECD's BEPS discussions.  The Deputy does not have to take my word for that because there is evidence in last year's Finance Bill to back it up.  The Minister abolished the so-called double-Irish in that legislation which gave this country a first-mover advantage and sent out a very powerful message to investors about certainty and to the OECD that this country wants to play a constructive role and encourages others to do likewise.  Now we have arrived at the point where we have the OECD BEPS process in place.  I also do not accept the Deputy's suggestion that there is an over-reliance on FDI.  If one looks at the job creation figures, which I do not have to hand unfortunately, one will see that the majority of new jobs in the Irish economy have been created by indigenous Irish companies.</p> <p>  We must be very clear that the knowledge development box is not just an incentive for FDI companies.  It is also an incentive for indigenous Irish companies, startups and young companies in this country to develop, innovate and research here.  If we do not put such measures in place here we will make Ireland a less attractive location compared to competitor jurisdictions in terms of encouraging companies to innovate, research, develop and register patents.  The Minister for Finance mentioned during the Second Stage debate on the Finance Bill that is quite likely because of the operation of the OECD modified nexus that the knowledge development box will be of most benefit to single companies which carry out their research and development activities in Ireland.  We would be very happy to see smaller Irish indigenous business availing of this relief and we expect, certainly in the initial years, that to be the case.  </p> <p>  On the issue of corporation tax, the Deputy said there is much speculation as to why we have seen a spike in corporation tax receipts.</p><p>Rather than speculating I am following the advice of the Revenue Commissioners on this.  Revenue has advised the Minister and the Department of Finance that the increase is attributable to, among other things, improved trading conditions and the positive currency fluctuations.  The Deputy's point that we do need to continue to monitor it is a fair one.  </p><p> On the cost, my understanding is that the cost for 2016 is estimated to be &euro;31 million.  The Deputy is correct that it will be &euro;50 million in a full year.  That is based on a reasonable assumption of a 50% uptake.  The legislation provides that the knowledge development box, KDB, will arise in respect of accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2016.  This cost for 2016 can be further refined to &euro;31 million on the basis of the payment dates for preliminary tax which fall due in 2016.</p></speech>

How we are arriving at the figure in terms of the expected cost is an important question.  The annual cost of the knowledge development box in terms of tax foregone from 2016 forward have been estimated.  This focused on companies who up until this year had corporate profits that were taxable in Ireland at the standard 12.5% corporation tax rate and who from 2016 may have profits that are taxable at the KDB rate of 6.25%.  On the basis of the analysis carried out in the 2013 review of the research and development, R&amp;D, tax credit the majority of Irish firms who undertake R&amp;D in Ireland are claiming the R&amp;D tax credit so it is assumed that companies who would be able to qualify for the knowledge development box rate are captured by this data, which is reported by the Revenue Commissioners in the corporation tax, CT, returns.  </p> <p>  On the basis of the most recent data available, the Revenue Commissioners has advised that in 2013, the total CT liability of all such firms was &euro;1.4 billion.  This is the outer limit of tax that could be reduced by the KDB rate.  In reality, the number of companies who will be able to immediately avail of the KDB will be much lower as only the proportion of income that is attributable to qualifying assets such as patents or copyright qualify.  Unfortunately, no data in that regard is collected by the Revenue Commissioners.  The amount of income that could qualify for the KDB rate is the proportion of expenditure on qualifying R&amp;D in Ireland over the total amount of worldwide R&amp;D that was carried out to generate the intellectual property, IP, assets.  That is how we have arrived at the cost.</p> <p>  I was struck by the point made by Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, during the debate on last year's Finance Bill and in other discussions, which I think is a fair point, that sometimes in a finance Bill it is worth taking a chance on trying an idea that could result in more R&amp;D, more innovation and substance based R&amp;D.  With this knowledge development box we now have the first OECD compliant box in the world.  While other countries and other competitor jurisdictions will have to adapt, amend and improve their offering to ensure they comply, Ireland will not because - this refers back to the kicking and screaming comments made earlier - rather than rushing to do things the Minister used the period between the last budget, in which he made the announcement about the knowledge development box, and this budget to ensure we have in place a box that is reputationally sound and in accordance with the new OECD figures.</p></speech>

It was at the heart of discussions of Congress investigations in the United States.  I recall that when the Taoiseach was in California the Governor of California made a joke about Ireland's tax regulations in front of him.  Internationally we have a poor reputation with regard to tax.  That has a material cost as well.</p> <p>  There has been some talk about the knowledge development box being considered by the EU to be State aid.  Perhaps the Minister of State would indicate whether there have been discussions in that regard with the EU, such that there is no confusion in that regard.  Am I correct that the Minister of State said that there is a potential &euro;1.4 billion cost in relation to this?</p></speech>

There is no doubt but that job creation in foreign directive investment, FDI, is totally out of kilter with regard to exports from foreign direct investment.  In other words, foreign direct investment has an enormous capacity to book profits in Ireland at extremely low employment growth rates, which indicates that first, these are very weak areas with regard to jobs per euro exported and second that a lot of the booking of profits here is for taxation purposes rather than manufacturing.  I have yet to meet anyone in Irish business - I have spoken to a few such people - who believes the business will benefit from this measure.  Is it the sale of the patent or the intellectual property or the sale of the manufactured goods that relates to that patent or intellectual property here that is captured?  If it is the latter, then the ability of this technique to reduce taxation exposure will be far higher.</p></speech>

This includes royalties that are attributable to the assets and sales income.  Any income that results from a disposal of the qualifying assets, such as the patent, will remain subject to the capital gains tax, CGT, rate.  Chargeable gains are not subject to the KDB rate.  It is the trading income derived from the qualifying assets that is captured.</p></speech>

A cynic would say that if a drug is produced by way of a particular method and that process is altered somewhat then that is innovative because it has changed the process of manufacture of that drug.  It may simply be the case that one ingredient has been introduced after another ingredient and so on.  How can we be sure that what we are looking at is innovation or R&amp;D that is of value to the State?  The Minister of State said that this the process is such that we will be able to identify the components within a product that fall under the KDB and so on.  Given there are potentially billions of euro involve in this there will be a huge incentive for foreign direct investment to play the game to a certain extent.</p></speech>

The EU code of conduct has approved and adopted the modified nexus standard.  Clearly, the tax sovereignty of a member state is a member state competency within the European Union.  As we have adhered to the modified nexus rules and the KDB as a general measure that is available to all Irish corporate taxpayers the KDB does not require any specific approval by the EU, such that approval by the European Commission under State aid rules is not required.  However, as I said, the EU code of conduct has approved and adopted the new modified nexus approach, which the OECD base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process has also identified.</p> <p>  The point made by Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n in terms of what qualifies and how we can ensure we are getting real value for money is a valid one.  The whole idea of the KDB is to encourage R&amp;D in Ireland.</p><p>Business processes do not qualify.  It would have to qualify to be registered as a patent or for copyright.  The business process the Deputy outlined at the start in his useful example would not qualify.  It has to be something that is patentable or copyrightable.  Therefore, business processes would not qualify.</p></speech>

I do not accept the Minister of State's assurances that this is not just replacing the double Irish tax scam with a new tax scam.  I think that is exactly what the Government is doing.  Having been exposed very badly with the double Irish, the Government in collusion with the multinationals has engineered a new tax scam, which is the knowledge box.  This is borne out by the fact that on a number of occasions the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, has had meetings with the US multinationals, and he has openly acknowledged that he has discussed this in detail with them.  From his most recent meeting in October he reported very positive feedback from the multinationals.  I am quite sure there is very positive feedback from them because, as we know from an abundance of evidence, they are keen to pay as little tax as they possibly can on their absolutely extraordinary profits.  In recent years we have allowed them to evade an extraordinary amount of tax under the double Irish mechanism.</p> <p>  I do not believe the Government or the Revenue Commissioners did not know of the abuse that was going on.  That applies to the previous Government and the current one.  I made a point on Second Stage and I will expand on it here, as I have a little more time now.  The Department of Finance's technical paper on the effective corporate tax rate contains a table produced by Revenue, table 3.25, on corporation tax distribution statistics.  There are the gross trading profits figures and then the allowances are taken out.  There is net trading income, other income and then total income.  It is amazing that in 2007, total income was &euro;63 billion after the allowances were taken out.  The deductions in that year were &euro;6 billion, so the taxable income was &euro;56 billion.  To be clear, those deductions include trade charges, which was the main mechanism through which the big multinationals wrote down their tax liability.  One subsidiary of a company would charge another subsidiary of the same company for the cost of using its intellectual property or patents.  They effectively wrote off most of their profits by charging it to intellectual property.  In 2007, &euro;6 billion was written off, mostly under the heading of trade charges by the big multinationals.  Two years later that figure jumped from &euro;6 billion to &euro;19 billion, which is a factor of three.  If I were in Revenue or in the Government of the day, I would be asking, "What the hell is going on here?  Has the cost of intellectual property jumped by that much?".  The total trading profits were not that different; in fact they were less.</p></speech>

We need to go into this detail to establish whether the knowledge development box will prevent the sort of tax evasion or the aggressive tax avoidance of the past.  If this committee serves any purpose, it needs to go into this detail.</p> <p>  The gross trading profits in 2007 were actually &euro;10 billion than more they were in 2009, but the amount written off jumped by 200%.  Therefore, the taxable income went from &euro;56 billion in 2007 to only &euro;37 billion in 2009.  This is blatant tax avoidance using intellectual property.  As I pointed out to sub-committee dealing with this, I did not fully understand how this worked until I got an e-mail from an anonymous whistleblower who worked in one of these companies, who explained very simply how they did it.  He said they would just adjust the amount they charged to royalties or intellectual property according to what profit margin they wanted.  They could literally decide what profits they wanted to make.  That is how they were operating.  There have been these absolutely unbelievable increases in the amount they are writing off, and are allowed to write off, under the old scheme.</p> <p>  The first thing to say is that the Government has not got rid of the double Irish, the mechanism through which they have done this; it is being phased out.  The Government has given them the time.  The companies that have been doing this will continue to be able to do it for the next few years until they acquaint themselves with the knowledge box.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, the Minister of State said he did not anticipate that much uptake in the first year.  They do not need to do it in the first year because they will continue with the double Irish, but they will slowly acclimatise themselves to the knowledge box.  Given that this is how they engaged in blatant tax avoidance in recent years, what assurances can the Minister of State give us that the knowledge box is not just the same thing?  It all turns on the question of the value a company can assign to patents and intellectual property.</p> <p>  The Minister of State has just made the really big admission that the sales that derive from the qualifying intellectual property will be able to benefit from the knowledge development box tax break.  There it is.  All they have to do is make the very slightest adjustment to the intellectual property.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n spoke about medicines and stuff.  Making small changes in medicines can actually result in big changes.  It is not medicines that we need to worry about here.  These are the tiniest cosmetic changes, or they could appear to be significant changes but actually be cosmetic changes.  We know the companies involved: the big IT companies, including Google and Facebook.  They can make cosmetic changes.  They might even appear to be significant changes, but they are not significant because they are always upgrading the stuff, with new versions of this, that and the other happening every few weeks.  It is really just variations on basic themes.</p><p>However, those variations will then be constituted as new intellectual property, with new patents associated with them, and all sales deriving from those products will be written off for tax purposes.  The Government has given them six years to refine this measure, just in case there are any difficulties, because we know the Government is under pressure from certain voices in Parliament, but, more importantly, it is under pressure internationally on this matter.  The Minister is clearly having lots of consultations with the multinationals and they are being given a six-year phase-in period to refine how they can fully exploit this new tax loophole.</p><p> It is important to understand just how much we are losing.  We are in an extraordinary position in which the Government does not want a possible &euro;19 billion from one company alone.  That is the upper estimate of what Apple would have to pay us back if it were to pay back the tax that it appears it should have paid to us.</p></speech>

The signals are that the European Commission believes we engaged in state aid in making special deals with companies such as Apple in order for them to avoid paying tax.  I believe that to be the case, as do many others.  That is why there is an investigation.  The upper estimates of how much tax was forgone in respect of one company suggest it could be as much as &euro;19 billion.  We are in an extraordinary situation in which the Government does not want that money.  If I were the Minister of State I would be chasing that money, but he is sitting back and saying "We will see what happens," and "There is nothing to see here," when we could be talking about as much as &euro;19 billion.</p> <p>  Let us look at the serious estimates of the effective tax rates.  The Government refers to a figure of an effective rate of 10.9%, which is laughable, because it is after the deductions to which I referred, namely, trade and charges, which is how companies write down their taxable income.  Any serious analysis of the profits being made by those companies would start with their gross trading profits at least, if not their total income.  Then one gets a very different picture.  One gets an effective tax rate of approximately 6.2%, which roughly coincides with EUROSTAT&rsquo;s estimate.  EUROSTAT's estimate of our effective tax rate is 5.9% for 2012.  As we know, the United States Congress estimated that the companies that are in the eye of this storm, the big players, are paying a rate of 2.2%.  Every time figures about their profits or revenues come out, that is borne out.  We had the extraordinary revelation recently that Google made &euro;18 billion in revenue last year and paid &euro;28.6 million in tax.  I calculate that rate to be less than 1%.  That is what is going on.  Everybody knows it.  I believe the Government knows it and that Revenue is aware of it, but it is being actively facilitated.  The knowledge development box is the new mechanism to facilitate the process.  I am sure the Minister of State will try to tell me that is not true.</p></speech>

That is the Deputy&rsquo;s ideology and I respect that, but it is not how the world works.  In Deputy Boyd Barrett&rsquo;s constituency there are thousands of people, in Cherrywood and other areas, employed by multinational companies.  They are in well paid jobs.  They pay tax to this country and make a living for their families and therefore they contribute to the economy and to society.  The idea that the initiatives put in place by the Government, previous Governments, and presumably successive Governments to try to keep this jurisdiction competitive does not have any bearing on those job creation figures and that it is all just incidental does not stand up to any degree of scrutiny.</p> <p>  It was very interesting when Deputy Boyd Barrett said that - shock, horror - the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation had met with the multinationals.  Shock, horror - the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation interacts with businesses to try to create more jobs.  I will let Deputy Boyd Barrett into a little secret: yesterday I met a multinational company in Cork and I talked to those involved and asked what we are doing well in this country in terms of attracting investment, what made the company decide to locate in Cork, how many jobs it had created and whether it was likely to create more.  That is the sort of engagement we have.  Expressing shock and horror at Ministers with economic portfolios engaging with the business community is the equivalent of condemning the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine for meeting with the IFA.  That is what we are meant to do.  That is what we are duty-bound to do, and should we choose not to have those engagements we should not be in government.  Nobody who has that attitude should be.</p> <p>  I have too much respect for Deputy Boyd Barrett&rsquo;s intellect to believe he genuinely believes that the knowledge development box is the double Irish by another name, because it simply is not.  Deputy Boyd Barrett knows it is not.  First, when he says this country got caught in relation to the double Irish, let us be very clear in terms of setting the record straight.  No Government of any hue ever sat down in any office in Dublin or any other part of this country and designed the double Irish.  The double Irish was an anomaly devised, I presume, by international tax lawyers to enable companies to pay less tax, and we have ended it.  Deputy Boyd Barrett is right that we are phasing it out.  That is factually correct.  The double Irish was never part of the Irish tax offer.  It was never something designed by the Government or by any previous Government.  It is just one of a number of examples of international tax planning arrangements which were designed and developed by tax and legal experts to take advantage of what could best be described as mismatches between tax rules in two or more countries.  That is why the OECD's BEPS process and countries working together on a global level is the only way to address such issues.</p> <p>  In contrast to the double Irish, which was to do with tax residency rules, the knowledge development box is about substance.  It is about recognising that there are companies today in this country and right around the world &ndash; and even more in the future &ndash; that will spend a significant amount of their time, energy and resources in research and development and trying to come up with novel ways of doing things.  It is a policy choice.  As a country we must decide whether we want that to happen in Ireland - if we want Irish companies to be innovative and to invest time, energy and resources in developing new products that could make significant positive differences in society and the economy.  Ultimately, we must consider whether we want foreign companies that are making decisions on where to carry out that research and development to decide to invest and create jobs in Ireland, or whether we should just sit on our hands and allow those jobs and investments to go elsewhere.  We have made our policy decision.  It is one that is internationally recognised as having merit in terms of investment in growth, and that is the reason OECD economies are increasingly driven by knowledge-based development.  It is also the reason the new rules and the new modified nexus recognises the opportunities such boxes provide.</p> <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett also made the point that if there was a tiny change to a product, it would still qualify the company to use the arrangement.  The point I was trying to make earlier is that if there was a tiny change there would be a tiny benefit.  The benefit is proportionate to the qualifying asset - the amount that was invested in the change.  I wish to make that clear as well.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked whether companies that used the double Irish could not just use the knowledge development box instead.  The non-resident company that formed part of the double Irish structure typically owned highly valuable intellectual property which was tax-resident in a zero-tax jurisdiction.</p><p>The substantial research and development activity that led to the development of such intellectual property has typically already been developed, often in the United States.  Following the rules agreed to by the OECD, to which we are referring as the modified nexus, the box has been designed in such a way that the 6.25% rate should only apply to profits that are the result of substantive research and development carried out in Ireland.  In essence, this means that if a country earns 50% from its research and development that led to the development of an asset in Ireland, 50% of the income arising from that asset will qualify for the KDB rate.  It is good that we are aspiring to have that research and development carried out in this country as it will benefit our constituents and the economy, but I take the point that the Deputy and I will not agree on it.</p><p> The Deputy also raised the issue of transfer pricing and royalties.  Differences can, obviously, arise in the legal and tax systems between countries, an issue we have discussed.  International tax planning takes account of these differences in national systems and rules.  From an Irish perspective, the profits arising here are taxed at the appropriate rate.  The Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 requires that a company's trading profits be computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice, subject to any adjustment required by tax law.  In computing such profits expenses incurred wholly and exclusively for the purpose of trade, including royalties and licence fees paid for the use of intellectual property, are deductible.  The tax code contains transfer pricing rules that apply the OECD's arm's length pricing principles to trading transactions between associated companies.  This ensures the profits chargeable to corporation tax in Ireland fully reflect the functions, assets and risks located here by a multinational group.</p><p> What companies do outside Ireland is beyond the scope of the Irish tax system.  That is the reason we have been having discussions at OECD level for the past few years.  We cannot conclusively determine the effective rate of tax paid under international tax structures by reference to the taxation paid in Ireland alone.  However, we are continuing to work with international bodies to ensure there is fair play on the international stage.  That is what the OECD process is about.  Regardless of how long I speak, I doubt that the Deputy and I will agree on this issue, but that is the explanation of my position and that of the Government.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.85" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/993" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12015111800002#F00200"><p>What is the expectation for the additional research and development activity this will generate over time?  The Minister of State has put a cost on the introduction of the knowledge development box of &euro;50 million in a full year, which presumably means that some of the profits currently taxed at 12.5% will be taxed at 6.25% when the knowledge development box is implemented.  For me, the real value of having a knowledge development box is that is generates additional investment, additional research and development related activity and, ultimately, additional employment and corporation tax revenue.  That must be the objective and the ultimate measure of whether this will work.  There should not be a cost to the State by way of tax forgone in net terms in the introduction of a knowledge development box.  The purpose is not just to change the basis on which certain profits are taxed from one rate to another, as that would not achieve the overall purpose.</p> <p>  What the Minister of State said about the European Union was interesting.  It does not require separate approval from the European Union because it meets the OECD standard.  However, that does not mean that the European Union will not at some stage initiate a probe, as it is entitled to do and as it did in the case of the United Kingdom's patent box some time ago.  Will the Minister of State clarify where this places Ireland in terms of its attractiveness as a location for research and development related activity?  Our rate of 6.25% is lower than the 10% rate in the United Kingdom.  Are there other countries in Europe that offer similar rates?  Where do we rank in the European Union, in particular?</p> <p>  On what Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett said, the key issue in terms of profit shifting, undoubtedly, relates to transfer pricing, royalty payments and moving profits from one jurisdiction to another.  As long as there are so-called Crown dependencies and overseas territories of the United Kingdom such as Bermuda, the Cayman Islands and the Virgin Islands which charge no corporation tax, companies will do what they can to channel profits to these destinations.  The way to deal with that issue is through international co-operation.  What we can control here directly are the allowable deductions against trading profits, capital allowances, research and development allowable expenditure, losses forward and so forth.  However, we must nail the issue of transfer pricing because profits are being moved from one jurisdiction to another through the transfer pricing mechanism.  Ultimately, however, I always make the point that this is about real jobs.  Last week Apple announced an additional 1,000 jobs in Cork.  When they come on stream, there will be 6,000 people in Cork city working for Apple, which is truly extraordinary.  Ireland cannot be compared with the brass plate operations in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands which are book companies facilitating the transfer of billions of euro to destinations where there is no corporation tax charged.  That is what it is about.  Until that matter is dealt with collaboratively with other countries on an international basis, we can only get our house in order.</p> <p>  I welcome the introduction of the knowledge development box, but it is right to probe and ask serious questions about it because it should enhance value and revenue.  Ultimately, that will be the measure of it.</p></speech>

I also agree that the value and benefit of the knowledge development box, KDB, to the economy should be measured in new research and development, additional jobs and investment.</p> <p>  To clarify my earlier comments on the OECD process and the European Union, while the Irish box complies with the OECD BEPS process owing to the modified nexus, that modified nexus has now been adopted in the EU code of conduct.  The European Union has given the OECD model the seal of approval, for want of a better phrase, in that regard.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked where this positioned Ireland.  That is a key question.  As the Deputy knows from engaging with multinational companies in his constituency and nationally, tax is only one element.  Companies locate here for a variety of reasons, including our talented workforce, the low turnover and high retention rates of staff, the ease of doing business, infrastructure, connectivity, access to the European Union and being the only English speaking nation in the eurozone.  This is another tool in the toolkit.  It is just one tool but when one combines it with all of the other parts of Ireland's offering and the roadmap for tax competitiveness, it places us in a strong position.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked if other countries had patent boxes.  The United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium, Hungary, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey and China have them, but ours is the only such box that is compliant with the OECD modified nexus.  As a result, it is highly likely that the boxes in competitor jurisdictions will have to be updated, modified or changed.  Luxembourg has announced that it is ending its box.  The United Kingdom is now obliged to consult on updating its box and Spain has recently announced details of its updated box.  Ireland is well positioned and IDA Ireland and the Government can now state proudly that people can come to this country, carry out research and development and avail of the knowledge development box knowing that it is fully OECD compliant and compliant with the new modified nexus.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about new research and development.  That is a pertinent question.  Anecdotally, we all know that more effort and time are being put into research, development and innovation.  One of the hard facts is the increase in the amount being availed of through the research and development tax credit, which dramatically increased from approximately &euro;290 million in 2012 to &euro;430 million in 2013.  This shows that an increasing number of companies, including Irish companies, are availing of the tax credit to carry out research and development in this country.  We must continue to monitor this closely and ensure we are putting supports in place in order that Ireland can be competitive and proudly invite people to come here as a good location in which to conduct their research and development.  We can also tell Irish indigenous companies that they can carry out their research and development here and that the Government and the State will support them.</p></speech>

I was referring to the fact that, according to the reports, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, was discussing the knowledge development box with multinationals and essentially seeking their approval.</p><p>He received very positive feedback.  There have been many such meetings with key multinationals which are not happy that there is a move internationally to close down tax avoidance schemes, but it is not the job of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, or any other Minister, to reassure them that we will not go after more of their profits in tax and that is what it sounded like in the reports.  It sounded like we were reassuring them.  I wish the Government had engaged with the water charges protesters and asked them what they would like in the tax code and how they would like taxes to be levied.  If it had, we would have a very different tax system.</p></speech>

That is not right.  The amount of tax they pay on their profits is shockingly low and obscene compared to the amount ordinary workers must pay and we should seek more from them.  Our proposal is to charge them 12.5% as a minimum effective tax rate and specify that allowances or deductions would kick in only after they had paid the 12.5%.  God almighty, 12.5% is a pretty low level of tax for them to pay on their astronomical profits.  However, even 12.5% is not low enough for these companies and we are giving them a mechanism by which they can pay half of it, which is what they have been paying through other mechanisms.  It is no coincidence that the figure set for the KDB is 6.25%.  According to EUROSTAT, 6.25% is approximately what these companies are paying.  We are establishing a system which will ensure they will not have to pay any extra tax.  We should be asking them to pay a little extra.</p> <p>  This will come back and bite us all.  If the Minister of State walks down to the Liberties area where Guinness is based, he will notice that Guinness built houses for its workers, parks, swimming pools and other infrastructure.  It was not a sublimely progressive or benevolent entity.  It made a lot of money for itself, but it understood that, in order for it to make profits and sustain its business, it had to contribute something to the infrastructure and give the employees who made its profits for it houses, basic sanitation levels, etc.  These multinationals do not think they have such responsibilities.  However, they rely on our infrastructure and need our educated workforce.  We are running into a problem, whereby the lack of affordable accommodation in the city may become a disincentive for the multinationals to locate here.</p></speech>

Why do we not have the money to provide affordable accommodation?  The answer is we will not make these companies pay taxes to contribute to our universities and infrastructure, including water infrastructure, on which they rely heavily.  They do not want to pay anything towards the cost of our infrastructure and we are facilitating them.  It is a pity we do not demand that they pay a minimum of 12.5% which they could well afford and which would give us &euro;4 billion extra in tax.</p></speech>

We can contrast this with the figure for citizens in County Wicklow, whom the Minister of State represents, who pay a tax rate of 40%.  They will not have a knowledge development box or any other tax loophole.  Ireland has been a leader in competition on corporation tax rates.  It is a central element of our international economic attractiveness.  Competition in corporation tax rates robs the citizen and locates the profits in the hands of the corporations.  Over time, it erodes the tax base and transfers money to corporations.  Around the world countries are losing corporation tax, given that they are forced to reduce their corporation tax rates as a result of a very negative competition that Ireland is leading.</p> <p>  Some 50% of the planet's wealth is owned by 1% of the population.  This extremely unequal distribution of wealth is being driven by a number of very large corporations which are making massive profits, on which they are not being taxed, while citizens are being taxed.  The Government, instead of having a big flashing neon light over the State stating &ldquo;bargain basement corporation taxes, please come in&rdquo;, must invest more in education and show it has a smarter, better educated citizenry than any other country.  We must say we have a broadband system that will beat anybody&rsquo;s such that events such as the Web Summit will not have to leave.  We must say we have a transport infrastructure in which, if an accident takes place on the Lucan bypass or the M50, the whole of the Dublin region&rsquo;s transport network will not be snarled up.</p> <p>  Paul Krugman has carried out analysis which shows that the sunshine states of America are experiencing more growth owing to the fact that their house prices are far lower than in New York and other centres.  Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett is correct.  When a company such as PayPal asks its staff if they have spare rooms to provide accommodation for potential workers in the company, it is clear that our infrastructure is snarled up.  We have reached capacity in areas that should be competitive advantages for the country.  The level of the Government's investment will decrease between now and 2020, according to the figures included in the spring statement.  We are at the bottom of the list when it comes to Government investment in these areas, which means that our competitive advantage will weaken and become more located in bargain basement corporation tax rates.  There is no doubt in my mind that the knowledge development box is part of it.  We have been forced down this route owing to the lack of Government investment.</p></speech>

However, as I was saying in my exchange with Deputy McGrath, a low stable corporate tax rate is only one piece of that broader, more complex competitiveness jigsaw.  A reform of the Northern Ireland corporation tax system does, in my view and in the view of the Department of Finance and the Government, have the potential to generate benefits on both parts of the island.  That can only be good for the island of Ireland and the economy, North and South.  It is obviously a very current issue in terms of yesterday's announcement.

Let us remember where the modified nexus for knowledge development boxes came from.  It did not come from this Government, from the Department of Finance or from the Minister, Deputy Noonan.  The modified nexus came from the OECD BEPS process, which recognised that while there is benefit in having boxes that enable and incentivise research and development, investment and growth, it is important that those boxes do not allow or facilitate aggressive tax planning.  The modified nexus is exactly what we have applied to our knowledge development box, which means that as we sit here today in this committee room, Ireland is the only country that has a knowledge development box that is compliant with the OECD modified nexus, which was put in place to reduce aggressive tax planning.  We just need to see this debate in that context.  This was an important measure put in place to combat aggressive tax planning.</p> <p>  Whether we like it or not, research and development is happening.  Every day, companies in Ireland and around the globe are using the brains of our brightest to develop new products, new ways of doing things and novel inventions to make the lives of our citizens better.  We have a choice: do we want that research and development to happen, in terms of jobs and investment in this country, or do we want Irish companies who wish to engage in research and development feeling they need to leave and move to another jurisdiction that is more supportive of incentivising that research and development, and foreign direct investment and multinational company members sitting in boardrooms around the globe today deciding they are not going to Ireland but to another jurisdiction?  I know my position on this and I know the Government's position.  We want to make sure we have a competitive but transparent regime in place to attract jobs and investment in terms of innovation, research, patents and copyright.  As has always been the industrial policy of this country through successive Governments, we want that to be based on substance and real jobs.  That is why we are doing this.</p> <p>  I am still confused about the difficulty with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Employment engaging with multinationals.  Obviously we are going to talk to businesses to see what we are doing well in this country that is making them likely to invest more in the country.  We had a public consultation process and there has been active engagement with stakeholders.  Those stakeholders included a range of NGOs over the course of 2015.  There was also a public consultation in 2015.  There were nearly 40 written submissions and officials met nearly 100 companies.  The process also included engagement with a range of Government agencies and Departments, including Enterprise Ireland, which works with indigenous Irish companies.  As is always the case with public consultations, the submissions received will be published on the Department of Finance's website.  I do not think I can say anything more to influence or change anyone's mind.</p></speech>

The general issues have been bashed around and will be again on Report Stage.  Will there be an upper limit on the amount of relief a company can get?  The Minister of State spoke about small and medium enterprises, and I am all for incentivising small and medium enterprises, but I do not believe they will be the main beneficiaries.  If it was targeted at small and medium enterprises, as the Minister of State suggested, should there not be an upper limit on how much any company can benefit?</p></speech>

That is the control.  I do not see why there is a need for an upper limit on the amount one invests in terms of developing patents and copyrights in this country and the proportion of that one makes a profit on.

However, it is missing public transparency.  It is very interesting that the public still is not allowed know what is happening.  In England, for example, when it was found out that large multinationals operating there - Google, Starbucks and a number of others - were paying extremely low corporation tax rates, the people of the country became quite annoyed and political pressure on these organisations started to grow.  These organisations began to say they had to maintain good public relations with customers, and that they would, therefore, step up to the plate regarding a better corporation tax regime.  Society is a powerful leverage with regard to tax justice.  If the information is not made public, consumers are not making full decisions on the justice behind the behaviour of these companies.  It is not good for the public not to have this power and knowledge.  Although we live in an information society, this information is withheld.  It neutralises the citizens&rsquo; ability to effect change on these companies.</p><p>I alluded earlier to the fact that many developing countries feel they are being robbed of tax by the fact that we have bargain basement tax rates here.  These countries are not necessarily in the same global tax treaties as we are.  Therefore, even though country by country reporting is going to happen, they may not have full access to the information.  These are the poorest countries, and they are likely to lose out regarding global taxation rules.</p><p>One of my worries is that I do not know how much profit companies such as Tesco make in the State.  This is a long-term bugbear of mine.  The Revenue understands, and there is a report into Revenue of the profits that are made, and they paid tax on this basis.  However, the citizen and the consumer of these large companies are deemed unworthy of full knowledge of their expenditure.  The companies operate within this State and tax is an enormous part of the justice of any state.  We, as citizens, cannot ascertain whether these companies are fulfilling tax justice.</p></speech>

Under the internationally agreed approach for country-by-country reporting, the reports filed and shared with the tax authorities must remain confidential.  The OECD and other countries involved in agreeing the BEPS report have been clear about it.</p><p>The nub of the reason I cannot accept the amendment arises from the fact that if Revenue was to make these reports publicly available, other countries would be entitled to stop exchanging country-by-country reports with Ireland.  This would result in a lot less information being made available to our tax authorities, in this case the Revenue Commissioners, and dilute the significant benefit of this important BEPS measure, which I know the Deputy welcomes. </p><p> The purpose of country-by-country reporting is to provide Revenue with the information necessary to make informed risk assessments.  It will give a clear overview of the global activities of large corporate groups.  This will enable Revenue to target audits and interventions by highlighting where there may be particular transfer pricing, something we discussed.  Making the reports public would not improve Revenue's ability to carry out this work.  Instead, it would actually make it much more difficult as Revenue would not receive, as I said, the country-by-country reports filed with the other tax authorities.</p><p> Separate from the OECD proposal for country-by-country reporting to tax authorities which is being introduced in the Finance Bill, which means that this country is implementing this proposal very quickly, the European Commission is examining the issue of public country-by-country reporting.  This would require companies to make information about operations, activities and profits in each country in which they operate publicly available, which is something the Deputy would welcome.  The Commission recently held, as the Deputy will know, a public consultation on the issue and has commissioned an impact assessment.  I and the Minister for Finance await the outcome of the impact assessment, but in any event departmental officials and the Minister will continue to engage actively in the debate on the issue at an EU level while introducing country-by-country reporting to tax authorities as agreed at the OECD as part of the BEPS process.</p><p> In general, I and the Minister, Deputy Noonan, believe it is important that a consistent approach is adopted globally to country-by-country reporting.  If we do not have a globally consistent approach, we are nearly back to square one.  For the reasons I have outlined, I am not in a position to accept the Deputy's amendment.</p></speech>

Does he think it is right that people are kept in the dark with regard to their expenditure and the tax justice behind that?

My exchange today has been with Deputies T&oacute;ib&iacute;n and Boyd Barrett.  They have rightly highlighted the need for certain information to be available to Revenue and have expressed concerns about the lack of information available.  Extra information will be available to the Revenue Commissioners and other tax authorities that we did not have before.</p> <p>  I am a firm believer in a co-ordinated and consistent multilateral approach.  As I said, the EU is carrying out an impact assessment of the issue.  We will do what any prudent Government would do, namely, when the impact assessment is completed, we will assess it and make our position very clear at that stage.</p> <p>  There is another fundamental issue.  Taxpayer information is confidential.  I do not know Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's tax information details nor do I want to.  I want to know that the Revenue Commissioners know all the relevant details they need to ensure this country receives every cent of tax it should in order that we can invest in the social services he and I want.</p></speech>

We will wait and see the outcome of the impact assessment, but I remain to be convinced about the benefit of taxpayer information being publicised.  I want to have an independent and robust tax authority that has all the information available to it.</p> <p>  Like I said, the tax information relating to the Deputy, me, his and my party is not public.  Are we going to decide that certain people's or organisations' tax information will be public?  That is why the European Union is examining the issue and why there is an impact assessment.  It is important to recognise the progress that has been made.  If Ireland does one thing on its own, that can have knock-on consequences.

This was leaked to several European Governments before it was leaked to the media and absolutely nothing happened.  As a result of the inaction of governments across Europe, it was leaked to a host of international media organisations which then published the information.  That is one example of why we need public country-by-country reporting.</p> <p>  To put it bluntly, governments cannot be trusted to make known to the public important information that is in the public interest.  I am reading quite a good paper on this very issue, which points out -  the Minister of State can confirm whether this is true - that the Irish tax authority has 201 members of staff in its office for large taxpayers, but this covers more than 12,000 companies of domestic and foreign origin, among which are 1,000 foreign transnational enterprises.  The paper goes on to point out that even with the best systems and procedures, it seems unlikely that 201 staff members would be able to scrutinise effectively and ensure the accuracy of these companies' tax returns.  That seems like a pretty good point.</p> <p>  By having them publish the information, we would save ourselves a lot of work and effort.  It would allow the public and all sorts of people to scrutinise these accounts and establish whether multinationals are playing by the rules.  It would establish whether Government policy is working.  It might be useful to know what subsidies of various types are going to companies.  The public is entitled to know all this information, particularly given the sheer size and significance of multinational companies, many of whom have bigger economies than large countries.</p> <p>  These companies are like Colossi, dominating the world economic system, and we know very little about what they are really up to.

Regardless of that sub-committee, they should attend to answer questions just as they had to appear before the British Parliament and the American Congress.</p> <p>  In 2014, PricewaterhouseCoopers conducted a poll of business leaders, of whom 59% stated that there should be public country-by-country reporting.  Even the business leaders do not see a problem with it, yet a minority of business leaders - those associated with the large multinationals - and governments with close relationships with those multinationals do not want it.  I do not see how anyone can sustain the claim that we do not need this information, given the aggressive tax avoidance of such companies, their importance to all of our lives and the way in which they influence the global economy.  It is not on that this reporting would not be done publicly.</p></speech>

It will empower the independent taxation authority - the Revenue Commissioners - to have information available to it.  The Deputy was at pains to point out examples of where such information, which Revenue did not have previously, would be useful.  I presume that, regardless of his view on whether information should be public, he accepts the logic of the current situation, whereby if we unilaterally decided to conduct country-by-country reporting, we would deprive Revenue of the vital information it needed.  The Deputy is looking confused.</p></speech>

The OECD BEPS process agreed country-by-country reporting on the condition that the information remained confidential, as all taxpayers' information remains.  If the Oireachtas decides to make such information public, it will untangle the BEPS agreement and allow other taxation authorities not to give that information to the Revenue Commissioners because we are not in compliance with the agreement.  That would be an extraordinarily foolish step to take.</p></speech>

Let us see where they go.</p> <p>  I will make a point about HSBC because the Deputy was not factually correct.  The Committee of Public Accounts probably received information regarding HSBC, but it is important to point out that there were three prosecutions in this country in respect of issues arising from that situation.  My understanding is that it all occurred before any information was made public.  Can we please give credit to the Revenue Commissioners for the job that they do?  If the Deputy wants a comparator, the UK received information on more than 1,000 cases, which resulted in one prosecution.  In this country, Revenue received information on fewer than 100 cases, which resulted in three prosecutions.  The Deputy must recognise the benefit in the role of independent Revenue Commissioners.  We decide tax policy and it is their job implement it.  They do that well.</p></speech>

The basis of many of these changes is the fact that Ireland has been an outlier as regards corporate tax, which has cost us dearly in terms of the amount of tax that we should have been receiving over a long number of years.  Changes have been made and are welcome, as is country-by-country reporting, but when the likes of Trinity College academic Professor Jim Stewart uses information from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis and estimates that the effective corporate tax paid by foreign firms is 2.2%, the damage caused by this policy shocks to the bone.  It all affects everyday human experiences.  Yesterday, we discussed with the Minister, Deputy Noonan, the 7,700 people on trolleys since the start of this year in my local hospital in County Meath, the 400,000 people on health service waiting lists, the 130,000 people on housing waiting lists and the thousands of children in emergency accommodation.  Two weeks ago, a woman rang me from a tent with her daughter because of the lack of housing in County Meath.</p><p>We see on the one hand a country whose delivery of public services has been vandalised significantly over the past five to ten years, and on the other an effective corporation tax rate - not by my estimation but that of the US Bureau of Economic Analysis and Trinity College academics - of 2.5%.  That is jarring information.  Citizens in all the constituencies are paying income tax at a marginal rate of 40%.  The purpose of this amendment and the previous amendment is to empower citizens with information and to ensure that they are no longer left in the dark as regards their spending power and their understanding of the contribution that companies make to the tax base of the State, and that information is to be made clear.</p><p> I understand the Minister stated that a change within the agreed negotiated position would reduce the ability for that to function properly.  However, there is a logic to what I am saying.  Potentially, the Minister would become a champion of information to citizens.  He should seek to push this, either through the mechanism within the amendment or in negotiations on an OECD and a European basis.</p></speech>

Obviously there are lots of different figures quoted for effective corporation tax rates, but the report, which was co-authored by Mr. Seamus Coffey and the Department of Finance, found that the effective corporate tax rate in this country was 10.7% or 10.9%, and that is documented in the report that we published.</p></speech>

I am not accepting them on the basis of the report that the Department published and co-authored with Mr. Seamus Coffey.  Let me respond directly to the amendment from Deputies T&oacute;ib&iacute;n and Doherty.</p> <p>  At 12.5%, as we have already discussed at length, Ireland has one of the most competitive headline corporate tax rates in the OECD.  Our competitive rate of corporation tax has been an important part of industrial policy in this country since the 1950s, and has attracted real and substantive operations to Ireland since then.  I refer the Deputy to an ESRI report published on budget day last year which showed what would have happened in terms of job losses and investments not made had we altered the rate of corporation tax to a higher level.</p> <p>  All companies in Ireland pay the standard 12.5% rate on their profits generated in Ireland.  A standard 25% rate applies in respect of investment, rental and other non-trading profits and profits from certain petroleum, mining or land-dealing activities.  A rate of 33% is applied to the chargeable gains of companies.</p> <p>  Some other countries may have a high headline rate of corporation tax which is then supplemented by a high number of tax reliefs.  The approach in Ireland, however, is more transparent.  We have a relatively low headline rate of corporation tax, which is applied to a broad base.  We therefore have only a small number of incentives in Ireland, but we ensure that these are targeted.  They are focused, first, on the creation of additional employment, as is consistent with current Government policy, and second, on areas of innovation, as we have already discussed, with a view to generating high-value-added economic activity.</p> <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in 2014 the Department of Finance produced a technical paper, Effective Rates of Corporation Tax in Ireland, for this committee.  The paper was produced - I acknowledge the work of this committee - as a result of discussions held during the Committee Stage of previous year's Finance Bill.  It contained a comprehensive analysis of effective rates of corporation tax paid.  It was submitted to the committee and published in April 2014.  The paper was prepared in order to provide clarity about the seemingly conflicting figures that are frequently quoted, and is an excellent resource for those seeking to understand and obtain more information about what is clearly a complex technical issue.</p> <p>  There is no internationally agreed standard for calculating effective rates of tax.  Therefore, the paper examined three different methodologies used in the calculation of effective rates of corporation tax generally.  The paper also analysed eight different figures that are quoted in respect of Ireland in greater detail.  Each of these different approaches is relevant depending on the nature of the question being addressed.  However, in attempting to assess the effective corporate tax rate applying to the total profits earned by companies in Ireland, the paper concluded that the approach based on national aggregate statistics from the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Statistics Office is the most suitable.</p> <p>  The paper found that the effective rates of corporation tax, as measured according to statistics from these two sources, are reasonably close to the headline rate of 12.5%, and that the difference is mainly accounted for by double taxation relief and a small number of other reliefs, including the research and development tax credit.  The report was based upon the analysis of effective rates across a ten-year period and, therefore, does not need to be re-examined on an annual basis.  On the basis of this extensive analysis, we are comfortable that companies in Ireland are paying the appropriate rate of corporate tax on profits generated by those companies in Ireland.</p> <p>  In relation to the publication of details on the effective rates of corporation tax paid by individual companies in the State, both the Department and the Revenue Commissioners would encounter, as we have already outlined in previous discussions, a number of issues regarding the confidentiality of individual taxpayers.  There are strict taxpayer confidentiality rules which would prohibit the Revenue Commissioners from providing taxpayer-specific information.  It would not, therefore, be feasible to publish any individual details while maintaining a taxpayer's right to confidentiality.</p> <p>  In the budget, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, announced that from 2016 onwards that certain multinational companies would be required to submit to the Revenue Commissioners an annual report of their groups' activities on a country-by-country basis - we have dealt with that already.  This will ensure that the Revenue Commissioners have improved information about the global activities of multinational companies and will help them with assessing high-level transfer pricing risks.</p> <p>  Between this new country-by-country reporting and the fact that a detailed report was provided to this committee following on from previous engagement with this committee, the Minister does not see the need to publish another report on an annual basis, considering the report looked at a ten-year period.  Given that a detailed report has previously been prepared by my Department and the need to allocate scarce resources most effectively, I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment.</p></speech>

They go from the 2.2% rate from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis to the EUROSTAT or so-called implicit rate, which is estimated at 5.9% for Ireland.  I do not accept 10.7% as a credible estimate of the effective rate precisely because, as I explained earlier, it is after the deductions that have been the mechanism through which these companies have aggressively avoided tax using intellectual property and patents.  That method of calculating the effective rate comes in after all that has been taken out of their taxable income, and one ends up with something that looks like 12.5%, but it is following the deduction of billions of euro in profits under the heading of trade charges.</p> <p>  I also believe, as I stated earlier, that it was a huge gap in the remit of that investigation into the effective rates that we did not bring some of the companies at the centre of this controversy in here to be questioned in detail about their tax affairs.  We did not get to the bottom of what was going on with effective tax rates.  The public still has the right to know the truth about this matter.</p></speech>

the exclusion from the relief of disposals by entrepreneurs of shareholdings in a company or companies which they started and which may become a quoted or public company is removed; and the amendment ensures that the relief should not be denied in cases of a reconstruction or reorganisation of a business where an original company or shareholding is replaced with a new company or new shares.</p><p> I commend the amendment to the Committee.</p></speech>

That is important, because lumping both together does not make sense.  Active investment, where investment is being made to improve the functionality and health of a business, will have outcomes for the State in that it will make the business more competitive and, hopefully, lead to more employment.  There is no doubt that this type of investment needed to be differentiated from passive investment.</p><p>My concern here is that the Government took a huge jump in reducing rates here and that this is a significant cut.  There has been significant analysis in regard to the Government having hollowed out the tax base, to a certain extent, in the budget.  USC contributors to the tax base who are on salaries over &euro;75,000 have shared in the &euro;169,000 in cuts to the USC on income below &euro;75,000.  This cut, along with the collapse in CGT here, is a difficult blow for Revenue.  Fine Gael has mentioned it expects to reduce USC further in the future and I understand there is an &euro;8 billion fiscal space in the next five years to get rid of USC, which would amount to &euro;4 billion.  This makes for a further significant cut in the tax base.  Given that we face so much pressure in regard to public service delivery, for example, the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, stated yesterday that universal health insurance is too costly and ambitious, the reduced revenue from USC and CGT at the same time, is a concern for us.</p><p>We welcome the differentiation between active and passive investment.  We were<i>en route</i>to a 33% rate for active investment and a 35% rate for passive investment but we were taken aback that the Government collapsed that to 20%. </p></speech>

Ireland is competing with other countries, the UK in particular, for high potential start-ups and this is an issue in that regard.  It has been raised by technology entrepreneurs in particular.  These people are highly mobile and can decide to start or grow their business in any jurisdiction.  The regime being introduced is a step in the right direction.  The rate in the UK is 10% for entrepreneurs.  The level here is quite low, a threshold of &euro;1 million, but it is a step in the right direction.

I know that earlier this year the Minister established a special working group comprising the Irish Charities Taxation Reform group, the Minister's Department and the Revenue Commissioners to examine how the impact of VAT on charities could be addressed.  The report published at budget time confirmed that the issue can be dealt with at national level by way of a compensation scheme rather than a direct rebate.  There are a number of such schemes already operating in different EU member states, including Denmark, which provides compensation with an in-built cap to limit exposure in the Danish exchequer.  The practical effect of the Danish scheme is to provide a partial refund of VAT to charities based on independent income collected by way of fund-raising.  I fully understand the concern that would exist in the Department to limit the scope of any change because it could ultimately continue to rise and lead, in effect, to a demand-led process, which would be of concern.</p><p>The essence of the issue is that various charities are working exceptionally hard, raising money through their volunteer networks in many cases and buying goods and services for end-users.  However, they also pay VAT.  As this is not in the course of business, as such, the charities are not able to register for VAT and reclaim any they pay.  There is an equity issue that must be very carefully examined.  I welcome the steps taken so far with the special working group but I would like us to go further with this Bill and have a report on the introduction of a capped VAT compensation scheme for charities prepared.</p></speech>

A report from the group was provided to me in my deliberations ahead of the 2016 budget.  It was published and is available on the budget 2016 website.</p> <p>  We have not taken any action on foot of the report because tax expenditures can be quite a blunt instrument and I am not convinced they constitute the best way to address the issue.  Following consultation with other member states, the report of the working group found relatively limited favourable VAT treatment for charities across Europe.  Furthermore, the existing ministerial refund orders already in place in Ireland provide some VAT relief to charitable causes.  Introducing a VAT refund scheme for charities would also, most likely, lead to similar claims from other VAT-exempt organisations, most notably sporting organisations.  Requests for new ministerial refund orders have been consistently refused since the 1980s, primarily to maintain the integrity of the VAT system.</p></speech>

The Minister seems to have concluded his own deliberations on the matter but he might clarify if the report is still under consideration.  Has the Minister reached the conclusion that this does not warrant any change to the VAT system?  It is important to establish the view of the Department and the Minister.</p> <p>  I understand the concern that this could lead to further calls in other sectors, especially from sporting bodies, which could make a legitimate case.  They are selling lottery tickets and fund-raising every week to buy equipment and pay for services on which they pay VAT.</p><p>There is a legitimate concern that there would be further related demands.  The Minister might clarify his comment that there is already provision for some VAT relief for charitable causes.

In my party's alternative budget we proposed that a 3% tax be paid by the punter.  My party has engaged massively with many of the smaller firms operating within the industry.  We have heard the view that a 1% turnover tax on a small firm could equate to a tax of 20% or 30% on the profits made by that firm.  Therefore, we have decided that a 3% tax should be paid by the punter.  That would lift the weight from the smaller operator or bookie and create a level playing field.  The proceeds of such a tax could be used to fund the horseracing industry or resource services for people with gambling addictions, etc.  It would establish greater revenues.  There is a concern, especially among smaller operators in this sector, that one or two very large players in the gambling industry have a great deal of influence and control.  It has been suggested they potentially have the ear of the Government.  Does the Minister agree that it would be economically beneficial to small businesses that are trying to create jobs and that it would improve the market structure if the burden was not placed on small operators in the manner in which it is currently placed on them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.223" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12015111800002#BB00900"><p>The Betting (Amendment) Act 2015 was enacted on 15 March last.  It provides a regulatory system for remote bookmakers and betting intermediaries, otherwise known as betting exchanges, that offer betting services in Ireland, regardless of their location.  The Act provides for fair and equal treatment of all bookmakers by extending betting duty to remote operators, thereby widening the tax base and protecting the Exchequer from the leakage of potential tax revenue.  Prior to the enactment of the legislation, excise duty was payable at a rate of 1% on bets entered into with a traditional bookmaker.  Since the application of duty to the remote sector from 1 August 2015, licensed remote bookmakers are now liable for 1% duty on the amount of a bet from customers in the State and licensed remote betting intermediaries are now liable for 15% duty on the commission charged to customers in the State.  </p> <p>  There have been a number of calls for an increase in the rate of duty applying to betting.  However, my preferred approach has been to put a regulatory regime in place for the sector and then to extend the base on which the 1% rate applies, thereby ensuring the tax is applied fairly and widely on a level playing field for all.  This system is now in place.  The first two months of duty from the remote sector have yielded &euro;3.3 million, which would imply a yield of approximately &euro;20 million in a full year.  It is better to wait until the new remote taxation regime has bedded in before considering changes to the rate and type of taxation.  As I said, the priority is to allow time for the new regulatory regime to bed in.  In addition, the application of a charge directly on the punter as requested would be problematic.  Punters who bet via remote means are highly sensitive and such a change would incentivise tax avoidance.  All betting firms, including betting exchanges, share this view.  They would prefer the tax liability to remain with the firms.  That these companies would prefer to bear the tax is a clear indication of how challenging it would be to enforce this proposal.  </p> <p>  All taxes are reviewed on an ongoing basis by officials from my Department and Revenue.  I assure the Deputy that the betting tax will be kept under review to monitor the operation of the new regime.  Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

In regard to section 6 which amends section 123B of the 1999 Act, I announced in the Budget Statement that I was replacing the current flat rate charges for cash cards and debit cards of &euro;2.50 and &euro;5, respectively, with a charge of 12 cent for each cash withdrawal from an ATM.  I am seeking to incentivise consumers to use more modern forms of payment such as debit cards instead of withdrawing cash from ATMs.  I am also seeking to reduce the amount of cash in circulation.  After the publication of the Finance Bill, my officials engaged in further consultation with representatives of the financial services sector.  A number of amendments are proposed on foot of this consultation.  The amendments are intended to address concerns that have been raised about the practical effects of changing from a flat rate charge to a charge based on usage.  They will also generally update section 123B of the 1999 Act in order that it reflects current banking practice.</p><p>Amendment No. 69, the main amendment in the group, specifies 31 December in each year as the date that determines whether a charge arises.  A charge will arise where the particular card is valid on that date and where the cardholder has an address in the State on that date.  The charge is also being confined to cash withdrawals from ATMs situated in the State.  Provision is being made for circumstances in which a card that is cancelled or expires during a year is replaced by another card before 31 December of that year.  The original card and the replacement card are treated as a single card for the purposes of liability to the stamp duty charge and imposing the monetary cap on the charge.</p><p>There are a series of minor technical amendments in relation to the removal of references to debit cards as such cards, within the meaning of section 123B, have become redundant.  In practice, cards that a debit function only have been replaced by cards that contain the dual functions of a cash card and a debit card.  Section 123B refers to such cards as combined cards.  The higher monetary cap of &euro;5 compared to the lower cap of &euro;2.50 is only applied where both functions of a &quot;combined card&quot; are used.  Where only the cash card function is used the lower monetary cap applies.  <br/><br/>An amendment that is not connected with the charge on the basis of charge was made to sections 123B and section 124 of the Finance Bill, as published, so as to update the definitions used in these sections for different types of financial institution.  These definitions are based on those used in EU regulations.  However, an unintended consequence of adopting the current EU regulation was to bring An Post and credit unions within the charge to stamp duty.  These latest amendments to sections 123B and 124 exclude these bodies and maintain the <i>status quo</i>in relation to chargeable persons.  <br/><br/>I recommend the amendments to the House. </p></speech>

What the Minister is trying to do here to incentive electronic payments is a positive development.  In these amendments he is trying to deal with some of the anomalies that have been flagged on foot of the introduction of this measure.  As the Minister is aware this is on foot of the movement to the interchange fee cap which kicks in from 9 December.  Is it possible for the Minister to introduce it at an earlier date than 9 December? I asked on Second Stage that it be introduced from 1 December, purely because there are only 24 days in the run up to Christmas, to give retailers the maximum opportunity to comply, rather than on 9 December as proposed under the EU directive.</p> <p>  We are moving from a fixed rate charge per transaction to a percentage of the overall value of the transaction.  While that incentivises people to use cards for small payments the difficulty is it prohibits them from using cards for large payments because the charge is now a percentage of the overall bill.  Traditionally, the cohort that has been slowest to move from the cheque book has been the farming community.  If a farmer is buying cattle at a mart and given that the charge is a percentage of the transaction we are talking about a significant fee being generated which either the farmer or the co-operative in the mart has to carry.  Is it possible to have a look at the directive before it is implemented fully so that we are not introducing a further disincentive to electronic payments where large amounts are involved and forcing people to go back to the old paper-based systems and cheques?  I understand that some businesses that deal with large transactions including the co-operative livestock marts are looking to withdraw this particular service because of the banking fees involved. </p></speech>

My estimate is that is worth about &euro;37 million to the retail sector not in a transfer from the taxpayer but in a transfer from the banks and the finance houses.  That is beneficial.  I am advised that 9 December is a date that the industry has selected following EU regulation.  I have no role in setting the date so we cannot change it here.</p> <p>  Caps are being introduced on debit cards by Visa which will limit the total charge on debit cards to &euro;1.  That is additional information. </p></speech>

It does not work out that way.  I am sure the Deputy knows such people also.  Younger people are more adaptable and will move on.  I do not think the effective date, as long as it is pretty quick, matters that much.  What matters is that we are putting the new facilities in place to encourage people to avail of these systems of payment which are electronically transacted.</p></speech>

I agree that people have some flexibility and an opportunity to reduce the level of stamp duty they are paying but this has to be viewed alongside the actual bank charges because these are Government charges.  Bank charges are a different animal.  The present bank charges can be very significant.  I have checked AIB as a case in point - it charges 35 cent for an ATM withdrawal, 20 cent for each debit card purchase, something the Minister is encouraging in the drive for an cashless society, combined debit card purchase with cash back, 20 cent and any staff assisted transaction, 39 cent.  These are the sample charges of one individual bank.  The Minister's policy is fine but it needs to be consistent with what the banks are doing in practice because the amount the customer is paying is the Government stamp duty plus the actual bank charges.</p><p>I submit the bank charges are not going in the same direction as the initiatives the Minister is proposing.  Has the Central Bank examined this issue?  Is it talking to the individual banks?  It is true that the staff-assisted transactions incur higher charges than automated transactions but if they did not impose such high charges for each withdrawal or debit card purchase, for example, people might be prepared to hold less cash.</p></speech>

I understand AIB charges 35 cent for a withdrawal at an ATM machine and Bank of Ireland charge 20 cent.  Some cards are free at point of use but they charge a quarterly fee.  One will find it has been done when one gets the statement, but Deputy McGrath is right.  There must be pressure on people and one of the most significant actions we took in this package of measures in the budget was to reduce the bank fee on the credit card and debit card transactions for purchasers in a shop, for example, from 20 cent to ten cent.  As I said to Deputy Naughten, that is a delivery of approximately &euro;37 million to the retail sector from the banks by reducing the fee.  It is something with which we will likely continue.</p></speech>

If a bank charges 20 cent to use that debit card to buy a newspaper for &euro;2, it is 10% of the cost of what they are buying so if they have cash in their pocket they will use that instead of using the debit card because of the cost incurred.  If it is a small transaction people will be much more likely to use cash because of the bank charges that apply to automated transactions.</p></speech>

I will read the full note.</p> <p>  There are two important dates that are relevant for the taxation of an inheritance.  These dates are used for different purposes. First, the date of death of a disponer is the date by reference to which the group tax-free thresholds and tax rates are determined.  Therefore, whatever thresholds and rates are in force on this date apply for the purpose of taxing the value of an inheritance.  These rules are based on statute and are strictly applied.</p> <p>  Second, the date on which probate or administration is granted is generally used as the "valuation" date.  The valuation date is the date on which the market value of the assets or property comprising the inheritance is established.  This market value is then compared to the relevant group threshold and the tax rate applied as appropriate on any excess of the market value over the threshold.  This date also determines when any inheritance tax must be paid and a tax return must be submitted to Revenue.  However, as stated, the thresholds and rates in force at the date of death of the disponer apply for the purpose of taxing the value of the inheritance.</p> <p>  Also, for capital gains tax, CGT, purposes, where a person acquires assets as a legatee of a deceased person, that person is treated as acquiring those assets at the date of death of the deceased person.</p> <p>  It is a general legislative principle that tax legislation should follow general law.  According to the law of inheritance an inheritor comes to own an inherited asset on the date of inheritance, rather than on any other date.  This is therefore the soundest and most appropriate date for the rules relating to the rates and thresholds relating to capital acquisitions tax, CAT, which are necessarily specific and precise to apply.</p> <p>  The amount of time elapsing between inheritance and grant of probate can vary greatly, and can also be determined to a large extent by inheritors themselves.  As such, were the rate of tax due and the tax-free threshold available to be defined by date of probate there would be considerable scope for individuals to delay probate with the hope that the CAT regime would become more favourable for them.</p> <p>  While I understand that there are inheritors for whom it would currently be advantageous for the tax-free threshold and rate of tax to apply according to the date of probate, as the threshold for inheritances from parents has been increased, there have been and could again be situations where the opposite is the case, for instance, when the thresholds have been reduced or the rate increased.</p> <p>  To apply CAT rules with respect to the date of probate would also be in conflict with the CGT provisions that treat the date of death of a deceased person as the acquisition date by a legatee for the purposes of that tax.</p></speech>

This proposal is to go further to increase it to &euro;300,000.  This is not an issue on which there is agreement.  Different parties and representatives have different perspectives on it but it is a legitimate aspiration for elderly people in particular who wish to pass on a home or another asset to a son, daughter or other family members and it should be encouraged because, ultimately, that asset has been built up after tax income, a point often forgotten.  People pay for the home and pay their mortgage from their net income, which has already been taxed.</p><p>The move the Minister has made is a significant one.  It is going in the right direction but I would like to see it go further.  Did the Minister examine at any stage the possibility of having a separate treatment for a home?  There are provisions in law whereby somebody can inherit their parent's house tax free if they have been living in it and caring for the parent for a period of time and so forth but has the Minister examined the issue of dealing with a home separately from other assets?  Also, why did he decide not to amend the thresholds that apply to the other two categories, B and C, for inheritances from wider family members?</p></speech>

The examination I did on the family home was to satisfy myself that persons who lived in the family home and who previously were acting as carers could inherit the family home without any inheritance tax liability.</p><p>Having established that this was the case and that the conditions attached were not very onerous, I did not move to make changes in this regard.  I changed the threshold from &euro;225,000 to &euro;280,000 because property prices have been increasing and the cuts the Government made in the thresholds on capital taxes were made when the State and the Exchequer were in penury and the Government needed every euro it could gather.  However, the provisions now are fairer, and this will be reviewed in future years if I am in a position to so do.  This year, while I initially looked beyond the parent-to-child transaction, I did not have enough resources to do anything more significant.  My point is that it was not because I disagreed in principle but because I thought it better to dedicate the resources I had to parent-child transactions, rather than letting it go out to those in class B and class C.</p></speech>

According to the figures he presented, the most affluent 20% in the State own 73% of the State's wealth, while the poorest 20% in the State had 0.2% of the wealth of the State.  By any judgment, this divide is severe and shocking.  He also stated that the combined wealth of the top 5% was almost double that of the entirety of middle earners - that is, the squeezed middle.  According to Revenue data, the top 1% of income earners in Ireland had an average income of &euro;373,300 on an annual basis, whereas the bottom 90% earned approximately &euro;27,000 per year.  Members are not discussing normal times by any means.  They are not talking about the 1970s or the 1980s or the normal left-right or rich-versus-poor debate.  This is about a modern phenomenon of incredibly concentrated wealth in the hands of extremely few people.  This has happened under the Minister's watch in recent years and many would state that it has accelerated under his watch.</p><p>The idea of a wealth tax is not new.  Interestingly, the Aire made an important and true statement yesterday, when he noted that there was a difference between wealth and income.  There is a significant difference between the two, and therefore there must be a method whereby both income and wealth are taxed.  There is a strong body of opinion worldwide to the effect that for those who have a high level of wealth, perhaps in excess of &euro;1 million, that is not concentrated in farms or businesses, the wealth itself can offer an opportunity to source income for the State and can be used to address the inequalities within the State.  The Nevin Institute calculated, on the basis of 2013 data from the Central Statistics Office, that a wealth tax which excluded people's homes, farmland, vehicles and pensions and which was levied at a rate of 0.5% could raise approximately &euro;400 million per annum.  In a response to a question from Deputy Pearse Doherty in the D&aacute;il Chamber a year or two ago, the Minister admitted that this was the ballpark figure.  Given the catastrophic division between rich and poor and given the life-and-death challenging experiences of many people at the bottom, would it not be a good idea to accept this amendment?  This amendment does not proceed as boldly as to suggest that a wealth tax should be implemented.  All it seeks is for a report to be written on the options available in this regard.  In other words, the Minister is merely being asked to research the options available in order that he might have the possibility of another tool in his toolbox regarding the raising of revenue.</p></speech>

I do not propose to accept this amendment.  The Government has no plans to introduce a wealth tax, although all taxes and potential taxation options are of course constantly reviewed.  Wealth can be taxed in a variety of ways, some of which are already in place in Ireland.  Capital gains tax, CGT, and capital acquisitions tax, CAT, are, in effect, taxes on wealth, as they are levied on an individual or company on the disposal of an asset, in the case of CGT, or the acquisition of an asset through gift or inheritance in the case of CAT.  Deposit interest retention tax, DIRT, is charged at 41%, with limited exemptions, on interest earned on deposit accounts.  The local property tax, which was introduced in 2013, is a tax based on the market value of residential properties.  The domicile levy introduced in budget 2010 also constitutes a form of wealth tax.  It is aimed at high-wealth individuals with a substantial connection to Ireland, regardless of whether they are tax-resident, to ensure they make a tax contribution to this country in a year of at least &euro;200,000.</p> <p>  In order to estimate the potential revenue from a wealth tax, it would first be necessary to identify the wealth held by individuals.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they currently have no statistical basis for compiling estimates on a potential wealth tax.  Although an individual's assets and liabilities are declared to the Revenue in a number of specific circumstances - for example, after a death - this information is not a complete measure of financial assets in the State, nor is it recorded in a manner that would allow analysis of the implications of an overarching wealth-based tax.  Comprehensive data on household wealth in Ireland, including assets and liabilities, were published for the first time earlier this year by the CSO.  These data have been collected across the entire eurozone according to a standardised methodology.  The data indicate that wealth inequality in Ireland for 2013, as measured by the Gini coefficient, is lower than the eurozone average.  The results also show that wealth is less concentrated at the top of the distribution here than the eurozone average.  Central Bank analysis of the data also indicates that while wealth inequality has increased since 2011, it is actually lower than in 2006, the earliest period for which data are available.</p> <p>  As part of the research programme agreed between my Department and the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, covering macroeconomic and taxation issues, a research project involving detailed analysis of wealth distribution and taxation has been included.  It is intended that this research project, based on the household finance and consumption survey, HFCS, published this year by the CSO, will commence shortly.  A number of the issues highlighted by the amendments proposed by Deputies Pearse Doherty and Richard Boyd Barrett, including the estimation of the potential tax base and the yield of a wealth tax in Ireland, already feature as part of the work planned for the project.  It should be noted that the data gathered by the CSO as part of the HFCS were not collected for the purpose of calculating the potential yield from a wealth tax but to collect general information on the financial situation and behaviour of households.</p> <p>  My Department will monitor and consider any additional information and data that come to light and will continue to examine potential taxation sources, as I stated at the beginning of this reply.</p><p>I do not intend to accept the amendment.</p><p> The Deputy referred at length to Mr. McWilliams's television programme.  Mr. McWilliams relied heavily for his data on a Credit Suisse report but that report indicated that much work remained to be done to refine estimates of wealth in a country.  I do not know whether the television piece was completed before the CSO report was published in January but Mr. David McWilliams did not reference it.  I refer to the report on the household finance and consumption survey which was published by the Central Statistics Office in January 2015.  It presented the results of the household finance and consumption survey I referred to already.  The survey was carried out between March 2013 and September 2013 on behalf of the Central Bank.  Such surveys were carried out across Europe.  The main highlights of the report were that a household's main residence accounts for the majority of most households' gross wealth at 48% on average.  Financial assets account for a much smaller proportion of gross wealth at an average of 13%.  More than half of households hold some form of debt, with mortgage indebtedness proving to be a particularly heavy burden for young cohorts.  However, the mortgage repayment burden is more evenly spread across the age distribution, with younger borrowers benefiting from lower interest rates and long mortgage terms.  The median value of net wealth is &euro;105,000.  This is in line with other European countries where the average is &euro;109,000.  The top 20% of households hold 70% of net assets, which is similar to the position in other European countries.  In Ireland, the concentration of wealth at the top end of the distribution is driven by two factors, namely, larger holdings or real assets and relatively smaller holdings of debt.  As such, a great deal of the Deputy's argument was based on incorrect facts.  It is not his fault they are incorrect, they come from other sources.</p></speech>

As such, the data may not have been available when the programme was filmed.  However, it casts a totally different light on the distribution of wealth in Ireland.  Anybody who is pursuing the option of a wealth tax should remember that, on average, 48% of a household's gross wealth is the family home.  We have already taxed the family home with the local property tax, a move on our part with which some of the Deputies do not agree.</p></speech>

That is equivalent to the bottom 20% of the income distribution.  Even even on those figures, wealth distribution is grossly lopsided.</p></speech>

The CSO references those in the top 20% of the income distribution having 40% of the wealth.  The CSO crosses the two items there.  It says that those in the bottom 60% of the income distribution are at the same level of wealth.  That is approximately two thirds.  The top 20% in the income distribution has three times the wealth of the bottom two thirds.  Even on the basis of the figures to which the Minister refers, there is no doubt that we have a lopsided wealth distribution.  By the Minister's own admission, it has got worse since 2011 when he took office.  That was one of the first things he said.</p> <p>  I have been a Deputy for four and a half years.  Approximately two years ago the Minister admitted the need for a budget costings office which Opposition parties could use to develop and cost alternative proposals.  Such a service would improve the quality of the budgetary debate and avoid the same old arguments about how Opposition proposals are not properly costed.  We could then discuss real figures and real policy differences.  That has not happened.  One of the outcomes of acceptance of the amendment before us would to allow us to begin examining the options available with regard to a wealth tax.  The Minister mentioned that we were in penury while ago and said that every single available cent was chased.  He also said that capital gains tax is a wealth tax.  That tax was reduced in the budget.  There were changes regarding a capital acquisitions tax, which led to it also being reduced.  The Minister also referred to the property tax.  The latter is a blind and blunt asset tax.  People who own houses worth &euro;200,000 on which they owe &euro;400,000 come to my office on a weekly basis.  They are being taxed at the same rate as those who own similar houses debt free.  There is a blindness there.  It is not a smart tax.  It does not identify the differences in the wealth of individuals.</p> <p>  A woman in my constituency had her home heating oil stolen from her tank during the summer.  For the next few months she got up late in the morning in order to skip breakfast, ate lunch in her own home and went to her daughter's house for dinner.  She would not have had enough money to pay for the oil without making those savings.  Some people are on the edge of existence yet they are subject to a blind and blunt property tax which they pay the same rate as the millionaire next door who owns a yacht.  All we are saying is that we should be developing smart taxes which take into account the real worth of an individual and which take account of the fact that if a person is extremely wealthy and has deep pockets, he or she should contribute a little more.  That is why I tabled the amendment.</p></speech>

In so far as the Department of Finance can cost them for the Deputy, it will do so.  However, I pointed out in my initial reply that there is no database of the wealth of the nation within any State agency, including the Revenue Commissioners.  It is very difficult to construct a tax if one does not know the base to which it applies.  The positions the Deputy has taken up are exaggerated because the distribution of wealth in Ireland is fairer than in most countries across Europe.  The CSO's research proves that.  It also shows that the position now is more fair than it was in 2006 when the first data became available.</p><p>It is not deteriorating.  The Deputy makes the comparison with 2011.  The reason the situation is different from 2011 is that the policies pursued by the Government have caused a recovery in the economy and the recovery is happening rapidly.  Part of that recovery is a growth in asset prices.  As the Deputy says, people on the top incomes tend to have more assets than people on low incomes.  As a consequence, their wealth increases because the value of their assets increases.  That is not a deliberate action of the Government; it is a consequence of the success of the Government in getting the economy out of hock and getting it to grow at rates of 6.2% in net terms in 2015.  The Deputy is right to say that 20% of the top earners have 40% of the wealth, but the same 20% pay 80% of all the taxes.  Any analysis of Irish society shows that it has one of the fairest tax systems in the OECD.  Many of the rhetorical points the Deputy makes are exaggerated.  That is not to say that his party is not fully within its rights to propose a wealth tax to the electorate, but it needs to make sure that it knows the asset base on which it is applying the wealth tax, especially if it is omitting family homes, as 48% of all wealth is in the value of family homes.</p></speech>

If the Government does not collect the information, it cannot manage this issue properly either.  It is quite shocking that the Government does not know the wealth of the nation.  It does not know the wealth in the hands of the people of the State.  That means it is blind to one of the biggest economic aspects of running the country, and if it does not know that information it cannot manage that process properly.  It is not an argument for non-collection; it is an argument for the collection of that information.  If the Nevin institute can work that out from the 2013 CSO data, surely the Government can put in place some level of information to collect.  We might disagree on the wealth tax but, at the very least, can we not agree on the necessity to manage the affairs of the nation with the information at our hands?</p></speech>

There are a number of points I want to make.  For some time we have been arguing for a wealth tax.  In our pre-budget submissions I quoted extensively from both the most recent Credit Suisse report and the one before that to press the argument for a wealth tax.  The Minister comes back with the same arguments each year.  To some extent we are on ideological terrain, because the Minister just does not believe in doing this, but it is worth responding to some of the points he has made.  There is a distinction between wealth and income.  That is absolutely true.  Sometimes when we talk about the need to tax wealth and higher incomes, other Government spokespeople - not so much the Minister - blur that distinction for political and rhetorical purposes.  We are very clear about the distinction and believe we need to capture extra revenue for the State from higher incomes and wealth from capital and financial transactions.  We are very clear on the distinction, as I am sure the Minister is, so he should not misrepresent our view on this.  I said to the Minister yesterday that there is a connection between income and wealth.  It is spelt out in the Credit Suisse report - if the Minister has read it - and it is obvious if one thinks about it.  They are not the same thing but there is a connection.  Credit Suisse makes the point explicitly in its report that those who receive higher incomes over time generate wealth because-----</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for making my point for me.  Only a tiny group of people has surplus wealth.  That is critical.  Only a very small group of people has surplus wealth.  Most people have debt.  That is what they have.  The owe money.  When income, wealth and assets are set against liabilities, for most of their lives most people are operating in negative territory.  For a small minority of people, that is not the case.  We are trying to get at the very small group that has extraordinary wealth.  That is also linked to the fact that they have very high incomes, so they have surplus wealth every year that they can translate into wealth, as the Minister put it.  That wealth becomes self-perpetuating.  If someone has a lot of money, a million quid, it makes money for them.  They just sit there and watch it accumulate.  As the Minister pointed out, it is not just property.  We understand the distinction, but the point is to get at that accumulated wealth.</p> <p>  The Minister says that for the majority of people the wealth they have is primarily made up of the family home.  This is obviously by way of justification of the property tax.  That is true for the majority of people but when one reaches the top 5%, or the top 1%, that is no longer true.  Their family homes are a much smaller proportion of their overall wealth, which is made up of commercial property interests, big investments and cash.  The purpose of a wealth tax is to capture that.  Even on the most conservative assessment of wealth distribution, as the Minister has set out with the CSO report, if we accept that the top 20% - approximately 300,000 people - have 40%, a conservative estimate is that they have &euro;151 billion, most of which is assets other than family homes.  That is the point.  One will find that the concentration is even greater when one gets to the top 10%, but with that top 20%, the &euro;151 billion that they have consists mostly of commercial property or financial assets.  If a 2.5% tax was put on that &euro;151 billion owned by the top 20%, it would raise &euro;1 billion a year.</p><p>They would still end up wealthier at the end of each year if a wealth tax at a rate of 2.5% were levied on them annually; it is just that the growth of their wealth would be slowed down.  The average increase in the value of that wealth, accounting for investments, etc., is probably running at 4% to 5%.  Those affected would still end up better off, but the accumulation and concentration of their wealth would be slowed down.  It would be a very significant boon to the Exchequer.  Why would the Minister not even consider opting for this, or even a measure that was a little more conservative?  We suggest a rate of 2.5%, but even a slightly more conservative rate would result in a few hundred million euro.  Why would the Minister not even consider this as a source of revenue rather than unloading a regressive property tax on those who cannot afford it?</p></speech>

I just disagree with him, but I am also pointing to the difficulties in his construction.  We have wealth taxes - capital taxes - and they are imposed at high rates.  If one transfers property or anything else to somebody else, there is gift tax at a rate of 33%, with very low thresholds.  On inheritance, one pays at a rate of 33%, with very low thresholds, particularly if one is not in the direct line of descent.  There is also the property tax, to which I referred on a number of occasions.</p> <p>  I do not understand socialism in Ireland.  If one was to search the world, one would not find a group describing itself as socialist that refused to tax property.  I do not get it.  The Deputy requested that we not tax property.  The property tax is on all property, but the Deputy will not tax the big mansions in which those against whom he targets most of his rhetoric live.  They comprise the wealthy, multimillionaires or those with all of the wealth he describes so graphically, but he opposes me when I tax big mansions.  I hope to convert him as time passes.  At least Deputy Paul Murphy has now paid his property tax, which is an advancement on what has happened.  He probably has a date in 2017 with a circle around it on the calendar on which he will pay his water charges.</p> <p>  I do not understand Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett's position and I am forced into wondering whether, for populist reasons, he is afraid to tax property.  I wonder why he would not do the simple thing and tax property.  He opposes doing so.  The party the members of which are beside him proposes to remove property tax when it gets into power, yet property tax is a tax on fixed assets.  All wealth taxes are on assets.  The most effective wealth taxes, if there are effective wealth taxes, are on fixed assets.  The proposal from the Deputy is that family homes, including mansions, be exempt.  According to Sinn F&eacute;in, land would be exempt.  What fixed assets are left?  One could tax liquid assets such as cash in the bank, but DIRT is paid on them already.  For how long does the Deputy believe the money would stay in the Irish banks if one was to levy a tax on it at a rate of 2.5% or 3%?  For how long does he believe there would be share transactions in the Irish Stock Exchange if share capital value were to be levied on the basis of his belief that it constituted wealth?  What is his position on pension funds?  I placed a levy on pension funds to provide me with the resources to reduce the rate of VAT in the hospitality sector from 13.5% to 9%.  I introduced it as a temporary measure, but there was outrage among the Opposition.  It was opposed to left, right and centre and I was told I could not do it.  It was an effective wealth tax, but, again, it was opposed.</p> <p>  The Deputy is against every wealth tax, except some mythical one that applies to very little or assets that will move.  He should go back to the drawing board and come up with realistic propositions.  Sinn F&eacute;in is seeking to exempt so much from the wealth tax it proposes that I do not know exactly to what wealth it would apply.  I notice that it did not exempt farmyards, although it exempted land.  Dairy farmers would need to look out for this because bulk tanks, equipment and machinery constitute quite a lot of wealth on a farm.  Now that I have mentioned it, I suppose another exemption will be proposed when the wealth tax is refined.</p> <p>  I disagree with what the Deputy is doing.  He does not propose the obvious steps such as building on the wealth taxes we have and supporting a property tax such as the one in place.  He should agree with a levy on pension funds such as the one we had, although I removed it completely.  That gave me the resources I needed to do a good job for the tourism industry, yet the Deputy keeps talking about a wealth tax that would bring in hundreds of millions of euro.  He will not do the obvious.</p></speech>

In responding to the suggestion we collect data on wealth I must re-emphasise that we are focusing, in particular, on those at the very top, not the ordinary person who has a house.  I refer to those with multiple properties and vast financial and other assets.  They are the people at whom we are trying to get.  The Minister says he or people might balk at collecting data for each individual, but that happens all the time in the case of the ordinary citizen.  If the poor apply for a social welfare payment, they are means-tested forensically on their income and assets before receiving it.  The Minister has the information on property through the property tax system.  He has gathered it.</p> <p>  The second home tax was progressive.  It was levied on properties one had, in addition to the family home.  We could reinstate and increase that tax and consider the property assets in question and their concentration.  It would be interesting to see who owned multiple properties and ascertain what tiny group of investors and property owners owned multiple properties.  We would find there was a heavy concentration in this area.  We should direct taxes at those who are generating considerable revenue and have an appreciating asset because of concentrated ownership of large amounts of property.  There is nothing to stop the Government from gathering information that would allow us to have a wealth tax targeted not at family homes but at the very wealthy, or those who have many financial and property assets above and beyond the family home.</p></speech>

The Minister referenced second and subsequent homes.  If the Minister were to abolish the property tax and impose a &euro;400 tax on second homes, a person who owns two homes would be a net saver under the Sinn F&eacute;in policy because instead of paying &euro;300 property tax on the first home and &euro;300 in property tax on the second home he or she would pay only &euro;400 on the second home.  What is being proposed would only apply in respect of multiple homes.  The key issue is that the wealth of a family in terms of the price of a house suffered a massive rupture because of the housing crisis, which rupture has not been experienced anywhere else in the world.  As a result, property prices are not a good analysis of the wealth of a family.  The Minister has frozen the property tax this year because he knows that the value of property over the next couple of years could increase so much it would be out of all proportion to the wealth of the family.  That freezing of the property tax is an admission that the tax is a blind, blunt instrument to identify the wealth of a family, which does not take into consideration the debt of a family.</p> <p>  There is an ideological reticence within the Fine Gael Party to take money from those who are extremely wealthy in this country and to invest that money in services for those are extremely poor.  That is the bottom line.  That cannot continue.  The Minister can dress this up any way he likes but it cannot be hidden from people.  I propose to press the amendment.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 76 provides that the Minister report on the cost of the proposed freezing of the local property tax and the likely property prices in 2019.  We are dealing with a method of taxation of families which is unstable.  To stabilise it in the election cycle the Government had to freeze it.  I would like to know the likely cost of the property tax freeze and likely property prices in 2019.</p><p>Amendment No. 78 deals with an issue of significant importance to a large section of our population.  The amendment provides:</p><blockquote>The Minister shall, within one month of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann a report on options on extending the exemptions from the Local Property Tax to residents in buildings unsafe because of fire safety regulations or other structural issues.</blockquote> <p>The Minister will have a lot of experience of people with regard to pyrite.  These are people whose homes, because they are crumbling, have almost zero value.  My understanding is that if following the carrying out of a particular test a house is identified as having significant pyrite damage, the owner can seek an exemption from the local property tax on that basis, and that the exemption applies for only six years.  As such, in terms of the cost of the test, the exemption is useless.  There are other people similarly affected, for example, the people of Longboat Quay and Riverwalk Court, which is in Meath.  These people are living in houses that are practically valueless because they do not meet necessary standards.  Would it not be useful to extend the exemption to these individuals?  Deputy Doherty has constituents in Donegal whose houses contain muscovite mica, and similar to those affected by the pyrite disaster, they have lost confidence in living in their houses or else the value of their properties has dissolved.</p></speech>

That is the purpose of the decision.  The revaluation date was due in November 2016.  We will now defer it.  It is difficult to estimate the potential loss because determination of that requires insight into the expectations of the percentage rise in value up to 2019.  It is difficult to give the Deputy a figure in this regard but it is probably in excess of &euro;100,000 or &euro;125,000 on average.  That is a very loose estimate because, as I said, it may be the case in 2017 or 2018 that house prices have stabilised.  If appeared last year that there would be a continuing rise.  I cannot give a realistic estimate.  That can only be done retrospectively from 2019.</p> <p>  On the pyrite issue, I answered a question this morning in the D&aacute;il which set out the position in this regard.  The Government has accepted the proposals of Dr. Don Thornhill in respect of pyrite-affected houses as set out in his report.</p><p>I published the report in the documents accompanying the Budget Statement.  Effectively, it is no longer necessary for a householder to have an expensive assessment, which might cost &euro;2,000, carried out, especially when the benefit is much smaller than the cost of acquiring it.  It will be done on a self-assessment basis.  The Revenue Commissioners will accept the Thornhill recommendations on an administrative basis in the first instance, pending legislation being passed to give it the statutory basis that is required.  In the next two weeks the Revenue Commissioners will publish a protocol setting out the position, to make it easier for persons whose family home is affected by pyrite to claim the exemption from property tax.</p><p> Regarding the other categories of houses mentioned by the Deputy, such as those in Donegal and Longboat Quay, the local property tax is self-assessed.  If somebody decides that his or her house is of very low value - and I presume no house has nil value - that is what he or she should return to the Revenue Commissioners.  The tax is based on the value as self-assessed.  The legislation governing the administration of the local property tax provides for a limited number of exemptions from the tax.  There is no specific exemption for properties affected by mica and there are no plans to introduce such an exemption.  Local property tax operates on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for the property owner, in the first instance, to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the market value of the property.  When making an assessment, issues such as the presence of the mica will be one of the factors that a property owner should take into account in valuing the property.</p><p> If somebody is claiming their house is worth very little because it has a mica problem, it would be prudent for the householder to indicate this when returning the property return to the Revenue Commissioners and to provide some evidence that this is the case.  Otherwise, the Revenue Commissioners might revert to them if comparable houses in the area were paying significantly more in property tax and the discrepancy could not be explained from the Revenue Commissioners' perspective.</p></speech>

The latter was a brake on families proceeding in that direction.</p> <p>  I worry about the self-assessment element.  Many of the people in Riverwalk Court, Longboat Quay and in Donegal suffering as a result of the impact of muscovite mica are under fierce stress already.  One's home is one of the foundations of one's well-being and if it is unsafe or is crumbling, that can have a massive impact in the context of stress.  In addition, self-assessment is very stressful.  Most business people or self-employed people who use the Revenue on-line service to carry out the self-assessment can be very stressed about being correct that their liability is X or Y.  Even if they are entitled to money back, they second, third and fourth-guess themselves to ensure they have done it right.  They wonder if they will get stuffed three or four years hence if somebody carries out an audit.  They also wonder whether they should leave money aside in case they have not paid enough thereby ensuring that if they are audited, they will not fall into arrears with the Revenue Commissioners.</p> <p>  The good news is that the Minister sees that a person who lives in a nearly valueless house should not have to pay property tax on it.  Would it not be easier for everybody if a black-and-white understanding could be given by the State to people living in these houses that this is the case, and that it is one of the stresses and strains they do not have to deal with this year as a result?</p></speech>

They cannot provide the black-and-white criteria the Deputy seeks.  However, the test for liability for property tax is whether the house is occupied.  If the damage is so severe that people have moved out, there is no liability on the property.  Once it is occupied, there is a liability for property tax and the question that arises is how much should be paid.  That depends on the valuation and the valuation is a self-assessment exercise.  However, the Revenue Commissioners have oversight of that and they might get back to somebody who has included a much lower valuation compared with the value of other houses on the road.  There are auctioneers and valuers all over the country and they do not charge much.  The auctioneer in a local village will write a statement of what they think the house is worth on the market and can outline that the reason they believe its value is lower than all the other houses on the street is because of severe damage due to X or Y.  That is the process.  It should work and I believe it will.</p></speech>

Account is also taken of some welfare changes.  This year the tables give examples of families with children and the increase in child benefit is taken into account.  However, my argument, especially in view of the expenditure cuts in recent years, is that there is no holistic measure of the impact of the budget on different family types and people in different circumstances, be that as regards gender, income, age, marital or disability status.  The ESRI publishes a report on the distributional impact in terms of tax, welfare and public service pay policy, and the Minister has taken issue with some aspects of that.  To put that issue to bed, I strongly recommend that the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform jointly publish a comprehensive analysis of the impact of the budget.  The tables that are published on budget day are a help.</p><p>They go some way towards it, but they do not take account of the full distributional impact.  If the Minister is not going to accept in full the ESRI analysis, which he has not done in recent years, then the Government should take responsibility for publishing its own.</p></speech>

Someone on &euro;28,000 received little.  We had the USC debate yesterday about the difference between those at the top and at the bottom.  Social Justice Ireland said that somebody on social welfare was not getting the same level of help or support as someone earning &euro;50,000.</p> <p>  By any measure, equality budgeting is an internationally accepted method of dealing with inequality and poverty.  I do not believe anyone on the Government benches who would claim there is not inequality or poverty in this country.  Approximately 60 countries either use equality budgeting or are in the process of doing so.  Such countries include England, South Africa, Canada and African countries such as Tanzania and Uganda.  This is not some kind of new dawn that we are asking the Minister to introduce.  We are not asking him to develop anything other than something that is tried and tested.  One benefit is that the Minister would not have to listen to me or other Members belly-aching after a budget because he could point to the fact that the equality budgeting objectives had been met.  I would be interested to hear why exactly the Government opposes the amendment.</p></speech>

A substantial amount of analysis covering some of the groups the Deputies have listed has already been published.  The Department of Social Protection has, on 4 November last, published a social impact assessment of the welfare and income tax measures in budget 2016.  The social impact assessment was completed in consultation with the Department of Finance in respect of the income tax elements of the budget and is consistent with my Department&rsquo;s analysis of the impact of the budget package.</p> <p>  Using the ESRI&rsquo;s tax-welfare simulation model, SWITCH, the social impact assessment includes a breakdown between the impact of tax and welfare measures respectively, as well as presenting the overall distributional impact of budget 2016 by income group and family type.  It also examines the impact of the budget on the at-risk-of-poverty rate and on work incentives, as well as the impact of the change in the minimum wage.</p> <p>  Expansion of the SWITCH model has also enabled the incorporation this year of investment in the early childhood care and education scheme into the social impact assessment.  The distributional impact by family type in the SWITCH model facilitates comparisons between the distributional impact of the budget on families with and without children, by employment or retirement status, and for lone parents.  All of those are presented in the social impact assessment.</p> <p>  At this time, it is not possible to use the SWITCH model to assess the impact of the budget on groups of people based on their disability status.  As I have pointed out previously, there are already significant efforts under way to expand the capacity of the model.  This is evidenced by the work which has allowed modelling of medical cards and the early childhood care and education scheme.</p> <p>  For further information, the budget book includes a range of material addressing distributional issues and explaining the impact of budget 2016.  A series of tables show the impact of budgetary measures at a range of income levels for different income earners.  A variety of illustrative cases provide examples of the change in net income for sample household types.  The extent to which income is redistributed through the tax and welfare system and the progressivity of the income tax system are also addressed in the budget documentation.  On the basis that the analysis proposed in the amendment is already published, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

The purpose of this amendment is to allow Revenue to report unprofessional conduct by solicitors, in acting on behalf of taxpayers, to the Law Society so that the Law Society can carry out an investigation into the alleged misconduct.</p><p>Section 851A provides reassurance to taxpayers that personal and commercial information received by Revenue for tax purposes is protected against unauthorised disclosure.  The authority to disclose taxpayer information requires a specific statutory basis and the use to which the disclosed information can be put by the recipient of the information is prescribed by statute. </p><p>One of the circumstances in which it is permitted to disclose confidential taxpayer information is where a Revenue officer is satisfied that the work of a tax adviser acting on behalf of a taxpayer does not meet the professional standards of the professional body of which the person is a member.  Thus, for example, a Revenue officer may disclose taxpayer information to the Irish Taxation Institute so that the institute can investigate whether the alleged misbehaviour of one of its members has breached its professional standards. </p><p>Section 851A defines &ldquo;professional body&rdquo; as those accountancy bodies that come within the remit of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority and the Irish Taxation Institute.  This amendment includes the Law Society in the definition.</p><p>The current situation whereby Revenue can report unprofessional conduct by certain tax professionals but not solicitors is a source of grievance for those tax professionals who are not solicitors because of the perceived competitive advantage it gives to solicitors in the provision of taxation advice and related work.  In so far as possible, I would like to see a level playing field between all tax advisors and I consider that this amendment will contribute to this.

Everybody else must pay DIRT at 41%, whether they have no income liable to income tax, pay tax at the standard rate of 20% or pay tax at the marginal rate of 40%.  There is an issue of equity here, especially for the many people who are dependent on interest income.  At a time when interest rates are so low, such income is lower now than it may have been in the past.  At the same time, DIRT has increased substantially, from 27% to 41%.  Moreover, for some people with unearned income, there is an additional 4% PRSI charge on the interest income.  I am asking the Minister to review this issue with a view to ensuring greater equity.</p></speech>

The standard DIRT rate has increased significantly since 2008, from 20% to 41%, and is now one percentage point above the higher rate of tax.  Up to budget 2009, the rate of DIRT was equal to the standard rate of income tax at 20%.  The increases in recent years were introduced to generate additional yield and encourage spending in the economy to stimulate growth and employment.</p> <p>  I am informed by Revenue that the estimated cost of charging DIRT at rate equivalent to individuals' marginal income tax rate, that is, either 40%, 20% or 0%, depending on the highest rate of tax applicable to their income, would be of the order of &euro;77 million for 2016, based on a forecasted DIRT yield of &euro;298 million.  This is a necessarily tentative estimate as it cannot, for instance, account for any individuals moving bands.  That said, it represents a substantial loss to the Exchequer, particularly given that under the terms of the Stability and Growth Pact, Ireland may not introduce discretionary revenue reductions unless they are matched by other revenue increases or expenditure reductions.  This means the Government must consider carefully any tax changes, as any reductions will have to be offset elsewhere.  I am further advised there would also be significant administrative issues and costs associated with such measures, both for Revenue and for financial institutions.  In the circumstances, I am not disposed to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

I accept that what I am proposing would be administratively difficult to implement.  An estimated cost of &euro;77 million in 2016 is a very significant sum.  Over time, however, as commissions on taxation examine the overall structure, the taxation of interest income should be aligned to the overall taxation of a person's income from other sources.  It would be the fairest way to do it.  It is not something that can be done overnight because it has a significant associated cost, as the Minister outlined.  Nevertheless, in the longer term, it is an objective that is worth working towards.  It is not fair that persons on very low incomes who have an asset that is earning interest must pay tax at 41% on that interest.  I accept the changes required will take time, on which basis I do not propose to press the amendment.</p></speech>

There are two points at which PRSAs are severely disadvantaged when compared to normal occupational pension schemes.  The employee is liable for a universal social charge, USC, on employer contributions to a PRSA.  In the case of PRSAs, both employer and employee contributions are subject to Revenue limits allowable for tax relief, while in the case of occupational pension schemes, only the employee contributions are subject to Revenue limits.</p><p>The Finance Bill provides for an exemption for employees from USC on employer contributions to a PRSA, which is welcome.  It brings the USC treatment of such contributions in line with employer contributions to occupational pension schemes.  However, there is no proposal to address the second anomaly, whereby both the employer and the employee contributions to the PRSI are reckonable or taken into account in terms of the overall amount which can be contributed within the allowable limits.  That is an issue which needs to be examined.</p><p>The current situation means that more contributions can be made to defined contribution plans than to the PRSAs.  This has a major impact for a small number of PRSA holders and is deeply unfair.  It particularly impacts those whose pensions are underfunded and who are striving to close the gap.  PRSAs are principally designed for those with no occupational pension scheme.  National and government policy for some time has been to encourage people to provide for their future well-being and their retirement.  To discriminate against PRSAs <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>occupational pensions by counting employer contributions towards the allowable limits for tax relief strikes me as unfair.  I am not sure what the original justification of it was.</p></speech>

During that debate, he highlighted the differential treatment afforded to employer contributions to trust-based occupational pension schemes as compared to PRSAs, in so far as the operation of the annual limits on employee tax-relieved pension contributions are concerned.</p><p>Basically, the amount of tax-relieved contributions which an individual or an employee can make towards pension savings in any one year is subject to a limit based on an age-related percentage of his or her annual earnings and to an overall earnings cap of &euro;115,000 per annum.  In the case of PRSAs, any employer contributions are aggregated with the employee&rsquo;s contributions for the purpose of determining if these limits are adhered to.  In addition, employer PRSA contributions, unlike employer contributions to trust-based occupational pension schemes, are treated as a benefit-in-kind of the employee.  As against that, however, they are also deemed for tax relief purposes to be a contribution made by the employee.  This means, in effect, that, where the aggregate amount of employer and employee contributions to the employee&rsquo;s PRSA does not exceed the employee&rsquo;s annual age-related limit, no effective benefit-in-kind charge arises.  This is because any potential benefit-in-kind charge arising for the employee, as a result of the employer contribution, is exactly offset by the employee&rsquo;s tax relief on those contributions.  It is only where the combined contributions exceed the age-related limits that an effective benefit-in-kind tax charge arises.</p><p>I am assuming that the intent of the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment is to, first, remove employer contributions to PRSAs from the compass of the employee annual age-related limits; second, although not specifically provided for in the amendment, to remove the benefit-in-kind charge on the employee in respect of the employer contributions.  This, I think, the Deputy would view as levelling the playing pitch <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>trust-based occupational pensions schemes.</p><p>In that regard, however, I have explained several times over the years in response to parliamentary questions on this issue, that there are good reasons for this differential treatment, which are of long standing.  In the case of trust-based occupational pension schemes, employer contributions are effectively controlled, first, by the statutory limit on the maximum benefits that can be provided for an employee under a scheme, that is, a pension not exceeding two thirds of final salary; second, by the standard fund threshold regime which places an overarching limit on all pension benefits of &euro;2 million.</p><p>In the case of PRSAs which were introduced in 2002, these are contract-based products which are beneficially owned by the PRSA holders.  As with other contract-based pension products, for example retirement annuity contracts, no benefit limit as such applies to the contract.  Control of benefits in such instances is exercised through restrictions on the annual amount of tax-relieved contributions that can be made by, or in respect of, the PRSA holder.  In the absence of contribution-based controls, it would simply not be possible, under the current legislative structure, to restrict the amount of benefits arising under such contracts, other than by way of the standard fund threshold limit of &euro;2 million mentioned earlier.</p><p>I do not propose, therefore, to accept the Deputy&rsquo;s proposal to amend the legislation in a fashion which would remove the impacts of the current restrictions on employer-related contributions to PRSAs.  Apart from increasing the annual cost of tax relief on pension contributions to the Exchequer generally, it would also mean that employers would be in a position, of which I have no doubt they would avail, to pick and choose favoured employees in respect of whom they would make significant additional contributions above current levels and above the levels made by them to employee PRSAs generally.</p><p>All of that said, I accept the differing approaches to the treatment of contributions to PRSAs and to occupational pension schemes, while having a sound basis, is just one manifestation of the overall complexity of the rules surrounding private pension provision.  These are being looked at in the context of the broader reform of the pensions area being considered by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection.  This change agenda includes work to reform and simplify the pensions landscape, to ensure schemes operate effectively and there is a regulatory structure which gives pension savers confidence in the system.  This encompasses consideration of potential impediments to the uptake of PRSAs.  It is in that context that the issue of concern to the Deputy can best be considered.</p></speech>

The Revenue Commissioners undertook the national contractors project which yielded significant revenues for the State.  It was a significant initiative by Revenue to examine the issue of the tax treatment of travel and subsistence payments for self-employed contractors.</p><p>I welcome that the Minister held a public consultation on this area a number of months ago and I know a number of submissions were made to that public consultation exercise.  We are talking about contractors working across the information and communications technology and health care sectors in particular, and the tax treatment of costs associated with contractors working away from their normal place of work.</p><p> The point made to me is that the current system and interpretation from the Revenue Commissioners has caused some uncertainty.  I assume the Minister may accept that to a point as he has initiated the public consultation.  The point has also been made that our capacity to deliver on major capital projects, with very large companies seeking to bring in the required expertise on a contracting basis, is meeting difficulties.  The issue must be examined.</p><p> It is some time since I studied the tax law surrounding deductible expenses for employees but the general rule of thumb about an expense being wholly, necessarily and exclusively incurred in the performance of the duties is, I presume, still the test used by the Revenue Commissioners.  Many of these contractors, by the nature of their job, move between locations.  I would have thought the expenses incurred in doing that job are inextricably linked to the performance of their duties in the course of that job and would be deductible, but there seems to be a different interpretation put on it.  There is also the acceptance of whether a person's home can be the normal place of work, which it is for some contractors.  For example, that would be the case for some people providing information technology support.  Many of these people have received very hefty tax bills, perhaps legitimately, and I am not holding a candle for anybody trying to avoid their taxation responsibilities.</p><p> I suggest there is a need for certainty in the taxation treatment of self-employed contractors and we must be cognisant of the ability of major employers in this country to deliver on capital investment projects and have access to the required expertise in this country.  The nature of the working environment has changed and more people are now self-employed.  They have incorporated and are offering their services as an independent contractor.  We are dealing with old taxation legislation and although I welcome that the consultation has been done, will the Minister's Department and the Revenue Commissioners, if they have not done so already, consider very carefully the submissions and bring certainty to the issue in order that it can be clearly explained to all the stakeholders, the Tax Institute, employer bodies, large companies and the contractors?  We should have clear rules on how travel and subsistence payments in particular should be taxed and this should be consistent.</p></speech>

Many people who pay in instalments are affected by penalties as a result and typically a person paying by instalments in the first place is likely to have viewed the total cost as unaffordable at a particular time.  It is not logical from a justice and human basis that such people incur an extra cost because of that position.  We live in a high-tech age with much connectivity and it is very easy to share information.  There is a logic to ensuring there is no penalty for payment by instalments.</p></speech>

However, my response on the general point raised by the Deputy regarding the payment of tax by instalments is that the abolition of these arrangements would impose an unacceptable cost on the Exchequer.</p> <p>  A core provision in the Revenue Commissioners' powers to collect the taxes and duties within their care and management is the provision for specific monetary sanctions on taxpayers in the event that payments are made late or not made at all. These monetary sanctions can comprise interest, surcharges and penalties of various kinds and exist principally to ensure the Revenue Commissioners are not placed in the invidious position of becoming an involuntary interest-free creditor to individuals or businesses as regards the late payment of tax.  Equally, where repayments of tax to taxpayers by the Revenue Commissioners are unreasonably delayed, provision is also made to include interest to compensate the taxpayer for the temporary lack of those funds.</p> <p>  From the overall perspective of servicing the national debt as well as funding the provision of public services generally, the Exchequer cannot be placed at the mercy of taxpayers as to when they may or may not choose to pay their taxes.  While the payment of certain taxes, such as local property tax, may provide for instalment payments without interest, this is not generally true in circumstances in which a statutory payment deadline has been missed.</p> <p>  The argument that tax payment deadlines are unfair is unsustainable for the very good reason that, in general, the events which have given rise to the liabilities will have already occurred by the time the tax has to be paid.  I am thinking of VAT or the remittance of PAYE deducted by employers.  There could be no justification for fiduciary taxes such as these to be paid by instalment.  In summary, there is no unfairness in the current system and the existence of these sanctions is fully justified.  For this reason I am not prepared to accept the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment.</p></speech>

A real estate investment trust, REIT, can be set up in this State and can invest in retail properties and collect income from rental properties - and possibly the sale of the rental properties - without paying corporation tax.  If the beneficiary is resident in this State, that beneficiary will then pay tax on the dividends.</p><p>If the beneficiary were living in the United States, for example, that beneficiary, because of international taxation treaties, could manage not to pay tax on the dividends, or at least could have a significantly reduced tax on the dividends.  First, this is obviously a cost with regard to potential taxation that could be received into the State.  Second, it has the effect of distorting the property market in real terms, because the REITs can become an efficient way to dodge tax responsibility.  A selling point for a REIT built in that fashion would be that it was very tax-effective.  It could create distortion in the market.  In the long term we would see more internationally owned REITs than Irish people owing properties and dealing with them in that fashion.</p></speech>

The REIT framework is designed to produce an after-tax result for shareholders similar to that from direct investment in property, while also providing the benefits of risk diversification and attracting of new sources of capital and professional management associated with collective investment.</p> <p>  A REIT must distribute at least 85% of its property income profits annually to the REIT shareholders.  Instead of being taxed directly on the rental income, investors are subject to taxation on dividends paid from REIT profits arising from that rental income.  Distributions to Irish-resident individuals are subject to dividend withholding tax, DWT, and are also subject to income tax, PRSI and USC at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate.  Such investors will also be liable to capital gains tax of 33% on disposal of their shares in the REIT.  Irish corporate investors are liable to corporation tax on the dividends received at the same rate that would apply had the income been earned directly - that is, the non-trading rate of 25% applies.  They will also be liable to corporation tax of 33% on their chargeable gains on disposal of REIT shares.</p> <p>  Distributions to non-resident investors by Irish companies are generally exempt from DWT if the appropriate declaration of non-residence has been completed.  However, this exemption does not apply to distributions from a REIT.  In the absence of any other provisions, foreign REIT shareholders would not have any liability to Irish tax on REIT dividends, despite the fact that the REIT itself benefits from a tax exemption on qualifying profits of the rental business. </p> <p>  In order to ensure that tax from foreign investors is retained, a dividend withholding tax at the standard rate of tax was legislated for, specifically applying to REIT dividends.  All REIT distributions to non-resident investors are subject to DWT at a rate of 20% at source.  The non-resident investor may also, depending on the national tax rules in her or his country of residence, be subject to tax in that jurisdiction.  However, non-resident investors who are resident in countries with which Ireland has a double taxation agreement, DTA, may be entitled to claim a refund of some of the DWT, if the relevant DTA permits.  The taxation of dividends varies from treaty to treaty, but commonly a source state would retain the right to approximately 15% tax on dividends paid from that state.</p> <p>  Non-resident investors will not be liable to capital gains tax in Ireland because the REIT is a publicly listed company.  However, non-resident investors will be liable to such taxes in their home jurisdictions.</p> <p>  A REIT may pay gross dividends to certain Irish-resident "excluded persons," such as pension schemes, charities, investment funds and other exempt bodies, provided the appropriate declaration has been provided.</p> <p>  When considered in conjunction with the many benefits that REITs bring, such as risk diversification and attraction of capital, the potential loss of tax relating to foreign shareholders is mitigated to a level that is acceptable within current budgetary constraints.  Therefore, I cannot accept the proposed amendment.</p> <p>  This arose back around 2011 or 2012 when the property market was in total collapse and effectively there was no property market in Dublin.  People with buy-to-let properties trying to get out could not do so because the price was frequently less than the mortgage they had on the property.  On doing research, we found that REITs were commonplace across the OECD countries, particularly in Canada and the United States, but also in some European jurisdictions.  The big benefit from the investor's point of view is that he or she does not need to raise &euro;300,000 by way of a mortgage and savings to buy a property to let but can invest &euro;5,000, &euro;10,000 or &euro;15,000 in REIT shares.  So it suits small investors who are building up a pension.  They can have things like bank shares and a bit invested in property as well, without having their total life savings in property.  In 2009, 2010 and 2011 people were absolutely burnt, with all their life savings consumed because they had invested in property.</p> <p>  The motivation for introducing this was to encourage people to continue investing in property.  As we know from the debate over the past three or four months, we need good-quality rental property, especially in our cities, and the REITs have fulfilled that need.</p> <p>  It is not being driven by tax exemption.  If a publicly quoted company were constructed, it would need to pay corporation tax before paying a dividend and then the dividend would be subject to income tax, USC and so on in the normal way.  In this case it is analogous to ordinary citizens having a three-bedroom house up for rent.  They have a liability for income tax, USC, PRSI and so on.  If they sell it, they incur a capital gains tax liability.  Absolutely the same applies to a person who invests in a REIT, but because it is not incorporated, the company is not subject to corporation tax, provided it complies with certain conditions.  The principal one is that, rather than retaining profits, they distribute 85% of the profits each year by way of dividend to their investors in proportion to the amount invested.  It has worked very well since it was introduced in Dublin.</p> <p>  There are other advantages.  Because they tend not to buy individual properties and tend to have an apartment block, or two or three apartment blocks in the same complex, REITs can afford to put in professional managers.  So the quality of the accommodation and the management of the accommodation will usually be higher than in the case of the one-off rentals, which were the only option when I was in rental accommodation.  It has many advantages.</p> <p>  I stress that there is no loss of revenue to the Exchequer.  If the investor is abroad, the rules apply as they would to another investment.  Investors in Ireland are subject to income tax, USC, PRSI and whatever else on their investment.  If they were to sell the shares, it would be the equivalent of selling the property; they would be liable for capital gains tax on any capital gains made on the shares.  It is a good scheme and it is working well.</p></speech>

However, we are not dealing with a punctured property market at the moment.  Many people would feel that in much of the country it is too inflated again.  I grant that REITs might provide a more consistent level of quality.</p><p>Let us say John and Patricia are investors in a REIT.  Patricia lives in Ireland and pays tax on her dividend.  John lives in the US and, under an international taxation treaty, can reclaim the tax he pays.  There is an advantage to being non-domiciled under these programmes.  Has there been any review of the effective rate of tax paid on the dividends of REITs in Ireland as opposed to abroad?  We cannot manage if we cannot measure.  Is the Department confident that there is no disparity, or has any research been done to deliver confidence that there is no disparity?  If there is a difference and the net tax of a foreign investor is lower, and there is a potential distortion that could lead to a loss of tax, would the Minister agree to legislative changes to ensure it no longer exists?</p></speech>

The income is treated is the same, except that it comes by way of dividend rather than rent.  Capital gains tax is the same.  It is far more flexible.  One does not need to sell the house in order to get one&rsquo;s money out; one need only sell the shares.  A person who has an investment of &euro;20,000 and who needs the money can sell the shares.  It is a much more flexible way of having a property play which is unlikely to lead to the madness we had during the Celtic tiger days.  The same rules apply to an investor who lives abroad.  The taxation of persons abroad who have investments in other jurisdictions is governed by tax treaties with the sovereign states concerned.  A withholding tax applies, and a portion of the withholding tax is recoverable.  As I said in the note, one would expect that 15% to 20% of the withholding tax would be retained in the jurisdiction of the investment.</p> <p>  The purpose of tax is to pay for the goods and services, and cover the liabilities, of the State.  People living in New York are not enjoying the goods and services of this State.  They are not driving on the State's roads or having their roads lit up by public lighting from this State, their children are not going to school here and they are not availing of the hospitals.  While they should have a liability as investors, they should have a different liability from the generality of taxpayers.  In the Deputy's example, Patricia is taxed under Irish law, and while there are various measures regarding residence and domicile, if John&rsquo;s tax jurisdiction is the US, he is taxed in accordance with that law.  If there is a crossover, it is governed by the tax treaties.</p></speech>

The legislation allowing REITs to set up investment funds was introduced in the 2013 Finance Bill.  Many of the REITs did not actively invest for a year after they had accumulated the fund.  It is very new.  I agree with the Deputy&rsquo;s point.  In due course, an assessment must be done of how it is working, given that it was a novel scheme for Ireland, although it works very well in other jurisdictions.  I am glad we have REITs.  In the Dublin market, they are providing good rental accommodation in the absence of domestic investors.</p></speech>

I have speaking notes on the amendments, which I wish to put on the record.  I wish to clarify the position on local property tax in respect of houses affected by pyrite damage.  I dealt with it in the response to a parliamentary question this morning.</p> <p>  On foot of the report of the review of the local property tax, which I commissioned, and which was recently submitted to me by Dr. Don Thornhill, I have decided to ease the qualifying criteria for relief from local property tax for homeowners whose properties have been severely affected by pyrite.  The current pyrite exemption will continue in place and will remain confined to properties with a damage rating of grade 2 or grade 1 with progression.  However, where a property has been accepted for remediation by the Pyrite Resolution Board, PRB, without testing, or a property has been remediated by a guarantee company or a builder or developer, or where a party is compensated in lieu of remediation without testing, the Revenue will accept confirmation of remediation or compensation from either the PRB or the relevant party for the purpose of exemption without testing.  In such cases, it will obviate the need for expensive testing.</p> <p>  Deputies are aware that the necessity of this change was due to the fact that people were deemed to be exempt if they proved their houses had suffered grade 2 damage or grade 1 with progression, but had to pay &euro;1,500 to &euro;2,000 to get engineering certificates to prove it, and the cost of proving it was greater than the value of the exemption.  This deals with the issue, which has existed for some time.

Some financial institutions and hedge funds bought shares in Bank of Ireland when they were at a low price of 14 cent and sold them close to the peak price of 37 cent.  It has recently been reported that one of these institutions recently short sold when the share price seemed to be increasing at approximately 35 cent.  Now, the shares are valued at approximately 31 cent, a fall of over 10%.</p><p>Will this not have a destabilising effect on our banking system?  Our banks are still not out of the woods.  Has the low share price an effect on lending rates?  Small businesses are being crucified with high interest rates.  Our banks are mainly State owned, with a percentage of Bank of Ireland State owned.  Could this type of activity scupper plans to sell off the banks?  This is a worrying trend for our banking system.  Should the Central Bank look at and monitor this more closely?  Are the reports from the Central Bank -----</p></speech>

The State has 14% of its shares and private investors have the rest.  The shares trade every day on the Dublin Stock Exchange and, more significantly, on the London Stock Exchange.  Like any publicly quoted share, the shares rise and fall.  I saw a reference to the transaction the Deputy referred to in the newspapers and the matter was also a subject of a parliamentary question.  I do not have the text of the reply and will not try to summarise it as it was quite technical.  I believe the information I got from the Central Bank adequately covered the situation.  I refer the Deputy to the relevant parliamentary reply and if she wishes to submit a supplementary question to adduce more information, I will do my best to provide her with the information she requires.</p></speech>

I apologise for the early start.  Unfortunately, the committee room is booked again at 11 a.m. by another committee as the Finance Bill is before the Houses.  We must therefore try to get this meeting concluded as quickly as we can.</p> <p>  Before we start, I am sure all members will wish to reflect briefly on the tragic events in Paris last Friday night.  I express my own sympathy and condolences to the families of those killed and injured and to the people of France and those countries whose citizens have been affected by the terrible attacks.  It is very sad that such a barbaric event was thrust upon innocent people going about their daily lives.  It is up to the people of Europe and the world to stand together and ensure a solution is found to stop future tragedies.  I propose that the joint committee writes to the French ambassador, H.E. Jean-Pierre Th&eacute;bault, to express the joint committee's sympathies and condolences.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Does anybody wish to comment?</p></speech>

These attacks demonstrate the need for solidarity within the West and especially within the European Union.  They are our brothers and sisters in the European Union and it is a family issue - an international family issue - for the European Union.  As we express our condolences, we should also say that we are with them and that the terrorism visited on the French is visited on all of us who believe in freedom.</p></speech>

Our thoughts are with those who have been badly injured.  We wish them a speedy recovery.  I agree that it is incumbent on us all to stand together in solidarity as it is incumbent on world leaders to come together to address the root causes of this mindless terrorism and to address the issues in Syria from which country a great deal of this is emanating.  It is a wake-up call for us all.  We all now realise how vulnerable we are every time we get into a plane or go to a large event, whether it is a football match or concert.  Now is the time for cool heads and a coming together of world leaders and the European Union to address this issue and bring about a satisfactory outcome for everybody.</p></speech>

Of course, our concern must now be how we can prevent future attacks.  We have had many reports of citizens from the UK and Ireland going to Syria to join the fight with Islamic State.  Their <i>modus operandi</i>is to send those people back to their home countries to perpetrate attacks similar to those in Paris in other European countries, including Ireland.  We need to ensure that that does not happen.  I propose that at some stage we should have the relevant leaders of various State agencies, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces in here to outline what they are doing to prevent this.</p><p>It has been pointed out for many years that there are elements within the communities in Ireland who will assist Islamic State in perpetrating these attacks in other countries, but who could do it here too.  There is no point in having more motions of sympathy about deaths in Ireland.  We must prevent those deaths and attacks in Ireland because it is highly foreseeable that people will return from Syria having fought there and their mission will be to carry out an attack here in Ireland.  That is not beyond the bounds of possibility.  That is what our intelligence services would tell us is going to happen, so our task now is to prevent it from happening.</p></speech>

It has brought home the reality of life for people in places like Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon and Syria.  They face that almost every day of their lives because there are suicide bombs and other bombings going on.  The West now realises in a very real way what other people have been suffering and how vulnerable their lives are.</p> <p>  Prevention is a wider issue.  We know that this all stemmed from a totally illegal invasion of Iraq.  That has been acknowledged.  The biggest protest was in Dublin, where 100,000 people marched against that invasion in 2003.  That is where it stemmed from, so the powers that be must look at their actions, as well as the possible unintended consequences of those actions.</p> <p>  It was horrifying to read the release from ISIS, including the reasons and the way in which it described ordinary people doing ordinary things in Paris.  I find it very difficult to understand how well educated girls from the West could go off to be jihadi brides, knowing that ISIS is totally against equality for women.  It is against education for women or any sort of equal rights for women.</p> <p>  One does not fight fire with fire.  While I can understand the rationale of the French wanting to do that, it is only going to create a worse situation.  In that bombing there is absolutely no doubt that more civilian lives are being lost in Raqqa and other areas.</p> <p>  Our sympathies are with those who have been bereaved in Paris, Lebanon and elsewhere.</p></speech>

The very important 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, COP21, is to take place in Paris soon.  I warmly welcome Mr. Jim Clarken, Oxfam Ireland, Mr. Ois&iacute;n Coghlan, Friends of the Earth, Ms Anja Murray, Stop Climate Chaos, and Mr. Jerry Mac Evilly, Tr&oacute;caire.  We need only look at this morning's weather and the amount of rain falling to know exactly how our climate has changed.  It is a timely meeting, in advance of COP21 and the 11th session of the COP serving as the meeting of the parties of the Kyoto Protocol, CMP11, which will take place from 30 November to 11 December in Paris.  We will hear a presentation from each member of the delegation and will then have a question and answer session.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Gallery to switch their mobile phones off for the duration of the meeting because they cause interference with the recording equipment, even in silent mode.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p></speech>

We are very fortunate that we have such a body that has robustly engaged on a wide range of developmental issues over recent years.  Climate change is paramount to success in this area.  We will talk initially about climate impacts and what climate justice means.  We will give some background on the negotiations and how we have reached this important point before the Paris meeting, which will happen in a couple of weeks.  We will focus specifically on climate finance and what the EU and Ireland should do.</p> <p>  Although some members might be more than acutely aware of it, I will reinforce the point for those in any doubt that climate change is real and is happening today, not in the distant future.  It has been happening for a number of years and is having a very devastating impact.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, was an unprecedented scientific collaboration and it is now a consensus view of the world's scientific community, approved by the world's governments.  It is a landmark way of working on climate issues.  The evidence of where the climate has moved to and where it is headed is indisputable.  It is important to note this, given that occasionally there are suggestions that the conclusions could be discredited or doubted.  It is very clear where climate is heading.  It is also clear, based on the scientific evidence, that if the increase reaches 2&deg; Celsius, it will be a tipping point from which it will be very difficult to return, and we will have a potential spiral of other events which we will be unable to control.</p> <p>  The committee and Ireland have shown great leadership in development support and assistance over many years.  Mr. Coghlan and I were in New York at the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, SDG, summit, where we were very proud to see the leadership Ireland had shown, particularly the team led by Ireland's ambassador to the UN, David Donoghue, in the negotiations to get the extraordinary agreement over the line and in such a business-like fashion that embraced a huge consultation process.  More than 1 million people across the globe participated and had their voices included.  We have 17 challenging but achievable goals to which the world's governments, including ours, have signed up.  It is a tremendous credit and the fact Ireland was in a position to co-chair it and lead it to this important conclusion reflects the long-standing credit and reputation Ireland has had in this space for many years.</p> <p>  I have started with this because this tremendous leadership, despite dark times in our country, is contradicted by our approach to the environment and climate.  The important message I want to communicate is that one cannot be committed to one but not the other.  If one believes in the importance of our international potential to make change happen and reverse extreme poverty, which we as a people and this body do, we must also firmly believe in what we can do in terms of the environment and climate change.</p> <p>  During the past 15 years leading up to the SDGs, we worked through the millennium development goals and halved global poverty and dramatically reduced hunger.  However, climate change very much threatens the future and the development successes we have had.  We are on the cusp, during the next 15 years, of ending extreme poverty and hunger forever.  It has been shown that it is possible and can be done.  However it will not happen unless we robustly challenge and tackle the climate change reality.  Some of the figures are staggering.  By 2050, up to 50 million more, rather than fewer, people will be put into hunger.</p><p>Rain-fed crop production could fall by up to 50% in some African countries by 2020, that is, in the relative short term.  The WHO estimates that climate change has already been responsible for 150,000 deaths and that will increase to a quarter of a million per year from 2030 to 2050.  A 2&deg; increase in temperature could lead to a 30% reduction in water in rivers in southern Africa and South America.  Sometimes it is hard to move beyond these statistics.  I travelled with Tony Connelly from RTE a couple of years ago to make a documentary on the impacts in Malawi.  In the programme, we talked to real farmers whom we met.  Prior to that, we travelled with Mary Robinson to parts of Kenya and spoke to ordinary farmers about their lifetime experience and what they had seen.  The change in rainfall means that huge areas of land are no longer arable at all.  Unpredictable rain has an impact on societies that have always known exactly when to plant, when they should harvest and what kind of crops they would have.  The yields would go up and down every year but they would be fairly predictable within a range and that has completely changed.  It is having a drastic impact on families, on the lives of people and on the hunger trajectory.<br/><br/>To discuss it in the geopolitical space, it is estimated that a million farmers in Syria have left the land in the past ten or 20 years.  Who knows how that may or may not have contributed to what is happening in that country.  That level of uncertainty has not been helpful. let us put it like that.  Into the future, more and more conflicts and issues will arise because of the impact of climate change.  Large cities in coastal areas are likely to disappear and hundreds of millions of people will have to flee.  The impact on migration and those types of crises will be dramatic.  It seems we have not taken this as seriously as we take other issues, and we have to change that mindset and trajectory.<br/><br/>To give a sense of the justice element, my presentation shows that the northern, so-called developed countries are responsible for creating climate change, yet the developing countries are the most impacted by it.  The entire continent of Africa produces about 2% of the world's carbon, yet people there are suffering as a result of what we have done in the past 150 years in terms of the Industrial Revolution and so on.<br/><br/>With regard to vulnerabilities, I have produced a chart showing the issues that those of us who work in the development and humanitarian space deal with all the time - natural disasters, poor governance, water insecurity, livelihoods, hunger and conflict.  That is in the normal run of things.  When one adds the impact of climate change to that, one sees those kinds of vulnerabilities are increased dramatically, namely, increased droughts, flooding, erratic rainfall, temperature rises, increases in vector borne diseases, land loss and displacement.  Many of these things can lead to greater conflict and can make the governance situation even worse.  It can dramatically increase the number of natural disasters.  The past ten years have been some of the hottest on record.  There has been a huge impact on crops in places like Australia, Russia, the US and developing countries.  The impact of that in this part of the world is that prices increase and change.  In other parts of the world it means that people starve.  There is widespread hunger which leads to widespread conflict which leads to many other issues with which we will also have to grapple.  This leads to humanitarian crises where there is extreme food insecurity and conflict can result from these issues.<br/><br/>I will give an example of one family that has a farm that has been completely decimated by drought.  This is something we are seeing increasingly.  We have first-hand examples of how that is happening dramatically in many places.  From a development perspective, we have made great strides and we cannot allow them to be reversed.  This will require a concerted effort.  We will present to the committee what we believe Ireland's position should be leading into these talks.  If we are to be honest, we are not there yet.  We are concerned that there has been a slightly schizophrenic way of thinking by Government so far on the approach to development, hunger and those issues we care about when it comes to the climate part of the story.<br/><br/>As this progresses, none of us will be immune.  I will show another picture that was taken in Ireland.  It was not taken in Bangladesh.  Up to &euro;2 billion a year is lost by small farmers in Ireland.  There have been lengthier rainfall events in winter, more intense downpours in summer, increased droughts in summer and health risks to farm animals, which will have a tremendous impact on our important agricultural sector.  We will talk more about that later, but agriculture is a concern in terms of the impact and the cause.<br/><br/>We are a coalition of development and environmental organisations working closely together because we care about the same issues.  The message from the development side of this coalition is that a sense of justice is required.  If we believe in a just world - and we do - we have to be responsible and deliver on that responsibility, particularly to those who have had nothing to do with creating this huge problem we face.<br/><br/>I have another small chart showing the <i>per capita</i>CO<sub>2</sub>emissions.  <i>Per capita</i>, Ireland's emissions are a hundred times those of Uganda and multiple times those of everyone else.  We have one of the largest in the world, so we have much more to do in this regard.  The message from the development space is very much that this is a justice, fairness and responsibility issue.  We have managed to support others to lead themselves out of poverty.  It is also about ensuring we do not erode the good work we have done.  We have worked too hard for that.  People here have been committed and farmers, rural communities and people in developing countries have struggled to deliver what we have got so far.  We cannot allow ourselves to go backward.  We have to move forward.  If we are going to deliver on the sustainable development goals, we have to deliver on our climate commitments.<br/><br/>I will now hand over to Mr. Mac Evilly who will take the committee through the next phase.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.502" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jerry Mac Evilly" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015111800002#D00200"><p>My name is Jerry Mac Evilly.  I am the climate policy officer working with Tr&oacute;caire and I have been following the climate negotiations.  I thank the Chairman.  Our executive director, Eamonn Meehan, sends his apologies.  He is out of the country at the moment but he thanks the committee for its invitation.  Mr. Clarken has set out the ongoing impacts on climate change and the issue of climate justice.  I will now very quickly go through what is going on in the negotiations, the EU and Ireland's role, and our final recommendations.  I will try to get through this quickly.</p> <p>  I will address some of the jargon first.  Some members of the committee may be aware of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change which was signed in 1992 with a focus on driving down emissions.  It focuses on three main areas: adaptation, in other words, protecting the poorest from the worst impacts of climate change; mitigation by preventing further climate change by reducing emissions across all sectors; and the overarching objective of climate finance, which I will speak about in more detail later.</p> <p>  I will give some background on what has been happening in recent years in the run-up to Paris.  Some members might be familiar with the Kyoto Protocol which was the first international agreement on mandatory emissions reductions.</p><p>This commitment has been renewed and runs until 2020.  Negotiations have been taking place in recent years with the aim of putting in place a new post-2020 agreement.  This has been a very difficult process and negotiations have not succeeded thus far.  One reason has been that parties have attempted to negotiate on what is known as a top-down agreement, in other words, specific overall emissions reduction objectives which all parties would have to meet in the relative near term.  What is different about Paris is that it is based on a bottom-up rather than top-down approach.  Parties have put forward voluntary and non-binding national pledges.  In the context of the European Union, this has been done as part of a bloc.  These pledges would then sit as part of the agreement but not within the core legal agreement.  The upshot of this is that there is a high degree of positivity that agreement will be reached in Paris in a month's time. </p><p> While there is likely to be a high degree of political recognition of the need for action, the bottom-up approach on the basis of national pledges has been shown to be insufficient.  The national pledges that have been put forward will not be adequate to prevent the worst impacts of climate change.  The United Nations did an analysis which has shown that 3&deg; Celsius of global warming is likely on the basis of the voluntary national pledges.  In Paris, many civil society organisations and non-governmental organisations will focus on the need for a process to improve, ratchet up or increase commitments and to ensure that this procedure is a core part of the agreement.  In other words, we would not simply have a process of reviewing the pledges, known as intended nationally determined contributions, INDCs, every few years.  Instead, the INDCs would be analysed early and there would be rolling cycles of commitments.</p><p> Our other focus is on the need for a long-term objective based on the latest available scientific evidence.  This means that to prevent the 3&deg; temperature increase, fossil fuels must be phased out and a process introduced for achieving 100% renewable energies.  This means achieving zero carbon emissions by 2050.</p><p> Many non-governmental organisations are focusing on the need for human rights protections to be integrated as a core part of the agreement.  The principal reason for this is that climate impacts and the actions taken to mitigate them have significant potential to undermine human rights.  For example, the use of biomass or biofuels to reduce emissions can have the effect of increasing competition for land.  The upshot of this is that the poorest and most vulnerable people can be displaced from their land as a result of land grabs.  For this reason, human rights protections need to be a core element of the agreement.  </p><p> In addition, climate finance is a major part of the agreement and relates both to pre-2020 and post-2020 processes.  Climate finance is financial support to ensure that the most vulnerable communities can adapt to current and future impacts and develop in a sustainable fashion, in other words, development will not be based on fossil fuels, as has been the case here.  Tr&oacute;caire and other organisations are very much involved in ensuring that there is proper adaptation to climate change.  Improving systems in sustainable agriculture is one example of the type of adaptation currently taking place using climate finance.  </p><p> Having provided a brief overview of the agreement, I will now address what actions need to be taken at a European Union and national level.  The next slide features two statements from the recent encyclical by Pope Francis.  Members may ask why a Papal encyclical features in a presentation on climate change.  The encyclical, which was released in June 2015, is an excellent document that sets out the grounds for climate action.  It makes clear that the need for a climate response is effectively a moral and ethical issue.  The two statements I have included note the injustice of allowing the most vulnerable to pay the high costs of climate impacts and of developed countries taking a business as usual approach that hampers the finalisation of a new international agreement.</p><p> We have spoken a great deal about climate justice and the need for an equitable response.  What is a fair response and how can we support equitable action by developed countries?  Civil society organisations have carried out a detailed technical assessment of how countries need to respond in respect of the INDCs or climate pledges they made as part of the Paris agreement.  This analysis includes the level of emissions that needs to be reduced, the pledges that have been made by countries and an assessment of their capacity, on the basis of income and wealth, to produce a fair share.  The analysis shows that the European Union's response in terms of mitigation and reducing emissions is approximately one fifth of its fair share.  </p><p> How must the European Union respond?  I will not discuss this in great deal other than to note that the EU's pledge or INDC to reduce emissions by at least 40% is too low and must be increased.  EU legislation, particularly on energy efficiency and renewable energies, needs to be improved.  Fossil fuel subsidies must be phased out, as must the use of coal.  We must also address land emissions effectively.</p><p> I will provide a little more context on the European Union's response to climate finance before doing the same for Ireland.  What can the EU do to provide more climate finance?  It can ensure that finance provided is new and additional to existing overseas development aid.  This revenue can be generated by auctions of emissions rights under the emissions credits system.  The revenues from such auctions could be used to generate climate finance.  We are strongly focused on ways in which climate finance can be generated.  Ireland has, however, been silent on this proposal.  At European Union level, we are also strongly focused on the provision of grants for adaptation.  This means avoiding the use of loans, which countries would struggle to repay.  We should also have targets for climate finance post-2020.  </p><p> Having provided the EU context, I will move on to Irish foreign policy.  In May last, the United Nations Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, made a powerful statement on Ireland's inaction or rather its need to take action on climate change.  To be clear on this matter, Ireland is not in a leadership position in its climate response.  The UN Secretary General focused on the need for a whole of government approach to climate change and the risks for Irish foreign policy if inaction continues.  What is the level of inaction?  The commitment made under the 2012 Kyoto Protocol was achieved largely due to the impact of the recession.  However, Ireland has not had a strategy since 2012.</p><p>We have a climate Bill, which I hope will be finalised in the coming weeks.  We are one of only four member states that is not meeting its 2020 EU targets.  The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has clearly stated that we are not on a path to meeting our 2020 and 2030 emission reduction commitments.</p><p> To reduce emissions, we need to finalise and implement a mitigation plan as part of the climate Bill as early as possible.  We must ensure that Government policies that affect developing countries work to promote poverty reduction.  We need coherence between our domestic and development policies.  This commitment was set out in Irish Aid's document, One World, One Future: Ireland's Policy for International Development.  There needs to be action on two key commitments within that document, namely, producing a report on policy coherence and using a relevant interdepartmental committee to review that coherence.</p><p> The final few slides are on what Ireland needs to do regarding climate finance.  As part of the previous Copenhagen Conference of the Parties, COP, there was a commitment that developed countries would generate $100 billion per year in climate finance by 2020.  This may sound like an extremely large or aspirational figure, but it must be put in the context of subsidies to fossil fuel companies, which amount to approximately five times that.  Ireland's fast start financing, which supports adaptation and resilience, totalled approximately $100 million between 2010 and 2012.  This was new and additional to overseas aid but, since 2011, it has counted as part of our overseas aid.  Our contributions to the $100 billion commitment should not result in commensurate reductions in our aid programme.  In other words, this should not be an accounting or labelling exercise.  The $100 billion is to be delivered internationally through the Green Climate Fund, GCF.  The first period for generating funds to that is 2012 to 2018.  Unfortunately, at the last COP in Lima, Ireland was one of only four countries that had not made any pledge to it.  This was a source of some embarrassment and we were given a fossil of the day "award", that is, when environmental organisations during negotiations single out the worst performing countries.  This slide shows the delivery of our "award".  By the end of that COP, the other three countries - Belgium, Austria and Australia - had made pledges.</p><p> In 2015, we did not provide any contribution to the fund.  However, there was a pledge of &euro;2 million as part of the 2016 budget.  The committee may see this as a positive and believe that we have taken a step in the right direction, but the &euro;2 million is insufficient and dwarfed by the pledges and contributions - what is actually delivered - of other EU member states of the same capacity and population.  We have not made a pledge for subsequent years that is in line with similarly developed countries.</p><p> I discussed the EU context, but how will Ireland deliver these funds?  As part of our Stop Climate Chaos coalition, NGOs have done a great deal of research into what is the best approach.  One of our recommendations is for a separate fund to be established to ensure that financing is new and additional.  This was also recommended in 2013 by the Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  To generate these revenues, we recommend using the carbon tax or emission trading revenues.  There is precedence for this, in that a similar fund was set up in Scotland.</p><p> Mr. Clarken gave an overview of climate impacts and the case for climate justice.  Our response needs to be done on the basis of climate justice.  It is clear that the effects of climate change are undermining human rights in developing countries and that Ireland's response is insufficient.</p><p> To summarise our final recommendations, which we hope that the committee can advance, Ireland needs to make a significantly increased pledge, by which I mean ten or 20 times the existing pledge, to the GCF in line with our capacity and what other member states have done.  This can be generated through the establishment of a climate justice fund.  At EU level, Ireland needs to support ways in which climate finance can be generated, namely, the auctioning of emissions rights.  To mitigate and reduce emissions, we must finalise and implement the mitigation plan as soon as possible under the climate Bill and take action on our existing commitments on policy coherence.</p><p> I thank the committee.  I have set out a lot of information for it to consider.</p></speech>

I am conscious of our role in human rights, for example, our membership of the UN Human Rights Council and our overseas development aid, ODA.  We give with one hand, but it is obvious that we are taking with the other hand.  Does it suit us to do that?  Unfortunately, we will have an election in 2016 and do not know what will happen afterwards or what the priorities will be.</p> <p>  Mr. Mac Evilly mentioned subsidies to fossil fuel companies.  I would like to hear more about those.  Policy coherence is vital, yet we are not making the necessary commitments to it.  What are the priorities in that regard?  We received a commitment to climate justice, but is it translating into actions that will make a difference?</p> <p>  I apologise, as I must be somewhere else shortly.  I will listen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.507" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1030" speakername="Eric Byrne" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015111800002#F00400"><p>I left for the Oireachtas an hour and a half earlier this morning than normal.  I have never seen weather like it.  The way from Terenure to town was nearly all flooded by the rainfall.  I apologise for being late, as I am normally on time.  I congratulate the witnesses on their contributions and will ask a question.  Climate change affects Africa severely.  What is the up-to-date position of Ethiopia?  It was our pride and joy.  Visits were made and politicians were impressed by what was developing there.  I understand that it has a population of approximately 90 million and a catastrophic crisis is about to begin.  Have the witnesses information in this regard?</p> <p>  My pet subject is beginning to evolve in my brain.  Do the witnesses address the issue of the contribution that we as human beings make by way of our numbers?  A population of 90 million is a lot for such a food insecure area.  Should we tackle the issue of family planning or argue that we are having too many children?  Should some countries consider their reproduction rates in the family system more carefully?</p><p>We do not want to see more starving, pot-bellied children on the African continent.  I was informed and reassured at this committee on various occasions that there was an early warning system to ensure there would never be a recurrence of these events.  Am I being alarmist or worrying too much about Ethiopia?  How much does overpopulation contribute to the degradation of the landmass?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.509" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1159" speakername="Mark Daly" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015111800002#G00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for attending.  I was delighted to request that they come in before the Paris conference.  I think they should come back in January to give us their analysis of what happens there.  The holy alliance of the Pope and the Pentagon says this is one of the most important issues facing the world and the Pentagon says climate change is on a par with the threat of terrorism.  We witnessed the tragic terrorist attacks in Paris last week.  Between 1970 and 2010 half the mammals, birds and reptiles on the planet have disappeared.  That is serious.  It is very difficult to highlight to the public the enormity of this issue.  It is bigger than the threat of nuclear warfare.  While humanity had to prevent the latter from happening, it must also prevent what is happening in terms of climate change.</p><p>The witnesses asked about ending the use of fossil fuels by 2050 but there are silent actors who will try to prevent that from happening because people are making massive sums of money out of such fuels.  How can we prevent those actors lobbying in Washington and Brussels to prevent what needs to be done?  Our guests outlined the consequences of that to which I refer, saying that this is the world&rsquo;s life support system and that there is a threat to life involved.  It is not just a question of climate change.  Life expectancy in China has dropped by five years because of air pollution.  According to an article in today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent</i>, if this is not checked, an extra 25,000 will die because of climate change.  Some articles about the Paris conference made the point that it will decide who lives and who dies.  It is not a question of being optimistic or pessimistic but determined.  The National Geographic Society has joined the Pope and the Pentagon in saying this is what needs to be done.  The 2% target the witnesses have outlined means that we go into the law of unforeseen outcomes but what will happen is highly predictable.  Once beyond the tipping point, there is no going back.  It is a long way to 2050 to reach that target.</p><p>There are things Ireland can do, particularly in respect of farming.  In a presentation to this committee, Mr. Eamonn Ryan said 80% of fossil fuels that we know of today must stay in the ground.  Given that people make billions of dollars out of the oil industry, it will take a serious effort to keep that in the ground.  That analysis must be done.  This committee should reflect and in January learn what happened in Paris.  Copenhagen was not good enough and we have to ensure this is top of this committee&rsquo;s agenda because it affects us all.</p><p>Agriculture creates a huge emissions problem for Ireland but we are not turning it into something positive.  In other countries the emissions are used to generate electricity and energy.  That is where we should put our money, instead of wasting it on carbon credits and wind farms - a matter on which we could have another debate - and make the emissions an income generator.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.510" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ois&iacute;n Coghlan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015111800002#G00300"><p>I am grateful for the invitation, which is timely, and to talk about coming back when we know more about the outcomes is also very welcome.  I will respond to Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s question about Ireland&rsquo;s role and how to counter the power of the fossil fuel industry in the upcoming policies.  I will leave the question about Ethiopia to my development colleagues and others will touch on the population question.  I will also speak about opportunities because it is not all sacrifice.<br/><br/>I spent ten years in the overseas aid and development community before my ten years with Friends of the Earth and have studied Ireland&rsquo;s role from both sides of that coalition.  I was conscious when I moved to Friends of the Earth of Ireland&rsquo;s proud record on overseas aid.  At the time, in 2005, before the recession, we were the sixth most generous country in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, development assistance committee, DAC, <i>per capita</i>, in overseas aid contributions.  We were just below the top five club who were at the 0.7% of gross national income level.  When I came to this job I made a calculation that no one in Ireland had made before and discovered that in the same peer group we were the sixth most climate polluting country <i>per capita</i>.  It seemed unreconcilable over time, otherwise we would be giving with one hand and taking with the other.  Recently, I returned to those figures because I knew that we had essentially met our Kyoto targets, through the impact of the recession more than policy.  We have dropped in aid to eighth place in the OECD DAC <i>per capita</i>and because our emissions have fallen we are now eighth in the peer group for climate-changing pollution emissions <i>per capita</i>.  There is not much of an improvement.  In terms of objective reality Ireland still has this - &quot;schizophrenia&quot; was mentioned earlier but that may be too strong - contradiction in its approach to, and policy on, climate change.  We have not squared that circle yet and the mitigation plan that is hopefully coming out next year has to do that.<br/><br/>I have a fear about our approach to climate diplomacy, which is relevant to this committee.  We have a particular emissions profile where agriculture plays a large role, more so than in other European countries.  For years, Ireland considered that and other issues such as peat and coal and Moneypoint and so on.  We have looked for ways to bring down emissions and had plans to do it, unlike now when we have no plan.  I am fearful of our approach now, watching how this Government has acted in recent years although it is about to bring a climate change Bill over the line.  This is the fourth environment Minister I have watched make this effort.  It will happen before the Paris meeting, which is good and significant, but it will be just a framework and will not include measures for dealing with emissions.  <br/><br/>We have watched the real concerted effort across Departments, which we had hoped would focus on actual solutions, but instead aims at a diplomatic effort to get Ireland off the hook of its 2020 targets under the EU, which are being renounced because they came from the last Government as if they were somehow wrongly calculated and an effort to obtain easier targets for 2030.  This comes across as Irish exceptionalism, as in &quot;We are special and different and should not have to make the same effort as everybody else&quot;.  We would state that this comes across as saying we should not have to do our fair share.  A lay person hearing the messages from the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Taoiseach, who have intervened in this debate, would say that it sounds like Ireland should not act and the current targets are not good for us.  The Taoiseach has spoken at European level about Ireland's being screwed if the targets set for 2030 are proportionately the same as those for 2020 and that this would be catastrophic for the Irish economy.</p><p>Normally we hear such words about climate change when talking about its impact.  The overall targets for Europe are not adequate to the science.  Therefore, when one country is speaking about its targets as being catastrophic, the message to its people and to Europe is that it does not want to act in a way which is commensurate with the issue.</p><p>  We have particular challenges but everyone has particular challenges.  The Germans could say - well, they could have said - Germany produces the best, most climate efficient cars in the world so if the Chinese middle class wants new cars it should buy German cars.  We are saying the same about beef and dairy products.  Of course, food is different, and we can discuss it in more detail, but this approach comes across as seeking not to act.  The risk is that if every country adopts this approach, we will not get anywhere near a deal commensurate with the challenge.  </p><p> This approach is an issue for us because it is an inappropriate way of going about climate diplomacy.  It is also ineffective from a strategic game theory perspective.  Ireland is not getting the traction it hoped it would get at an EU level.  Huge efforts went into getting particular wording in the European Council conclusions last October.  It was trumpeted by Ireland as a success because it did two things.  It gave special recognition to land use and agriculture, which would pan out in how the European target was applied to different countries.  It also recognised, in obtuse language, that it would look again at each individual country's target based on its GDP.  Our GDP is higher than our GNP.  The question was, therefore, what is our real capacity to act.  These were taken by the Government as two very significant moves by the EU.  Now our understanding is that it is not clear that those rhetorical assurances are panning out in real policy changes as Europe gears up next year to adopt national targets under whatever comes out of the upcoming meeting in Paris.</p><p> One analogy is the concession we got at the European Council level with regard to the recapitalisation of the banks and breaking the link between sovereign debt and bank debt, which was trumpeted at the time.  It is much more difficult in practice to get it applied.  In that case it was, exceptionally, retrospective as well.  In this case, the concession would be prospective.  However, applying a special treatment to one country opens a can of worms for the Commission and the European Council.  Our understanding is that there is a significant push back.  Officials inside government are now worried that because we are not meeting our 2020 target and not on track to meet it, we are facing potential non-compliance costs, namely, fines or costs for buying credits overseas.  These costs could run into multi-billions of euro over the course of the decade from 2020 to 2030.  This is not just for farm emissions but transport emissions as well because we have not broken the link between economic activity and emissions.</p><p> There is also a push-back from the European Commission because Ireland's approach has been quite confrontational.  We are saying we are different, the last targets were unfair and that we should not have targets which are commensurately proportionate for 2030.  The approach has been quite pushy.  While it achieved some traction rhetorically, there is now a push-back in practice.  I fear an analogy can be drawn between this and how Ireland dealt with the troika versus how Syriza dealt with the troika.  Ireland seems to be ignoring its own lessons.  In the case of the troika, Ireland complied but then asked for changes along the way and got them.  The argument would be that significant gains were made.  Syriza rejected on principle the way it was being done and, as we know, faced an even stiffer challenge.  Ireland's approach to climate change at the European level is much more like Syriza's approach to the troika than that of Ireland.  I worry that our climate diplomacy is not and will not be effective and will come back to bite us.  The calculations of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Finance suggest the approach runs significant financial risk.</p><p> Our analysis is that Ireland is not even trying to meet its 2020 targets.  The narrative is, "we said they were too high and too difficult and we cannot meet them".  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government recently said that we cannot meet our 2020 targets, even though, as an NGO, we do not think the targets are particularly high.  Therefore, the attitude adopted is not "we must try harder" but rather "we should be given easier targets for 2030".  With regard to climate justice, our overseas reputation and our effort in the sustainable development goals and so on in terms of coherence,  it would be much more appropriate and effective if we were being seen to act as much as possible on transport, retrofitting our houses, farming and energy.  There has been some movement in the area of energy at least.  If we were seen to be as effective as possible in such areas, then when we say we have a particular challenge in agriculture and are different, we would get a much more sympathetic hearing and a much fairer, more realistic, more practical and proportionate deal in Europe on our climate actions.</p></speech>

Many of my questions have been answered already.  I do not think anyone now doubts that climate change is happening notwithstanding the fact that this morning's weather was not that much different to typical Irish weather.  If one goes to places such as Africa, one sees that once arable soil is now dust.  One thing that is really telling is the shrinking of the lakes.  It is frightening to see how much they have shrunk.</p><p>To discuss Ireland's situation, which is Mr. Coghlan's purpose in attending today, I wonder if it is a valid comparison when he says our emissions are so much higher <i>per capita </i>than India or China.  I appreciate emissions <i>per capita</i>is a good way to measure emissions and changes in emissions over time but I am not sure that it is fair to compare us with countries such as China and India.  However, that is neither here nor there.  </p><p>Mr. MacEvilly's presentation looked at the three strands of policy and so on.  Two of the strands were all about money, and I accept that is the case, but we have to acknowledge that we high levels of debt in Ireland.  Our heart is in the right place, we do what we can and we will continue to do what we can.  I feel that is cross-party and not something just for this Government.</p><p>What do the witnesses really expect in terms of mitigation measures?  Mr. Coghlan has covered the issue to some extent.  Is it realistic that we would get out of fossil fuels by 2050?  What is the big ticket item that will replace fossil fuels without a major change in people's psyche, never mind Government policy and so on?  What will happen?  What level of technological breakthrough do we need to achieve something like that?  </p><p>On farming, Mr. Coghlan was saying to sign up to the targets and then look for concessions.  Is that realistic?  We are a special case in the sense that we cannot grow grapes.  Even though we might not have a bigger farming sector than many European countries, the reality is we cannot grow grapes.  We keep cows.  What is the alternative?  How can we damage such a big industry yet still be able to contribute to development aid and all the other things required of us?  It is a big question.</p><p>There is the undoubted role of big powers such as oil development corporations, which certainly are a lot cleverer than the rest of us, and what they will do to try to fool us on and so on.  How do we change people's minds?  How do we change the minds of Governments.  How do we convince people that we have to make that big leap.  What is the big leap?</p></speech>

A depressing picture was painted.  We should all be much more worried about this issue than we are.  We all know that Governments react to pressure from citizens.  Given the picture painted, why is this so far down the political agenda?  Why are ordinary citizens not putting more pressure on governments to respond more positively to the goals about which we speak?</p><p>Is it because they fear meeting more demanding targets will cost ordinary citizens more by way of carbon tax or other taxes?  Is that the reason climate change is so far down the political agenda in Ireland?  How do we change that?  If we do not, and if we do not get the temperature increases below 2&deg;, the world's people are facing a very uncertain future with much hunger and poverty.  Are we over-estimating the impact that 4.5 million people have in the overall equation?</p></speech>

We have another 20 minutes, which is not bad.  Regarding CO2 and our carbon emissions, there is one coal burning station in Ireland at Moneypoint.  That is the main problem we have with CO2 emissions at present and we must decide what we can do about it.</p><p>To take up Deputy Mitchell's point about the <i>per capita</i>CO<sub>2</sub>emissions, in China it is 3.8 as opposed to Ireland's 10.5.  However, China is building coal burning power stations at a rate of one almost every three weeks at present.  Where do big countries that are being heavily industrialised and polluted fit into the equation?  This applies to India as well.  Coal is the cheapest form of energy at present but it has most CO<sub>2</sub>emissions.  There is an abundant supply of coal throughout the world and there are enough supplies for another 150 years.  Have we examined taking the CO<sub>2</sub>out of coal?  That would go a long way in helping us to reach our targets.</p></speech>

The IPCC fifth assessment report states clearly that there must be deep and fundamental changes to business as usual if we are to keep warming below a 2&deg; threshold.  That is what we must do.</p> <p>  There is a worrying theme through some of the responses here with regard to the contribution of 4.5 million people, the coal, agriculture and what else we are going to grow.  We will not achieve anything in responding to climate change if we do not start to put a collective global common good before a short-term national interest.  I have been alarmed that Ireland's response has been about a short-term national interest.  In particular, the focus of all of our negotiations in the past couple of months, if not longer, has been about finding a concession for agriculture.  Agriculture is a very important sector in the Irish economy.  It contributes approximately 7% of our GDP; it is 2.6% with respect to primary agriculture.  It also accounts for approximately 10% of Irish exports.  Most of those exports go to the UK and other European countries.</p> <p>  We must look again at the polluter pays principle.  We have seen the quote from Ban Ki-moon and there are incitements to change our behaviour and systems from people such as Mary Robinson, President Higgins and Pope Francis.  They are not talking about seeking concessions for Irish agriculture, as this is just free-loading on the efforts of other countries that are making cuts to emissions.  We need an overall cut to emissions.  We will overshoot our targets and that is largely attributed to the impact of agriculture.  The general taxpayer will pay for that, whether it is through purchase of credits or fines.</p> <p>  That is an unacceptable situation.  I realise there is a good case to be made, but if one zooms out a little and looks at the ethics of the situation and whether we will achieve our emissions reduction targets and play our role fairly, as we have done for so long with regard to aid and development, seeking concessions for one sector is not ethically acceptable.  I will leave the other questions to other members of my group.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.518" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ois&iacute;n Coghlan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015111800002#J00400"><p>I will reply on the practical questions raised.  There are two aspects to the issue of China.  It is still building coal fired power stations, only it is doing so less fast than it was.  It is also now the largest investor in renewables in the world.  It is taking pollution very seriously because it is seeing the local impact of local air pollution.  The biggest difference between Copenhagen in 2009 and Paris this year is that there have been two big deals in the past year between President Obama and President Xi Jinping in advance of this conference.  The two biggest polluters in the world are showing some degree of leadership on it.  China is taking action and has committed to peak and reduce its emissions towards 2030.  China has been used as an excuse in the US and was raised in the media here as well.  People asked what the point was if China was not moving, but China is moving.<br/><br/>Indeed, one of the things it is doing is capturing much of the business opportunity.  Germany is moving away from nuclear power and into renewables in a big way.  It thought it would build the solar panels but it was out-competed by the Chinese.  The Germans own much of the renewable energy; local people own 51% of it, not big companies.  However, it is mainly Chinese solar panels.  The investment by German taxpayers in subsidised solar energy has driven change in both Germany and China.  We must also acknowledge that much of the Chinese manufacturing is for our consumption.  One can no longer cite China as a reason for the other countries not acting.<br/><br/>With regard to 4.5 million people, nobody is asking Ireland to do more than its fair share.  We are the fourth highest <i>per capita</i>in the EU, so that is another way of looking at our peer groups.<br/><br/>There was a question about whether we can get off fossil fuels by 2050 and how we cope with the power of the industry.  Countries such as Sweden, Finland and Denmark have set that fossil free target for themselves for 2050.  It is possible and there are models for how it can be done and what it involves.  The technology is evolving.  A solar panel in Ireland will get 80% of the impact of a solar panel in Madrid because of our long daylight hours.  However, there is no payment for having one for electricity generation.  That is one change we must see here.  Solar has potential, as does anaerobic digestion.  Obviously, wave and tidal power have possibilities.  The biggest, easiest win is in retrofitting our homes and reducing our need for heating in our homes.  Down the line there are electric vehicles combined with storing the renewable power that is generated.  Almost all of the reductions we need can be done with existing technology.  It is a question of deployment and change, and not getting locked into new investments in fossil intensive power.<br/><br/>On the power of the fossil fuel industry, there are some changes.  Rather than campaigners focusing mainly on the high level issues, as we are here today and will be in Paris, or even the semi-abstract content of a climate Bill, more public attention and focus is going on fossil fuel infrastructure.  President Obama made a big decision a couple of weeks ago not to build the Keystone XL pipeline from the tar sands in Canada, the most polluting source of oil, for the oil to be refined in the US.  He did not think it was economically useful, given how things are going, or climate appropriate.  It is the first time a country has rejected major infrastructure because of its impact on climate change.  That is leadership from the US, but we must see it more generally.  Ireland will face decisions about peat, Moneypoint and fracking in the future.  Do we go down the energy efficiency and renewables path or the fossil path?  It is the choices we make.  It will not be one big thing, just many choices.</p><p> There was a question about taking the CO2 out of coal.  There is a lot of talk, particularly from the coal-producing states in the US, about clean coal and the potential of carbon capture and storage, CCS.  That process involves putting something at the end of the tailpipe, sucking out the CO2 and storing it underground, often in old gas fields.  It is potentially possible and there is no harm in researching it, but there is no sign of it happening as yet.  The UK has given particular concessions to gas-fired power stations that were CCS-ready, which meant, in the case of Drax or one of the other large stations, having an empty space on the site so that when the technology came along, there would be somewhere to put it.  Beyond that, however, we are not very close to progress in this area.  We certainly cannot use the potential of CCS as a reason not to act.  We must act now, and perhaps in 2030 or 2040, or whenever CCS comes on stream, we can make use of it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.520" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Clarken" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015111800002#K00200"><p>I will try to cover some of the questions that have not been addressed.  Deputy Eric Byrne referred to the situation in Ethiopia, which is a major concern for us all.  That country has made tremendous strides in the past ten, 15 or 20 years, but the whole region is now facing a food crisis.  We must ensure Ethiopia is supported now, when it is struggling, after a period of doing so well.  We all recall the darkest days for the country and how far it has progressed.  The situation in Ethiopia is a watching brief and we are working with partners there to see what can be done.  Of course, Ethiopia is affected by the conflict in South Sudan.  There is a regional issue that needs to be addressed, with a greater focus on pushing the parties involved to come to a resolution.</p> <p>  The population question is something of a perennial for some of us, specifically in the context of climate impact.  To respond in a personal way, I have three children under the age of five and it is fair to say they probably have already used more carbon than their counterparts in developing countries.  Certainly, through the course of their lifetimes, they will, with the best efforts of their parents and our society, use multiples of what people in developing countries use.  It is the parents and grandparents of children in Ireland today, and previous generations, who are the cause of the climate impact on countries like Ethiopia, not the Ethiopian people themselves or the fact that more Ethiopian children are being born.  There is an inevitability in terms of where the population trajectory is heading in the next 20 or 25 years.  We can do nothing about that but we must push for better levels of education in developing countries, particularly for girls and women.  We need to ensure girls stay in school longer, space their children better and have fewer of them.  There is nothing more definite than that when one has middle classes in a society, people will have smaller, better educated and more protected families.  It is really about the need for poverty alleviation rather than blaming population increases.  That is an important message to get across.</p> <p>  In his analysis of the threat of nuclear power, Senator Mark Daly wondered whose lives will be saved and whose will not.  Those are very strong lines and I am glad the Senator is using them because that is how serious this issue is.  As Senator Michael Mullins said, for some reason we have not quite captured that imagination yet.  There is a great deal of activity going on in this area.  For example, a large protest march is planned for Paris and a stepping up of public engagement.  Many of us have been engaging with the public on these issues for years.  Lots of people, for several generations, have been hugely passionate about them, and more and more are taking the concerns on board.  People are joining the dots and getting more involved.  The flip side to this is that action requires leadership as opposed to followership, which in turn requires courage and doing things even if they are not yet on the popular agenda.  It is a question of working together to find out what we can do to mobilise people and how we can collectively ensure they are fully engaged.</p> <p>  Deputy Olivia Mitchell spoke about Ireland's share or part in bringing about change.  It is about equity, fairness and justice.  Nobody is asking Ireland to do any more than what is proportionate to its share.  During the worst of the economic crisis, the aid budget was cut by 35% or so.  In the past five years, however, it was more or less kept steady.  That required political leadership, and we should give credit where it is due.  The public was not clamouring for the level of aid to be retained but the political leadership decided it was important enough to do.  Equally, this is important enough to do and it requires that kind of leadership.  I am absolutely convinced the public will come along with us on this.  People are becoming more and more aware of the impact climate change is having not just somewhere far away but in our own country today, in the course of their lifetime and in their children's lifetime.  That is something we need to work on together.</p></speech>

I apologise for missing the start of the meeting.  Unfortunately, I had a clashing event to attend.  I am not convinced there is a groundswell of support to tackle climate change such as Mr. Clarken described.  Those of us who have for several years been giving the leadership he referred to find ourselves facing assassination from all sides.  I have to attend a public meeting tomorrow night to explain why I am supporting wind energy and other initiatives.  There is a lot of money being spent to ensure I am convinced otherwise.  However, I remain committed to recognising the need to respond to climate change and was formerly a party spokesman in that area.</p> <p>  Agriculture in this country represents a major part of the economy and was instrumental in the economic recovery we experienced in the past four or five years.  Without it, as well as the pharmaceutical and IT sectors, we would not be where we are now.  It is 90% indigenous - that is, generated locally  and 85% export-led.  In other words, a minimum of 85% of all the agricultural produce made here is exported.  It is a huge part of our economy and it must be protected.  There is a variety of ways to do that, including via alternative energy.  I am not and never was in favour of nuclear energy.  There are dangers to it, as we saw not too long ago with the Fukushima event.</p> <p>  When it comes to road transport, we cannot change the amount of fuel used and, consequently, the amount of carbon.  We are not going to run big trucks electronically; that is not going to happen.  It is a question of weaving a path between the needs of agriculture and road transport, on the one hand, and the carbon penalty regulations on the other.  We are in trouble if we do not find a way to do that.  It is all very fine to say Ireland should lead the charge and make the sacrifices.  Certainly, we are committed to meeting our targets and are doing our best in that regard.  I do not know whether we will meet them, but we should be very careful not to sabotage our own industries in the course of our efforts.  I do not agree, moreover, that every country in the world is pulling its weight in this area.  China has come on board in recent times, but in terms of the totality of the problem it has to deal with, there is a long way to go yet.</p> <p>  A number of options have been put forward as alternatives to carbon fuels, one of which is hydroelectric energy.  The Turlough Hill idea is a feasible one that could be merged with wind to replace what we have.  The Moneypoint generator produces 1,000 MW and is the largest single contributor to the national grid.  If we take that out and replace it with something else, then we have a serious void in terms of reliable energy production.  We can replace it with biomass but for that we need 1 million acres to grow the food for the biomass, which would have to come from land currently used to produce food for human consumption.  That creates its own problems, particularly in places such as Latin America.</p><p>I spoke with a guy about solar power.  I am finishing on this, Chairman, but this subject is of particular importance to me.</p></speech>

I am not sure support from me on wind energy is useful to Deputy Durkan, but I recognise the challenges he has been facing.  It is a debate we engage in frequently in public and private with people to find ways to involve communities positively in looking for solutions.  I recognise the challenges the Deputy faces.</p> <p>  On the question of whether there is a groundswell for action more generally, politicians have been saying to us for years that climate change does not come up on the doorsteps.  I take their word for it, but our response - and I do not mean it tritely - is that banking regulation did not come up on the doorsteps in 2002 or even in 2007.  The challenge for leaders, as people with a far greater awareness of what is going on than people who are struggling through the challenges of daily life, is to take on board the evidence of an overheating planet, as evidence of an overheating economy should have been taken on board, and to act on behalf of all of us.</p></speech>

One recommendation of ours is that the committee could examine the issue of policy coherence.  Deputy Durkan referred to biomass and biofuels, and those are issues we have concerns about.  We ask that those matters be taken forward also.  In relation to Ireland's emissions being perhaps irrelevant in the context of the big players, while they may be small in comparison with the biggest countries, it does not change the fact that our harmful emissions contribute and will contribute to damaging climate change.  It also goes back to the point about exceptionalism.  This is also true of a lot of other smaller developed countries and it is an issue of responsibility, as the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, has stated.</p> <p>  As to why this is not high on people's agendas, it is probably not understood that this is a human rights issue.  It is affecting food security in the developing world.  By 2025, two thirds of Africa may be subject to water stress, with similar pressures on crop production.  With that in mind, we are making recommendations on mitigation which Ireland needs to put in place.  It is not about putting pressure on an individual industry, but about a mitigation plan across all sectors.</p> <p>  Deputy Olivia Mitchell asked about Ireland being subject to financial pressures.  That is precisely why we have recommendations as to how climate finance can be generated.  In other words, it is about finding new mechanisms to generate those funds.</p></speech>

I remind members and those in the public Gallery to ensure their mobile phones are switched off completely for the duration of the meeting because, even when in silent mode, they cause interference with the recording equipment in the committee rooms.</p> <p>  The purpose of today's meeting is to consider two motions, referred to the select committee by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, on the economic partnership agreement between west African states, the Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS, and the West African Economic and Monetary Union, UEMOA, of the one part and the European Union and its member states of the other part.  The second motion is the economic partnership agreement between the CARIFORUM states of the one part and the European Union and its member states of the other part.  Under the terms of the D&aacute;il motion of 11 November 2015, the select committee must consider the matter and report back to the House not later than 26 November 2015.</p> <p>  On behalf of the select committee, I welcome the Minister of State with responsibility for development, trade promotion and North-South co-operation, Deputy Sherlock, and his officials.  I congratulate him and the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, on their superb work in recent weeks.  We know it has been very difficult to get them because they have been in Belfast.  It is good that the Stormont talks were successful and I congratulate our delegation from the Irish Government which took part in the talks.</p> <p>  We will hear an opening presentation from the Minister of State and then take questions from members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.553" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/979" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOS2015111800002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for his expression of congratulations.  I will be sure to convey the message to the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and the team involved in the talks at Stormont House.</p> <p>  I am joined by Ms Dympna Hayes and Ms Mary Barrett from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Ms Lorraine Benson from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  If there are any very technical questions which I am not able to answer, we have three experts here.  I thank the Chairman and members for this opportunity to discuss the two motions before us, which have been referred to the select committee for consideration.  The motions seeks D&aacute;il approval of the terms of the EU&rsquo;s economic partnership agreements with 15 Caribbean countries and with 16 west African states and their two regional economic organisations.</p> <p>  As members of the committee are aware, the agreements in question involve mixed competence.  This means they cover matters falling within the exclusive competence of the European Union, such as the common commercial policy, as well as issues which remain within the competence of member states, such as development co-operation.  For this reason, each EU member state is a party to these two agreements and they can only formally enter into force after they have been ratified by all member states.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, the approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is required prior to ratification whenever the terms of the agreement involve the possibility of a charge on public funds.</p> <p>  As it can take a considerable length of time before ratification procedures are completed in all 28 member states, arrangements are usually made for some aspects of agreements such as these to be applied on a provisional basis pending their formal entry into force at a later date.</p><p> These two agreements are significant in that they are the first full economic partnership agreement, EPA, signed between the EU and African, Caribbean and Pacific, ACP, countries.  Members of the committee will recall that historically ACP countries benefited from unilateral trade preferences with the EU.  However, these were deemed to violate World Trade Organization, WTO, rules on the basis that they established unfair discrimination between developing countries.</p><p> In 2000, the EU and 77 ACP states concluded an agreement known as the Cotonou Agreement.  This provided for a new trade and development framework based on EPAs.  These are a new type of multilateral agreement combining both trade and wider development issues in a unified framework and containing reciprocal preferences in trade between the EU and ACP states.  On this basis, in 2001 the WTO agreed to give a waiver to the EU to continue the unilateral preferences until 31 December 2007 when these agreements were expected to come into effect.  The original intention was for the EU to conclude comprehensive EPAs with the six regional groupings of ACP states.</p><p> Following protracted and difficult negotiations, only the Caribbean was in a position to initial a full EPA before the December 2007 deadline.  Twenty-one other ACP countries initialled interim agreements in smaller subgroups or individually.  In west Africa, two interim EPAs were concluded with Ghana and the Ivory Coast.  The interim agreements have been acting as building blocks to full EPAs, negotiations on which have been ongoing in Africa and the Pacific.  Last year, a full EPA was signed with west Africa and negotiations were concluded on two full EPAs with the east African community and southern African development community EPA states.</p><p> These EPAs are pioneering agreements in the international trading system.  They are the first genuinely comprehensive north-south trade agreements which seek to promote sustainable development, build a regional market among developing countries and help eliminate poverty.  The agreements seek to put trade at the service of development.  The EU&rsquo;s trade and development partnership with the ACP states stretches back more than 30 years.  These agreements build on that partnership.  The aim is to make it easier for people and businesses from the EU and the Caribbean and west Africa to invest in and trade with each other, thus helping Caribbean and west African countries grow their economies and create jobs.</p><p> I will now introduce the EU-CARIFORUM economic partnership agreement to the committee for approval.  The agreement is between the EU and its member states and the Caribbean forum of African, Caribbean and Pacific states, CARIFORUM.  The CARIFORUM members party to this agreement are Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, the Dominican Republic, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Christopher and Nevis, Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago.  The agreement was signed in the Caribbean on 15 October 2008 and Guyana signed on 21 October 2008.  It entered into provisional application on 29 December 2008.  The EU worked together with the Haitian authorities to adjust some of that country&rsquo;s tariff commitments in light of its specific needs as a least developed country.  This made it possible for Haiti to sign the agreement on 10 December 2009.  As of now, it has been ratified by 17 EU member states and eight CARIFORUM states.</p><p> The agreement comprises six parts.  Part I, trade partnership for sustainable development, sets out the objectives of the agreement with specific articles on sustainable development, regional integration and monitoring.  It recognises development co-operation as an essential factor of the agreement with the EU to support implementation of the agreement via the European Development Fund and other relevant instruments.  EU member states undertake to provide support via its development policies and instruments, in accordance with complementarity and aid effectiveness principles.</p><p> Part II, trade and trade related matters, removed tariffs and quotas on CARIFORUM exports to the EU immediately.  From the Caribbean side, there is a gradual opening of markets covering 61.1% of the value of CARIFORUM imports from the EU over ten years, 82.7% over 15 years and 86.9 % over 25 years.  The agreement contains considerable flexibility for the Caribbean countries to exclude sensitive products and industries from liberalisation.  The main exclusions from tariff cuts are agricultural and processed agricultural products, some chemicals, furniture and other industrial products.  The agreement provides for rephasing of the CARIFORUM liberalisation schedule if serious difficulties arise in respect of specific imports.  It also provides for possible modification of the CARIFORUM commitments, having regard to the special development needs of nine of the CARIFORUM countries.</p><p> Part II also includes provisions on investment, trade in services and electronic commerce.  The EU is making substantial concessions in the services sector, opening up new markets for Caribbean companies, investors and professionals to offer services in the EU in areas like international phone calls, banking and architectural services, including new services sectors such as entertainers, chefs de cuisine and fashion models.  In turn, CARIFORUM countries have also made offers, in particular in export-oriented and infrastructure sectors key for their development, such as telecommunications, transport, tourism, manufacturing and environmental services.</p><p> Part II covers trade defence instruments and non-tariff measures.  It includes provisions to support WTO and other multilateral compliance and co-operation with regard to customs and trade facilitation, agriculture and fisheries, technical barriers to trade as well as sanitary and phytosanitary measures.  The agreement seeks to improve the business climate and boost trade.  To this end, Part II also covers commitments in trade related issues such as competition, innovation and intellectual property, public procurement and the protection of personal data, along with complementary co-operation and assistance.  There are provisions to protect and uphold environmental standards and workers&rsquo; rights while guaranteeing the rights of the CARIFORUM countries to regulate and manage their own affairs.</p><p> On the trade aspects of the agreement, under Protocol I, Caribbean countries now benefit from improved rules of origin that support the development of industries that import materials to make goods for onward export to the EU.  This is important for industries such as processed food or fisheries which might import raw materials from outside the Caribbean.</p><p> Part III outlines the procedures for dispute avoidance and settlement.  Part IV provides for general exceptions, for example, in the areas of security and taxation.  Part V provides for supervision and monitoring of the agreement via a ministerial council and three committees comprising senior officials, parliamentarians and civil society representatives.  Part VI covers sundry general and final provisions.</p><p> Last July, the Caribbean EPA ministerial joint council reviewed the first five years of implementation of the agreement.  A study conducted as part of the review found that efforts to implement the EPA were hampered by the global recession which hit just as it was being signed in 2008.  Our Caribbean EPA partners are all small island developing states and were particularly impacted, given their openness to the global financial and economic system and high dependence on a narrow range of income-generating sectors such as tourism.  Nonetheless, the study found a positive EPA effect for some agricultural and industrial exports from the Dominican Republic and for products such as rice, frozen shrimp, citrus and rum in the other CARIFORUM countries.</p><p> The study identified five big ticket items to be addressed.  The first of these is ratification by all CARIFORUM and EU states.</p><p>With my attendance at the committee today, I hope Ireland can play its part in addressing the recommendation.  Other actions recommended are continued support to the regional and national EPA units and substantive discussion on a regional development fund, and continued engagement with the private and public sector on the EPA.  The other two recommended actions have already been addressed, namely, the establishment of a sub-committee on development and the convening of the consultative committee, and the establishment of a monitoring task force.  The July EPA CARIFORUM-EU ministerial council concluded that in spite of the challenges which had so far confronted implementation, the EPA has tremendous potential for contributing to the sustainable development of CARIFORUM states.</p><p> Between 2008 and 2013, the EU, including Ireland through our contributions to the European Development Fund, supported a &euro;75 million EPA implementation programme for governments and businesses.  This was part of a wider &euro;165 million EU package promoting regional integration in the Caribbean.  Additional support was provided bilaterally by the United Kingdom, Germany and Spain.  From 2014 to 2020, the EU will provide a further &euro;102 million for region-wide development programmes, with regional integration and EPA implementation among their main goals.  This is one of three focal sectors in a package of &euro;346 million, the others being climate change and crime and security.  Implementation in all three sectors will be boosted by the work of the Caribbean Investment Facility, which will receive &euro;135 million to blend grant resources with additional funding, notably from European and regional finance institutions and the private sector, to facilitate the mobilisation of much-needed key infrastructure investment.</p><p> I introduce the EU-West African EPA to the committee for approval.  The agreement is between the EU and its member states and the west African states, the Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS and the West African Economic and Monetary Union, UEMOA.  The 16 west African states are Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo.  The agreement was signed by Ireland on 12 December 2014 and in west Africa on 15 December 2014.  All EU member states and 13 of the 16 west African states have signed.  Gambia, Nigeria and Mauritania have yet to sign.  The agreement comprises seven main parts.  Part I, entitled "Economic and trade partnership for sustainable development," sets out the objectives and principles of the agreement, with specific articles on economic growth, sustainable development and regional integration.  Part II, entitled "Trade policy and questions concerning trade," removes tariffs and quotas on west African exports to the EU immediately.  West Africa will liberalise 75% of tariff lines over 20 years, with no liberalisation in the first five years.  A wide range of west African goods considered most sensitive are permanently excluded from the requirement to liberalise, ranging from agricultural goods to industrial goods and including the following: meat and poultry; processed meat; fish and fish products; milk and milk products; eggs; cocoa and cocoa preparations; cement; and textiles and apparel.  At the same time, the progressive elimination of tariffs on goods such as equipment and other inputs will make them cheaper for local businesses.  In addition to this gradual and controlled liberalisation, west African countries will be able to avail of safeguards if imports of liberalised products are increasing too quickly and jeopardising local markets or where food security is threatened.  Special protection is also foreseen for infant industries.  In addition, the agreement recognises the special development needs of west African countries and provides scope to change their tariff commitments.</p><p> Part II of the agreement also covers trade defence instruments and non-tariff barriers.  It includes provisions to support WTO and other multilateral compliance and co-operation with regard to the following: technical barriers to trade, sanitary and phytosanitary measures; facilitation of trade, customs co-operation and mutual administrative assistance; and agriculture, fisheries and food security.  Specifically on agriculture and fisheries, the EU will not subsidise exports of EU farm products to the region, and a high-level dialogue on agricultural policies will be established, creating transparency and improving coherence on agricultural matters within the region and with the EU.  In conclusion, on the trade aspects of the agreement, under Protocol 1, west African countries will benefit from improved rules of origin which will allow them to source materials from other countries to produce duty-free exports to the EU.</p><p> Part III of the agreement, entitled "Cooperation for implementation of development and achievement of the objectives of the EPA," provides for support from the EU via the European Development Fund and other relevant instruments and from EU member states in accordance with aid effectiveness, co-ordination and complementarity principles.  The agreement links support to the EPA development programme, known by its French acronym PAPED.  The PAPED was developed during the negotiations by the west African parties.  The conclusions of the EU Council of Ministers of 10 May 2010 and 17 March 2014 confirmed the commitment of the EU and its member states, with more than &euro;8.2 billion provided in the period 2010 to 2014 and a commitment by the EU to provide at least &euro;6.5 billion for the period 2015 to 2020.  The latter amount corresponds to the existing needs as estimated by the west African authorities.</p><p> Of the &euro;3 billion to be delivered by the EU institutions, the delivery of almost &euro;1.2 billion by 2016 has already been committed to.  Following discussions with west African countries, support will focus on key priority sectors relating to trade, including agriculture, infrastructure, energy and capacity building for developing civil society.  The European Commission is in discussions with member states and the west African countries to co-ordinate the response to the PAPED, and Ireland is taking part in these ongoing discussions to determine how we can best assist in implementation of the agreement.</p><p> Part IV of the agreement outlines the procedures for dispute avoidance and settlement.  Part V provides for general exceptions - for example, in security and taxation.  Part VI provides for supervision and monitoring of the agreement via a ministerial council and three committees comprising senior officials, parliamentarians and civil society representatives.  Part VII covers final provisions.  These include a provision for the suspension of trade benefits where any party fails to fulfil its obligations on human rights, democratic principles, the rule of law and good governance under the Cotonou Agreement.  There is also a revision clause providing for the agreement to be assessed or reviewed every five years while also allowing review as required.</p><p> I thank the committee for its time.  I am happy to recommend these two agreements for approval.  They present a strategy to assist our Caribbean and west African partners to build larger markets and foster trade in goods and services as well as stimulate investment.  They reaffirm the EU's commitment to a close trade and development partnership with the two regions.  I encourage the committee to recommend to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann that the two proposed motions be approved so that Ireland is in a position to notify the Council of the completion of its ratification procedures.  I am happy to take questions, and if there are any very difficult questions that I cannot answer, I have a very competent team of experts with me.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.556" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/970" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOS2015111800002#C00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his very detailed presentation.  In his introductory remarks, the Minister of State referred to the promotion of sustainable development, building a regional market among developing countries and helping to eliminate poverty.  In his concluding remarks, he referred to sustainable development and a close trading and development partnership between the Caribbean and west African regions and the EU.  We fully concur with these aims and recognise the potential for development for the benefit of both partners.</p><p> It is not just the text of the agreements that is critical, it is their implementation and mechanisms to review their workings as well are necessary.  Flexibility is important as well in the implementation of the agreements.  What safeguards are in the agreement to ensure its fair implementation to suit the needs and capabilities of both the European Union and west African countries?  It was clearly outlined that the agreement will seek to facilitate EU food exports to the west African region.  As eradication of global poverty is a cornerstone of Irish foreign policy, could the Minister of State confirm whether research has been conducted into the impact of the exports on the ability of local agricultural interests, both farmers and producers, to engage with their local and regional markets?  It is clear to us that a worthwhile agreement should not be about displacement of local produce or industry which would in the long term continue to restrict overall growth in the local economy.  We must be very cautious in that regard.  I hope at the level of the Council of Ministers and at the exchange at official level with the European Commission that the agreements would be examined sector by sector to see how they are working out.  Recent comments in the early part of this month by the trade Commissioner were brought to my attention.  She said that the West Africa- EU economic partnership agreement, EPA, protected west African producers in the poultry sector.  I take that as an example of where the very opposite is happening to what the Commissioner told the rest of the world.</p><p> Based on current trends the export of poultry products is likely to destroy livelihood opportunities not only for tens of thousands of local poultry producers but also for hundreds of thousands of cereal producers who provide the animal feed for the local poultry farmers.  A few statistics were brought to my attention in regard to this sector.  Between 2004 and 2014, consumption of poultry meat in sub-Saharan Africa increased by 99%.  However, local production grew only 57% while imports from the EU grew 209%.  By 2014, imports of poultry meat accounted for 44% of sub-Saharan African consumption compared to less than 30% in 2014.  There is increased consumption but the share of the market by local producers is in decline and the European Union is displacing local producers.  That is the type of issue on which we must keep a very close eye.  Ongoing reviews are necessary of the mechanisms and workings of the agreement.  The poultry sector is a very small one from a European Union point of view but it is a hugely important sector for so many impoverished farmers and producers in impoverished regions in the area.  I could not emphasise enough the need for flexibility and for considerable oversight to ensure the spirit of the agreement is followed, with which all of us agree, in terms of trying to grow trade and improve the economic fortunes of people in less-developed areas.  It is very important that the mechanisms are in place to do that.</p><p> The other issue that was brought to my attention was Article 34 of the agreement which deals with the agrifood sector and the export of food.  Could the Minister of State indicate whether there is provision in the agreement for the transfer of knowledge to build up the capacity in those regions to grow their own local agricultural sector and to grow the food industry there?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.558" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOS2015111800002#D00200"><p>Ordinarily, I would be very supportive of proposals of this nature and I wish to be supportive but I am a little bit at sea as to the detail.  The Minister of State is probably relaying what is in the general agreement and we may not find out the detail until a later stage.  We have had one bad experience in relation to a similar agreement in the past, namely, the termination of the sugar regime in Europe.  The selling point at the time was that sugar would become cheaper for consumers all over Europe and it would be hugely beneficial to the individual farmers in Africa to whom the Minister of State referred, rightly so if that were to happen, but that did not happen.  In fact, the reverse happened.  It was of huge benefit to multinational corporations who seized the opportunity not only to replace the poor indigenous farmers in African and other countries but also to improve and enhance their position in the European sugar market.  I do not want such an outcome to be hidden somewhere in the fuzz that goes along with agreements.</p> <p>  I am also aware of the large European dairy companies that have made major acquisitions which will be of huge benefit to them in the context of this particular agreement.  They readily admit that African producers will not be able to compete with them and it was never intended that they should compete with them.  Problems will arise.</p> <p>  Another issue to which we referred in the past is the concept of trade for aid.  Ireland is one of the very few countries which does not employ a policy of aid for trade.  Rightly so, but as you well know, Mr. Chairman, we have visited certain African countries where there was ample evidence of aid only for trade to the detriment of the poorer countries.  I would like to see much more detail.  I would like to know, for example, to what extent engagement took place with the small producers in the African countries with a view to asking them how the agreement would affect them or how beneficial it would be for them, if they expect to enhance their trade and would it be trade with no strings attached.  I would also like to know the extent, if any, to which the whole concept of aid for trade was advanced in the course of the preparation of the agreements.  In addition, I would like to know the extent, for example, to which producers in this country and across Europe &ndash; the ordinary small producers, not the multinational corporations &ndash; are likely to be affected or are being affected in the context of the agreements.</p> <p>  I am fully in favour of removing barriers to trade.  We talked about the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, and other such matters in the past.  There are benefits from it accruing to the poorer nations and all participants.  However, I am very concerned about the extent of the detail that may be wrapped up in the context of the two agreements which spread very wide.  Two Continents are covered by them, and there will be an impact on both Continents.  I am concerned that some of those issues might be of negative content from the point of view of first, the people for whom the help is intended, and second, the producers in this country, for example, the poultry sector, and the impact it might have on the agrifood sector.</p> <p>  I wish to be supportive.  The concept is a good one but I am deeply suspicious.  I have many bad memories.  I was one of the very few people in a previous incarnation of this committee who asked the question about the doubtful benefits of the cessation of the sugar regime in Europe.  Deputy Denis Naughten, who was spokesperson in a different incarnation at the time, also raised concerns.  In fact, the implications were not recognised by the people who were directly affected, either in this country or in the countries for whom the intention was to assist.</p> <p>  I do not wish to be negative but I am happy about the agreement until I see a much greater level of detail trotted out.  I would love to meet and greet some of those people such as FrieselandCampina, Danone and other companies that have launched major investment programmes throughout Africa and made major acquisitions throughout Europe recently and continue to do so.  That is all I wish to say at this stage.  I will not read the list into the record but I will do so at another point.</p></speech>

In terms of how we trade with developing countries, I am satisfied that this country's foreign policy with respect to Irish Aid policy is clearly structured in a way that ensures we trade on the basis of such trade being a sustainable relationship.  That feeds into our position in terms of an EU position on these negotiations.</p> <p>  Specific reference was made to sugar and I want to make a broad point in response to that.  I hail from the town of Mallow and if people check the historical debates of this House, they will note my surname is possibly synonymous with some of those historical debates.  A political decision taken at Council of Ministers level on the future of that industry.  I take the point made by Deputy Durkan regarding the ACP Cotonou Agreement with respect to the broader sugar industry, globally speaking.  The global market for sugar has transpired in a way in which it was not sold to us at the time.  I would make that objective point.</p> <p>  I want to defer to Ms Mary Barrett.  Dare I say it, the people accompanying me are global experts on these agreements and we are lucky to have the benefit of their expertise here.  If there is further political response needed, Ms Barrett can defer to me.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.561" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Barrett" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOS2015111800002#E00400"><p>I will respond first to Deputy Smith's questions.  He raised the question of flexibility and asked if there will be oversight of these agreements.  We can see from the example of how the Caribbean European partnership agreement is already being implemented that this is the case.  The five yearly review was held and a joint ministerial council meeting was held last July to review that.  It found there were areas that implementation has not proceeded as expected because of the global economic circumstances.  That review, and the recommendations flowing from it, shows that there are systems in place once these agreements are being implemented.  There is the joint ministerial council, the trade and development committee, which is made up of senior officials, the parliamentarians group, which is made up of the Caribbean and EU parliamentarians, and a consultative committee, which is made up of civil society.  All these parties are involved in reviewing the agreement and feeding into how it can be improved in the future.  That is the oversight.  There are also examples of flexibility given that so far some Caribbean countries, because of the legislative procedures involved, have not been able to meet all the targets on reducing their tariffs.  It is not a case of the EU coming in with heavy boots and saying they have not met the deadline.  The EU is talking to the countries involved and listening to the issues they have.  It is not pushing the issue but rather is taking it on board as part of this five yearly review.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to safeguards in the agreement to ensure fairness.  As the Minister of State mentioned in his opening statement, there are safeguards in place whereby in the case of too much of a product being imported into a country and that affecting local markets, the country can avail of the safeguard in the agreement.  Also, infant industries are protected by safeguards.  These safeguards are more flexible than one would get at the World Trade Organization.  They have been specially designed for these development agreements.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about studies that have been done.  The European Centre for Development Policy Management did a study for us in Irish Aid in 2012 on trade liberalisation and fiscal adjustment.  It examined previous studies and showed that the fiscal loss impact has been overestimated in many studies, but nonetheless it stated that of all regions west Africa would be more affected than others by fiscal losses.  It is for that reason the negotiators, as the negotiations were proceeding, recognised that west Africa would be more affected.  That is the reason the PAPED was developed.  The west African countries got together and in a participatory way came up with the EPA development programme and they pointed out the issues that would need to be addressed for such an agreement to be successful.  The European Council of Ministers came up with conclusions and said they would address those in 2010 and last year.  Also, a more recent study by the World Bank, specific to Nigeria, has shown that there will be very limited fiscal losses, marginal welfare gains for consumers, and increased jobs and profits for the majority of manufacturing firms in Nigeria from the EPA.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised the issue of poultry.  The EPA has not come into effect yet.  Therefore, difficulties in the poultry sector are not caused by the EPA.  The poultry sector is excluded from liberalisation under the EPA.  The Deputy mentioned the issue of local production, which I have addressed with regard to the safeguards.  Article 34 deals with the prohibition of quantitative restrictions.  If there are any difficulties with that provision, the safeguards will kick in.  The Deputy asked about the transfer of knowledge, and that is exactly what PAPED is all about.  It is about providing assistance in order that the west African countries can build up their trade capacity and move into more intermediate products rather than depending on basic commodities.  We in Irish Aid hope we are playing our part in this.  For example, our support for the international trade centre helps countries build up trade strategies.  It works with the private sector and helps those countries to move into higher value products and to export to the EU and all around the world.</p> <p>  I will now respond to Deputy Durkan's questions.  He raised the question of milk.  Milk is excluded under the liberalisation schedule as a sensitive product.</p> <p>  The Deputy also mentioned how aid for trade was advanced in the negotiations.  Sometimes the phrase "aid for trade" can be a misnomer.  The Deputy was correct in what he said, namely, that there is very much a separation in Ireland between aid and trade in that we provide aid but it is totally separated from trade.  There is an agenda at the WTO and it is called for aid for trade agenda.  It seeks to build up the capacity of developing countries.  For example, at the WTO we support interns at the missions of least developed countries and they provide great support.  They can learn about WTO mechanisms, and when they return to their home countries, they know how to use the safeguards in these agreements and in WTO agreements.  PAPED came about from how aid for trade was advanced.  The west African countries said that to implement this agreement, they would need assistance to build up our trade capacity.  There is where that comes from.</p> <p>  On the question of what this agreement will bring to small producers in Europe, it would bring them potential increased markets.  However, we must recognise that when the Caribbean EPA was being brought in, there were estimates that there would be increased exports from the EU, but because of the economic crisis, that has not come to pass to date.  There was an increase in exports at one stage but then it declined again.  Over the course the Caribbean EPA, the volume of exports from the EU has gone up and down and then levelled off.   Trade agreements in themselves do not ensure something will happen.  They provide a framework and then the companies need to inform themselves about the framework that is in place and take advantage of it.  It can take a while for that to happen.  Such agreements create a framework, an opportunity and clarity for business, and then that opportunity must be grasped.  That is the idea of PAPED and the development co-operation for the west African side, namely, to help them grasp that opportunity.</p><p>For example, Irish Aid has given &euro;800,000 to the International Trade Centre in Geneva this year.  It produced a guide to the agreement for the Caribbean businesses.  Such initiatives will help businesses grasp the opportunities these agreements present.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.563" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1005" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOS2015111800002#F00200"><p>These motions are presented to us in a way that is totally positive and suggest this will be a wonderful success.  Page 7 of the Caribbean agreements refers to the positive EPA effect for some agricultural and industrial exports from the Dominican Republic and some other projects.  That does not come across as a glaring success of what is happening in the Caribbean.  In the previous D&aacute;il, the now President, Michael D. Higgins, was most critical of EPAs and the lack of debate in the Parliament on them.  We should have a full and frank debate in the D&aacute;il on these issues.</p> <p>  Deputy Durkan spoke about how people in west Africa feel about this.  There was an open letter from west African farmers to the European Parliament.  Another document was produced an amalgamation of NGOs, called CONCORD.  The common concerns coming from them was that instead of lifting people out of poverty it will plunge them further into poverty, which will lead in turn to further migration to Europe; that there will be massive impacts on local markets and on long-term food security; and, very significantly, that it will undermine our development aid programme.  We were discussing climate change this morning where we seem to be giving with one hand and taking with the other because of our lack of real commitment on climate change.  I think there is a further element of that with these EPAs.</p> <p>  We know the saying that to give a person a fish allows them to feed for a day but teaching them how to fish or giving them a boat has potential.  Cynically one could say it would be a lost opportunity for the home base.  Therefore, how serious are we with helping Africa to feed itself and lift itself out of poverty?</p> <p>  The letters from the west African farmers and from civil society make us wonder why we are not on the same side as those people in addressing these issues.  Is there something significant in the fact that the most populous of the west African countries, Nigeria, has not signed this yet?  The EU Commission is carrying out a trade policy review but EPAs do not seem to come under that review.</p> <p>  Page 11 refers to the final provisions which sound vague and woolly.  The Minister of State said that there would be a revision clause providing for it to be assessed or reviewed every five years while also allowing review as required.  Is there not a need for much more stringent monitoring of this?  We know it will pass here.  Where is the role for this committee in such monitoring?  Will the Minister of State come back here on that one?</p> <p>  The Taoiseach has said that developing countries across the world have a growing thirst for dairy products, especially infant formula.  However, much of the milk powder that we export is fat filled, meaning that the valuable cream has been extracted and has been replaced with cheaper vegetable fats.  It is also taking from those programmes, including Scaling Up Nutrition, that promote breast feeding, which has been found to have the potential to reduce deaths in infants by double-figure percentages.  This is where I see the contradiction.  That is just one small example.  If we go into it further, we could see other contradictions.</p> <p>  There are very serious concerns here.  I do not think the safeguards are sufficiently rigid or stringent.  Much more active oversight is needed.</p> <p>  On the Caribbean agreement, I do not know whether Cuba wants to be part of it, but I presume the embargo is preventing it from even being there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.564" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1026" speakername="Olivia Mitchell" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOS2015111800002#F00300"><p>Generally speaking, I would be in favour of trade agreements and economic partnership agreements.  I am sure the Minister of State is somewhat surprised to find so much negativity coming from this side of the table.  These agreements are with some of the poorest countries in the world and traditionally the relationship between rich sophisticated Europe and poor Africa has been an uneven relationship.  As other speakers have said, we have received a certain amount of correspondence from civil society groups expressing concerns about the agreement's contents.</p> <p>  For instance, one concern is about the non-tariff barriers to trade which are being eliminated straight off, as far as I understand.  I presume that refers to all products.  It may be protected products; it is not clear.  They are being retained while the tariff barriers, the import duties, are being gradually and partially reduced.  However, the countries have traditionally depended on the non-tariff barriers to protect their indigenous industries and particularly their agrifood sector.</p> <p>  The other major point they have been making is that trade with Europe is not necessarily the best thing for Africa.  The population of Europe is falling and the population of Africa is growing.  The demand in the future will be in Africa and they feel that promoting trade between us and Africa is thwarting the development of inter-regional development in Africa.</p> <p>  The objectives of this agreement include improving governance, sustainable development, increasing capacity, regional integration and eradication of poverty.  One could not be against those.  I am reluctant to argue in any way with what the Minister of State refers to as global trade experts.  However, we want some reassurance the progressivity on liberalisation will be dependent on the progress in implementing the commitments that we, Europe, have made.  Irish Aid has always had the tradition of trying to work for the benefit of the countries with which we trade, but that might not necessarily be the agenda of the entire EU.  We need some assurances that we are aware of these pitfalls.</p></speech>

I have attempted to read these agreements, which are quite substantial, and the Minister of State's contribution.  It is all contained in the documentation if one can fully understand it.  It is terribly technical.</p> <p>  It is very important to be reassured that the Minister of State is the person arguing in favour of these agreements.  The Minister of State covers a very important portfolio, encompassing overseas development aid.  If we were to be fearful of what he is trying to implement on behalf of Ireland within the EU, it would beg the question as to whether he is being honest with us parliamentarians given that we are very enthusiastic about and supportive of the Irish Aid development programmes on which we engage with the Minister of State.</p> <p>  The last time I was involved in this type of debate was when we discussed similar agreements with Colombia, Peru and Europe.  One must respect the role of NGOs in the field and their perspective of what is happening with big brother, big governments or big regional authorities.  I would hate the wrong image to go out from this meeting to the ambassadors of the seven African countries who meet this committee once a year as a group.  When they appear before the committee they insist that they want Africa to be seen as a trading area, they do not want this old image of poor quality agriculture production.  They want to be seen as a continent that is growing and bustling, and wants and is arguing in favour of trade.  Who am I to tell the west African countries that they have it wrong because NGOs have pointed to some possible negative effects?</p><p> The Minister of State will know that I am a fanatical supporter of one of the agencies he supports financially.  It is called Fair Trade produce.  I only buy fair trade bananas and a wide range of fair trade produce, including coffees and other products.  When I give my imprimatur to this deal, I want the people to know that I support it and I want the Minister of State to convey our support for the development of fair trade in the real sense of fairly trading.</p><p> I want to ask two questions.  Who am I to argue against these agreements when so many African nations are arguing for and signing up to them?  From reading this documentation, the missing link in the context of the agreement is Nigeria, which is the biggest country we are talking about and which is conspicuous by its absence.  Yesterday, I was attended the Latvian national day celebrations and I called over and had a chat with the Nigerian ambassador.  It may not be appropriate but I told him that we would be debating this issue and asked him if he had any preliminary direction on his country's thinking in respect of it.  He said that it would be favouring it.  If one looks at the documentation, Nigeria is one of the three countries that have not yet signed the agreement.  The other two are Gambia and Mauritania.  The governments of these states do not need me to shout on their behalf but I will make the case for them, especially those in west Africa.  If I have read the documentation correctly, I see that there is an East African Community and Southern African Development Community EPA.  If we imagine Africa as a continent and see that at least two of its big regional power brokers have already negotiated, signed and sealed EPAs with Europe, who are we to dictate to the west African countries that somehow or other we know more than they do about the implications of this?  Therefore, if my interpretation is correct, we are saying that we will not ratify it even though their competitors on the continent of Africa have ratified these two agreements.  </p><p> Where do I get my sense of security?  Many of these documents refer to the role of the International Labour Organisation, ILO, which can and is likely to be consulted.  There are also provisions to protect and uphold workers' rights and environmental standards, which is very important.  It says that the ILO can be brought in to advise on labour rights.  I do not want to sound as though I have swallowed this whole document in one clean swoop but I would appreciate the Minister of State's opinion on these two key issues.  Why has Nigeria not yet signed up?  How can we talk about west Africa without the biggest and most important of all the countries in the region being party to it?  Can the Minister of State confirm that the neighbours on the continent, the Southern African Development Community and the East African Community, have already signed up to these agreements?</p></speech>

I will bring them in now because there could be overlapping questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.571" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/998" speakername="P&aacute;draig MacLochlainn" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOS2015111800002#G00300"><p>I listened to the Minister of State's presentation.  I have read the CONCORD assessment which, as the Minister of State is aware, is the umbrella group of NGOs across Europe working in development aid and assistance.  From reading its paper and listening to the Minister of State's presentation, one would almost think there were two different agreements.</p><p>I must to put a number of issues to the Minister of State.  These agreements operate outside the framework of the WTO.  They go further in terms of liberalisation by including services, investment and procurement alongside goods.  West Africa had been opposed to this.  This goes further in terms of impacting on its ability to protect its key public services from privatisation.  Twelve of the 16 west African countries are in the least developed countries, LDCs.  They would, therefore, have been entitled to trade with Europe under the Everything But Arms system but Europe has opposed this.  It appears that we have a situation where Europe wants to go further than this.  I see the Minister of State nodding his head.  The reality is that the wealthiest economic region in the world is engaging in a trade agreement with one of the poorest economic regions in the world.  We have a situation where it would clearly be better for many of those countries to trade with each other and trade within their regions rather than being in competition with the established stronger global corporations.  Many of these trade agreements are negotiated in Europe against the best interests of civil society in west Africa.  West African farmers have spoken out on their concerns about this matter.  The Minister of State has presented it almost as if it is benign.  Everybody supports the idea of trade between Africa and Ireland and Africa and Europe and we want to turn the investment we have made in development aid to the point where the countries involved will eventually move toward prosperity and trade with the world.  They need to trade with each other and meet their own market needs first, particularly in terms of agriculture.  How can the Minister of State give the presentation he has given today and not be cognisant of the concerns in the report from CONCORD?  One quote that really alarmed me is from G&uuml;nter Nooke, Angela Merkel's adviser on Africa, who is a pretty important person.  He says:</p><blockquote>Part of the German and European taxes are devoted to various development programmes in Africa.  The new economic agreement concluded between the EU and certain African governments will have the effect of cancelling the impact of these programmes.</blockquote> <p>That is a pretty big statement for the individual who is an adviser to Angela Merkel - the most key political leader in Europe on Africa - to make.  The Minister of State is asking us, as parliamentarians, based on a debate in this meeting, to pass this agreement and to put the imprimatur of the Irish people on it.  Our reputation has been a proud one of world leaders in investment in overseas development aid and assistance and the Minister of State is asking us to put it on the line for this agreement without any debate in the D&aacute;il or Seanad on the matter.  He has the ability to remove this motion from a vote.  I assume it will be put before the D&aacute;il tomorrow and I ask the Minister of State to withdraw it and make time for debating it in the D&aacute;il and Seanad and to include the voices of the NGOs that work on the ground, not only those of civil society leaders in Europe.  Every umbrella group of European NGOs working in Africa is deeply opposed to this.  They say that the support of trade with Africa can be achieved without going down the road of these agreements which are outside the framework of the WTO.  They go further than the WTO would want.</p><p>What is the Minister of State's response?  Has he read this document?  Who benefits from the EPA between the EU and west Africa?  Has he read this, as the Minister of State with responsibility in the area?  If he has, what is his rebuttal of the points that are made?  Will he agree to a debate in the D&aacute;il and Seanad on this vitally important issue which puts the reputation of our State and people on the line before we go down the road of this agreement?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.572" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1177" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOS2015111800002#G00400"><p>I am not a member of this committee but I have an interest in this matter and I welcome the debate.  I think trade is good.  We are probably one of the more forward-thinking countries in the world because we have now brought overseas development aid and trade together.  That is an innovative step.  Hopefully, whatever the composition of the Government that enters office after the election, I hope those two sections remain together because it is vitally important.  It is an area that Ireland can have a big say in.  Trade agreements are vital.  They are vital for these developing countries to get access into premium markets in Europe.  No deal is better than a bad deal.  It is not the African countries that are saying that but our own farmers here in Ireland on TTIP, which is another trade agreement in which we are involved.</p><p>Our own farmers and people are saying one thing while Ministers and the European Commission, who are negotiating this, are saying something completely different.  Both groups cannot be right.  The proof of that will be in the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP.  Across Europe there are governance issues in governments and parliaments.  It is the same in Africa and the developing world.  We are relying on the belief that governments will fight for their citizens and get the best deal for them.  That reminds me of a negotiation in the early 1970s, when our Government negotiated with the European Economic Community, EEC, as it was known at the time, on an economic partnership and hung our fisheries industry out to dry.  To this day, Deputy Mac Lochlainn and many of his peers on the western seaboard say that was a fundamental mistake.  When the French Minister for foreign affairs or trade brought it to the French Parliament at the time and a member of that parliament asked about the fishermen in Ireland, he was told that the Irish Government was dealing with it.  We have seen the effects of this.</p><p> It is not the case that individual governments will always focus on the issues and the impacts of policies on the ground.  Our Government told us the price of sugar was going to collapse but now it is called white gold.  The end of our sugar industry was supposed to benefit the developing countries.  The African, Caribbean and Pacific, ACP, countries, through the Everything but Arms agreement, have not had preferential access, and they, along with Irish farmers, have been the big losers in this, as the Minister of State knows better than anyone.  The problem with EPAs is that they are far too focused on EU net exports rather than economic stability in these developing countries.</p><p> I made the point in the D&aacute;il last week that leaders across Europe are wringing their hands about migration from Africa, but in tandem with that the EU is pushing through these trade agreements that are loaded against local farmers.  The EPAs are leading to food insecurity in some of these countries and to conflict, which forces people to migrate from there to Europe.  The EPAs in some cases are pouring fuel on the fire of migration.  We need to take that into account when we consider and negotiate the EPAs, but that has not happened to date. </p><p> In respect of the west African EPA, the Senegalese Minister of Commerce has criticised the lack of effectiveness of the safeguards in the EPAs that should be written into them.  Poultry is not part of this EPA, yet the legs and wings of European chickens are literally being dumped on the West African markets, completely undermining the sector there.  The sector will find it hard to recover from that.  The farmers have moved to the cities where they cannot get jobs.  They see a better life in Europe, and they move to North Africa, get on dinghies and end up being drowned in the Mediterranean.  That is what can happen if the agreements are badly structured.</p><p> The Caribbean EPA is a good example, because it was implemented seven years ago, and we can see whether the EU delivered on its part of the bargain in these negotiations.  One of the issues arising now are the para-tariffs, special levies that are not official import duties but that are a huge source of revenue for these island communities, making up to 15% of government revenue in some of them.  Those Caribbean countries have to eliminate the tariffs by the end of this year.  That will undermine the economic stability of some of them.  Part of this agreement was to do with knowledge transfer.  Members of the European Commission have been coming here for the past few years.  Love them or loathe them, they have been providing advice and assistance to the Government and the public service on how to bring about reform.  That has not happened in these Caribbean countries.  The Commission has not advised them on how to replace these para-tariffs with something else.  Have we as a country worked with some of these countries to explain the Irish experience in bringing in foreign direct investment and using a low corporation tax rate as an incentive to drive economic development?</p><p> Ms Barrett mentioned Haiti.  She is right in that there are particular challenges there, but the EU has not been prepared to provide the type and scale of assistance that Haiti needs to reform its structures.  It is the least developed country in the Caribbean agreement.  If as a community we are not prepared to bend over backwards and facilitate one of the poorest countries in the world, what hope do the four least developed countries in the east African EPA have, or the 12 least developed countries in the west African EPA, or the two poorest countries in the south African EPA?  The European Commission is saying one thing but failing to deliver on it in these bilateral agreements.  It undermines the EU responsible trade policy, which aims to introduce flexibility into these agreements, particularly where there are economic issues at play.  One example is the sanitary and phytosanitary provisions which are standard in these agreements.  It is all well and good to say we will open up trade from these countries into Europe and reduce the tariffs for a certain amount of goods or for all of a particular product, but we are putting up other trade barriers in the way of sanitary and phytosanitary provisions.  As someone from the most rural constituency in the country I know how important it is to have disease protections in place.  I am not talking about that, but in the Caribbean agreement in respect of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, one condition was that the EU would build an airport so that the people could export goods from their islands into the European Union.  The promised investment was delayed, but hopefully by the end of this year the airport will be opened.  The export of flowers to Europe, particularly into the United Kingdom, is a market with huge potential for them, but to do that they must send 200 consignments a year for three years into the EU before they will get a reduction on their inspection charges.  Those inspection charges over the next three years are 400 times the inspection charges of other established export countries into the EU.  They are in effect a barrier.  If for some reason they do not get 200 consignments next year - because the airport will only open, hopefully, next month - that will kick the agreement another year down the road, making it four years before they get approval for reduced inspection fees.  Those inspection fees are a further tariff on export to the European Union.</p><p> Irish farmers have been very critical of how the EU rules are interpreted and implemented, because it is creating additional barriers.  That is the problem with the EPAs and that is the frustration we find in talking to NGOs and organisations working with communities on the ground.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.574" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/979" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOS2015111800002#J00100"><p>With your permission, Chairman, we will reply as a team.  I wish to make a broad point about EU trade policy, to which we subscribe.  I refer members to &quot;Trade for All: Towards a more responsible trade and investment policy&quot;, a document published last month by the European Commission.  It contains a foreword by Cecilia Malmstr&ouml;m, the EU Trade Commissioner.  The new approach &quot;also involves using trade agreements and trade preference programmes as levers to promote, around the world, values like sustainable development human rights, fair and ethical trade and the fight against corruption.  We will use future EU agreements to improve the responsibility of supply chains.&quot;  In terms of seeking to have a debate on the issue, and referring to Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan's point, I agree that there is a need to discuss the wider EU policy implications of trade agreements of this nature in the House and in this committee.  I will do anything I can to facilitate such discussions.  If one is to interpret this forward, there is definitely a shift in the thinking by the Commission on trade policy and I encourage members to engage with that document.</p><p>I am aware of the position of CONCORD in respect of the west African farmers' organisation.  I note that Germany, one of the countries that was mentioned, has signed up to this agreement.  The focus of CONCORD with regard to the west African farmers was on unfair competition from EU agricultural products, fiscal losses, trade diversion towards the EU and the undermining of regional integration.</p><p>On unfair competition from EU agricultural products, west Africa decided internally to exclude almost all agricultural products from liberalisation.  We are confident that if difficulties arise, the agreement also contains robust safeguards which west African countries can use.</p><p>Mary Barrett referred previously to the Irish Aid report which kicked the tyres, as it were, on this.  That was in 2012.  On the issue of fiscal losses, there was a general tendency to over-estimate the direct fiscal losses resulting from an EPA, but it was found that the greatest fiscal impacts were to be expected in west and central Africa.  The report suggested possible strategies to address this.  One was playing with liberalisation schedules in the EPA, second was direct compensation, third was accompanying assistance leading to higher tax collection through economic growth and fourth was using EPAs as a catalyst for wider tax reform to broaden the tax base and increase compliance.  All of these strategies have been accommodated with the agreement with the west African countries, taking sensitivity for revenue purposes into account in their excluded product lists, and the EPA development programme, or PAPED, to deliver assistance in this regard and provision for dialogue on tax reforms and associated support from the European Union.  It was the recognition of potential for fiscal losses to be a bigger issue in west Africa that led to the detailed discussions on the PAPED and the associated commitments outlined in the Council Conclusions in 2010 and 2014.  The European Commission has clearly stated in its latest fact sheet on the EPA that the amount allocated under the PAPED corresponds to the existing needs as estimated by the west African authorities and that the EU will continue helping west Africa throughout the implementation process.  The EU support will continue beyond 2019.</p><p>On trade diversion, which was another point raised by CONCORD, under the agreement west African states have agreed to grant each other at least the same treatment as they are granting the European Union, which speaks to a point made by Deputy Eric Byrne.  This is designed to encourage regional integration and prevent trade diversion by EU products.  On the issue of undermining regional integration, the negotiation of the EPA actively supported integration in west Africa as the 16 countries and two regional organisations define common positions and policies on the issues at stake.  The west African market access offer to the EU is fully aligned with the ECOWAS common external tariff adopted in October 2013 which lays the basis for the ECOWAS customs union.  The implementation of the EPA and the ECOWAS-CET are going hand-in-hand and they will mutually reinforce each other.  Regional integration will be enhanced as the agreement's provisions make customs procedures easier and more efficient.</p><p>Issues were raised regarding the Irish dairy sector, exporting certain types of products and whether those products had been lessened in quality in any way.  That is something on which we need further engagement.  If there are specific and concrete examples of that, we would wish to hear about them.  I am confident, and I speak objectively on this, that there is transparent production from farm to fork with anything we export.  We adhere to the highest standards in that regard and we are bound by EU rules regarding the standards of those products, whether they are exported within the European Union or externally.  The use of the farm to fork motto is something Deputy Smith might have fashioned when he was Minister with responsibility for agriculture.</p><p>My central point is that we must be careful about assertions being made about Irish product going to third countries.  If there is a contention that some of those products are being undermined or devalued in any way to meet export goals and bottom line and profit margins, we must engage further on that.  However, we are absolutely clear in terms of Irish Aid policy and Irish foreign policy.  Irish Aid policy has always been about ensuring that whatever we bring to internal trade negotiations, in terms of an Irish position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>a final EU position, it has been on the basis that the best rules of probity apply and that it is not a paternalistic trade relationship but a relationship of equals.  That is inherent in Irish Aid and in Irish foreign policy.</p><p>Integrating values into EU trade policy also means using trade policy as a lever to promote European values with all parties around the world.  Trade agreements and trade preference programmes can be vehicles to enhance respect for sustainable development human rights, fair and ethical trade and the fight against corruption.  The Commission is saying that it will use future EU agreements to better address those issues.  For example, for the first time the Commission has proposed to include anti-corruption rules in EU free trade agreements.  I hope we will have more time in this committee to debate that policy, &quot;Trade for All: Towards a more responsible trade and investment policy&quot;.</p><p>With regard to TTIP, before engaging on the current Irish farmers' response to TTIP, it is important, with the Chairman's indulgence, to give a technical brief as to the current position of those trade negotiations.</p><p>Sometimes there is a perception that it has been locked down and absolutely concluded but that is not the case.  There are some political points in respect of the concerns of Irish farmers with regard to the TTIP rules.  If I may defer to Ms Benson, she might give a current overview of TTIP.</p></speech>

We just heard that news today.  To give an overview of where we are on TTIP, negotiations commenced in 2013 under the Irish Presidency.  Ireland has a big interest in TTIP because we stand to gain hugely by virtue of the volume of trade we have with the US.  This has been demonstrated in an economic impact study which we conducted and published earlier this year.  The negotiations have reached the 11th round.  It is difficult to know if it is at the half way mark and we have another half to go, or if the glass is half full or half empty, but the negotiations continue apace.  They are heavily detailed and cover many areas and not just market access, including market access for agriculture products.  They also cover, for instance, public procurement rules and regulatory standards, so there is a vast area of work yet to be done.</p> <p>  The council of trade Ministers will be discussing TTIP with the European Commissioner on the 27 November.  Following that meeting, the TTIP statements in December will probably be a good opportunity to have that information on a political level progress report from the Minister in the D&aacute;il.  </p></speech>

I do not think the Minister of State, in his opening statement, claimed that it was.  There is a recognition that the global economic crisis had an impact on implementation.  As I said, trade agreements just provide a framework and there is a recognition that both sides have to work very hard to reap the benefits they can potentially bring.  In saying that, the Caribbean agreement is showing us the way these agreements can work.  The overseeing committees are in place and taking on board the concerns raised by the Caribbean side.  The Caribbean side has brought forward issues about the timing of the tariff lifting and the EU is listening and trying to accept longer phasing and so forth.  The Minister of State addressed some of the points Deputy O'Sullivan raised on CONCORD, west Africa and so forth.  I will, therefore, address the Cuba point.  Cuba is not a signatory of the 2000 Cotonou agreement.  The EPAs flow from the 2000 Cotonou agreement, which gave the mandate for the negotiations agreed by both sides.  This means that Cuba is not party to the EPAs.</p></speech>

It has other issues in it and Cuba would have made the decision not to sign up to it.  That being said, the EU is currently negotiating a bilateral EU-Cuba political dialogue and co-operation agreement and hopes to finish it next year.  That agreement will increase political dialogue and economic relations.  Deputy O'Sullivan also mentioned an EU trade review and EPAs not being included in it.  I will ask Ms Benson to say something about it because she deals with the trade review.</p></speech>

As stated by the Minister of State, the new emphasis in the European trade strategy is on European values, sustainable development and ethical trade supply chains.  It certainly is a new departure in emphasis on the part of the Commission.</p></speech>

She also mentioned regional integration.  The Minister of State addressed that point and noted the provision on the treatment they would give each other.  On the reassurance on Europe's commitments, the commitment to the west African EPA in the Council conclusions in 2010 and 2014 is at the highest level.  The commitment made in 2010 was exceeded.  It was for &euro;6.3 billion but more than &euro;8 billion was given in the heel of the hunt.  We are hoping a similar outcome will arise for the next phase of the EPA development programme, PAPED.</p></speech>

If the five yearly review does not suffice, there is a specific provision in the west Africa agreement that it can be reviewed as issues arise.</p> <p>  Deputy Eric Byrne asked about Nigeria.  The position with Nigeria is that there were elections earlier this year but there has been a big gap between the elections and the appointment of the cabinet.  The cabinet was appointed last week.  In light of the very positive World Bank study last year, which showed the benefits of the EPA, we are very hopeful that Nigeria will be ready to sign now that it has a new cabinet in place.  The committee has received good feedback from the Nigerian ambassador in that regard. </p></speech>

Those have not got to the stage we are at with the west Africa community yet.  Last year, all the negotiations concluded in respect of the west Africa, east Africa and southern Africa communities.  The west Africa community agreement was then quickly put through legal scrubbing and translation.  The EU member states and most of the west African states were ready to sign last December.  The east Africa community and southern Africa development community agreements have been through legal scrubbing, which is where the wording is fine tuned.  The negotiators would have been working late at night so the lawyers on both sides collaborate and agree the final agreements.  That has now been concluded.  It went a bit longer than usual in respect of those two regions but they are now being translated and the next step will be for the EU to bring them to the member states.  We will then proceed to sign and revert to the committee on them in due course.</p></speech>

I heard Deputy McLoughlin's concern on going further than the WTO.  The Caribbean EPA does go further than the WTO because it has extensive sections on services but that is because Caribbean countries wanted those provisions.  They are interested in services such as tourism services.  They are the lifeblood of their countries.  They were, therefore, very keen to move forward on services.  In respect of the west Africa agreement, those countries want more time to go into the area of services, competition and those other elements.</p><p>The west Africa agreement deals only with goods.  The other areas will be discussed in due course.</p><p> Reference was made to the LDCs being entitled to everything but arms, which is the case.  The LDC countries are not obliged to sign up to EPAs but some have opted to do so.  Our key partner country, Sierra Leone, and another partner country, Liberia, have signed up to them.  We are keen to show our willingness to implement these agreements given those countries have signed up to them.  Outside of west Africa, Mozambique wants to move beyond basic trade into the area of services and so it is keen to move forward on those issues.  While some countries want to move forward on issues which go beyond the WTO framework, others do not.  For this reason, there are a few clauses in the EPAs which allow for the countries that are not keen to get involved to be parked and dealt with later.</p><p> Deputy Naughten referred to Senegal.  It has signed up to the agreement.  Irish Aid is attempting to do its bit in respect of sanitary and phyto-sanitary conditions by way of supporting the standards and trade development facility at the WTO.  That facility supports projects in-country.  For example, it assisted in the food flight project to help west African countries deal with such problems.  The EPAs should further efforts in this regard because they include specific sections on sanitary and phyto-sanitary matters to increase European co-operation with the countries in this regard.  Where difficulties are identified in a particular country, the European Union is willing to send veterinary officers to help resolve them.  The EU does not want technical issues to stop trade between countries.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

My concern relates to the countries in respect of which no problem has been identified such as, for example, Saint Vincent, to which 200 consignments must be sent each year for three years despite that it has been shown that it does not have a problem.  The cost involved in that makes it prohibitive to get involved in the trade.  Perhaps some of the EU or Irish overseas development aid could be used to cover the cost of the additional levies until such time as the countries involved - subject to there not being any identified health or disease problems - have open market access.  For a country that has been given a clear bill of health, getting the access is a challenge.</p></speech>

I warmly welcome its president, Mr. Eddie Downey, whom I will ask to introduce his colleagues.  The format of the meeting is that I will invite him to make a brief opening statement lasting approximately five minutes, after which we will have a question and answer session with members.  We find this to be a highly effective approach.  I ask everyone present to switch off his or her mobile phone or set it to airplane mode or another in order that it will not interfere with the recording system.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>I)</i>of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members should be aware that under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/><br/>I ask Mr. Downey to introduce his colleagues and make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I know that members are well aware of the real anxiety among the farming community and rural communities generally about crime in the countryside.  The theft of valuables from rural homes and livestock and machinery from farms is a major concern.  It must be recognised that many farmers and other rural dwellers are living in real fear of their personal safety and that of their families.  That is why it is so important that the issue be addressed as a matter of urgency.<br/><br/>I am joined by Mr. Jer Bergin, national treasurer, who has responsibility within the organisation for dealing with the issue of rural crime and Mr. Colin Connolly who has recently taken up the newly created staff position of rural crime prevention executive.<br/><br/>According to CSO figures, more than 2,500 farm crimes were reported in the first six months of 2014.  They include 1,720 instances of farm machinery being reported as stolen and 218 cases of vehicle theft.  There is also a serious problem with the theft of livestock, with 48 cases reported, including instances of cattle rustling.  There were 280 burglaries or break-ins to farm houses.  We do not have separate figures for burglaries at the homes and businesses of other rural dwellers.  I stress that these are reported figures.  We believe there is considerable under-reporting of rural crime, in particular, the theft of machinery, fuels and other items from farmyards and lesser break-ins to family homes.  <br/><br/>The theft of agricultural equipment and livestock can be financially devastating for farmers who, like all rural dwellers, are very vulnerable when it comes to criminality.  This vulnerability is compounded by geographic and service isolation.  It is the IFA's contention that rural dwellers and farmers are not guaranteed the same level of service and security provided in urban areas.  Many areas have seen the effects of cutbacks and closures of local services, including post offices and other vital institutions, as well as Garda stations and the presence of Garda members.<br/><br/>In response to the concerns of its members, the IFA has taken a lead role in addressing these challenges and we are working with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other agencies to support rural crime prevention.  The IFA has partnered An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in developing the TheftStop crime prevention initiative, a new, practical, simple and cost-effective theft prevention system now available nationwide.  Following successful pilot schemes in counties Tipperary and Donegal last year, the initiative is being rolled out nationwide on a county by county basis.  All rural dwellers are invited to join TheftStop by registering at It has been designed to deter criminals and recover stolen items by ensuring machinery and other equipment are clearly marked with a unique ID, with the details registered on TheftStop's nationwide database.  I thank An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for its co-operation in this initiative and, in particular, assistant commissioner Jack Nolan for his continued commitment.  I encourage all country dwellers, farmers in particular, to become part of the initiative by registering today.<br/><br/>The IFA has welcomed publication of the Sentencing Council Bill 2015 by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  It must lead to longer jail terms for burglars, in particular, for repeat offenders who continue to target family homes and businesses.  The issue of bail also deserves close examination.  There is clearly a serious problem with the level of crime being committed by people released on bail.  Law abiding citizens deserve to be better protected.<br/><br/>The IFA has been campaigning for increased policing hours and the presence of mobile units in rural areas by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to reduce crime and, in general, provide for a safer, more secure rural environment.  I welcome the addition of 200 new vehicles to the Garda fleet and the commitment to continued Garda recruitment.  Last August the IFA launched a policy charter for rural Ireland to support the 440,000 families and businesses in the countryside.  It proposed the following measures to address members&rsquo; concerns about rural security.  The seniors alert scheme which provides financial support for the use of personal pendant alarms by elderly people should be extended to cover the installation of house alarms and there should be full enforcement by local authorities and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of the legislation to curb metal theft.  It was enacted in 2014 and requires all scrap metal dealers to keep proper records and seek proof of identity from those supplying such materials.  A key element of Government support for rural areas is delivery on its commitment to provide a high-quality rural fibre broadband network across the country to support homes and businesses.  <br/><br/>The IFA has taken a lead role in terms of action on rural crime and been proactive in identifying solutions to the problem.  As a clear indication of its commitment we have appointed a rural crime prevention executive, Mr. Connolly, to assist the organisation in this task.  We have established a reward fund of &euro;10,000 with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Crimestoppers to combat livestock theft and developed a community-based text alert initiative in which IFA branch officers play a key role in crime prevention.  Building on our community text service, we are exploring the development, with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, of a full nationwide text alert service that would lead to safer and more secure rural communities.  We are engaging with local communities on the issue of CCTV installation in local villages at locations where it would assist crime prevention and detection.  <br/><br/>The IFA will continue to campaign for support from elected representatives and the Government to protect rural dwellers and businesses.  Today I am looking for further engagement from the committee on the IFA's activities in rural crime prevention, together with its support for the IFA's initiatives in this regard.  We look forward to a constructive discussion with it.</p></speech>

The committee is looking for submissions on electronic tagging and curfews.  If anybody who is listening has comments to make on these issues, he or she is welcome to send them in.  There are different views on how effective electronic tagging is and we would need to have a good look at it before rushing to implement it.  There has been some pilot scheme work done on it.</p> <p>  We had representatives of Muintir na T&iacute;re before us recently in what was a very interesting engagement.  What engagement has the IFA had with that organisation?  I would also like to find out about farmwatch which is active in some parts of the United Kingdom and seems to be quite an interesting and effective approach.</p></speech>

A few years ago the IFA carried out a survey in which one in three respondents said he or she had been the victim of crime in some way.  There was an issue with the recording of crime and a sense that some crimes were not taken seriously.  Other surveys produced similar findings for rural areas, but the official crime statistics gave a very different picture.  What is Mr. Downeys view?</p></speech>

I have attended a number of meetings around the country at which crime officers from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have spoken.  One of them described a farm as a supermarket for thieves because the opportunities for thieves at a farm were endless.  It is as if we invite thieves onto farms.  We need to take action to prevent this from happening.  It is very clear that some people think it is not necessary to report certain crimes and they do not see any value in reporting them.  We have to get the need to report every crime into people's minds because, while a crime on one farm may seem trivial, in combination, they are all serious and reporting them might lead to the detection of a more serious crime later.</p><p>While a crime committed on my farm might seem trivial, the combination and culmination of various crimes might lead to the detection of more serious crimes further on.  I think we need to get that into place.  We cannot expect the system to deal with all of these issues.  People dwelling in rural Ireland need to be part and parcel of the solution.  The IFA believes it has a role in that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.625" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jer Bergin" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015111800002#C00200"><p>Mr. Downey is right when he says that a great deal of low-level crime is not reported.  I refer to diesel theft and that kind of thing.  I will explain why reporting has to be part of the IFA's Theft Stop initiative, which is being rolled out by my colleague, Mr. Connolly.  There are two issues at stake here.  The first is crime prevention and the second is that the Garda is unable to return much of the stolen equipment it recovers to its rightful owners.  There is a need for reporting through official Garda channels, to be followed by uploading, identification and all the rest of it.  This should result in being able to trace owners and return equipment to farmers.  However, this is not something that always happens at present.  I think that is a key issue as well.</p></speech>

The IFA has taken up some very good initiatives in the county.  I refer to the marking of farm machinery, etc.  What level of co-operation exists between the IFA and the Ulster Farmers Union?  Is a joint approach being taken?  We have recently heard language suggesting that a joint task force of the PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is tackling criminality in Border areas.  The issues that need to be addressed include not only diesel laundering and cigarette smuggling but also cattle rustling and the theft of farm machinery.  This type of crime is having an impact on the farming community.  I want to get a sense of the level of all-Ireland co-operation to address crime.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.627" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eddie Downey" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015111800002#C00400"><p>My colleague, Mr. Connolly, might want to come in on this as well.  We have a very good relationship with the Ulster Farmers Union.  I recently spoke at a farm safety conference at which the union was represented.  We are developing links with the union because there is commonality across the Border.  When machinery is stolen from a farm, it is a unique thing.  The number of customers for a piece of machinery might be quite limited.  It is a question of finding out where these things are going, who is receiving them and who is moving them on from there.  I think that is the key part of this.  That is where the marking system that is part of the Theft Stop initiative comes in.  A unique mark on each piece of equipment will make it more traceable.  We are going to work with interested parties in the North.  I have already had discussions with the president of the Ulster Farmers Union on the potential for the roll-out and use in the North of a similar system to our Theft Stop system.  We are looking at how it could work on that basis.</p></speech>

Part of my function with the IFA is to liaise with the Garda in respect of these matters.  Having worked in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I understand the way this needs to work.  It says a lot that the Theft Stop initiative originated in County Donegal as a cross-Border initiative.  At the moment, the Garda is fully engaged with this system and the PSNI is very aware of it.  We can ensure the system works by transcending the Border, bringing it across and getting the North engaged in it.</p></speech>

I want to get a sense of the role played by community alerts and text alerts.  A delegation from Muintir na T&iacute;re, which is a fantastic and important initiative in rural areas, attended a recent meeting of the joint committee.  With regard to joint policing committees, I have concerns about the ability of community organisations and public representatives to engage with senior members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the concerns that exist in a given county.  When the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Policing Authority and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2015 is passed, which should happen soon, the new policing authority will have an important role in policing the joint policing committees.  I would like to get the thoughts of the witnesses on how we can improve those committees, particularly as they pertain to rural areas.</p></speech>

We have great confidence in this robust and good system, which is being well policed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Cattle rustling is creating a real worry for us, however.  The co-operation that is being received North and South to try to stamp this out is an example of how various systems can work well together.  I think we are making major progress in this whole area.</p></speech>

We have almost 950 branches across the country.  Like the GAA, we are in every parish in every county.  Farmers have a unique role to play because they are present in rural areas at times of the day or night when other people are at work or college.  Their local knowledge and skills of observation are used as part of the text alert system, for example.  Reference has been made to Muintir na T&iacute;re.  We are working with the Garda as part of that to get it running better and to spread it out.  We intend that all our branch members will be able to be part of community text alert systems, which are used by people to make reports to the Garda when they see something wrong.  Such reports go to local garda&iacute; and nobody else.  Those garda&iacute; assess the vehicle or whatever it is and make decisions on that basis.  It is a case of using local knowledge to help garda&iacute; to do their jobs.  Our role does not involve replacing garda&iacute; or the resources that need to come to the Garda to police rural Ireland.</p></speech>

Some of the issues I want to raise have already been discussed.  A large theft of livestock in my constituency was devastating for the family involved.  I would like to hear more from the witnesses about what we can do in that regard.  What do they think Members of the Oireachtas should be doing to protect farmers from these crimes?  I am interested in the Theft Stop initiative, which farmers often raise with me.  I am aware that the IFA is encouraging the national roll-out of the initiative, which was rolled out on a pilot basis in counties Tipperary and Donegal.  What was the uptake of the scheme in those counties?  How much success did it achieve?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.641" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colin Connolly" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015111800002#C01800"><p>A pool of 3,450 farmers was used in the trial, which was carried out in counties Donegal and Tipperary and was welcomed by those involved in it.  No item that has been marked as part of the Theft Stop initiative has been stolen since the start of the initiative.  We can stand 100% over that figure.  I think it is a very good figure.  It suggests the strength of the system.  At the moment, we have a county-by-county roll-out plan.  While Theft Stop is available nationwide and any member of the public can log on and use it, we have decided to launch it on a county-by-county basis through our IFA executive meetings.  We carried out our first launch in County Laois the night before last.  Although it is probably too early to quantify the figures for registration and sign-up, it is obvious from the expressions of interest and the national and local media coverage that Theft Stop will be put on a national footing.  The cross-Border links with the PSNI will be invaluable as we try to close down the systems that are used to move machinery and cattle across the Border.  The IFA is associated with tagging.  Essentially, we are now tagging property with a serial number that makes it uniquely identifiable.  When I was a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I encountered the problems that can arise with the repatriation of property.  This is the first time this country will have a database of property that can be used in this way.  This initiative is being initially rolled out to target the theft of farm machinery and other crimes that take place on farms but I do not see why it cannot go out into the wider community.  The Garda deals on a daily basis with the theft of bicycles and other items that are not returned.  A cost is associated with storing this property if it is not located.</p><p>Therefore I think it is definitely a system that can and will be expanded upon.</p></speech>

It is a good idea.  Mr. Connolly spoke about the seniors alert scheme and the wish for support to extend it for installing alarms, but how will that work?  In my constituency, my late father, Lord have mercy on him, used Helplink South which was an alarm he wore on his wrist.  It was very effective for an elderly person.  Is Mr. Connolly suggesting that, similar to that, we would put alarms in houses to counter burglary?  How does he expect that would be rolled out?</p></speech>

I saw one recently with a panic button that was completely tamper-proof.  We need items like that which can give more security to people in the countryside.  The personal pendant has worked very well and is an excellent system, but we need to extend it further to give more security to people.</p></speech>

We are examining the issue of funding.  I acknowledge that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has put seed funding of &euro;50,000 into a text alert group and a community group in our area for cameras.  Those initiatives help us to work with people who want to help themselves.  That is where we are coming from.</p></speech>

Deputy Mac Lochlainn mentioned the soon to be created independent police authority.  As a large organisation, the IFA should seek membership of that authority.  There is currently a call under the Public Appointments Service.  It is open to individuals to seek inclusion in the authority's membership.  I think the IFA would have a constructive and valuable role to play in this regard.</p> <p>  Will the IFA representatives quantify the scale of cattle rustling, including the headage stolen?  Are the cattle brought to unlicensed, unregulated abattoirs or are they sold on?  What is the dispersal method?  I am trying to get a sense of the scale of the problem.  We had some reports of it happening in my constituency in Limerick.  Thankfully, however, the most recent report turned out to be a false alarm.  It was reported in the newspaper that there was a large theft of cattle, but apparently they found their way home the following week.</p></speech>

That was not reported in the press, by the way.  I want to get a sense of it, including the insurance implications.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.649" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eddie Downey" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015111800002#D00800"><p>On the subject of cattle wandering home, there was an alert because a neighbour had lost the header of his combine and thought it was stolen, but it turned out that another neighbour had put it into a shed to keep it dry for him.  There are good neighbours as well.</p> <p>  Forty-eight cases of cattle rustling were reported.  In one case, 100 cattle were stolen in Westmeath.  It is not that the numbers are huge but it is the potential damage this can do to the industry, including the traceability system.  Livestock theft can wipe out individual farm incomes.</p> <p>  The other question was where these animals go.  They do not all go to the one place, so there have to be multiple destinations.  Some of them are finished cattle that can go to certain places, but others are not.  We have to figure out where these are going and what criminals are involved.  Some of those criminals must have knowledge of how to deal with animals because not just anybody can walk into a field, load them and move them on.  There are groups of people involved in this and we need to break that down.</p> <p>  There was no insurance for cattle theft until 18 months or two years ago.  FBD Insurance has stepped into that space now, so insurance is available for farmers.  That is not the way we want to go, however.  We want to get to the stage where cattle theft is not profitable.</p></speech>

Like all insurance, it makes one feel better to have it.  We obviously hope that we will never have to use it.  We would like to get to the stage where we get to the bottom of this and cut it out.</p></speech>

The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI are working together to try to track it down.  In recent weeks, we have seen one conviction in that region of which I am aware.  As I understand it, that was an ongoing investigation for a long time.  As the IFA president said, it is a specialist job and needs targeting by both police forces.  I think it can be rooted out.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Downey know if there is much of that going on?  Is he aware of the level or scale of that?</p></speech>

At least one such case has been found due to the activities of the Garda and the PSNI following up on thefts.  It is positive that we found those but we need to root it out completely at this stage.  Let us not rush in with one piece of evidence.  Let us wait until we have the full picture and then stamp it out completely.</p></speech>

They are going to other jurisdictions, which is a problem.  Does the same problem apply to stolen farm equipment being moved to another jurisdiction in the main or off the island altogether?  I am glad to hear such equipment is being tagged with serial numbers.</p></speech>

Cattle and machinery are moving across the Border.  Unfortunately, however, there is also a market within the country for it.  Members tell me at meetings that if one attends markets at the weekend, one can see in the early hours of the morning that various things, including tools, are available for purchase.  Part of the solution to that is engaging with people, including through the development of a text alert service.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a confidential phone number for information, but a forum where people can communicate their knowledge is also useful.  One must have an in-depth knowledge to be able to carry out cattle rustling and achieve one's aim.  A communications facility, perhaps through the IFA, to the Garda or Crimestoppers and back into the PSNI would be helpful.  We need to encourage people to communicate in that way with us.</p></speech>

The initiatives certainly seem to be working.  I am particularly struck by the fact that not one of the tagged cattle has gone missing.  As regards international best practice, has the IFA looked at other jurisdictions and, if so, are there similar problems there?  I imagine there are, so how have they dealt with them?  Is there anything we could all learn from what is happening internationally?</p></speech>

One of the things we are doing, and which Mr. Connolly will do in his role, is assessing various vehicle-tracking technologies and different types of equipment, seeing what works and what does not.  We are not salespeople for security system companies.  Our responsibility is to our members and to rural communities and putting together policies and packages that will work for them.  The advantage we have over everywhere else is our broad membership base.  We have 90,000 members and 950 branches, which gives us a reach.  Ireland is a small country and if we can use that bit of knowledge, we will do so, through text alerts, reporting to the Garda, uploading information and documenting it, so that garda&iacute; can access it.  We will also work to change policy in terms of encouraging the Legislature to put resources into the Garda.  Some of the recent initiatives are very good in terms of extra resources but we also need, for example, to target the markets that were referred to with a van - there has been some targeting by garda&iacute; early in the morning - and we need to close off the market at the other end as well.</p></speech>

In his new role, Mr. Connolly is going to go across the country, talking to farmers and county executives to get information as to how we can best be defensive in managing ourselves and what measures we can take to make our farms and equipment safer and more secure.  We see working with other groups as key to this process.  We work with Muintir na T&iacute;re and with different groups along the way.  We see the GAA as a major organisation in rural Ireland.  This area of security has to be addressed from that point of view.  As I said already, and maybe I did not get that across the way I wanted to, we do not see this totally as the Garda's problem.  The Garda is part of the solution, as are we, the people who live in the communities, and we have to work together to make best use of the resources, be it the farmers themselves, who are, as Mr. Bergin said, our eyes and ears on the countryside, the GAA, or whoever is out there, all those organisations.  We have to work together and become more security-conscious in what we do.</p></speech>

I really like and affirm the holistic approach the IFA is presenting to us in terms of the issue of rural crime, identifying some of the legislative concerns, the issue of broadband, the ways in which various kinds of partnership are being formed, CCTV installation and so on.  It is great to hear that kind of leadership.  So much of it is about prevention.  Could the witnesses tell us specifically a little more about the rural crime prevention executive, and more generally is it getting enough Government support for that prevention approach?  We have spoken a little about the resource issue.  Is it about more resources?  Surely it is also about new ways of working with the resources the organisation has.  Is it about a bit of both?</p></speech>

Obviously we also have to identify what is working out there and, as Mr. Bergin said, what is working in other jurisdictions and what we can bring back here.  If we find something that works really well, we can see if we can get funding for that.  The evidence about CCTV footage is anecdotal.  The new road structure in this country is wonderful.  I came through the port tunnel this morning and I got here before everybody else, which makes a change.  However, that is also facilitating the reverse of that: criminals moving out into the countryside.  They are using those arteries to get into these areas.  If we had proper CCTV coverage on those roads, we might be able to identify more of these criminals and where they are working.  It is a mix of small things that will give solutions.  We have to build intelligence within the Garda to help us resolve that.  Co-operation with the Garda is essential at all times and the co-operation we have had so far has been excellent.</p></speech>

We have worked through this for two years and came up with a list of recommendations, including a rural crime prevention officer.  It is not about doing something outside the existing structures, it is about trying to add to the existing structures.  That is the unique element of it and that could be rolled out in other areas of industry and so on.</p></speech>

In anything we do, or anything I am involved in developing, I will always look at the cost element of it.  Security should not necessarily come with a cost to a rural dweller, because if we put a cost on it with high-tech security implementation systems, it keeps people outside of it, whereas initiatives like Theft Stop or text alerts are relatively inexpensive to implement.  We are not asking the Government to invest millions in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; we are asking it to invest time and effort and to put garda&iacute; back in rural communities.  If we are putting them back into the area, we are investing in our communities, which is ultimately going to invest in the overall system.  It is a simple basic structure and it is a holistic approach.</p></speech>

Is that similar to Farm Watch in the UK, where people sign up, a little like community alert?  Mr. Connolly said that nothing that was tagged was stolen, which implies there is a way the thieves know those things are tagged so they will not steal them.  Am I right or can the witnesses explain further?</p></speech>

Theft Stop, and Farm Watch in the UK, display an obvious sign, similar to the text alert signs we have across the country, with which people will be familiar.  With Theft Stop, we have a farm gate sign, which is clearly displayed on a person's property to show they are part of the system.  Then there are serial numbers.  One will begin to see obvious serial numbers on trailers and people will start to know what they are very soon.</p></speech>

There is a company in the UK called SmartWater, which operates quite an effective system, whereby it is a unique number.  However, it does come with a cost element to it and there is an end case element.  Ultimately, if something needs to be prosecuted in court, I would always be keeping an eye on the end product.  If we do catch somebody with something, we need to be able to prosecute them.  The system we have in Ireland is quite robust in that regard in its make-up.</p></speech>

That message came from Muintir na T&iacute;re as well, because we have heard people saying from time to time that there in no point in reporting these incidents.  The IFA's message is obviously, in contrast to that, to report everything, no matter how minor, to garda&iacute; so they can build up a picture.  Mr. Downey mentioned in his opening statement that people were living in real fear for their personal safety, and we have seen reports of people going to bed with shotguns and firearms.  We know farmers use firearms for other reasons as well on farms.  Could he comment on the fear of crime?  Muintir na T&iacute;re told us the fear of crime can be more devastating than the crime itself.</p></speech>

What we are seeing in rural areas is the impact of an almost siege mentality.  When an alarm is installed, one will put it on when one is going out or at night, such that one feels one locked in.  This is creating a fear factor.  Electric gates and CCTV cameras are being installed all over the place.  What we want to try to do is to bridge it to some extent by working in conjunction with other organisations to have community involvement to release some of the fear.  It is not just older people, everybody is experiencing genuine fear.  There is nothing as devastating as walking into one's house and seeing it ransacked.</p></speech>

It is a combination of things that will give people a sense of security and a sense that they do not have to live as if they are under siege.  Legislators must be seen to deal with the legal issues and take repeat offenders out of the system.  The simple community systems we are trying to initiate are the way forward.  We should avoid turning Ireland into a prison camp.</p></speech>

The committee did some work on the issue earlier this year.</p></speech>

That is the reason we are trying to get into this space as quickly as we can.  We have not come before the committee because of a reaction to recent media reports; we have been working on this issue for a long time and will continue to work on it as we normally do.  We would be very worried if people were to take the wrong action at particular times.  What is really frustrating for us is that repeat offenders out on bail are committing crimes.  When they are convicted, they receive the same treatment on their 100th crime as on their first.  That is where the problem lies.  There has to be a ratcheting up in order that repeat offenders are dealt with more severely.  Everybody on the ground and the Garda have to make that call.</p></speech>

The other reason is that as I am chairman designate, obviously I do not have too much to say as yet.</p> <p>  I am a retired solicitor now acting in a consultancy capacity with the firm Ensor O' Connor, a firm which was founded by me, but as I have reached the age at which one qualifies for the bus pass, I have stood down to let younger solicitors at it.</p> <p>  I was involved in the Law Society of Ireland for many years when I chaired a number of committees, including the regulatory and education committees.  I was fortunate enough to be president in 2000, in which capacity I chaired the council of the Law Society of Ireland for a full 12 months  I set then on the disciplinary tribunal which would be partly on all fours with the Property Services Appeal Board in the sense that one deals with the same matters.  The statutory limit in serving on the disciplinary tribunal is ten years.</p> <p>  I am honoured to have been asked to become chairperson of the Property Services Appeal Board and I have set out its role.  It is relatively limited in relation to the powers of the regulatory authority which deals with issues on a day to day basis and, of course, has its own board.  Effectively, what happens is that if a party which has to comply with the regulations of the authority feels disgruntled in any manner and wishes to appeal, he or she can appeal on certain grounds to the appeal board.  I have had the opportunity to talk to some of the board members to see exactly what they do in their day to day business.  It is a very strong board.</p><p>Ms Sunniva McDonagh and Mr. James Bridgeman are both barristers, Mr. David McGarry is a chartered accountant, Ms Dorothea Dowling was chairperson of the Personal Injuries Board and Mr. Philip Moynihan was a superintendent in Enniscorthy when I was practising there, so we came across each other.</p><p> The board deals with major issues coming to it from the authority.  On hearing an appeal, it can confirm the authority's decision and state it is happy the authority dealt with the matter properly or remit the matter to the authority for certain directions.  A number of matters have been remitted for reconsideration, the reason being - and this is anecdotal because, of course, I have not sat on the board because I have not yet been fully appointed - the board felt the authority should look at them in more detail.  I have spoken to board members and examined the board's annual report.  Some matters failed, probably because they were outside the jurisdiction of the appeals board.  The appeals board can make determinations and substitute penalties, in other words overrule the authority, by increasing or reducing fines.  The board is somewhat limited in its jurisdiction as set out in the statute.  An appeals board must always have regard to applying natural justice and fair procedures.  This will be my priority.  The authority must do its job and we may be seen to have a more compassionate view, if appropriate.  This is how I see it.</p></speech>

He spoke about natural justice.  We particularly think of the establishment of the position of Ombudsman as a very positive development in Irish democracy in recent decades.  It is important that people have a right to appeal and it is good that the board will be entirely independent.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.700" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Anthony Ensor" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015111800002#G00500"><p>As of yet, it does not have a website.  However, the board has notified me - and because I am not yet chairman I must say this somewhat guardedly - that it feels easy-to-follow guidelines should be set out to make it easier for a person who may want to appeal a decision.  This would be fairer.  I intend to follow up on this once, and if, I become chairman.  This would make it easier.  We must remember the Act setting up the authority and the board is relatively new, dating from 2011, and the clear intention was to relieve the Ombudsman of this particular function.  We see ourselves as doing the same job in a slightly different manner.</p></speech>

I have referred the committee to the board, which is very strong from a personnel point of view.  The people on it have huge experience and this can be seen without singling out anybody.  These people have been working on it for several years.  When they started to operate a number of appeals came through in a bit of a rush but this has now levelled off.  The authority seems to be doing its job very well.  We do not want to be <i>functus officio</i>but, at the same time, it is nice to know that not too many appeals are coming forward.  This suggests people feel they are being dealt with properly by the authority.  I see us as giving the benefit of compassion and fair procedures to people coming through because if they appeal a decision, they may feel that all matters were not considered by the authority.</p></speech>

A number of people in the real estate business informed me recently that the property register is not up to much with regard to entering the price of houses.  It does not detail the number of bedrooms or the style of house.  It might cover the square footage but it does not provide the type of information necessary to protect its integrity.  It should be like booking an airline ticket whereby if one does not have all of the boxes ticked and completed properly, one should not be able to register the price of a property.  Auctioneers and real estate agents and, in particular, valuers find it very frustrating.  This may have nothing whatsoever to do with Mr. Ensor's organisation or it may have a role in an advisory capacity.</p></speech>

However, meetings will be held between the authority and the appeals board and we can certainly discuss with the authority matters which do not come specifically within our jurisdiction and with which we are not entitled to deal.  This would be a matter for the authority.</p></speech>

That goes for colleagues as well, so please ensure all phones are off.</p><p>I will invite groups and individuals to make a statement of approximately five minutes and I ask witnesses to keep to this as many people wish to contribute and we want to finish at a reasonable hour.  There will be a question and answer session with members about points arising and perhaps there will be interaction between different groups as well.  Before beginning, I draw the attention of witnesses to the position regarding privilege.  They should note that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>I)</i>of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of the evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members should also be aware under the salient ruling of the chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p></speech>

I will briefly introduce my colleagues.  I am joined by our senior policy officer, Ms Naomi Feely, and one of our members, Ms Angela Gallagher, whose story was part of our submission to the committee.  Mandatory retirement ages are deeply ageist and that they have been permitted for so long is a reflection of the ageism still publicly acceptable in Ireland.  Whereas some people cannot wait to retire and are very eager to do so, there are others who want to keep working.  There is a large and growing group of workers who realise that with retirement comes a major drop in income and for these people, the longer they can work, the more they can save.  If Deputy Anne Ferris's Bill becomes law, older people who are willing and able to keep working would be able to do so.  It would eliminate the growing problem of older people being forced to retire at 65, or even earlier, with years to go until they can claim the State pension.   Like everyone else, we welcome the continuing fall in the unemployment figures but although there are schemes and programmes to help young people find work, what is there for a forklift driver forced to retire at 55 or the civil servant pushed aside on her 65th birthday?</p> <p>  Older people frequently tell us they feel they are invisible and undervalued.  They see the media refer to them as bed blockers or as a burden on society.  Against this backdrop, one would need to be very determined to go job-hunting as an older worker.  With people retiring today expected to live, on average, for another 20 years or more, we need to have an honest debate about the role of older workers in Irish society, the kind of honest debate that led, four years ago, to the abolition of the default retirement age in Britain.  The abolition of mandatory retirement in Britain was no less challenging, difficult or controversial than it would be  in Ireland but the political will was there, the recognition of the rights of older people was there and the understanding that older workers have something to contribute to their communities and to the economy was there.  It can be done and as the demographics in Ireland change in the coming years, it will be done.  There should be no doubt about this.  Mandatory retirement ages will be abolished in Ireland, so why not now?</p> <p>  I will ask my colleague, Ms Angela Gallagher, to add a few words on her own experience of mandatory retirement.</p></speech>

I appreciate that the issue and its implications for employment law, for pensions policy and for many other areas is very complex.  At the same time, it is also very simple.  People should not be forced out of their jobs because they are a certain age.  If we accept that basic principle, we can overcome the complicated policy issues thrown up by abolishing mandatory retirement.</p> <p>  People like me, who are able to work, willing to do so and capable of doing our jobs effectively should not be forced to retire because of our age.  To me, this is simply ageism; it is discrimination against me and thousands of people in Ireland like me who are deemed expendable.</p><p>In my own case, the frustration of losing my job for no other reason than because I had turned 65 years of age was exacerbated by the financial hardship this policy of mandatory retirement inflicted on me.  I was trying to pay a mortgage to the bank and a loan to the credit union at the same time.  It was very difficult to keep going.  I had to cut right back.  I had to get rid of my telephone, television and anything I could to save money.  I even had to cut back on my medication several times because the cost exceeded the maximum per month under the drugs scheme and I simply could not afford it.  There were weeks and months when I did not know how I was going to pay the bank and when I worried whether I would even be able to keep my home.</p><p> The thing that annoys me most and the reason I am before the committee today is that none of this was necessary.  I wanted to work and I was able to work.  I liked what I was doing and I was good at my job.  If I had not been forced out of my job I would have been able to work until I was secure.  I would have been able to keep contributing to the economy as well.  I urge committee members to recognise what older workers have to offer, in particular, the skills, experience and wisdom we have built up in our careers.  I strongly support the legislation proposed by Deputy Ferris.  I thank the committee members for their attention.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by the vice chairman, Mr. Loughlin Deegan and another member, Ms Deirdre Malone.  The employment inequality committee of the Law Society of Ireland is made up of a number of specialist lawyers in the area of employment and pensions.  In making our submission I am keen to point out and make clear that we are not here to represent the interests of the profession or the interests of employment lawyers generally.  Our submission serves to offer our expertise in so far as any legislation introduced is compliant with developments in EU law and does not contradict any existing provisions of domestic law.</p> <p>  From a legal perspective the context is that the current provision in the Employment Equality Act 1998 permits employers to set a compulsory retirement age.  Certainly, it does not prevent them from setting a compulsory retirement age.  It does not set out any requirement that such compulsory retirement age must be objective.  While that may have been in compliance with the law in 1998, there have been developments at European Court of Justice level in the interim which indicate that setting a retirement age is potentially a type of age discrimination.  However, those cases suggest that in certain circumstances where there are objective justifications, it may be possible to set a retirement age.</p> <p>  We have made submissions relating to Deputy Ferris's Bill and the Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, both of which would ensure Irish law was compliant with developments in law at the Court of Justice of the European Union.  The two Bills are incompatible, however, and could not be introduced together because they are conflicting.  Our role and our submission serves to ensure that any legislation brought in is legally clear and from an operating perspective does not create any conflict with either EU law or any other provision of Irish employment equality law.  My colleague, Ms Deirdre Malone, will comment specifically on the Bill.</p></speech>

We have some comments in respect of the drafting.  There is provision within the Bill for a fixed-term contract to be offered to someone over retirement age.  We are seeking clarity around the drafting, especially in regard to section 6(3)(c) of the 1998 Act and the proposed amendment to section 4 of the 2013 Bill.</p> <p>  Deputy Ferris has drafted the other Bill.  As we have said, we are neutral on which Bill would be enacted since both are compliant with the provisions in the EU directive.  However, I wish to draw the committee's attention to some particular things.  We wish to raise a concern relating to the potential costs.  In particular, the 2014 Bill permits age discrimination and disability discrimination where an employer can demonstrate that treating the person equally would entail significantly increased costs.  Cost alone is not generally an accepted appropriate justification for discrimination.</p> <p>  There is a question over the potential impact on unfair dismissals.  We maintain that the Unfair Dismissals Act permits fair dismissal on the grounds of capability.  We believe that the drafting in its current form may remove an employer's obligation to participate in performance improvement programmes and other managed processes whereby someone could be fairly dismissed.  As currently drafted, the Bill would permit an employer or company to get a report from a doctor to the effect that a person is not fit to do the job.  The ground of capability could be a fair ground to dismiss a person.  Another aspect we highlighted relates to looking to establish whether a person was capable of doing the job.  We take the view that there may be an increased cost to employers where they have to assess employees on a regular basis, for example, on a yearly basis, once they have reached a particular point.</p> <p>  We had concerns on the drafting and around the language used.  For example, reference is made to significantly increased costs.  How could that be shown?  What other evidence would be required?  There should be more clarity around the wording.</p> <p>  There is a potential conflict with section 16 of the 1998 Act dealing with disability and when someone cannot do a job.  This is a new departure in terms of introducing disability on the grounds of age.  The idea is to ensure that both are compatible.</p></speech>

We will move on to the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament.  Ms. Hayes will speak next.  You have colleagues with you.  Is that correct?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.722" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms M&aacute;ir&eacute;ad Hayes" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015111800002#GG00800"><p>My colleagues include Ms Imelda Brown, who is on our executive committee, and Mr. John Walsh, who is the president.  I am the chief executive officer.  The Irish Senior Citizens Parliament welcomes the opportunity to address the committee on this issue, a critical issue for older people.  We thank Deputy Ferris for tabling the Bill.  We urge the committee to take action in the term of this, D&aacute;il, the 31st D&aacute;il.  I thank Senator White, Deputy McFadden and Deputy Se&aacute;n Kenny for attending the hearing.</p> <p>  As the Age Action Ireland representatives have said, the Irish demographic patterns continue to be favourable despite predictions of changes in future.  We reckon that the 2016 census will produce an opportunity to validate these predictions.</p> <p>  The Bill is brief but cleverly worded and simple in its construct.  In September, Senator John Crown introduced the Longer Healthy Living Bill 2015 in the Seanad.  The main focus of the Bill was to allow health professionals to continue to work after normal contract.  Both Bills focus on capability and people being capable.  One of our submissions has said that perhaps all the Bills could be brought together and we could see them in that context.</p> <p>  We welcome the desired intention of the Bill to abolish mandatory retirement ages for people who are able and willing to continue in the role for which they have been employed, as outlined by Deputy Ferris in introducing the Bill.</p><p>The element of choice is critical in respect of how long people wish to continue to work.  The choice for the individual is made on the basis of whether he or she will have sufficient income in retirement.  Some countries allow access to state pensions at an earlier age and also allow people who so desire to continue to contribute for a longer period.  Uncle Sam in the US sometimes is not so good, but workers can get their pensions at 62 there and can continue to work.  That is important. <br/><br/>At least 50% of people are dependent on a State payment in retirement.  Many of them are working on contracts which require them to retire at 65.  I bow to the Law Society in some of these matters.  Since 2014 the effective age for receipt of the State pension has moved to 66 years.  There are people who are retiring at 65 but will not get a State pension until they are 66.  Effective from 2021, which is not that far away, it will be age 67 and from 2028 it will be age 68.  A mechanism must be found which will ensure that if these workers wish to continue to work they are enabled to do so.  Ideally we would seek that on the enactment of the Bill, a new contract<b><i></i></b>would be given to each employee which would substitute the word &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; for &rdquo; 65 years&rdquo;.  To be effective, the Bill must ensure that it is applicable and monitored in both the public and private sectors.  We recognise that there may be some cost involved but it is important this should happen in the beginning.<br/><br/>Many in the private sector do not have occupational pension schemes and are solely dependent on the State pension.  Late joiners to pension schemes and those with interrupted service due to caring or other duties, in both the public and private sectors, will have access only to small occupational pensions and many in this category are women.  We are aware of people who are being forced by their employer to retire at age 65.  They are then offered re-employment at a lower rate and on a new contract.  These women - we have mainly had contact with women - are clearly capable of doing the job but their employers are getting the benefit of their experience at a lower rate.  Their capability is beyond doubt as they are being offered re-employment.<br/><br/>Section 1 as drafted proposes the amendment of section 34 of the Employment Equality Act 1998 by the substitution of subsection (3) and the insertion of new subsection (3).  We have a concern that the proposed amendment to the Act in subsection (3)(a) may not be robust enough to secure and achieve the intent of the Bill in its wording of &quot;an employee who is doing a job for which he or she is employed&quot;.  Our concern is that this qualification may not reflect the evolving nature of some jobs and we would welcome a comment from the drafters in respect of this matter.  The wording presupposes regular engagement with employees in respect of the job for which they are employed.  Our evidence is that this does not happen all the time in a lot of cases.  We would also have a concern that manual workers in particular may be forced to retire early in such circumstances.  Ideally we would wish to allow for a position where provision could be made for those with an acquired disability to be accommodated within the same employment but perhaps on a job for which they were not originally<i></i>employed.  That is one of the areas on which we would like some comment.<br/><br/>Where an occupational pension is part of a package for an employee, there can be conflicting dates with regard to the contract of employment and the so-called contract or promise to pay them a pension.  We have been told on many occasions of difficulties encountered when the deed establishing a trust from which pensions are paid may have a pension payment date which differs from the retirement date.  In some cases it is a requirement that access to a pension can only occur when the person leaves that employment.  If they continue to work they will continue to pay superannuation costs but will accrue no additional benefit.  It is vital that the possible conflicts between trust law and this Bill are fully investigated. <br/><br/>There are three important dates as people approach retirement: the date of the contract between themselves and their employer; the date at which the State pension will be paid; and, if they are in an occupational pension scheme, the matter of whether there is any impact resulting from changes to State pension payments on the amount they will receive from the occupational pension provider.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the Government has published a national positive ageing strategy and we know that, with some amendments, the enactment of this Bill will be seen as a move towards the achievement of positive ageing for all citizens.</p></speech>

I fully support the Employment Equality (Abolition of Mandatory Retirement Age) Bill 2014, sponsored by Deputy Anne Ferris.  I am delighted that my recent submission was selected for inclusion at today&rsquo;s committee hearing stage.  I am employed as a community employment supervisor.  I am 63 years of age and have worked in this position for the past 22 years.  Under current law I must retire in three years at the age of 66.  I will still have two sons in third level education and I know my wife and I will find it very difficult to make ends meet.  Can I afford to have my sons finish college?</p> <p>  Large numbers of people like myself are working today in the community and voluntary sector with no retirement or pension entitlements to alleviate these fears when we reach the State retirement age.  In light of this fact, the Labour Court recommendation LCR 19293 July 2008 stated that &ldquo;an agreed pension scheme should be introduced for community employment scheme supervisors/assistant supervisors and the scheme should be adequately funded by F&Aacute;S as the recognised funding agency&rdquo;.  This recommendation was not honoured by F&Aacute;S or by the Department of Social Protection, which is the current funding body.  As such, many of us face into a poorer and more stressful time in our latter years.  Deputy Ferris&rsquo;s Bill offers us, in these circumstances, an opportunity to remain in continued employment provided that the Department of Social Protection will continue the funding of our positions beyond the age of 66, which it currently fails to do.</p> <p>  An article from Age Action Ireland under the heading "employment and income" states: &ldquo;the Government view access to quality employment opportunities as the best route out of poverty and social exclusion".  Community employment employers - community groups mandated by the State to be incorporated company status - under the auspices of the Department of Social Protection fund and control the day-to-day operating procedures of each and every project throughout the State to such a degree that one wonders who the employer is.  One very important procedural demand made by the Department of Social Protection in respect of today&rsquo;s Bill is that the Department instructs all community and voluntary employers that no funding be given to any employee on reaching the State retirement age of 66.  Employers in this scenario have no choice but to make those workers redundant, as these voluntary groups do not have the financial resources to fund the wages of any staff.</p> <p>  People today are healthier and fitter and thankfully are living longer.  They are therefore much more able to continue working if allowed to do so.  As an individual approaching retirement age, I feel that I should have the right to determine how long I wish to remain in the workplace.  Retirement should not be dictated by the State.  The Global Health and Aging report, in the "Living Longer" section, states: &ldquo;the dramatic increase in average life expectancy during the 20th century ranks as one of society&rsquo;s greatest achievements".  It will be the greatest achievement of this D&aacute;il to pass into law Deputy Anne Ferris's Employment Equality (Abolition of Mandatory retirement Age) Bill 2014.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.726" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. William Quinn" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015111800002#HH00400"><p>I am very grateful for the opportunity to speak on this matter.  My Name is William Quinn.  I am almost 59 years old.  I have 32.5 years of service with Dublin City Council.  I am one of three area supervisors in the waste management services division, which provides cleansing services, with approximately 40 staff, for the north central regional administrative area of Dublin city.  In addition, I deal with divisional attendance management issues and imminent staff pensions.</p><p>It is very important to change the existing legislation on the mandatory retirement age for public servants and other workers for a number of reasons.  When the original legislation was enacted, life expectancy was only a couple of years more than the mandatory retirement age.  That demographic has dramatically changed, and people now live much longer because of better diet, education, housing and medical knowledge.  Many of the experts in this field contend that staying as active as possible is very important for our more mature citizens, and one of the ways of doing that is by continuing to work.  It is inherently unfair to offer the option of staying on after the age 65 or 66 only to those who came into public service after a certain date, namely April 2004, providing they are fit enough to carry out the full range of their duties.  This is an option that should be equally offered to all public sector staff.  Many staff will not want to exercise that option, but it should be available nevertheless.  Otherwise, it appears that they are being penalised because of their age and excluded from a benefit afforded to others.  Due to the major difficulties in the public sector over the last number of years, there has been an embargo on recruitment.  We have lost a lot of very good, talented and experienced staff who have not been replaced.  My own division has lost almost 50% of its staff and, if anything, the city has grown upwards, not outwards, and does business for far longer every day.  This means we are now under pressure to provide more services with far fewer resources.  The recruitment embargo is now slowly starting to lift in some public sector areas, but it will still be some time before the benefits unfold.  Indeed, some sectors may never recover.  It is very important, therefore, to ensure that we have enough mature and experienced people to pass on their vital knowledge to a new generation.</p><p> If the legislation is changed there will not be hordes of people in their 60s holding onto jobs at the expense of school and college leavers.  Many people are very happy to shake off the yoke of work when their mortgage is paid and their children have moved on.  However, it will help to prevent many public sector retirees born from 1956 onwards from having to sign on for jobseeker's benefit and allowances until they qualify for their State contributory old age pension.  At that age, and because of the type of work they do, they would be unlikely to get a new job.  It will help these people to stay healthier for longer because of their active contribution through work and thus they will be at less risk of becoming a burden on the State through long-term ill health.  Furthermore, it will help the beleaguered public sector pension schemes, which were not designed to cope with today&rsquo;s demographics.  If the legislation is not changed then all public servants hired before 2004, if unsuccessful in finding alternative employment when forced to retire, will have to claim State benefits or allowances for between one and three years, depending on their grade, until they qualify for the State contributory old age pension.  That is a horrendous prospect for many of us.  I fully endorse the changes advocated by Deputy Anne Ferris.</p></speech>

I work in retail, have extensive experience and certified skills and am well able to carry out all duties assigned to me.  I feel I am being forced to retire against my will.  I have made a request to my company to continue working until pension age, which for me is 66, but the company is refusing to discuss this issue with me or my union representative, making it clear that the retirement age is 65 years.  There is no retirement age on my contract of employment.  I am sure I will be replaced by someone on a lower wage and with a zero-hour contract.  This represents a cost reduction towards the minimum wage, part of a race to the bottom.</p> <p>  I find it difficult to understand why the Government, when changing the pension age to 66 years, did not introduce legislation allowing people to stay at work until pension age or longer if they so wish.  Why would anybody want to leave a job that he or she is experienced and skilled in after 17 years and have to look for another job?  I find it ludicrous that I will be forced onto jobseeker's allowance against my will when I could, through the transfer of payments, continue to contribute to society.  This will also result in a substantial drop in my income.</p> <p>  Older staff have a major contribution to make, and age is irrelevant.  Many employers recognise the contribution that older, experienced sections of the workforce have to offer.  In the retail sector, Tesco and SuperValu are just two examples of such employers.  The State pension is inadequate, as the recent economic crisis has left many people with substantial debts and in need of money.  Other countries have greater flexibility around keeping older staff in employment.  Retirement should be an option and should not be compulsory.  Forced retirement because of age is discrimination.  I fully support the proposal from Deputy Ferris.</p></speech>

It is unfair that at 60 I will no longer able to work as a servant of the State, despite the investment of large amounts of money by the Prison Service in developing my various skill sets, while elsewhere in the EU members of the prison services can continue to work until they are 67.</p> <p>  In 2005, under the proposal for organisational change in the Irish Prison Service, an annualised hours system for attendance was introduced.  The aim was to eliminate the large amounts of overtime being worked by staff and to improve our work-life balance.  Staff are liable to attend for a certain number of hours over and above their normal 39 hours of work per week.  In my case this was set at 112 hours a year, which works out at an average of two extra hours per week.  In my current role I am responsible for the human resources function for 700 staff in the west Dublin campus.  As a result of my current conditions of service I must retire at 60, while a person in the Irish Prison Service headquarters carrying out a similar function may work until he or she is 65 years old.  The reality is that if I wish to work beyond the age of 60 I will have to look for a job outside the service now, as the chances of getting something at age 60 will be greatly diminished.  There is a provision whereby sanction can be sought from Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to extend service on grounds of public interest, which is covered in Circular 13/752.</p> <p>  The grounds for forcing staff, particularly at the grade of governor, to retire at 60 no longer exist due to the changes in working conditions that I referred to earlier.  Staff in the headquarters of the Irish Prison Service working in a similar role can continue working until they are 67 years old.  There has been no recruitment in the Prison Service for the last ten years but approximately 850 staff are eligible to retire in the next three years, which is roughly one third of the total.  This will result in the loss of a substantial knowledge base.  In contrast to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, there is a provision in the Prison Service whereby sanction can be sought from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, but this is at the discretion of the director of the Irish Prison Service. </p> <p>  To sum up, when a person has reach the required service age for pension entitlement the choice should be with that person as to when he or she retires, and not with the State.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.733" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Meany" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015111800002#JJ00700"><p>I thank the Chairman for giving me an opportunity to speak today.  I also thank Deputy Ferris for introducing this Bill.<br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">  People in Ireland today are living longer.  Life expectancy has been revised upwards and people who have reached retirement age should have the option of remaining in employment.</font>Life expectancy at the average effective retirement age can be as high as 18 to 20 years, about a third longer than it was 30 years ago.  It is projected to increase further, so the retirement period will lengthen unless retirement itself is delayed.  As we can look forward to living longer, we need to rethink what retirement looks like.  As the population dynamics change, there are many potential advantages for all of us, including a stronger economy, higher living standards, less pensioner poverty, reduced spending on benefits, and improved national well-being and inter-generational cohesion.<br/><br/>The obvious solution is to embrace later-life working, helping to realise the potential of older workers who have so much experience and talent to offer.</p><p>This is not about being forced to work on but enabling and encouraging those who want a fuller working life.  Older workers can play a vital role in future growth both for individual businesses and the wider economy overall.  Employers need to adopt age-friendly policies such as flexible working, phased retirement, family care leave and even gap breaks.  This can facilitate a new type of retirement in which people cut down rather than suddenly stop working, where health and well-being policies take account of older workers&rsquo; needs and where employers enable staff to combine work with caring responsibilities.  Managers with the right skills are crucial to supporting older workers successfully.</p><p> Working in retirement offers many benefits.  For example, not only can working delay the onset of age related diseases such as dementia, but keeping mentally and physical active helps one feel younger for longer.  It is generally accepted by most people on reaching retirement age that they would prefer to continue working beyond retirement.  Working also keeps one socially active, preventing isolation and providing a sense of purpose.  Senior citizens who stay in the workforce are much more likely to retain their cognitive ability.  Many senior citizens become isolated after retirement which can have widespread psychological consequences for anyone.  Senior citizens who stay in the workforce are much more likely to stay up to date with technology, since technological changes have an effect on each and every workforce.</p><p> By simply working a few extra years, one can put oneself into a much better financial situation.  Whatever a person&rsquo;s circumstances, working into the second half of one&rsquo;s 60s or beyond offers the prospect of a happier and more financially secure retirement when one finally does retire.  The financial benefit from working is obvious.  One keeps earning income.  This regular income allows one to continue to pay for one&rsquo;s life expenses without needing to turn to one&rsquo;s retirement benefits for necessities.  Workers generally have become healthier and more educated while jobs have become less strenuous.  This means more people are willing and able to work longer.  The definition of retirement has changed.  Rather than retire altogether, many older workers are phasing out of one career and into another.  On reaching 65 years of age, an employee should have the option to continue working.  We must ensure older people&rsquo;s skills do not go to waste.  It is generally accepted by most that on reaching retirement age, they would prefer to continue working beyond retirement.</p></speech>

I invite Dr. Enda Shanahan to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.736" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Enda Shanahan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015111800002#KK00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to speak on the Employment Equality (Abolition of Mandatory Retirement Age) Bill 2014.  I worked in the public hospital sector until I had to retire on reaching the age of 65 years, nearly two years ago.  I did not wish to retire at the time as I was able and willing to continue working.  There was no objective reason for my retirement.  I was still rated fit for purpose by the Medical Council and was physically fit, as demonstrated by being able to run distances from 10 km to the marathon.  Retirement was entirely because of a date in the calendar.</p> <p>  The forced retirement of experienced, able and willing workers is commonplace and represents an enormous waste of human resources.  This is particularly acute in the public health sector where there is an ever-increasing demand driven by increasing numbers of people using services due to population increase, reduced numbers having private health insurance due to increased unemployment and premia, and an increasing number of older people who inevitably require health treatment.  This situation is made worse by the great reduction in staff numbers in recent years and by difficulty in recruiting both doctors and nurses because of the terms and conditions offered by the Health Service Executive, HSE.  As well as the loss of numbers, there has been a disproportionate loss of experienced workers.</p> <p>  If there were no mandatory retirement, many workers would work on which would alleviate skills shortages.  There would also be retention of knowledge and experience built up over many years.  It would be possible to provide mentoring to less experienced workers.  These older workers would continue to contribute to society, both by their work and their taxes, and by either deferring or reducing pension payments, they would reduce demand on pension schemes.</p> <p>  The EU has legislation prohibiting discrimination on age grounds.  However, the wording of the directive allows member states to interpret this more or less as they wish.  The rulings of the Court of Justice of the European Union tend to favour the member states.  There is no doubt that age discrimination is treated far less favourably than other types of discrimination.  The UK recently changed its employment law to ensure there must be appropriate and objective grounds for mandatory retirement.  The United States abolished mandatory retirement in the 1960s and it has continued to have the leading economy in the world.  It must be doing something right.</p> <p>  One of the objections made against retaining older workers is that this would reduce employment prospects for the young, a point touched on by the Minister of State on Second Stage.  This idea is known as the lump of labour fallacy, which has repeatedly been disproved by economists such as the Nobel laureate, Paul Krugman, as well as by exhaustive research performed over many years and covering many countries by such bodies as the National Bureau of Economic Research in the United States and the Institute for the Study of Labor, IZA, in Bonn.  There are multiple publications in peer-reviewed journals which confirm it is a fallacy to suggest retaining older workers interferes with the employment of younger workers.  All the published work on youth unemployment asserts that education, training and motivation are the keys to dealing with it.</p> <p>  It is also alleged that retaining older workers impedes the advancement of younger employees.  In the real world, promotion is based on ability and work performance, not on seniority in an organisation.  It is known that as most workers age, they wish to reduce stress and tend to stand aside from the most challenging types of work.  They also have more interest in having a better work-life balance, a point which they have in common with workers with young children.  The National Health Service, NHS, in the UK is a model for how to retain and value older workers and it is benefiting greatly by this.  All over Europe, businesses are making changes to retain older workers by reducing hours, having flexible working times, working from home, changing benefits, changing workplaces to meet workers&rsquo; needs and ensuring older workers retain skills and feel valued.</p> <p>  Working past 65 years of age will not be for everyone.  Those doing hard manual work, especially outdoors, and those in stressful occupations will probably welcome retirement.  Those who have contracts with specified retirement ages should be allowed to retain these.  However, those who are willing and able to work should be allowed in law to do so.  There should be no age cleansing as a means to get rid of underperforming workers.  There needs to be objective and independent assessment of suitability for work regardless of age.  As someone who regularly runs with people of all ages and as a doctor of 42 years&rsquo; experience, I am aware that chronological age is not the same as biological age.  One size does not fit all.</p> <p>  In Canada, for example, 12,128 physicians aged 65 and over are still working, comprising 15% of all doctors there.  Another 25% of doctors are in the 55 to 64 age group.  Most of them will continue to work after 65 because the Canadians deal with this by having an assessment of fitness to practice.  They use a questionnaire for those who have been in practice for more than 35 years.  If a warning flag is raised, such as in the case of a doctor who has been working for 35 years or more or a doctor who is working solo as a locum with not much contact with others, then there is a further review.  It works well for the Canadians.  Their experience of disasters in the health service is probably better than ours.</p> <p>  Any system for assessing fitness to continue in work should be objective and independent.  Human nature is such that some colleagues may want to work and not to retire because they want to keep something that he or she has.  Self-interest is very good at disguising itself as the public interest.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.738" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony Kenny" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015111800002#LL00200"><p>Go raibh maith agat as an deis thairiscint dom chun aghaidh a thabhairt duit ar an mBille at&aacute; molta anseo inniu.  I thank the joint committee for giving me the opportunity to make my contribution to this important draft legislation.  I am here in a personal capacity.  My interest in the proposed legislation is personal and also has regard to the broader policy implications.  I refer to the article by Professor John FitzGerald in  <i>The Irish Times</i>on 10 November 2015 in which he set out the economic policy argument in support of the proposition in a far better and more trenchant way than I could.<br/><br/>I am 66 years of age and fortunate to be in full-time employment.  If the current situation continues - I see no reason it should not - I will be required to retire when I reach the age of 70 years.  As the committee will have discerned, I work for a progressive employer who takes account of the contribution older employees can make.  Even so, in a few short years I will be surplus to requirements.  My mother worked until she was 73 years old and would have kept going but for the fact that the firm for which she worked closed down.  Many well known people continue to work past normal retirement age, including President Michael D. Higgins and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan.  This suggests the concept of &ldquo;retirement age&rdquo; is a societal construct which draws its legitimacy from our culture rather than from any scientific or biological fact.  If I am able to continue to do my work in a capable manner that meets the expectations of my employer, what relevance does my age have to the decision on when I need to stop working?  Apart from convention, I do not think it has any relevance.<br/><br/>For many working people, men in particular, their job is a vital source of identity and self-worth.  If I am enjoying my work and performing well, why should I be forced to stop simply on age grounds?  Many employees look forward to the opportunities retirement may bring and the Bill will not alter this in any way.  While I may be in a minority in being less enthusiastic about retirement, it is an important equality consideration.  The decision to retire is very personal and age is just one of the factors that should be taken into account.<br/><br/>Regarding the broader policy issue, the dependency ratio has been referred to by many speakers.  It worries policy makers throughout the world.  Professor John FitzGerald has pointed out that the Irish dependency ratio has been trending upwards since 2005.  It seems to be an odd policy choice to require people to become dependent.  For many older people, the State pension system is the only, limited, support they have to sustain a basic standard of living.  Approximately 50% of citizens have no other pension entitlement.  Where continued employment is a possibility, it seems perverse to require a person to depend on the State pension.  Although there is no legislatively defined mandatory retirement age, there are a raft of regulations, contacts of employment and pension schemes that <i>de facto</i>legislate for it.  While youth unemployment is a very significant policy concern, the shorthand connection drawn between the numbers leaving the workforce and the numbers wishing to join it, to which my colleague referred as the &ldquo;lump of labour&rdquo; theory, is very simplistic.<br/><br/>The Minister of State is not opposing the Bill, although he raised questions about how it might impact on employers&rsquo; contractual rights.  It is the proper function of legislation to address this issue and it is the subject of the Bill.  The proposed change would not disadvantage any sensible employer by allowing productive employees to remain working.  While there may be differences of opinion between an employer and an employee about whether the employee is productive, there is a raft of legislation to deal with this issue.  The proposed legislation would remove an important discriminatory barrier for a minority of employees.  In doing so it would add to the progressive transformation of our society, sustained by the Oireachtas, in a small but significant way.  Deputy Anne Ferris is to be commended for taking the lead on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.739" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Margaret Haughton" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015111800002#LL00300"><p>I thank the joint committee for inviting me to discuss the Bill which should be passed to amend the Employment Equality Act 1998 to abolish mandatory retirement ages for those able and willing to continue in the roles in which they were employed.  I will be 65 years old in January 2016 and due to retire, as my contract states.  I am well and healthy and feel I could work for at least another three to five years.  It is an absolute disgrace in this day and age that workers are being forced into retirement against their will when there are so many role models of older citizens working creatively and contributing so much to the economy.</p> <p>  I work as a dental nurse for the HSE.  It makes no sense for a skilled, competent and widely experienced dental nurse to be asked to cease employment based on a mere number on the calendar.  Given my knowledge and experience, my compulsory retirement would be particularly disadvantageous to the service.  The age factor should be removed when considering suitability and necessity for retirement.  The Government has already increased the retirement age in the public sector to 68 years, thereby recognising people's capability to perform their duties competently past the retirement age of 65.  People of sound mind and body should be allowed to work for as long as they choose.  Retirement should be voluntary.  We, therefore, need to remove the age factor.</p> <p>  I fully support Deputy Anne Ferris and hope the Bill will be passed and enshrined in law before my retirement date.  I do not know if that will happen, but it would be great if it did.</p></speech>

The people present have given their personal stories which cannot be easy to do and for which I salute them.  I have been Chairman of the joint committee for almost five years and almost 600 people have given evidence to us on topics including criminal law, insolvency, burglary, prostitution and missing persons.  It goes on and on and we have sent 35 reports to the Government.  The submissions made today have been some of the most powerful, sensible, well thought out and well researched I have heard and I congratulate those who have made them.  While I usually speak last, I have been very moved by them.  From what I have heard, unless I am persuaded otherwise, I will support the proposal.  There are anomalies that could be addressed on Committee Stage and it must be done.  Whether it can be done before the end of the year remains to be seen, as a raft of legislation has backed up.  The delegates have put down a very powerful marker, for which I congratulate them.  Given that it is her Bill, Deputy Anne Ferris will speak first.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.741" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1105" speakername="Anne Ferris" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015111800002#LL00500"><p>I thank the organisations and individuals who have made very powerful presentations on their own stories.  They are very moving and it is a very personal issue for them as they approach retirement age.  I had not realised staff in the Irish Prison Service had to retire at the age of 60 years.  When I introduced the Bill last year, many people contacted me to tell me their stories.  I was delighted when the Bill was chosen.  When one introduces a Private Members' Bill, it is included in a lottery to be given the opportunity to debate in one of the two Friday D&aacute;il sittings per month.</p><p>I was over the moon when my proposal saw the light of day in the D&aacute;il.  That it has now come as far as Committee Stage means it will not die, as do the many Private Members' Bills which do not get a hearing.  Even if it does not get through before Ms Haughton's retirement, it will, I hope, become law during the next D&aacute;il.</p><p> I do not have any questions because the witnesses are preaching to the converted.  I know all of their stories and am aware of the major anomalies that exist in this area.  The delegates from the Law Society raised a number of issues that can and will be teased out.  The Bill was drafted by a senior counsel who is now a judge.  If there is a need for further clarity on certain provisions, it can be achieved on Committee Stage.  The main anomaly under the current regime is that people are being forced to retire at age 65 and, because they cannot claim their pension until age 66, they are obliged to seek jobseeker's benefit and apply for jobs they do not want.  The biggest culprit in this regard seems to be the Health Service Executive.  This is not just a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality.  It is a broader equality issue which the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and others must take on board.  If the pension age is pushed out to 67 or 68 and people are obliged to work until that age, then the whole area of pension provision will have to be reviewed.</p><p> I thank the Chairman for accommodating this debate.  It is not often that a Private Members' Bill proceeds to Committee Stage so quickly after First Reading in the D&aacute;il.  I am obliged to the Chairman and committee staff for their efforts in this regard.  A great deal of work has gone into these proposals and I assure the delegates that I will keep pressing the legislation.  If the good people of Wicklow and east Carlow return me to the D&aacute;il after the election, I will work on it further.</p></speech>

I congratulate her on bringing this legislation forward and I hope it goes well for her.  To clarify, we are not dealing with Committee Stage today.  When Second Stage of the Bill was completed in the D&aacute;il, it was referred to us for public hearings and scrutiny.  The next Stage will be Committee Stage in the select committee, where the Minister and members will have an opportunity to table amendments.  The next Stages will be Report and Final Stages in the D&aacute;il, after which the Bill will be referred to the Seanad.  There are issues and complications that need to be ironed out but the will is there to move the legislation forward.</p></speech>

Subject to clarification on some of the issues raised by Ms Malone, I cannot see why these proposals should not have the full support of members.  I thank all the delegates for attending.  As the Chairman said, the submissions were very powerful, moving and intelligent.  I have an aunt whose age I will not give, because she would kill me if I did, who retired from the HSE in her 60s, although she did not want to.  She opened a business 21 years ago and it is still going strong today, as is my aunt.  She worked in that business for more than 12 years and still has an input into it.  She made the decision to set up on her own because she did not want to retire.  She should not have had to retire because she is a very capable and intelligent person.  She should have been able to continue in her job until she was ready to leave.</p> <p>  Mr. Kenny spoke about the people, men in particular, for whom their job is a source of identity and self-meaning.  That applies to women just as much as men.  I congratulate all the delegates on their submissions and assure them the legislation has my complete support.</p></speech>

The Chairman summed up the importance of proposals like these being brought before the committee.  I apologise to the delegates for not being here in corporeal form but I was watching proceedings on my monitor.  I had another meeting that ran late.  I read most of the submissions and take this opportunity to express my appreciation for the time the witnesses have taken to make their views known.</p> <p>  Like previous speakers, I do not have any specific questions.  I have some personal experience of the issues concerned in that my father was obliged to retire many years ago from the public sector at age 52.  He still had a huge amount to contribute to society and that is what he did, for a further 20 years, by way of voluntary work for several charitable organisations in Malahide and further afield.  The experience he garnered over 30 years in the public service was wasted to the sector when he had to retire due to downsizing.  It was a personal choice he made not to return to paid employment.  If he had been in a position to stay on within the public sector and provide his skills and experience, it would no doubt have been of benefit to those with whom he worked.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the fact that the pension age and retirement age are not aligned.  It is outrageous to force individuals either to sign on or participate in schemes like JobBridge.  Last weekend, at the Pavilions shopping centre in Swords, I met a constituent of mine who I have known for many years.  When I told him he looked well and asked how he was getting on, he informed me that, at 65 years of age, he is doing a JobBridge scheme and that he had no choice in the matter.  It is not appropriate that people who have been out of work because of the economy and who are somewhat discriminated against because of their age should be treated like that.  Such people have a wealth of experience earned over a lifetime of working.  The opportunity, particularly within the health service, to use one's skills and experience to nurture young talent coming through as to best practice and so on is extremely important.</p> <p>  In regard to social isolation, as referred to by the Chairman, that is a very important matter for us to consider in the context of this discussion and, indeed, when the Bill comes to Committee Stage.  Allowing a person who has 30 or 40 years experience working in a particular industry to continue is far preferable to putting them out to pasture.  We must ensure people, particularly in the later stages of their working life, are valued for the important role they can play.</p></speech>

I introduced an Employment Equality (Amendment) Bill in the Seanad in 2012 on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il, which had the same objective.  I brought that Bill to Second Stage but did not push it to a vote in case the Government chose not to support it.  However, the former Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Phil Hogan, who was in attendance, indicated his support for the proposal.</p> <p>  In the past 40 years, the Oireachtas has introduced many progressive legislative measures to ensure people in the workplace are not discriminated against on grounds of gender, race or sexual orientation.</p></speech>

One of the most dramatic moments at my public meeting was a woman, not unlike Ms Gallagher, stating that she had to retire upon her marriage.  She cried.  She was approaching 65 years of age and had to retire again.  I congratulate Ms Gallagher on her statement at this meeting.  I am not allowed to state my reasons but I would like to put on the record the fact that if there was age discrimination in the Oireachtas, Senators Quinn and &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, would not have been able to contribute their experience.  Nor would President Higgins.  I would love to express my reasons that I stated in the Seanad but I will give the killer sentence instead.  The witnesses and those elsewhere who are approaching retirement know the heartbreak and trauma faced by people who go over the cliff's edge of compulsory retirement at 60 or 65 years of age.  I would love to have had the opportunity to say everything but that is the bottom line.  It is a cliff's edge.  Many people's health deteriorates after they have had to retire.  We are not forcing anyone to retire.  If people wish, they should stay on in the job and negotiate the hours that they want to do.  I am fully supportive of this Bill.</p></speech>

I also welcome members' responses and contributions.  I will be brief.  A term that keeps arising as we examine this issue is the concept of &quot;legitimate aim&quot;.  It is mentioned in the Employment Equality (Amendment) Bill 2013.  Under the equality directive, age discrimination is wrong and should not happen unless it enables us to meet a legitimate aim related to employment policy or the labour market.  This raises the quick question of what constitutes a legitimate aim.  In 2007, the European Court of Justice found in Spain that it was legitimate to discriminate against older workers if it allowed younger people to get employment.  In Ireland's Donnellan <i>v</i>. Minister for Justice, a Garda Commissioner was forced out of his job because doing so was seen as facilitating promotion prospects.  There have been similar High Court equality cases.<br/><br/>Something that I admire about Deputy Ferris's legislation is that the two little words &quot;legitimate aim&quot; are not included.  It is not legitimate that older workers should be forced aside to make room for younger ones.  As Mr. Quinn and Dr. Shanahan observed in some detail, there is no research to support that idea.<br/><br/>I thank the committee for inviting me to this meeting and the Chairman for allowing me to speak again.</p></speech>

I commend Deputy Ferris on her work on this legislation and Senator White on her previous work.  It is important that their work be recorded.  I support the legislation.  This is not an issue of equality in society but of common sense.</p> <p>  The Chairman will be delighted to know that I only have two short questions.  I encountered something in the disability sector.  I speak as a former chairman of the Dublin branch of Down Syndrome Ireland.  Has any of the groups present ever encountered a complete breakdown in services for people with intellectual disabilities because people who have worked therein for years have been forced to retire?  A major problem emerged, given the relationship between the older members of staff and adults with intellectual disabilities.  As parents, we encountered this breakdown.  Often, the role of senior citizens who work with adults with intellectual disabilities is not recognised in broader society.</p></speech>

Many experienced people left over a few years.  They used to mentor younger staff.

My aunt died when she was 88 years of age.  She had been looked after by a succession of care workers.  She did not have the same care worker from one week to the next.  It affected quality.  I am sure that the cost was the same but the quality of the service that she received was poor.  That cost does not show up in the books.</p></speech>

A further 15,555 doctors are in the 55 to 64 years age group, equalling 25% of all doctors working.  It is not a problem in Canada because it has a means of assessing.  Quebec has had it since 1970 and the other provinces followed suit.  Canada does not target doctors until they are 70 years of age or older, at which point a questionnaire is taken.  If that raises a red flag, for example, a doctor doing locum work solo or having been 35 years or more in practice, Canada follows up on it.  This approach works.  Does that answer the Deputy's question?</p></speech>

It also found that having older workers continue to work does not reduce the wages of younger workers.  In the European Parliament, the Directorate-General for Internal Policies of the Union produced something similar in April 2013.  The Journal of European Labor Studies, IZA, in Bonn has come up with the same findings.  I have umpteen references on this.</p></speech>

The more older people are employed, the more younger people are employed.  Four of the countries with the top ten employment rates for older people are also in the top ten for the employment of younger people.  I suspect Dr. Shanahan and I have been looking at much the same research.  An OECD report states, "It is important to dispel a number of myths in this area [...] the claim that fewer jobs for older workers results in more jobs for younger workers, though unfounded, is proving especially stubborn".  This proves the Deputy's point; it is a stubborn myth but a myth nonetheless.</p></speech>

I hope it is well-researched, as we say at the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, because I get a lot of people in their 50s coming to my constituency office who say they find it very difficult to get a job as some of the companies they go to say they can get a young man or woman in their 20s for half the price, from a salary point of view.  The over-55s are telling me this.  That seems to contradict what the witnesses are saying about their research.  A private company, in IT, human resources or some other sector, can get a young person in their mid-20s or 30s for half the salary of this older person.  It is an issue.</p></speech>

It goes back to the example I gave of the 64 year old who is not in a position to find employment.  I often find that is cyclical with the economic profile of the country being studied and that was the case in the OECD report Mr. Moran referenced.</p></speech>

I fully support the Bill but its spirit will be devalued if the Department, the way it is operating currently, ceases funding for anyone reaching retirement age.  Even though the Bill could be law tomorrow morning, if the Department does not change its policy in regard to extending funding beyond retirement age, which is 66 this year or next year and 67 in two years' time, it will be of no value to the staff employed in the community and voluntary sector.  Community and voluntary groups do not have the funding to maintain salary and wages without funding from the State.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.795" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms M&aacute;ir&eacute;ad Hayes" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015111800002#OO01100"><p>There are different issues here.  One is about activation of older people.  At the beginning of austerity or the recession, the tendency was not to activate older people.  We are now seeing that trend changing because there are more people employed.  The skills of older people will again be recognised.  We are seeing people in their 60s being activated, which we had not experienced at the beginning.  We would always make the point that the skill sets they bring, as evidenced by the contributions here, are very important.</p> <p>  I wonder whether it is possible to put a question.  I am not sure about the protocol.  Two equality Bills have been brought forward by committees.  There is the longer healthy living Bill and the other equality Bill.  These Bills seek to do the same thing, namely, to allow people to work longer.  This Bill is simple.  That has been mentioned before.  I know groups have been working in this regard because I have participated with some of the people from the law group, particularly Mr. Loughlin Deegan, and have had conversations on this.  Is it within the power of the committee, along with other committees - I know there are different Departments - to push this as an objective before this D&aacute;il finishes?  That is what is important.  There are a lot of things that can be worked around. </p> <p>  What the witness from the community and voluntary sector is saying is that there are so many community and voluntary groups which are going to have to disband, including our one, because they have no funding.  That is a huge issue for people.  It is about the principle.  I am concerned that this would work particularly well for the public sector but not so much for Ms O'Toole's situation as she is in retail and may not have as much power.  It should be a choice for everybody, not just for people in the public sector.  I appreciate the scarcity of skills and that is very important.  We are hopefully moving into a different era now, as 2016 looms.  I would say to the legislators that they should make it an objective to get this through before the end of this D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

I do not distinguish between them.  Age discrimination is just that.  I do not care what the age is.  What the Deputy says is correct.  People who lose their jobs in their 50s have great trouble getting into the workplace because they are considered too old.  That is age discrimination and it should be made illegal.  It is downright wrong and takes no account of the experience or the skills of that person.  The Deputy is right in saying that the companies are probably employing younger workers because they can pay them less and treat them like dirt.  It is not exclusive to what I was saying.  All the research says - there is a lot of it and I can give the references to anybody who wants them because I have a lot of them-----</p></speech>

Part of how we begin to deal with it is to name it.  Age discrimination is still very <i>sotto voce</i>in our society.  It is talked about but in whispers.  I will give a short anecdote.  A friend of mine lost his job at 62.  He sent out 600 applications and got one or two responses.  Somebody told him to take his age off his application and he got eight or ten responses from the next 20 or 30 he sent out.  It is a live issue in our society but we tend not to talk about it.  This Bill sends a powerful message from the Oireachtas and the people of Ireland that this should be an unacceptable practice.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses who came here today.  Senator White alluded earlier to the marriage bar that was brought in to force women out of their jobs when they got married years ago and was subsequently lifted.</p><p>There was a major debate on the lifting of the marriage bar.  The argument was that men would lose their jobs or not get them if married women were allowed to work, but the sky did not fall in.  The lifting of the mandatory retirement age is an issue of equality and concerns getting rid of discrimination at all levels.  The age of 65 years is the new 55 and I am nearer to 65 than to 55.  Believe me, we will do our best to have the legislation coming down the track enacted.  I ask organisations such as the HSE that have people like Margaret Haughton who is due to retire to take another look at the issue of retirement age.  In one year organisations will not have a choice because the legislation will have been enacted.  I plead with them to look with compassion, honesty and equality at what they are doing.</p></speech>

All public sector organisations should look at this issue to see what they could do to retain staff with ability, energy, knowledge, wisdom, skills and experience.  I join members in thanking the delegates for being here as it is very important that we hear the public.  This is not a forum in which members should make speeches but for members of the public to engage and have their views made known to the Oireachtas, the Legislature and Parliament.  That is the reason we invite groups and citizens to come before us because this is the parliament of the people.  They are the bosses, not us.</p></speech>
