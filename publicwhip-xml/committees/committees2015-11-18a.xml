    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015111800002#A00500"><p>I think most people know what the formalities are in respect of the horse and greyhound racing fund.  I will be happy to answer questions from members following my presentation.</p><p> The most recent estimates available suggest the horse and greyhound racing industries underpin over 24,000 jobs and stimulate approximately &euro;1.6 billion in economic output.  The industries receive financial support from the State through the horse and greyhound racing fund under section 12 of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine makes payments from the fund to Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon.  Since 2001 over &euro;963 million has been paid from the fund to the horse and greyhound racing industries in accordance with the provisions of the 2001 Act.  The cumulative upper limit on payments from the fund provided under the relevant regulations has, therefor, been reached.</p><p> The Exchequer funding provided from the fund is pivotal to the survival and continued development of the horse and greyhound racing industries.  In order to give effect to the provisions of budget 2016, the cumulative upper limit must be increased by regulation.  This happens each year.  The Estimates for my Department, as passed by both Houses as part of budget 2016, include an allocation of &euro;74 million for the horse and greyhound racing fund.  This will be distributed in accordance with section 12(6) of the 2001 Act, with 80% or &euro;59.2 million going to Horse Racing Ireland and 20% or &euro;14.8 million going to Bord na gCon.  In order to allow my Department to provide the moneys allocated in budget 2016, it is necessary to comply with the technical requirement under section 12(13) of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act for the cumulative limit on the amount payable from the horse and greyhound racing fund to be increased by &euro;74 million.  This is being achieved by means of the regulations that have been submitted to the committee today.  The aggregate limit on the horse and greyhound racing fund was increased in the same manner in 2004, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014.</p><p> It is estimated that the Irish bloodstock industry provides 14,000 jobs and contributes almost &euro;1.1 billion to the economy.  In 2014 the industry achieved exports of over &euro;220 million to 34 countries.  It is estimated that it accounts for up to 80,000 tourists to Ireland each year, who are among the more than 1 million people who attend horse race meetings in this country each year.  Ireland holds a pre-eminent position in the thoroughbred racing world as the biggest producer of thoroughbred foals in Europe and the fourth largest producer in the world.  Approximately 40% of the EU output of thoroughbreds and 11% of total worldwide output is produced in Ireland.  The horse and greyhound racing fund is a critical part of the dynamic that has shaped the industry.  It has helped Ireland to become a world centre of excellence for horse racing and allowed Horse Racing Ireland to undertake a capital investment programme that has underpinned growth in the sector.  The horse racing industry satisfies all of the critical requirements for success in terms of employment and foreign direct investment.  It is the type of export-orientated industry we need.  It is not an exaggeration to say it has probably done more than any other to enhance Ireland's international reputation in recent times.</p><p> The greyhound racing sector is also an important driver of employment and economic activity in rural and urban areas.  Bord na gCon estimates that the greyhound industry employs over 10,300 people and contributes &euro;500 million in economic output to local economies around tracks which have a wide geographic spread.  Bord na gCon reports that since 2002 over 10 million people have attended greyhound racing meetings.  The board employs over 700 people, including full-time and part-time staff, and has an annual turnover of approximately &euro;40 million.  The funds generated from greyhound racing are reinvested in the industry through contributions to prize money and grants to various bodies involved in the greyhound racing and breeding sector, as well as the promotion of greyhound welfare and the regulation of the industry.  The challenge for the board is to encourage the development of a commercial greyhound racing and breeding industry built on a customer-focused, high quality entertainment product that meets the highest international standards of regulation.  The funding provided for the greyhound racing sector helps to sustain the longstanding tradition of the industry as part of the social fabric of the country.  I refer, in particular, to rural parts of the country.  This funding underpins economic activity in parts of the country that are, in many instances, less affluent and contributes significantly to the improved facilities available at greyhound tracks around Ireland.  Greyhound racing is an activity that is inextricably linked with the farming community.  While it is, undoubtedly, part of the fabric of rural Ireland, it also enjoys a strong urban support base.</p><p> The Government's overall objective is to ensure the horse and greyhound racing industries achieve their maximum potential and contribute to economic and social development.  Governments of all persuasions have acknowledged the importance of the industries and supported them through legislation and policy initiatives over a long period.  Without this support, these vital industries would simply not survive.  The advent of new technologies and business models has challenged the Government to re-evaluate the funding mechanisms for the industry.  As part of its overall commitment to the industry, the Government has addressed through legislation the anomaly that meant remote and online betting operators were outside the tax net.  On 14 April last my colleague, the Minister for Finance, signed a commencement order for the Betting (Amendment) Act 2015.  The Act came into force on 15 April, with some aspects of the new regulatory regime being commenced on 1 August.  The Act brings betting exchanges and Internet and mobile betting providers within the scope of the existing licensing regime and extends the existing 1% turnover tax on land-based bookmakers&rsquo; activities to online and mobile bookmakers.  The Act also means the 15% commission tax on betting exchanges which was initially tabled in 2011 is finally being implemented.  These measures are expected to increase revenues from betting tax by &euro;25 million in a full year.</p><p> Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon have operated through challenging economic conditions for several years.  I have had the activities and operation of both bodies reviewed in that period.  In that context, members will be aware that the Committee Stage debate on the Horse Racing Ireland Bill 2015 will take place the week after next.  The Bill introduces a range of improvements in governance and accountability arrangements, many of which derive from recommendations made by Indecon consultants following its review of the sector.  That Bill has been through a comprehensive process of pre-legislative scrutiny at this committee.  I know that the process involved consultations with a wide range of stakeholders and that officials from my Department provided considerable assistance for the committee in its deliberations.  The Bill will strengthen the Ihorse racing industry, enable it to deal with the existing challenges and, most importantly, maximise its future potential.  I am grateful for the committee&rsquo;s input into the process.  Indecon consultants was commissioned to draw up a report, A Review of Certain Matters Relating to Bord na gCon, which assesses the suitability of the legal, governance and regulatory framework supporting the greyhound industry and identifies opportunities to maximise its commercial income.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, recently appeared before the committee to discuss aspects of the report.  He outlined the Government's commitment to the implementation of its recommendations.  My Department is preparing the heads of a Bill to respond to some of Indecon's recommendations.  I expect the committee to have a significant role to play through the pre-legislative scrutiny process, as was the case with the horse racing legislation.</p><p> I do not wish to understate the challenges facing Horse Racing Ireland and Bord nag Con as they work to grow and develop the horse and greyhound racing industries in an extremely competitive international market.  I am confident that the industries have tremendous growth potential, with sporting, leisure, tourism and cultural appeal across a wide demographic nationally and internationally.  The Government is working hard to put the kind of statutory and policy framework in place that will allow this growth to take place.  I appreciate the contribution the members of the committee have made to the debate on the future of these critically important industries.  I am confident that we share a common objective of maximising the contribution of the sectors to the economy and those working in the industries, many of whom are absolutely passionate about both sectors.  None of this can happen without the critically important contribution made by the horse and greyhound fund.  Copies of the draft regulations have been circulated to members of the committee.</p><p>Section 12(13) of the Horse and Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001 provides that a draft of these regulations be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and a resolution approving the draft be passed by each House before the regulations are made by the Minister.  Accordingly, I ask members for their support so as to ensure that Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon receive the funding provided for in budget 2016 and that the very important role of these industries, and the economic activity generated by them, are sustained into the future.  I commend this regulation to the committee and I look forward to discussing any matters arising.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015111800002#C00200"><p>I will be brief.  A persistent case has been made by the industry that the betting tax should be increased now that the loophole of online betting has been eliminated and that this should be used to develop what should be one of our major industries based on a fantastic natural resource in terms of both land and people.  What is the Minister&rsquo;s view on increasing the betting duty?  I know it is a matter for the Minister for Finance, but no doubt he will consult with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Has the Minister made a case that even though it does not follow directly, they are related?  The Minister himself mentioned the betting tax in his speech.  If the betting tax were raised, we would have more money to develop the industry.</p> <p>  I presume the Minister has a unit within his Department that deals with the equine industry.  How many staff work in the unit?  Is it a stand-alone unit?  How does it compare with similar sections such as the beef or sheep section in terms of staff?  Does the Minister have plans to develop the unit so that we realise the full economic contribution from horses?</p> <p>  I understand at a European level the horse is not considered as an agricultural animal.  It is amazing that tobacco, cotton and wool, which one cannot eat either, are designated as agricultural pursuits.  Would it be an advantage to us if horse-related activity were designated as an agricultural activity at European level?</p> <p>  The Minister is going to give the greyhound industry a lot of money and he is asking us to vote for it.  Is he satisfied, pending legislation, that it has carried out the necessary reforms into its procedures short of legislation before he gives them so much money for the next year?  It is important that we get an audit of where the industry is at the moment in terms of practices before we vote it even more money.  I suggest that before we vote the money through the Minister might come back to us on the issue with a report on the changes that have been brought to bear within the industry that did not require legislation.</p> <p>  The Irish Harness Racing Association was before the committee recently.  It said it was getting less than co-operation from HRI, to which we are also going to vote a lot of money.  We want to talk to HRI about its attitude to harness racing, which is quite a big sport in other places.  My understanding is that harness racing in this country does not get any money from the horse and greyhound racing fund.  We should defer the matter until we get an opportunity to talk to HRI to hear its side of the story, because it is wrong to make a pre-emptive decision.  On the other hand, in view of the very serious issues raised with us by the Irish Harness Racing Association, I do not think we should vote the funding through until we get a full explanation as to why it holds the attitude it is alleged to hold on harness racing.  I specifically say &ldquo;allegedly&rdquo; because we have not heard HRI&rsquo;s side of the story.  I hope the Minister will be agreeable to putting the decision back for a few weeks to allow us to talk to HRI and to get its explanation for its attitude to harness racing, the reason it has refused permission for harness racing to take place, and why it does not get any money from the fund.</p></speech>

I do not know whether it is possible to defer the decision for a number of weeks as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v suggested.  Perhaps the Minister would address the issue when he responds.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015111800002#C00400"><p>I will deal with the matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015111800002#C00500"><p>Since I came to this House in 2002, I have fully recognised the contribution of both horse racing and greyhound racing to rural communities, particularly greyhound racing, which is very prominent in my area.  I have always argued that the share of the pot for greyhound racing was significantly smaller than the allocation to Horse Racing Ireland.  A sum of &euro;963,990,000 &ndash; almost &euro;1 billion - has been allocated since 2001, which is a huge amount of money.  Despite misgivings at times, I have always supported it because of the number of jobs involved and the fund&rsquo;s contribution to the social fabric of communities.  I have been involved for the past 12 months with the Irish Harness Racing Association to get a facility to hold an event.  Eventually, an event was held in Dundalk racecourse.  I speculate that it came about due to the intervention of the Minister.  I hope that is the case.  If what I have heard is accurate, the treatment of harness racing by Horse Racing Ireland and the influence it has brought to bear on privately owned racetracks around the country to prevent harness racing events from taking place is a disgrace, to put it mildly.</p> <p>  I have had sight of a letter outlining a number of reasons for HRI's opposition to harness racing events.  One is a legitimate reason, namely, that it had to be satisfied regarding the health and safety of the animals, particularly in terms of disease control.  Another reason referred to the fact that harness racing is in competition with horse racing.  There is not one cent involved.  I understand an application was made for a small amount of funding prior to the event in Dundalk but the request was not acceded to.  I note that a figure of &euro;52.2 million was allocated to Horse Racing Ireland.  I do not have any problem with the greyhound sector because I know how valuable it is.  Not one cent is being made available for harness racing.  Many would argue that it is a question of status.  I hope that is not the case.  I support the position adopted by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  I cannot vote for the regulation before us.  I have never voted against it on any previous occasion but I cannot vote for it until I have had the opportunity to question Horse Racing Ireland and to challenge it on its intervention to prevent harness racing from taking place.  To do so would be to accept inequality, and I will not go down that road.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1125" speakername="Pat O'Neill" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015111800002#D00100"><p>Deputy Ferris said he could not support this.  Does he consider harness racing to be under HRI?  Harness racing could be under sport horses, for which there is a totally different fund.  We are very proud of our sport horses but have lost a lot of our world status for breeding them, so I ask the Minister to continue to pay attention to that.</p> <p>  I welcome this allocation of funds because in Carlow-Kilkenny we have some of the most successful trainers in Ireland, especially in National Hunt.  It is not about headline tracks like the Curragh or Leopardstown but the point-to-points that take place in every parish around Ireland during the winter and the jobs that the horse and greyhound industries create in rural Ireland.  The &euro;59.2 million for HRI provides 14,000 jobs and the fund of &euro;14.8 million for Bord na gCon creates 10,000 jobs.  Indecon has done a report on both amounts of money, but has there ever been a value-for-money audit by the Department on these funds to determine whether we are getting value for the investment?  Harness racing has a case, but it comes under a completely different fund as HRI is for thoroughbred horses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1063" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015111800002#D00200"><p>I welcome the allocation and I know how important it is.  I will not expand on the views I put forward on Second Stage of the Horse Racing Ireland (Amendment) Bill, as they were very sincerely held.  The level of support I have received for some of the things I said suggests that HRI needs to come down to earth.  It is getting a lot of money from the State, but how much money did it raise on its own?  It is all State money, and that is why I made the pitch for the small tracks and everything else.  I pointed out the 90% versus 30% equation, which is there in black and white.  The Irish Harness Racing Association was before the committee and made a very compelling case, but it would be a huge input.  I agree with Senator O'Neill that the association deals with sport horses, but HRI had an input into it.  Is there an elitism involved here?  Point-to-points are essential across rural Ireland and I have three of them dotted around my area.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1063" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015111800002#D00400"><p>The HRI wants to get its hands on it.  We see that in the Bill.  We want accountability.  The Minister has worked hard on this, but I want to make sure the dead hand of bureaucracy does not stymie an activity that is carried out by volunteers and has been very successful across the country.  That is what I see at Castletown Geoghegan, Doory or anywhere else I go.  The &euro;59.2 million is a great amount of money and the Minster has succeeded, in very difficult times, in securing it.  I know the fight HRI put up for it, but let us ask HRI, under the sport horses head, for a small initial fund for the Irish Harness Racing Association so that it is recognised for its efforts.  It could become a money spinner, as is the case in France, where it is big business.</p> <p>  I got so tied up with two or three points in the last meeting that I forgot to make a very important point.  Again, it is on behalf of the small person.  There are several powerful people across Ireland who can do what they like and come in and out of the country at the drop of a hat, but I am thinking of the little people with two or three mares.  We are one of the few EU countries with a foal levy, and there may be reasons for it, but it is constructed on the advertised value of the stallion.  More often than not, if a stallion is advertised at &euro;10,000 or &euro;15,000, this is negotiated down to &euro;5,000, but HRI then states that the levy is on the advertised value.  It forces the small person to pay a percentage which does not reflect the reality of the deal.  What republic would force its people to do that?  I understand it is for simplicity of administration of the thoroughbred market, but it is not fair at a time when there is very little for the man or woman with two or three mares.  They are trying to get the best breeding, but most have animals worth less than &euro;10,000, and only those at the top have sires between &euro;75,000 and &euro;100,000.</p></speech>

Information is important.  The Minister is here and he is the boss.  Is it intended to go back to market value in the case of the foal levy?  Is it fair that the lower the amount, the more the person has to pay?  The percentage decreases from over 1% down to 0.9%.  A number of people have contacted me on the matter and I am only making the point so that I can support the regulation.  I will only do that on condition that the Minister make a commitment to the Irish Harness Racing Association.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.31" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/949" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015111800002#D01700"><p>I will concentrate on the statutory instrument before us today.  I congratulate the Minister on securing another increase for the horse and greyhound fund, which is absolutely crucial.  It is an investment not in a sport but in an industry which employs an awful lot of people around the country.  I recognise the role of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and note that the increase is being paid for by an increase in income from betting expenditure, with the extension of the betting duty to online and remote betting and to the exchanges.  In time, I would like the betting rate of 1% to increase, because the racing, breeding and greyhound industry never wanted to be in a position in which it was dependent on Exchequer funding, which happened because of the failed policies in the past and, in particular, an inexplicable reduction in the rate of the betting tax at a time when revenue was increasing dramatically.  The cut from 2% to 1% has never been justified.  It was fine when the country was awash with money and the Exchequer could pay directly into the industry, but the industry always knew it would struggle to compete with hospital wards and new schools when tight times came, and that is what happened to this industry.  It was not good for the industry that the horse and greyhound fund was cut during the recession but, over the past four years and five budgets, there has been a real attempt to protect the industry and it has been acknowledged that the previous cuts had a catastrophic impact.</p><p> The increase flagged last year and committed to this year has allowed the industry to begin to invest again in key infrastructure.  I welcome the local infrastructural developments that are to be undertaken in my constituency, including the redevelopment of the Curragh racecourse, the home of the blue riband of flat racing.  If we want to retain the key position we hold worldwide, it is crucial that the Curragh racecourse be redeveloped.  It is an exciting public private project, which incudes investment by both private interests and the State, through Horse Racing Ireland.  I understand the Turf Club will also play an important role in this project.  As I said on Second Stage, I was struck, on the day of the unveiling of the plans for the Curragh racecourse, to hear the spokesperson on behalf of the private investors single out the commitment of the Government to this industry in the past couple of budgets as the reason for their confidence in investing in the Curragh and local industry.  It is important to mention that.  Lest I am accused of looking after the big man only, I am also excited about the plans to develop the racecourses at Punchestown and Naas.  The latter is excellent for National Hunt racing.  This &euro;2.5 million expansion plan is hugely important for the courses and the industry.  As many people are employed in the horse racing, horse breeding and greyhound industries in Kildare as are employed by Intel.  This is key economic activity in rural areas where there are no alternatives.  This industry is every bit as crucial to the small man as it is to the big man.</p><p> In regard to the greyhound industry employing 10,000 people, I have gotten to know the industry a little better during the past year or so through my involvement in part-owning, through a syndicate, a dog.  This is an activity from which I have obtained great fun and I am impressed by the value one can get from it.  From evidence given to the committee, however, I am aware of the concerns of stakeholders in respect of issues relating to the industry.  I have also read the Indecon report.  I look forward to working with the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, as he seeks, by way of implementation of the Indecon recommendations, to improve the structures into the future.</p><p> I, too, am concerned about the division within the industry from the stakeholders point of view, about which we have heard from different representatives.  There are many different representative groups in this area.  If owners and breeders in the racing industry do not get themselves organised, there will always be conflict.  It is important the eight or nine different organisation in this area work together.  I wish to put on record that I am opposed to any deferral today of a decision on this matter.  This is too important.  There are too many jobs on the line.  This is a key industry.  Side issues, such as harness racing and so on, can be dealt with on another day.  I do not think we should be playing politics with this issue today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.33" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1169" speakername="Mary Ann O'Brien" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015111800002#E00200"><p>I will be brief.  I thank the Minister for attending.  I welcome the increase in the fund.  On the elitist conversation, I was at Goffs this morning and on Monday morning.  It is no more elitist than Billy the Bear.  On Monday, we sold a foal for my parents, who are in their nineties, for &euro;4,500.  The man who has worked for us for 30 years sold a National Hunt horse that won a bumper that he had built up with a local man in point-to-points for &euro;140,000.  That is like a lottery win for him.  The fun and camaraderie around that is great.  Returning to Goffs, the people there are not elitist.  They are ordinary people from Carlow, Kilkenny, Tipperary, Cork, Wexford, Limerick, Clare, Kerry, Mullingar, Meath, Laois and Galway.  That is where all my friends come from and they are not elitist.  As the Minister said it is not an exaggeration to say that this industry has probably done more than any other to enhance Ireland's reputation in recent times.  I admit there are a few individuals who happen to be geniuses and who have made us the most famous country in the world in which to breed racehorses but there are also many ordinary people like me involved.  We are supporting rural Ireland.  </p> <p>  I take the point regarding the excellent presentation by the Irish Harness Racing Association but we need to hear the response to that from the thoroughbred industry and from Horse Racing Ireland.  The tillage, dairy and beef sectors are very different.  Harness racing is about as far away from horse racing as one can imagine.  It is difficult to explain that.  They do not belong in the same conversation.</p> <p>  I am interested in hearing further from the Minister about the betting tax.  I would like to see the industry pay for itself such that it does not have to dip into Exchequer funds.  I would also welcome an update from the Minister on the Irish Equine Centre and how we can make certain it is continuously funded so that we become best in class in the world.  I welcome the Bill.  The Minister will be aware that I am a great fan of An Bord Bia.  I know he wants to see HRI as a value-for-money organisation that is transparent and world class in terms of operation.  Even though those of us here have confidence in how the vast amounts of money being provided in this area will be spent, I welcome the Minister's plans and vision for the future of HRI.</p></speech>

On harness racing, I have much sympathy for the case made by the Irish Harness Racing Association.  I have met its representatives and I did ask that harness racers be facilitated in Dundalk and they were.  The Irish Harness Racing Association is an affiliate of Horse Sport Ireland rather than Horse Racing Ireland.  The demands on funding in the sports horse sector are huge yet it gets only a tiny percentage of the funding provided to the racing sector.  We provided &euro;200,000 last year for the Jumping in the City initiative, which was one of the biggest new initiatives in the sports horse sector in terms of show jumping which was awarded the innovation of the year in the sports industry awards.  That &euro;200,000 was a huge amount of extra funding for that sector.  I am happy to have the conversation around the harness racing sector.  I want to help it and get horses off the public roads and onto appropriate tracks.  We need properly regulated and safe areas where competitive events can be held.  I know the industry wants that too.  That is what they have asked for and that is what we have to try to facilitate.  I am not going to have a allow a situation whereby a gun will be held to the head of Horse Racing Ireland in terms of it not being granted any money until such time as it agrees to provide a certain amount of that funding to the harness racing sector.  I think that would be hugely unfair to the sports horse sector.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.40" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015111800002#E00900"><p>It is also unfair for it to apply pressure to have a request for a racetrack refused.  That is the nub of the problem.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.41" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015111800002#E01000"><p>We need to understand what lies behind this.  The racing industry is a hugely valuable one.  Racetracks run important events.  There needs to be a conversation between the harness sector and horse racing sector so that each understands that tracks can be used without damage being caused to the turf or the surface.  I have asked Horse Racing Ireland to have that conversation with the harness sector.  Access to the Dundalk track has been provided since I made that request.  I think that things are changing for the better - and quite quickly - for the harness race sector.  We have never had a race meet at a track like Dundalk.  It happened this year.  I want to encourage that more and I will do so.  It would be unfair for me to force HRI to allocate funds to the harness sector when there are lots of competing demands in the sports and racing sectors for available resources.  Members should by all means invite Horse Racing Ireland and Horse Sport Ireland to appear before the committee to discuss funding and how we support and regulate the harness racing sector.  I will be very supportive of that, as will my Department.</p><p>It is an issue that should not hold up the legislation, on foot of which expenditure of millions of euro is planned.  It needs to be spent if we are to achieve a series of results in the horse racing industry.  People can make their own decisions on that.</p><p> This has nothing to do with elitism.  I am happy to have this conversation.  I have had it and we want more interaction between Horse Sport Ireland, Horse Racing Ireland and the Irish Harness Racing Association.  I am not happy to see races take place on public roads.  There have been accidents on public roads and many associated welfare issues have arisen.  We need a proper, regulated, controlled sector.  To be fair, that is what the Irish Harness Racing Association wants to create.  We will help it to do that.  This matter may be linked to the issue in hand but it should not hold up the vote today.  I appeal to members not to delay it.</p><p> On elitism, I am not quite sure what people are suggesting.  To suggest we have some kind of elitist policy on racing in Ireland would be very unfair.  If one asks the small trainers what they want to be prioritised through funding, they all say they want more prize money.  That is what has been provided in recent years.  If one asks dog breeders and trainers what they want, the vast majority say they want more prize money.  They have said this to me.  Everybody dreams of winning the big prize.  In point-to-point races, flat racing or jump racing, we need good facilities and decent prize money.  We need a supportive budget and proper transparency in terms of how money is spent and raised, including, for example, through the foal levy.</p><p> I take Deputy Penrose's point on that levy.  There is an ongoing debate on how it should be raised.  I am happy to discuss it with the Deputy.  The means of raising the revenue will not be prescribed in the legislation.  We are trying to have a fair foal levy that is easy to implement.  We want a reasonable chunk of money coming in so we can fund the equine centre.  I have allocated more money for the centre next year because it needs more money.  This allocation is not from the foal levy revenue.  I made it very clear to Horse Racing Ireland that I want to see more prioritisation of the equine centre.  The centre is doing a phenomenal job but it is in a facility that is like a 1980s primary school.  There is technology in the corridors of a very old building.  The researchers are doing a really good job there.  We need to support them and upgrade the facilities.  We are going to do so.  Next door, there is a fantastic facility that is being funded by the private sector through voluntary funds.  The equine centre has a really important role to play.  Some of its money needs to come from a foal levy.  We need to have a fair way of allocating the money.  Many people have suggested the levy should be raised based on the value of the foal at a later stage.  However, many foals are not sold so that would not be possible.  This conversation is not as simple as some people might believe.  I will happily have the conversation and we will talk to Horse Racing Ireland about it.</p><p> For the first time, we will have stable staff recommended for the board of Horse Racing Ireland, yet people are suggesting we are somehow elitist.  We are trying to change racing in Ireland to ensure everybody has a say, whether they are associated with small racecourses as opposed to big ones or whether they are stable staff by comparison with the most wealthy horse owners in the country.  All will be in the same board of Horse Racing Ireland.</p><p> Nobody is changing anything in terms of how point-to-point meetings operate.  The local hunt clubs and the National Hunt committee will decide where and when they should be held.  Well over &euro;1 million of public money is going towards point-to-point racing.  It is horse racing and it comes under the Bill.  The only change we are making is that when registering a hunter, one must go through a central registry office operated by Horse Racing Ireland.  The money that would have gone to the Turf Club or the Irish National Hunt committee automatically goes back to it.  We are trying to create a central portal through which money comes in and out so we will have a clear understanding of what is being spent and raised.  That is not unreasonable in these times given the need for transparency.</p><p> On the points Deputy Ferris has been making on the greyhound industry, I am impatient in my desire for reform.  Indecon points to a series of changes that need to take place.  That process of change is well under way.  The Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, was here recently, for four or five hours, to discuss the detail on the greyhound industry, which I believe he understands very well.  He is involved in it and knows many people involved.  We are changing the greyhound sector in terms of board appointments and financing.  There are some debt problems associated with Bord na gCon of which, I believe, people are aware.  Some difficult decisions have to be taken on this to try to get Bord na gCon and the racing industry on a stable platform again.  We want to see an increase in prize money.  If one does not increase prize money in the greyhound industry, there will be no excitement about and growth in the breeding and owning of dogs.  Therefore, we have signalled to Bord na gCon that a consequence of the increased funding this year should be an increase in prize money to try to bring positivity back to the sector.  There has been much division within the greyhound sector and we are trying to heal that and move forward while learning lessons.</p><p> I have answered most of the questions on the Irish Harness Racing Association and Dundalk.  On the questions raised by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v on betting tax, we should increase betting tax.  I have argued that point.  To be fair to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, he told me we should concentrate on getting the structure right first so we can actually start generating a revenue stream from online betting.  Many other countries have really struggled with this.  This was a much more difficult thing to do than some believe.  Getting online betting platforms and exchanges that are international to agree to giving to the State 1% of their turnover from bets coming from Ireland and managing that required considerable co-operation with the industry.  The Minister for Finance was very sensible in saying we should get the structure working first and only when it is working - it is only this year that it is working for the first time - should we consider the rates.  That is the point we are now at.  If I am lucky enough to be the Minister with responsibility for this area next year, I will make no apologies for advocating an increase in the rate.  I do not believe there should be a dramatic jump because the industry needs to adjust but I would like to see the betting levies increased for both online and offline bookmakers.  I do not want to start giving exact figures on that but those who know my views on this area know the kinds of figures I would like to see.</p><p> Let me respond to the question on how many staff in my Department work in the equine industry.  If I were asked the same question on beef or dairy farming, I would probably give the same answer.  We have expertise in the Department that applies across multiple sectors whether it is a question of breeding programmes, genomics, welfare or various schemes.  There is knowledge in different areas and it applies to different sectors at different times.  For example, we have done a huge amount of work on horse welfare over recent years.  It is the welfare element of our Department that has been working on that but it also works on cattle, sheep and dogs in terms of the welfare legislation.  This means that owners of horses now have to have their animals microchipped and must have passports for them.  They must have an equine-registered premises or they are breaking the law and their animals can be seized.  I find it difficult to give the Deputy an exact answer to the question, although it is perfectly reasonable because the equine industry is a big priority area.  As it happens, the person in the Department in charge of advising me on the thoroughbred sector and horses is also in charge of beef and dairy advice at senior Assistant Secretary level.  I am sure he has been before the committee on a number of occasions.</p><p> On the agricultural classification of horses, the breeding of horses is deemed agriculture.  One can use breeding horses to increase one's stocking rate to qualify for certain schemes.  If one has a horse that is not being used for breeding, it may not be used for this purpose.  That is the distinction.</p><p>I know how strongly people feel about harness racing.  As I want to be helpful, I will certainly ask HRI to be helpful and come before the committee to talk about it.  However, I also think the committee should hear from Horse Sport Ireland which is an affiliate of Horse Racing Ireland.  When it hears about the funding demands of Horse Sport Ireland, it might realise there are a lot of competing demands for funding in the equine sector.  It is not simply about racing which is to receive nearly &euro;60 million next year in the context of the thoroughbred sector; harness racing should also receive a slice of the funding.  The sports horse sector is worth &euro;800 million and involves about 200,000 people when one takes account of all of the volunteers involved.  Horse Sport Ireland is also asking for money and a slice of the pie.</p></speech>

The Deputy should not forget that there are multiple disciplines, including ponies, eventing, showjumping and dressage.  There are other demands to be met, including Connemara ponies in the west to putting Olympic teams together.  We have been increasing funding for the sports horse sector which deserves a very significant increase, but I cannot do all of it in my Department.  To be fair to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, it cannot do it overnight either.  I would, however, like to see the sector receive a very significant increase in funding because, as in the case of racing, it is an industry as well as a sport.  Let us do one thing at a time.  This is a fund for the racing industry for thoroughbred horses and the greyhound sector.  I would really like to get the committee's approval in order that we can move ahead and start to plan for the expenditure next year.</p></speech>

I suggest to members that we put it on the agenda for discussion next week and invite the other relevant bodies such as Horse Sport Ireland and HRI to discuss the matter further and tease it out to see where we should go.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.47" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015111800002#G00500"><p>I agree with and welcome a lot of what the Minister said, particularly about looking at a foal levy, etc.  I agree with him completely that horse industry is a fantastic one.  As members of the committee know, I have been concerned to ensure all horses are looked at, including those in urban areas, and that account be taken of the Traveller community's affinity with horses.</p> <p>  I welcome what the Minister said about the betting tax which in the long term is the key to solving many of the problems.  I would like to see all activities funded from the one fund.  If more money was raised through the betting tax, some of it should go towards dealing with the issue of gambling, to which I have an aversion.  While I might want to raise the betting tax, I have a particular aversion to gambling because I know of the damage it can do.  However, it is going to happen.  The issue has been the subject of ongoing discussions at the committee to which we invite all participants in the industry.  It was great to hear from county managers and representatives of the ISPCA on one day, with representatives of the thoroughbred industry, in order that we looked at the very high and very low ends of the industry in a seamless way.  In the future the one fund should be used to fund the development of the industry, from top to bottom, including the export sector.  That is, as the Minister rightly pointed out, a matter for another day and it will require dramatic changes in how we conduct our business.  </p> <p>  I still have a problem in the case of harness racing.  There are two issues, the first of which is that it is looking for a small amount of money, while the second is access to tracks.  On that very narrow issue, I would like us to invite representatives of HRI to give us its side of the story.  I doubt if any of the money being allocated to HRI will be spent this side of Christmas.  Perhaps the Minister might confirm that this is the case.  In other words, I presume this is the fund to be spent next year and that, therefore, there is no overriding imperative preventing us from following procedure.  On the narrow issue of harness racing, rather than the wider issue of reform of the industry, about which the Minister has spoken eloquently, in which he has shown a great interest and about which he has shown great flexibility, I would prefer the vote to be deferred until we have heard from HRI.  When we have heard from it, I imagine it would not take more than ten minutes to agree to it.</p></speech>

The conversation got off to a slow start, but it is now developing and we should give it an opportunity to develop further, rather than put HRI under pressure and say we will not give it any money until it does X, Y and Z for the harness racing industry.  I can speak to HRI.  The chairman rang me about this issue and asked whether I wanted it to look at it with an open mind.  He said that if that was the case, it would do so.  To be fair, that is what happened in Dundalk.  The job of HRI is to protect the horse racing industry, primarily the thoroughbred sector.  Of course, it would be cautious about another sport using venues it was funding.  We are in the early stages of that conversation, but I think HRI will look at the issue with an open mind to see how it can be helpful in developing the sector, but I do not think the way to do it is to force the matter by withholding money.</p></speech>

I have not even seen the harness racing industry's application for funding.  There are many other demands for funding in the equine sector.  I am not saying "Yes" or "No" to the harness racing sector.  All I am saying is we are at the start of a process in trying to regularise harness racing in Ireland, which is an issue from a welfare point of view as much as from a sporting point of view, and we all know this.  I have said very bluntly to the people in the sector, some of whom come from my county and they are great people, that we want to try to create what has been created in countries such as France, which has a proper regulated industry where horses and yards are inspected with a licensing program and many other measures to ensure this is not just a loose arrangement whereby people turn up and race at big venues without having the proper infrastructure behind it.  I want to work with the industry to do this.  The Department will do this and HRI will be helpful, but it is not its job to manage it unless we change the legislation in this regard.</p> <p>  There is no mention of harness racing in the new horse racing legislation we will introduce.  People are trying to remove the mention of point-to-points from the legislation because they do not want it to be considered as horse racing, even though they want to take more than &euro;1 million through Horse Racing Ireland each year for point-to-points.  All I am doing is asking for a proper discussion on the issue.  I will be helpful, as will the Department, but I not want to create a mini-crisis in the horse and greyhound fund around this issue.  If we delay approval of this because we must solve a problem with the harness racing industry, we will create an unnecessary focus linked to the fund, which is a separate issue.</p></speech>

I am as anxious as other people to develop a proper, regulated and supported harness racing industry in Ireland, but this cannot be done in a couple of hours by the committee next week, with approval of the horse and greyhound fund hanging over us.  The committee needs to bring before it Horse Racing Ireland, Horse Sport Ireland and the Department with regard to welfare issues, and then, working with me because I will support it, come up with a model to put in place a proper regulatory framework, which may need legislation, whether primary or secondary, to bed in and protect the industry.  Let us look then at how we fund it, whether through Horse Sport Ireland or Horse Racing Ireland or another mechanism.  One could argue that either the Department with responsibility for sport or the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine should fund it.  Holding to ransom the thoroughbred racing industry is unfair.</p></speech>

This is ongoing, and I understand the intention is to produce a report before the election, depending on when it is, in the same way as we have produced many good reports under the chairmanship of Deputy Andrew Doyle.  This process is ongoing and it is the big scene issue.  We are doing it in a methodical and systematic way.  However, this issue has arisen in the meantime.

I am interested in Horse Racing Ireland coming before the committee because it refused permission to use its tracks.  I would like to hear the reason for this refusal.  The tracks do not belong to Horse Sport Ireland so it is irrelevant because it had no part in the refusal.  Before I am asked to vote on this, I would like to hear what it has to say.  I counted yesterday that the best case scenario is we have 16 weeks until the election is over, and that is if the D&aacute;il goes until 11 March, which I think it might.</p></speech>

If we are satisfied, we will all agree and we will all vote it through and there will be no division.  It would not take five minutes for the Minister of State.  The Department has five Ministers of State so that when the Minister is tied up with other business, he can send in one of them to do business on his behalf.  It is perfectly possible.  I suggest that rather than have a division, which would be very unusual for this committee, we defer a decision on this to next Tuesday.</p></speech>

We should have a more honest discussion about this.  Many people are trying to get their heads around what harness racing as an industry might look like in Ireland.  We are at the early stages of this conversation.  We need to reassure people rather than trying to bully them into something.  The greyhound industry has nothing at all to do with this, although one could argue harness racing could be held at greyhound tracks.  I do not know.  I do not know the technicalities of the size of the track.  This is a sector and industry we need to move from streets and beaches into proper, regulated and managed facilities.  We need to do this over time.  I do not think we should delay what is a separate ask, namely, the horse and greyhound fund, before we do so.  I hope we do not have a vote today, but if we must have a vote on this, I must give the industry the certainty.</p></speech>

We are here today to pass a very important increase in funding to the industry.  Let us deal with any other issues aside, as the committee always has done, and invite people to come before it.  I do not see the link.  I came here today to pass this and I would like us to make a decision on it today.</p></speech>

The issues are not connected and we have got into a long conversation.  We all agree we want to have good meaningful debate about harness racing and, as the Minister said, it is in its early stages.  I am not quite sure why are we sitting here playing ping-pong and holding the meeting to ransom.</p></speech>

We are not.  Every year since I became a member of the committee I have voted &euro;1 billion to Horse Racing Ireland and the greyhound board.  I have serious reservations about this because people are sleeping on the streets, people are hungry and there are children in the State with disabilities.</p><p>That is why I am challenging this today.  The track in Dundalk was offering the facility to harness racing and Horse Racing Ireland deliberately interfered, stopped it and threatened to pull funding and its meetings from that track if it went down that road.  If the Minister is prepared to accept that, that is fine.  I am not.</p></speech>

This committee's right, separate from the Minister, is also to engage.  Two Deputies are suggesting that because Horse Racing Ireland is getting this money, before we vote this money through, we as a committee - nothing to do with the Minister - invite representatives of Horse Racing Ireland to appear before the committee on Tuesday morning to explain their attitude to us - not to the Minister - on why it took the Minister to change their minds.  In the afternoon as part of our meeting, if the Minister of State attends, it will take only five minutes because our debate will not be with the Minister or the Minister of State.</p> <p>  We know where the Minister stands and we congratulate him on that.  This will be taken as a motion without debate in the D&aacute;il on Tuesday afternoon.  There is no technical problem with this.  I do not know why we have wasted so much time this morning when all the committee needs to do is invite representatives of Horse Racing Ireland to appear before the committee on Tuesday morning, have our chat with them and then, in the afternoon, the Minister of State attends, we bless the thing in five minutes and we move on.</p></speech>

The purpose of the meeting is to discuss special needs provision in second level education.  The joint committee is examining the wider area of special needs in education and will publish a report on the matter, for which Senator Mary Moran has been appointed rapporteur.  I welcome, from the Special Needs Parents' Association, SNPA, Ms Lorraine Dempsey and Ms Teresa Maher; from the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, NAPD, Mr. Clive Byrne and Mr. Paul Byrne; and from the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, Ms Mary Byrne and Mr. S&eacute; Goulding.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give this committee.

Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of a long-standing parliamentary practice or ruling of the Chair to the effect that Members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or any official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>It has been decided for a number of reasons to take as read the presentations provided.  The opening statements will be published on the joint committee's website after the meeting.  We will proceed immediately to questions and witnesses may refer to parts of their presentations if they consider them relevant.</p></speech>

Special needs provision in education has been transformed in the past ten years.  The perception, which I appreciate is not always correct, is that much more progress has been made at primary level than at second level.  As a politician who deals with parents, I have the impression that parents find it much more difficult to access resources at second level.  A common challenge they face is that the role of principal in a large school is very different from the role of principal in a small primary school.  For this reason, parents feel much more secure approaching the principal of a primary school to have issues addressed.  This is not always practical in the case of a large secondary school.</p> <p>  The joint committee is interested in hearing the views of the witnesses on two pinch points, the first of which is the transition from primary to secondary school.  Continuity needs to be ensured in this regard and I ask the witnesses to outline their experiences in this regard and make any suggestions they may have for improving policy in this area.  The second area is the question as to whether secondary education is lagging behind primary education in special needs provision and, if so, the reasons for this.  I would also welcome suggestions on changes in policy that could be made to improve the position.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.128" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Teresa Maher" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015111800002#C00400"><p>Transition is a major difficulty for children and their families.  Where a child falls within a family can also be either a help or hindrance.  In the case of a first child, for example, because it will be the first experience of second level education, it can be much more daunting for parents than when the child is the third or fourth sibling to enter the same school.  Very little work is being done on the transition from primary to secondary school for children with special needs.  There is little enough work being done on the transition for mainstream students.  Primary school pupils can filter into three, four or five different secondary schools when they leave sixth class.  One issue that can help is the concept of an education passport where a specific selection of information would be written down and certain questions would be asked, such as how a child's needs could be addressed in certain circumstances and what circumstances would make life very difficult for the child.  It would be very helpful if a standardised passport could be developed. </p> <p>  A one-size-fits-all approach is not the answer to special educational needs and children with difference.  This makes the issue most challenging for school principals.  For example, a school may have had one deaf pupil in the past and then believes it knows everything about deafness.  However, the needs of the next 16 deaf or hard-of-hearing children will be totally different.  Comorbidity of disabilities, an issue of which I have personal experience because my son is deaf and has Down's syndrome, becomes even more challenging because the child does not fit neatly into the mould of deaf or the mould of having Down's syndrome.  It is difficult to work out whether special classes will support the child's overall needs or speak to one specific part of the child's needs.  That is my starting position.</p></speech>

As such, students who have access to supports at primary level will continue to have such access at second level.  To illustrate this point, we had approximately 1,500 applications in this year's application cycle from the second level sector.  In addition, for students who cannot access or have their needs met in a mainstream setting, we have increased the number of special classes in mainstream schools.  This year, the number increased from 205 classes nationwide to 254 classes, a rise of almost 25%.</p> <p>  We recognise that an increasing number of students making the transition from primary to post-primary education expect to be educated in their local community and we are making every effort to ensure this can take place.</p></speech>

The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, is to publish guidelines shortly - they are at the final stage of preparation - on the transition from primary to post-primary for parents and schools.  The NCSE is aware from our various consultations that there is very good practice in place on the transition of students in certain areas and in certain schools.  We want to share what we know to be good practice and to make it available more widely.  We know the kind of things that make a difference, including some already mentioned by Ms Teresa Maher.  We consider it to be really important that schools and parents understand the need to plan well in advance.  It is not enough to do this in sixth class, as one must be thinking about this long before the child reaches that point.  One must think about the kind of supports the child will need in post-primary education, and some of these supports take time - for example, being obliged to adapt a school building.  Similarly, making sure the resource supports and so on are available as soon as the child transfers also takes time.  Consequently, we will be advocating for schools to plan well in advance and we intend to give guidance to parents and to schools about what information needs to be exchanged and how that information will be used in a post-primary school.  We will put forward the idea of parents perhaps being given the opportunity to share what they know about how their children learn in primary school - for example, by bringing a little communication passport with them.  The NCSE will raise the importance of having open days and things like that.  In addition, some students with special educational needs will need more assistance in deciding on what subjects to be taught.  These guidelines are in preparation and hopefully will be of some assistance in this transition.</p></speech>

One thing I have found is that students with special educational needs probably are making the transition better than some students without those needs.  I am speaking from the perspective of a practitioner who still is in school working at the job.  When a student with special needs comes in, I see where the communication between the primary and secondary schools is at a much higher level to prepare for that student's arrival.  We also consider it to be very important that such students, the special needs assistants who are with the students and any other people who are supporting them at primary school come to make their first visit as such students approach the end of their primary school career.  We make a couple of visits during the summer in order that the student can become familiar with the school.</p> <p>  As for general transition from primary to secondary school, every secondary school must have a good transition programme.  I was involved, in my school, with the National Behaviour Support Service, NBSS, approximately five years ago and we developed a transition programme.  We also have employed an educational psychologist who works with us in making sure that programme is correct.  However, it is not just about the initial transition.  When the students have been in the school for a couple of weeks, we must undertake what we call a settling-in programme.  We use a system of mentoring in which we use fifth-year students who are associated with a certain group of first years.  We then follow that on with a big brother/big sister programme.  That happens in the school in which I work, and such good practice must be spread to each school in the country.  I am not really sure how to do that, but our organisation is very interested in spreading best practice like that and will do so through the conferences and seminars that we hold throughout the year.</p> <p>  To address the second part of the Deputy's question - that is, what are the problems we are experiencing - I could go on at length on that.  However, the main thing is that for a successful special educational needs, SEN, system in the school, one must have a person who is suitably qualified in SEN to co-ordinate the work being done in the school.  Without that, it will be piecemeal.  Areas with which we have difficulty include students coming from primary school with unidentified mild learning disabilities.  Sometimes one may find they are not identified until, quite possibly, late into second year.  We carry out testing when the pupils enter school, and I note that we ceased using one test because it was not giving us the results we were expecting.  It was still missing out in respect of some students.  We find the best method of identification is when the teachers are teaching the students.  If the teachers are aware of indicators of different special educational needs and they bring them to the SEN co-ordinator, then we can work out how best to deal with or help the students.</p> <p>  Another point is that sometimes for students who are identified with special educational needs the school puts in place something that will operate on a continuous basis.  If matters were left at that, without assessing how effective the system is for these students, one would be doing the students a disservice.  One system we use is the performance of a six-week review, whereby the allocation of resources is maintained for a six-week period before assessing whether it has worked.  Sometimes, in certain subject areas - because we aim for as full integration as possible - we realise that after six weeks some students have benefited hugely in certain subject areas but may need more work in other subject areas, and we adjust the programme thereafter.  Again, this is an example of good practice and it must be spread, but the key to that is that we have reduced a teacher's timetable load sufficiently to enable that teacher to co-ordinate this approach.  It is a fluid approach that is extremely labour-intensive.  In addition, I believe every teacher in the school should be trained in SEN.  They must be able to identify and to put in place strategies to help get the best outcomes for the students concerned.  Hopefully, this goes some way towards informing the joint committee on the information it seeks.</p></speech>

There are a few matters on which I seek their comments.  I will direct this question at the NCSE in the main.  I am interested in finding out what sort of lessons it expects to get from the new pilot model that has been established and in which I understand 20 schools are taking part.  A key concern schools have expressed regarding the change proposed by the 2014 report of the working group chaired by Eamon Stack is that it may mean some schools will end up with fewer resources while other schools will have more.  If the overall number remains the same but the method of distributing the resources is different, then if some gain, others may lose.  Nevertheless, there will be no change of resources for the schools that are taking part in the pilot model.  Consequently, I am interested in ascertaining what will be the key lessons from this pilot.  I am sure some will be valuable.  In addition, how can the main concern raised, which pertains to the subsequent changing of resources, be allayed by a pilot model that does not include those types of change?</p> <p>  While primary and secondary schools have been discussed, I seek the comments of the three sets of witnesses on the post-secondary school situation.  I acknowledge that this is not necessarily something the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, NAPD, would deal with directly but, that said, there is now a massive gap there.  Positive progress has been seen over the past ten or 15 years in mainstreaming children with special educational needs at primary and secondary levels.  This has been a positive experience and development for those with special educational needs.  At present, however, once such people turn 18 and leave the secondary school environment in which they were with their peers and were given additional assistance required to support them, in many cases no follow-on service is available that is appropriate to their needs.  Many such people attend day-care facilities from the age of 18, where they are with people of all age groups.  From my experience, the training and experience there is in no way representative of or similar to the type of life experience they have had through their teenage years.  This is traumatic for the children concerned and is highly traumatic for their parents.  There is a big gap in our system in this regard.  I would be interested in hearing the witnesses' feedback on this matter.</p> <p>  As for the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, the NAPD in particular referred to how one might get two to three assessments for a school of 600 students.  The representatives of the NAPD should flesh out this point in further detail and outline how that is having an impact.  In addition, I welcome any comments witnesses may have on the capacity planning for special autism units attached to schools.</p><p>I have come across several cases where there is no capacity.  There is an excessive demand but we do not seem to be trying to build it into the system and future planning, so that it is available for students when they require it.</p><p> The witnesses might also comment on part-time students.  I heard of a primary school which was taking a student for 2.5 hours a day because the child had behavioural issues.  How does that work and what type of supports should be put in place to enable schools to do that?  Can they decide to take a student for only a small part of the day rather than full-time?</p></speech>

The chairperson designate for the National Council for Special Education will be here next week, so there will be an opportunity then to pursue those issues.  Members should keep their focus on second level.  If some of the questions feed into second level issues, the witnesses might briefly return to them.  We do not want to get into too broad a discussion.</p></speech>

It is good to see Ms Maher again.  I know what a strong advocate she is and the excellent work she does.  Mr. Byrne is on the same wavelength as me and I commend what he said.  I have many years&rsquo; experience of teaching too.  Mr. Byrne hit the nail on the head when he said that the teachers need to be suitably qualified.  Since becoming a Member of the Seanad, I have been saying that we need to expand our programme for teaching children with special educational needs, SEN.  I know there have been some advances but everybody in a mainstream school should be suitably qualified in SEN.  In particular, those who teach in special schools should have special qualifications.  My experience, anecdotal and personal, is that people who have good intentions need to be suitably qualified to teach in this area.  I say that as a teacher with no SEN qualifications but as a mother.  I could teach so much better when I understood the children.  That is what is needed to be a very good proactive teacher.</p> <p>  The reference to the transition programme with the educational psychologist is a fantastic idea.  I wish to God it was available everywhere.  Who paid for that educational psychologist?  Did the school have to raise funds?  How did it get around reducing the teacher&rsquo;s timetable in respect of funding?  </p> <p>  In County Louth, where I am from, there are nine special classes at national school level for children with special educational needs but there is only one second level school for those children in the county.  There are huge anomalies.  A child cannot be taken from one situation and put into another.</p> <p>  It came to my attention recently that a special needs assistant, SNA, in the classroom refused to take the child to the toilet or was told not to do that.  Since starting this study, I have encountered many different roles for the SNA and would like clarification on the role.  Is it the SNA&rsquo;s job to do that?  My impression was that the SNA was to look after the child&rsquo;s hygiene and personal needs.  The continuing professional development, CPD, courses should be rolled out everywhere.  They are not compulsory but how many people take them?</p> <p>  Speaking again as the mother of an 18 year old, who finishes school next June, I am petrified about what will be there for him.  He is not because I do not think he understands.  A group has come in to talk to the children about taking them on a visit here or there.  I have made inquiries about what is available, which is very limited.  However, many parents, who have absolutely no idea, are sailing along.  There has been no preparation for these children to leave school at the age of 18.  They should be prepared as they progress through secondary school for life after they reach 18.  My son turned 18 two weeks ago and suddenly went from child services to adult services.  I was told he had to stop physiotherapy because that is not available in the adult services.  I said he was still the same child on the Monday he was on the previous Friday but his birthday fell on the Saturday.  The continuity of services is hopeless.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.136" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/984" speakername="Jonathan O'Brien" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015111800002#E00400"><p>In respect of the guidelines on transition due to be published, one of my bugbears with guidelines is that some schools will implement them very well and some will not.  We have seen that with guidelines issued in respect of bullying and mental health problems, some schools are excellent and some are not so good.  When guidelines are published, there must be some oversight of how they are implemented.  The witnesses might tell me who will be responsible for that.  Will it be the teachers, the principals, the boards of management or will the NCSE have some role?</p> <p>  I know a child who has dyslexia, dyscalculia, dysgraphia, dyspraxia, Asperger's syndrome and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD.  He is aged nine and the assistive technology he uses has totally transformed his educational potential.  He feels confident and part of the class.  He does a lot of his work on an iPad.  There are many apps that will highlight words and read them back.  One of our concerns is that when he moves to post-primary school and sits State examinations, there is no guarantee that he will get a reader or a scribe for those examinations, even though he started using assistive technology in third class, on the recommendation of the psychologist in consultation with the parents, the student, the principal and teachers in his primary school.  Those parents face the dilemma that when he gets to that stage, he may not qualify for a scribe and a reader.  That is a huge worry for them.</p><p>It transforms the way he is learning and improves his educational outputs before he gets to a State examination.  I am sure we have all had people make representations where they have been refused access to a scribe or reader, despite having one in the lead-up to a State examination.  That area needs to be given more priority.</p><p> The idea of a passport system is excellent and I have advocated it for a long time.  We should get students for transition in fourth and fifth classes and not just sixth classes.  In larger urban areas we also have the difficulty of the choice of schools that can be accessed.  The Louth case is one example but we have schools in Cork city that do not have special classrooms and the schools that have them are over-subscribed.  There seems to be no planning between primary and post-primary schools.  In a primary school setting, we know how many children with special educational needs are in a particular locality and so why are we not looking at the post-primary setting in the same locality.  We should know that in five years there will be X amount of students coming into the post-primary system and we need to put in places the resources now rather than leaving it until a student is transitioning from sixth class, only to find that he or she cannot access the services or resources because they are not in place.  That does not make sense.</p><p> Resources should follow the student and it should not be a case that when a student reaches sixth class, the resources available at primary school end for that person and he or she must go through a process of applying all over again for what will probably be the same level of resources at post-primary level.  We should be moving to a system where the resources transition with the student.  One of the difficulties with many children in special educational needs is that they need to build a relationship with teachers and special needs assistants but the relationship stops at the end of primary school.  They have to rebuild the relationships again at post-primary level, which can be very difficult and detrimental to a child's educational outcome.  These are some of the ideas we should consider.</p></speech>

I have seen the agenda for the conferences, along with some of the work and training being done.  I compliment the delegation on embracing the area of special educational needs.</p> <p>  Special educational needs is such a broad term that it covers every sort of disability under the sun.  In itself, that causes a problem.  In further education - my former career - we would have seen parents trying to hide the fact that their child had special educational needs coming through the system, with half a year lost by the time they get into system.  This goes back to Deputy O'Brien's comments about a passport.  I would almost argue that the passport should bring the special educational needs child with it, moving from one sector to the next.  At least there would be a continuity and security of dealing with the same person all the time.  That concerns me.</p> <p>  Like my colleague, Senator Moran, I am anxious to know how the educational psychologists would be financed, as it seems like a brilliant idea.  It is a pity we do not have it in every school.  The witnesses spoke about a special educational needs trained co-ordinator but will this be a teacher or assistant principal, for example?  Does it refer to a line of promotional posts available to special educational needs operatives in a school?  I am interested in how this would be done.</p> <p>  I know how inventive principals have to be from time to time with regard to reduced timetables.  The less said about that, the better, as how they manage to do things is sometimes better left unsaid.  The transfer from second level to further education is of concern and there is little enough in the guidance area.  It strikes me that a guidance person with the special educational needs co-ordinator is required in the step-up to further education, with all parties working together.  Sadly, that does not happen in many cases.  With regard to assisting technology, Mr. Byrne knows that when we see students moving from second level to higher education, the technology can take six months to catch up with the student, and by then almost an entire year is lost.  We discussed readers and scribes a couple of weeks ago.  A parent may be reluctant to bring information at the outset of a transition from primary to second level or from second level to further education so people may not be aware of a problem.  Sometimes, the issue arises so late it can be in an exam period.  If that arises, we default to what is best for the student, even if that means we give a scribe and reader to somebody who really does not need it.  I am interested in the view of the delegation on that.</p> <p>  I do not want to get into how the timetables are managed as that is an issue for the principals in schools.  If they are inventive with that, I congratulate them on that.  With regard to the training programmes laid on by the NAPD, we have education conferences every year for the trade unions but we know they are about industrial relations, although there is some degree of education.  I would love to see an approach where all our baggage could be left outside the door of an education conference.  I know the Education and Training Boards of Ireland is doing something this coming week but I would like to see something more in the area.</p></speech>

In certain cases of middle and profound intellectual disability, have we created a kind of rod for our own back by integration?  I say that with all the quality in the world.  I came from a background of education and as an educationalist - I came to the Seanad as one - but I wonder about this.  There is a move from first to second to third level.  It is all very well a nephew of mine is profoundly handicapped as we know the path, which is good and qualitative but very limited.  The lives become a little more blurred sometimes with what Senator Moran described.  There is a sameness.  One day we are trying to be the same but the next we are trying to be different.  Sometimes we do not know what we are trying to be.  We are all trying to be a qualitative human being.  I know this is a philosophical educational question but do the witnesses wonder about what we have done that could have been done better?  Sometimes people are not allowed speak about integration because there is the idea that it is in some way educationally prejudicial, which I am not at all.  It is a question we need to ask as the fall is huge.  I do not know what people around the table think but I am asking the philosophical question.</p></speech>

I support the integration and mainstreaming of children, moving children with special needs into mainstream education.</p><p>Anecdotally, I am aware of some people who put their children into mainstream primary school but then when it comes to second level they move them to special needs.  Is that a big phenomenon?  If so, what is going on?  Does it signify something along the lines of what Senator O'Donnell has said?</p></speech>

It was said by a parent of a special needs child.  She said that the only disability that her child had was the disability that the State imposes.  That is a relevant point because sometimes the lack of resources compounds the disability rather than addressing the child's ability.  Perhaps that feeds into the question.</p></speech>

I fully agree that we constantly have to review and ask whether we are on the right path.  I am the parent of a moderate to severely IQ disabled son who has Down's syndrome and is profoundly deaf.  His first language is Irish Sign Language.  From our family perspective and Killian's perspective, going to mainstream secondary school was the making of his life.  Killian had a chequered history through school but we ended up in Ashbourne Community School to see how it would work.  Killian's first lesson on his first day in school was that he could not take out his mobile telephone.  His second lesson on his first day in school was that he could not rat on the other students who took out their mobile telephones.  In answering this question we should ask what education is and what it is about.  Why on earth would we limit the potential, aspiration or expectations of any human being?</p> <p>  It is true that Killian sat his leaving certificate.  He became famous and got 485,000 hits on his Facebook page because he was the first student who had Down's syndrome - a moderate intellectual disability - and who was deaf to sit and pass a State examination.  He got his leaving certificate applied course.  It was not by accident.  It was down to remarkably hard work and belief in the people around him as well as a belief that it was not about the certificate but the process and the things he would learn for life along the way.  My view on education for anyone is best represented by asking, "Why not?" and that we should see what people can get from it.</p></speech>

When Killian was going to school, he was not the same as his peers.  He knew it and we knew it.  It is rough.  I will read out something I got from Facebook.  This is what equal is: for those who are tall, they get a small box to stand on; for those who are middling, they get a middling box to stand on; and for those who are quite short, they get an incredibly large box to stand on.  That is part of the idea of it not being a matter of one size fitting all.  Would mainstream secondary education suit every child who is profoundly deaf with an intellectual disability and Down's syndrome?  The answer is "No".  However, for those who it does suit, please leave the doors open and give them every support they need.</p></speech>

I did not mean that.  I was simply asking the question for those who might not be suitable.  Perhaps it is a parental matter.  I have seen where parents insist on sending the child to mainstream secondary school, which does not serve many people's needs whether they have intellectual disability.  It may not serve them subject-wise, talent-wise, passion-wise or interest-wise.  That was the question I was asking and Ms Maher answered it well.</p></speech>

Thanks to Google we can get far more information than 20 years ago.  When a child goes to mainstream education, the parents have to work very hard.  It is not a path they take lightly.  Why do some children transition to special education or services subsequently?  It is because the journey gets too tough.  That is the reason.  Parents get worn out or the system breaks.  When Killian started in secondary school we never saw him doing the leaving certificate or any examination.  This was not because we did not believe he was able but because we presumed the system would not support and facilitate him.  He was very lucky that it did.  It can work.</p></speech>

He graduated with the mainstream graduates last week.  He has taken a year out because he has a health problem.  Next year he will go to a FETAC 3 course.  His passion is drama.</p> <p>  There is another problem when students go on, because they cannot get through the door.  A student can go for an interview only to be told that the option is not suitable or that the organisation cannot support them without even asking for an assessment or report.  The enrolment policies of FETAC level 5 and 6 courses are problematic.  It is easier to get into college and undertake a third level degree than study a FETAC level 5 course.  If someone goes to the vocational training opportunities scheme or back to education initiative there are no supports for people with special educational needs.  A student cannot get an interpreter.  Killian is deaf and his first language is Irish Sign Language.  It is not possible to get an interpreter for the VTOS or BTEI programmes.  There are many challenges and the challenges are there because no one has asked for change up to now.  However, there is a cohort of students finishing secondary school now who are going to come asking for change.  The transition planning needs to happen in fifth year in future.</p></speech>

I am like Ms Maher.  I want all doors open and I want the three boxes.  However, when one special needs child comes into a school, it causes huge resource issues that have to be dealt with as well.

Access to resources at second level generally comes through the National Educational Psychological Service, although the new model or pilot may change that.  As students move from post-primary into further education, institutes of technology and so on, access to resources is appalling because it must be consultant-led and that is difficult.  Oftentimes, by the time all the documentation has arrived, the course is almost halfway through.</p></speech>

I support what Ms Maher has said.  We should think about the educational system in Ireland as a continuum of provision.  We recognise that the majority of students should be included with their peers in mainstream education to the greatest extent possible.  However, we also recognise that there are some children for whom that may not be possible for all of the day or week.  Therefore, we have special classes and special schools as well.  The National Council for Special Education has looked into this in other countries.  Most European countries have a continuum of provision in place in some shape or other.  We have both here.  It should be individualised for the child.</p> <p>  My colleagues can address some of the other questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.160" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. S&eacute; Goulding" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015111800002#G01800"><p>I will work through the questions and leave Senator Moran's questions until the end.</p> <p>  Deputy McConalogue mentioned the new model of provision of allocation of supports to schools and the pilot.  Currently there are approximately 47 or 48 schools engaged in the pilot for primary and post-primary schools.  The pilot is being rolled out by the Department of Education and Skills.  The Minister announced it last February and it started in September.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked what to expect and what the students were learning.  In the selection of schools, the Department ensured a full spectrum, including primary and post-primary, smaller rural schools as well as urban schools and disadvantaged schools etc.  The idea was to get a true representation of the school sector at primary and post-primary level.</p> <p>  What are we expecting to learn?  This is a model of allocation of supports.  However, in addition we are asking schools to focus on the needs of students.  Reference was made earlier to the labels attached to children.  This model will not necessarily work off labels.  It works by identifying the needs of the students.  Then the schools plan how those needs will be met through the management and deployment of the teaching supports allocated to the schools.</p><p>The Department wanted to identify how the model is working.  Schools did not lose out in the pilot process.  However, it is not only about the model of allocation <i>per se</i>because the Department still has to see how the model will work.  The Department has not yet come to its final conclusions, as far as I am aware, on how the resources will be allocated to schools but, equally, it wants to see how the schools will manage and deploy the supports in the best interests of the students concerned.<br/><br/>Deputy O'Brien asked about post-secondary education.  The NCSE recognises that there are deficiencies once one moves beyond the post-primary sector.  We conducted research in 2013 on post-school transitions and highlighted a number of issues which need to be addressed, including equity of assessment, eligibility requirements for the disability access route to education, DARE, scheme, lack of early school and career planning and a profession by school professionals that they lack specific knowledge on aspects of supports in further and higher education.  It is one of the strategic priorities on which the council has focused over recent years.  We are trying to review what provision is available in further and higher education.  The council's main focus since it was established has been on the allocation of supports to students in a school setting.  Everyone recognises now, however, that the issue moves beyond the school sector.<br/><br/>Deputy O'Brien also mentioned the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, and the number of assessments that would be carried out in a school.  A fair few of the assessments required by schools are required in order to access resources.  It is necessary to put the label on a student.  Should the new model be adopted, that particular aspect of NEPS may not be as relevant.  It would be relevant in assisting schools determine what strategies they would employ in meeting the needs of the student through, as Ms Byrne mentioned, the continuum-based approach.<br/><br/>Special autistic spectrum disorder, ASD, classes were also mentioned.  I will speak in terms of the national provision.  We have now moved for the first time to a situation where we have more than 1,000 special classes in mainstream primary and post-primary schools.  The majority, approximately 65% or 75%, of those classes would be ASD classes.  We recognise that there is a demand for them and the demand is beginning to emerge at second level as well.  Over the past four to five school years, we have increased the number of special classes in post-primary mainstream schools from approximately 106 to 254.  We also have plans in place to open more classes next year.<br/><br/>We recognise that in some cases there is a lead-in time in the establishment of such classes.  The schools may have to go through a planning process and apply to the building unit of the Department of Education and Skills for access to the capital expenditure programme.  We are trying to ensure places are available in schools but we recognise that there will be a lead-in time.  In some cases, it may be that we are not quite clear where parents will enrol their children in second level schools.  We may expect a demand in area A but it may end up in area B.  We try to identify where the demand will be as early as possible.  We roll out our applications process for schools generally in February or March each year so that we can have resources in place in schools well in advance of the start of the school year.  The schools can then plan for how they will manage and deploy the resources allocated for the start of the school year.<br/><br/>A child being taken for only a part of the school day was mentioned.  The lead agency dealing with the issue would probably be Tusla.  We would also have concerns if that were the case.  If there is a specific case, I am happy to discuss it further after the session.  Obviously, we cannot comment on a specific case during this hearing.  In fairness, I am aware of situations where, as part of the programme, schools have commenced with a reduced school day in order to allow the student to adapt to the school setting.  If that is the context for a reduced school day, there can be a logic to it.  However, no one would agree that it would be used on a permanent basis as it would exclude a child from access to education.<br/><br/>Deputy O'Brien also mentioned a specific case where assistive technology has helped.  We agree it helps but, if assistive technology helps, it helps because the student is able to access the learning the teacher is providing.  The assistive technology in itself will not be the solution.  This concerns how the student and the teacher interacts in the classroom setting.  Assistive technology is a tool or a means to make that happen.  At junior certificate level, schools can determine themselves to what extent a student may require access to reasonable accommodation.  At leaving certificate level, a report is required which will enable a student to access it but it is done on a needs basis.  <br/><br/>I referred to special classes.  Deputy O'Brien mentioned that resources should travel with students.  The resources do travel with students but we have approximately 4,000 schools in the country, comprising 3,300 primary and approximately 750 post-primary schools.  There is significant movement of students between those schools and there is a significant movement of students out of those schools.  We resource the schools in terms of teaching and SNA supports to enable them to meet the special education and care needs of the students.  There is quite an ebb and flow of resources.  There is no question that the student supports will not follow them, in particular the resource teaching, but it may impact on the overall level of supports allocated to the school in question which could alter from year to year.  This is why we put our allocations process in place well before the start of the school year.  For the past few years, we have allocated supports to schools in mid to late May.  The school knows in advance precisely what resources it will have the following September.  The applications process at present is the manner in which resources are allocated.  The new model, if piloted successfully and adopted, would not require an applications process because the model of allocation would be different.  The allocation would be made to the school.</p></speech>

This is partly a result of timetabling.  If a student has an exemption from Irish, he or she can be rounded up with other students who also have an exemption and they all may receive joint or group work with educational support.  This is not always great.  A student with a very high IQ who is doing English, mathematics and every other subject at honours level might be exempt from Irish because he or she has severe dyslexia or dyspraxia.  This student is then grouped with students who may be doing foundation level work.  As the allocation is made to the school and not to the child, and it takes parents a long time to get their heads around that fact.  Parents often report that the allocation is used elsewhere and is not directed towards their child.</p> <p>  Another problem concerns equipment.  A child might have an iPad or a computer in sixth class but is required to hand it back to the school.  Someone else said it already but it could be six months before it is replaced.  It would make a big difference if the equipment was given to the child and not the school.</p> <p>  A partial day really only has a place as part of a bigger plan.  Nothing will be resolved where partial days are used to relieve stress on the class teacher and students in the class without being part of a bigger plan and the child rather than the system will constantly be seen as the problem.</p> <p>  Someone touched on the issue but children in special classes in primary schools experience inclusion on a daily basis.  They are included for part of the day, be it art, PE or another subject.  Students in special classes in secondary school seldom experience inclusion.  They spend the full day and possibly the full five years in the special class.  This is particularly obvious or easy to observe for the leaving certificate applied, LCA, class.  Most schools do not include a section in the timetable during which LCA students join with mainstream students for art or some other such subject.  I know it is difficult to do it because the curriculums are very different but part of being in a mainstream school is experiencing that inclusion.</p> <p>  Something that was not touched upon but which I have to bring up is the idea of enforced isolation and seclusion of students with special educational needs.</p><p>This is happening throughout Ireland in schools without a proper system in place.  Some schools manage it very well; others do not.  As parents, we believe that in order for exclusion rooms or forced isolation to be put in place there needs to be a unified system that is sanctioned by the Department of Education and Skills.  That includes copious reporting and specialist training for the staff who are working with the child in isolation.  Parents report that teacher training and teachers' skills are the biggest indicator of positive outcomes for their children.  Nothing else replaces the quality of a teacher and their understanding of teaching.</p></speech>

We do not make pals by accident.  It does not come naturally and easily to a lot of people.  School can be a horrific place for any kid without special educational needs.  Usually it is our pals and friends who get us through those six years.  Systems have to be put in place in schools to support students so that they are not isolated socially.  The funny thing is that all of these recommendations are included in the inclusive education framework, which is a guide for schools presented by the National Council of Special Education.  We know all of this but we need to get it implemented.</p></speech>

It is a tool that, if used properly, can have significant positive impacts.  I agree with Ms Maher that the quality of a teacher cannot be substituted.  In the case I mentioned, the teacher involved did a training course on assistive technology, dyslexia and dyspraxia which benefited not only the child in question but every other child coming up through the school.  I completely agree that it is a tool, but it is a tool that can have a positive impact.  There is the issue of IEPs and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, but when schools invite us in and give us an educational plan for the year outlining what they will prioritise and their areas of focus, it is a collaborative approach.  That is where the assistive technology is brought into it.  It is brought in in conjunction and partnership with the teachers, parents and student.  I agree that it is only a tool; it is not the answer.  It is a tool that has the ability to transform somebody's educational experiences.</p></speech>

What I was trying to say in the context of it being a tool is that if the teacher is clued in it can be really valuable.  To put that in context, in most cases where a student has access to such technology at primary level, it should transfer to second level.  We would deal with probably 1,500 or 1,700 applications each year from the primary and post-primary sector.  The question is whether the second-level school will be in a position to obtain the equipment.  Under the current scheme operated by the Department, it is an asset of the school and the school has to track its assets.  That is the scheme that we operate.  We provide the reports to the Department and it allocates the supports to the schools.</p> <p>  On reasonable accommodation, I should have said that the scheme, as the Deputy is probably aware, is administered by the State Examination Commission because it relates specifically to the junior certificate and leaving certificate examinations and it determines the regulations that are put in place on access to reasonable accommodation.</p></speech>

It is the parents' associations that are funding them.  They do not become the property of the school; they become the property of the parent.  In my own experience, they become the property of the student, and when they transition, the equipment goes with them.  That is one way that some parent associations and schools are getting around the issue of it being a school asset.</p></speech>

We could have as many as 20 or 25 laptops to hand out to students.  Technology ages very quickly - the software rushes ahead and the technology chases behind.  That has always been the way.  If one is lucky, one finishes up after two years with 20 laptops that are obsolete.  I am interested in what Mr. Byrne has to say about managing the updating of the software when laptops or other assistive technology is returned to the school.  It is a nightmare to manage and it makes no sense.  If a student is given a piece of technology that will help them to learn, why can they not bring it with them?  Even if they are finished their education forever, they should bring it with them and keep all their files, learning and technology.  I understand the Department has to try to manage its resources but a laptop probably costs them &euro;250 and a student has it for three or five years.  Today an iPad, depending on the particular model one is working with, costs a couple of hundred euro.  I am interested in what Mr. Byrne has to say on this.  One cannot recycle an awful lot of this stuff.  It finishes up in a storeroom for somebody to count because there is nothing else that can be done with it.  It might be passed onto staff to use in their staff rooms.  Keeping technology alive is nonsense.  We should give it to the students and tell them that it is to assist them for the rest of their lives and that they can take it with them.</p></speech>

Normally when a student finishes up, some of the parents will come in and ask what the laptop is worth and they are prepared to pay for it.  That is what we do.  It is no good to any other student in the school.  A laptop has a lifespan of three years.  When a student has been using it for five years, it is so slow that it is of no use to anybody else.

With regard to using assistive technology to help SEN students, one of the things we did was to try to form links outside the school.  There is a dyslexia club every Tuesday which is run mainly by primary school teachers who come in voluntarily in the evenings.  We provide the IT room and any classrooms they want.  They use programmes such as Touch-type Read and Spell, which is fantastic.  By doing that, we are building a link.  The transition from primary to secondary has been mentioned.  Many of the students who come from our feeder schools are already used to the school from coming in and out and they know that the school has an awareness of the needs of SEN students.  It has done an awful lot for the students.  It also assures parents that they are sending students to a school that is already prepared to help them.  Even with all that, we still find that sometimes a student slips through the net and it is only when there is an assessment, mainly when they are looking for some sort of assistance for SEC exams, that something is identified.</p> <p>  On the funding for psychologists, that came about because we had two to three NEPS assessments per year for 600 students.  We also identified that there were other students who definitely needed an assessment to prepare us to help them in their education.  They were falling behind but did not have behavioural problems.  We work on different strategies for behavioural problems with NBSS.</p><p>This is a priority, so we used our school support fund.  We worked with the psychologist and found he had an outstanding input to make on the transition of students from primary to post-primary level.  I listened to him speak a fortnight ago.  Basically, he slated secondary schools.  Ours is one of the schools that is running a transition programme and a settling-in programme.  He asked now that we have those in place what are we doing about the transition of students from second level to third year.  He asked how we were preparing the students for that jump as he said that is the next thing we need to examine.  That is all part of progressive planning within a school.  To put this in the context of the our submission, all that is dependent on good leadership in a school.  It is also dependent on the leaders having the time to do this, and their time not being taken up dealing with trivial matters that should have been dealt with, and traditionally were dealt with by middle management.  The problem is that middle management has been eroded to the point where principals and deputy principals are acting as year heads, with some of them looking after book schemes, because they do not have the necessary middle management structures in place to do that.  To progress the way special educational needs are looked after in schools, the middle management structures need to be put back in place.  That is one of the elements we are seeking.<br/><br/>Senator Craughwell asked about the co-ordination of the special educational needs provision within the school and issue of continual professional development, CPD.  We have incentivised teachers to do CPD training.  We had a fund in place from the board of management for any teacher who undertook CPD training.  If it was one teacher, he or she would get a maximum of &euro;1,500 towards whatever course he or she was pursing.  If there were five teachers, the maximum we would pay out was &euro;300 and the money was divided on a <i>pro rata </i>basis.  It encouraged five of our staff to engage in high quality CDP training.  One of them zoned in on special educational needs area and on completing his training he has given back 100 fold what we gave him towards he doing his CPD training.  He has put a structure in place.  <br/><br/>Reference was made to creative timetabling.  My view on timetabling is that we would use the timetable to the best effect for the students we have, to best use our resources to get the best outcomes for the students.  In terms of timetabling in the school in which I work, I have provided that every teacher works to the maximum of 22 hours and every teacher has involvement with special educational needs.  That is why the programme is successful.  It is a major job to do that and keep it rolling over every six-week period.  Sometimes issues arise in certain subject areas where a student suddenly finds that they are struggling.  If we deal with that quickly and give them the help they need, six weeks is all it may take for that student to be able to keep up.  We use team teaching a great deal.  The value of team teaching is very high.</p></speech>

To take the example of the subject like mathematics, one could take three students out of a class and do work on a ratio of 1:3 with them but in the time they would have been taken out of the class and would not be following the flow of the class.  Whereas if a second teacher is put into the classroom and the three students are strategically placed, that teacher can help those three students to keep up.  It is a very good use of resources.  It also opens the door to teachers accepting the idea of peer review.  It opens the door for those teachers to show good practice and for them to communicate on what is the best way of teaching a subject.  It provides a great opportunity and more schools should use the concept.    I will now pass over to Mr. Clive Byrne.</p></speech>

There are 3,500 primary school and 700 post-primary schools.  The school in which Mr. Paul Byrne is based in Carrick-on-Shannon is the stand-alone school within that town and the primary schools feed into it.  In many urban areas parents are chopping and changing between which second level schools their children will attend.</p> <p>  Deputy Daly, Senator Moran and the Chairman spoke about policy provision.  The school administration package user group, which is a working group within the Department of Education and Skills, is very keen to work on post-primary and primary databases.  My understanding is the work it is doing will mean that when a second level school offers a place to a particular student in primary school, the school will be able to download information on the system which will travel to the second level school.  In those circumstances when that happens and the place has been offered, another second level school will be precluded from picking up information about that student.  That would be worthwhile in terms of making sure that the proper information follows to the second level school in order that the needs of the student can be taken on board.</p> <p>  Initial teacher training is now a two-year a professional master's course.  In the past with the old HDip course, one might found a minority of students doing an optional module in special needs education but there is no reason in terms of the current initial training that teachers should not be equipped to deal with the differentiation issues that arise in students with special education needs coming into classes.  From a policy point of view, it would be a very strong recommendation coming from the committee that this should be a key part of the training.  Our primary colleagues are much better trained in areas to do with differentiation than our second level teacher colleagues.</p></speech>

That would makes great sense from my point of view.</p> <p>  Deputy McConalogue wanted more information about the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, and spoke about three assessments in a school of 500 or 600, but that is completely down to capacity.  There has  been significant investment in the NEPS over the last while in terms of an increase in staffing.  Much of the time of the NEPS psychologist in the past was taken up with completing the necessary paperwork to enable resources of scribes and readers to be made available for leaving certificate students.  Some of my colleagues made the point that discretion is given to principals in many incidents at second level, whereby they can offer particular resources.  The State examinations body will give schools the autonomy that if a student requires a reader or a scribe that such resources can be offered.  Often parents look for those resources at junior cycle level because they hope to be able to access those resources at leaving certificate level.  There is not always guaranteed because the NEPS will be involved in applications for special resources.  Regarding the point Deputy O'Brien made about students not having a certainty that a scribe or a reader would be allocated to a student with  the needs he described, it would be most unusual if either the State examinations body or the school would not be in a position to ensure that this happened.</p> <p>  Senator Moran raised a question about the role of a special needs assistant, particularly in regard to refusal to toilet a student.  Some rare incidents arise, but on the question of having special needs assistants in the system, that provision has expanded into post-primary level.  Our colleagues from the NCSE may know this, but I believe there may be 15,000 or 16,000 individuals in 10,000 wholetime equivalent positions in terms of special needs assistants.  Their types of duties and responsibilities are as many and as varied as the individual schools in which they work.  I can recall a person applying for an special needs assistant position but not being interested in any toileting duties that might be associated with the student.  If a student has such care needs, I would take it as read that the special needs assistant should be required to perform those duties for the student.  In view of the particular responsibilities of special needs assistants and there being a renegotiation of their contract, their hours and their availability for work during June and other times of the year, there are particular arrangement in different schools and as long as they are working for the best needs of the school and for the children, I believe it is worth leaving well enough alone, as Senator Craughwell might have implied earlier on the issue of timetabling.</p><p> It makes perfect sense that the assistive technology should stay with the student.  The pupil passport was an initiative that the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, NAPD, and our primary colleagues Irish Primary Principals Network, IPPN, started in a particular region to ensure that appropriate information was transferred between the primary and post-primary sector.  At the time industrial relations issues were strained and the INTO forbade the principals of the primary schools to pass on any of that information.  Now that issue has been worked out, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, working with the Department will have primary passports where the appropriate information can be transferred.  The NAPD president, Mr. Paul Byrne referred to the continuous professional development of principals and he was generous in his comments.  We do our best to provide continuous professional development for our members in the areas of special education needs because our policy is that all schools should be inclusive and welcoming.</p><p> Part of the reason we welcomed the Stack report was the concept of a baseline allocating to all schools.  If all schools have a baseline allocation from the NCSE, then no school can have the soft barriers that are often spoken about by saying that one would be better able to have one's son or daughter catered for if one were to move to a school down the road.  Certainly working with the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, and the research conferences and research papers they provide, we find constant supports and resources are made available.  The difficulty, as my colleague said, is in regard to the current climate in school, where pressures on principals and deputy principals and everybody else in the teaching profession as a result of moratorium on posts, cutbacks and changes to pupil teacher ratios is affecting what is happening in school.  There is no doubt that in terms of a policy position, the most serious policy recommendation that could come would be that somebody should be allocated a role as a senior SEN co-ordinator within a school to enable appropriate services to be put in place to meet the needs of the students in the school in the context in which they find themselves </p></speech>

Senator Moran's point is that there are not enough such classes.  I pointed out the increase in numbers in the past four to five years.  The role of the SNA is to meet the significant care needs arising in the school setting.  Two of the traditional care needs which are often referenced are feeding and toileting and these would have been some of the primary care needs that were addressed at the start of the scheme.  The number of SNAs in post-primary schools have increased in the past four to five years from around 2,000 to 2,400 so there has been a 20% increase, which would reflect the number of students transitioning through from primary to post-primary education.  The numbers are increasing and the number of teachers and SNAs in the post-primary sector has increased to meet that need.  We would recognise that there are soft barriers in place but in the main the majority of students are transitioning through in mainstream.  As I mentioned earlier, schools are open to establishing special classes, but there are lead-in times and there are difficulties sometimes in terms of where they are needed and sometimes there are difficulties in opening the classes.  However, we need to recognise that a great deal of progress has been made.</p> <p>  Senator Moran asked about the numbers taking continuous professional development courses.  We would not have those numbers.  That information is primarily available from the Special Education Support Services, SESS, and if necessary we will go back to the SESS and obtain the information and let Senator Moran have it.  From our contacts with the Special Education Support Service it is very active in trying to let schools know what continuous professional development courses are available.  In fairness to schools, there are issues in respect of substitution but the SESS places a heavy emphasis in trying to ensure that as many teachers as possible are upskilled in meeting the special education needs of the students enrolled .   </p> <p>  Senator Moran also mentioned the transition to adult service.  She is correct.  I referenced that earlier.  In many cases the students will be leaving the education sector and perhaps moving into areas, other than education, such as employment or to supports provided by the HSE.  That is the reason I mention that the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has identified it as a priority in trying to see what supports are available in further and higher education for adults with special education needs.</p></speech>

There are many soft barriers to inclusion.  Parents do not have confidence that the new enrolment legislation will fully address all of these aspects.  Parents believe that a roadmap for the implementation of the outstanding parts of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSON, Act 2004 is required, in particular the individualised education plans, IEPS, the independent appeals and also the implementation of the NCSE policy advice on the education of deaf and hard of hearing children in Ireland.  Both of these policies have been articulated for a number of years.  We need a roadmap, to know if its will happen and if so, how it will happen.  Parents have noted the lack of second level education places, even though there are classes at primary school level.  There are a small number of special classes at primary level for specific speech and language impairment but there is no provision for this at post-primary level.  Specific speech and language impairment is a lifelong and enduring condition.  There is a major issue when a child has multiple and complex needs due to comorbidity, as in two equal but totally separate disabilities.  They are often excluded from special schools and special classes as these have a very strict enrolment.  If one is deaf and also has autism, one may not be accepted into a deaf unit and one may also not be accepted into the autism unit.  These children have a very difficult path.</p> <p>  The parents suggest a partial exemption from Irish, that is, a person could be exempted from the oral or written section of the exam but not necessarily from both.  The Ombudsman for Children looked to the application of reasonable accommodation and has suggested that must now be more transparency and parents must be given the reason for the rejection, and then allowed to appeal.  The final decision must be made much earlier.</p> <p>  The July provision has not been mentioned but it is a significant issue for post-primary school students.  This educational support happens in July.  Students finish towards the end of May and resume school at the beginning of September.  They find it very difficult to get tutors because tutors are not paid until November but also because this happens in the middle of the secondary school teaching holidays.  Parents are suggesting that this funding could be allocated to parents and could be used at the end of August to help the student prepare for re-entry into school in September.</p></speech>

I do not know how some principals are still alive, let alone managing their schools.  As well as being the principal of the school, the principal is the secretary to the board of management, is in charge of continuous professional development, and must take responsibility for up to 1,000 students.  On top of all of that one will find that some principals are acting as year head for two classes.  I met with a principal who told me he sat in his car at night monitoring social media for the particular class for which he was the year head because there had been a fatality in the school.  He sat in his car at night until 10 p.m. because his wife could no longer take the stress that had befallen on the family.</p> <p>  We have stripped our schools of middle management.  God be with the days when there were special duties teachers and assistant and deputy principals.  One is lucky to have two or three assistant principals and they are so over-worked they do not want any additional work.  Schools are now running on goodwill.  This is not a trade union issue, it is a real issue for principals.  Mr Clive. Byrne, in particular would know would that I have been up against many a principal in my time as a trade union leader but he would also know that I think it is the loneliest post in the world.  We need to put back in the middle management.</p></speech>

He had been invited to attend a book festival and the Paris tragedy had occurred.  He said it was only in Ireland, in a place like Westport, that he could find such an educated audience.  What he meant was that the audience members were from all walks of life and included all kinds of people - educated, non-educated and self-educated - as well as people of all ages.  He said he would rarely find this in parts of England, an audience that was aware, informed, well read, interested and alive.  I think it has something to do with what Mr. Byrne is talking about - our striving to be educated in a republic, into which great effort is put.  The most important thing we will ever do is educate our young, middle-aged and ageing population consistently.  It is linked tenuously with what Mr. Byrne is saying and how we can move and are moving forward in that way.</p></speech>

As initiated, the legislation provides that a company has to make a claim for relief within 12 months of the end of the accounting period.  However, I am now extending the period to 24 months to recognise that the KDB is a new tax incentive, there are significant documentation requirements that must be met before any claim is made, and that it will take time for taxpayers to become familiar with its operation.  This will provide some additional flexibility and allow taxpayers to respond to the requirements of the KDB, in particular those that relate to the documentation that is required support a claim.</p><p>Amendment No. 43 clarifies the definition of member state used for the purpose of the KDB refers to the EU and EEA regions, not just the EU as per the original legislation.Amendment No. 44 is a technical amendment correcting the reference to the appropriate section of the Patents Act 1992.  Amendment No. 45 clarifies the criteria that should be applied by an agent for the purposes of certifying patents that are not subject to an examination for novelty and inventive step.  This is aligned to the standard criteria for examined patents.</p><p>Amendment No. 46 makes it clear that all qualifying research and development expenditure that leads to the development of a qualifying asset may be included in the KDB computation.  This will ensure that even unsuccessful research and development may be included, so long as it sought to resolve the uncertainty that the ultimately developed the qualifying asset resolves.  Amendment No. 47 clarifies that an amount of research and development expenditure does not have to be excluded for the purposes of the KDB computation simply because such expenditure is capitalised only for accounting purposes.  At present, the legislation already provides for this to be included in respect of intangible assets, for example a business process or know-how.  This change will ensure it may also be included for tangible assets, for example aspects of a piece of equipment protected by a patent.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 48 and 51 are technical amendments which are necessary to remove a circular calculation, thereby ensuring the KDB computation works.  Amendment No. 49 provides a claim must be made within 24 months, rather than within 12 months.  Amendments Nos. 50 and 52 are technical and are necessary to clarify that the obligations to keep records and documentation as set out in section 769I and 769L apply only to a company that claims the KDB relief.  Amendments Nos. 53 to 58, inclusive, are technical amendments to delete a superfluous subsection in section 769O and amend all consequential references within that section.</p><p>Amendments Nos 59 and 60 are necessary to clarify that the criteria which apply to the additional category of assets for small companies is within both the OECD rules, but also the EU state aid rules.  This follows the definition of a micro, small or medium-sized enterprises as set out in Commission's Recommendation 2003/361/EC of 6 May 2003.  Specifically, this change will clarify that to qualify for the additional category of assets, the Irish taxpayer must have less than &euro;7.5 million of income from all intellectual property per annum; employ less than 250 people; have a balance sheet of less than &euro;43 million; and have a global annual turnover of less than &euro;50 million.  If the Irish entity is a member of a group of companies, then this turnover requirement applies to not just the stand-alone Irish company but to the whole global group.</p><p>I commend these amendments.</p></speech>

One of the problems with the economy we have created in this State is its over-reliance on foreign direct investment.  There is an inherent imbalance within the Irish economy at the moment, with 90% of exports coming from FDI companies, for example, rather than indigenous business.  Any imbalance will cause exposure and will make us susceptible to shocks in the future, whether they be shocks in the context of Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, BEPS, taxation, exchange rates or the competitive realities of emerging markets.  Foreign direct investment is very mobile in comparison to indigenous business and therefore it is far easier for it to go elsewhere.  Indigenous business does not have the same level of mobility.  Typically the attraction of FDI companies is used by emerging economies as a strategy to grow their own indigenous sectors in the longer run.  The attraction of such companies is very seldom an objective in its own right but Ireland has not been able, so far, to strike a balance between the two.  Of course, FDI must be welcomed and every job that can be created in times of difficulty must be supported but the current imbalance must be addressed.</p> <p>  This Government has been dragged, kicking and screaming, into changing the taxation environment for FDI companies.  Sinn F&eacute;in has long been calling on the Government to resolve the so-called double-Irish problem and the various loopholes that were in existence which allowed companies to pay very low effective rates of tax.  This year I attended a committee meeting addressed by the chief economist of the Department of Finance and have tabled parliamentary questions to the Minister on this issue but there seems to be confusion around the fact that corporation tax receipts are so far ahead of profile this year in comparison to other years.  The trading environment and exchange rates have been suggested as reasons for this but there is a large body of opinion that holds that corporation tax is so far ahead of profile this year because some companies are locating their profit generation base for tax and accounting purposes in Ireland which has resulted in a ballooning of the corporation tax take here.  If that is the case, it means we have lost the opportunity which existed for the last four or five years and the State has lost out on those funds because of this Government's reticence to become up to date with international best practice on taxation.  </p> <p>  My worry is that the knowledge development box is simply another method by which the Government is seeking to ensure that we maintain a competitive advantage through our corporation taxes.  Foreign direct investors will tell one that they want to make a profit.  The infrastructure of profit for any business is based on having access to customers, low input costs and a skilled workforce.  The availability of most of those components is falling in this country because we are reducing our investment in education and infrastructure and therefore, our competitive advantage is our bargain basement corporation tax rate.  We are putting all of our competitive eggs into one basket and making it difficult for ourselves to broaden out and re-balance the economy in the future.  I am concerned that the knowledge development box is simply another way of going down this route.</p> <p>  I understand that the knowledge development box is designed to replicate the patent box which has been introduced in other countries.  Will the income generated from products developed from patents or intellectual property be identified as income under the knowledge development box structure?  Will it cover not just the sale of intellectual property or a patent but also the sale of a product developed from same?  The cost analysis from the Government indicates that it will cost about &euro;50 million but I ask the Minister of State to outline how this was calculated.  My understanding is that this can only be calculated by determining the income to the State if the effective corporation tax was 12.5%, then determining the percentage of profits made by FDI companies which would be booked under the knowledge box and working out the difference.  If that is the case, we have to be talking about billions of euro in costs to the State.  </p> <p>  Much of the work being done by FDI companies at the moment is contract work which leaves employees in a precarious position.  Does the Minister of State know what percentage of the employment created by FDI companies is contract based as opposed to direct labour?</p></speech>

It is not fair to say that the Minister was dragged, kicking and screaming anywhere in the context of his approach to ensuring that this country promotes best practice when it comes to taxation and plays a prominent, leadership role within the OECD's BEPS discussions.  The Deputy does not have to take my word for that because there is evidence in last year's Finance Bill to back it up.  The Minister abolished the so-called double-Irish in that legislation which gave this country a first-mover advantage and sent out a very powerful message to investors about certainty and to the OECD that this country wants to play a constructive role and encourages others to do likewise.  Now we have arrived at the point where we have the OECD BEPS process in place.  I also do not accept the Deputy's suggestion that there is an over-reliance on FDI.  If one looks at the job creation figures, which I do not have to hand unfortunately, one will see that the majority of new jobs in the Irish economy have been created by indigenous Irish companies.</p> <p>  We must be very clear that the knowledge development box is not just an incentive for FDI companies.  It is also an incentive for indigenous Irish companies, startups and young companies in this country to develop, innovate and research here.  If we do not put such measures in place here we will make Ireland a less attractive location compared to competitor jurisdictions in terms of encouraging companies to innovate, research, develop and register patents.  The Minister for Finance mentioned during the Second Stage debate on the Finance Bill that is quite likely because of the operation of the OECD modified nexus that the knowledge development box will be of most benefit to single companies which carry out their research and development activities in Ireland.  We would be very happy to see smaller Irish indigenous business availing of this relief and we expect, certainly in the initial years, that to be the case.  </p> <p>  On the issue of corporation tax, the Deputy said there is much speculation as to why we have seen a spike in corporation tax receipts.</p><p>Rather than speculating I am following the advice of the Revenue Commissioners on this.  Revenue has advised the Minister and the Department of Finance that the increase is attributable to, among other things, improved trading conditions and the positive currency fluctuations.  The Deputy's point that we do need to continue to monitor it is a fair one.  </p><p> On the cost, my understanding is that the cost for 2016 is estimated to be &euro;31 million.  The Deputy is correct that it will be &euro;50 million in a full year.  That is based on a reasonable assumption of a 50% uptake.  The legislation provides that the knowledge development box, KDB, will arise in respect of accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2016.  This cost for 2016 can be further refined to &euro;31 million on the basis of the payment dates for preliminary tax which fall due in 2016.</p></speech>

How we are arriving at the figure in terms of the expected cost is an important question.  The annual cost of the knowledge development box in terms of tax foregone from 2016 forward have been estimated.  This focused on companies who up until this year had corporate profits that were taxable in Ireland at the standard 12.5% corporation tax rate and who from 2016 may have profits that are taxable at the KDB rate of 6.25%.  On the basis of the analysis carried out in the 2013 review of the research and development, R&amp;D, tax credit the majority of Irish firms who undertake R&amp;D in Ireland are claiming the R&amp;D tax credit so it is assumed that companies who would be able to qualify for the knowledge development box rate are captured by this data, which is reported by the Revenue Commissioners in the corporation tax, CT, returns.  </p> <p>  On the basis of the most recent data available, the Revenue Commissioners has advised that in 2013, the total CT liability of all such firms was &euro;1.4 billion.  This is the outer limit of tax that could be reduced by the KDB rate.  In reality, the number of companies who will be able to immediately avail of the KDB will be much lower as only the proportion of income that is attributable to qualifying assets such as patents or copyright qualify.  Unfortunately, no data in that regard is collected by the Revenue Commissioners.  The amount of income that could qualify for the KDB rate is the proportion of expenditure on qualifying R&amp;D in Ireland over the total amount of worldwide R&amp;D that was carried out to generate the intellectual property, IP, assets.  That is how we have arrived at the cost.</p> <p>  I was struck by the point made by Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, during the debate on last year's Finance Bill and in other discussions, which I think is a fair point, that sometimes in a finance Bill it is worth taking a chance on trying an idea that could result in more R&amp;D, more innovation and substance based R&amp;D.  With this knowledge development box we now have the first OECD compliant box in the world.  While other countries and other competitor jurisdictions will have to adapt, amend and improve their offering to ensure they comply, Ireland will not because - this refers back to the kicking and screaming comments made earlier - rather than rushing to do things the Minister used the period between the last budget, in which he made the announcement about the knowledge development box, and this budget to ensure we have in place a box that is reputationally sound and in accordance with the new OECD figures.</p></speech>

It was at the heart of discussions of Congress investigations in the United States.  I recall that when the Taoiseach was in California the Governor of California made a joke about Ireland's tax regulations in front of him.  Internationally we have a poor reputation with regard to tax.  That has a material cost as well.</p> <p>  There has been some talk about the knowledge development box being considered by the EU to be State aid.  Perhaps the Minister of State would indicate whether there have been discussions in that regard with the EU, such that there is no confusion in that regard.  Am I correct that the Minister of State said that there is a potential &euro;1.4 billion cost in relation to this?</p></speech>

There is no doubt but that job creation in foreign directive investment, FDI, is totally out of kilter with regard to exports from foreign direct investment.  In other words, foreign direct investment has an enormous capacity to book profits in Ireland at extremely low employment growth rates, which indicates that first, these are very weak areas with regard to jobs per euro exported and second that a lot of the booking of profits here is for taxation purposes rather than manufacturing.  I have yet to meet anyone in Irish business - I have spoken to a few such people - who believes the business will benefit from this measure.  Is it the sale of the patent or the intellectual property or the sale of the manufactured goods that relates to that patent or intellectual property here that is captured?  If it is the latter, then the ability of this technique to reduce taxation exposure will be far higher.</p></speech>

This includes royalties that are attributable to the assets and sales income.  Any income that results from a disposal of the qualifying assets, such as the patent, will remain subject to the capital gains tax, CGT, rate.  Chargeable gains are not subject to the KDB rate.  It is the trading income derived from the qualifying assets that is captured.</p></speech>

A cynic would say that if a drug is produced by way of a particular method and that process is altered somewhat then that is innovative because it has changed the process of manufacture of that drug.  It may simply be the case that one ingredient has been introduced after another ingredient and so on.  How can we be sure that what we are looking at is innovation or R&amp;D that is of value to the State?  The Minister of State said that this the process is such that we will be able to identify the components within a product that fall under the KDB and so on.  Given there are potentially billions of euro involve in this there will be a huge incentive for foreign direct investment to play the game to a certain extent.</p></speech>

The EU code of conduct has approved and adopted the modified nexus standard.  Clearly, the tax sovereignty of a member state is a member state competency within the European Union.  As we have adhered to the modified nexus rules and the KDB as a general measure that is available to all Irish corporate taxpayers the KDB does not require any specific approval by the EU, such that approval by the European Commission under State aid rules is not required.  However, as I said, the EU code of conduct has approved and adopted the new modified nexus approach, which the OECD base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process has also identified.</p> <p>  The point made by Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n in terms of what qualifies and how we can ensure we are getting real value for money is a valid one.  The whole idea of the KDB is to encourage R&amp;D in Ireland.</p><p>Business processes do not qualify.  It would have to qualify to be registered as a patent or for copyright.  The business process the Deputy outlined at the start in his useful example would not qualify.  It has to be something that is patentable or copyrightable.  Therefore, business processes would not qualify.</p></speech>

I do not accept the Minister of State's assurances that this is not just replacing the double Irish tax scam with a new tax scam.  I think that is exactly what the Government is doing.  Having been exposed very badly with the double Irish, the Government in collusion with the multinationals has engineered a new tax scam, which is the knowledge box.  This is borne out by the fact that on a number of occasions the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, has had meetings with the US multinationals, and he has openly acknowledged that he has discussed this in detail with them.  From his most recent meeting in October he reported very positive feedback from the multinationals.  I am quite sure there is very positive feedback from them because, as we know from an abundance of evidence, they are keen to pay as little tax as they possibly can on their absolutely extraordinary profits.  In recent years we have allowed them to evade an extraordinary amount of tax under the double Irish mechanism.</p> <p>  I do not believe the Government or the Revenue Commissioners did not know of the abuse that was going on.  That applies to the previous Government and the current one.  I made a point on Second Stage and I will expand on it here, as I have a little more time now.  The Department of Finance's technical paper on the effective corporate tax rate contains a table produced by Revenue, table 3.25, on corporation tax distribution statistics.  There are the gross trading profits figures and then the allowances are taken out.  There is net trading income, other income and then total income.  It is amazing that in 2007, total income was &euro;63 billion after the allowances were taken out.  The deductions in that year were &euro;6 billion, so the taxable income was &euro;56 billion.  To be clear, those deductions include trade charges, which was the main mechanism through which the big multinationals wrote down their tax liability.  One subsidiary of a company would charge another subsidiary of the same company for the cost of using its intellectual property or patents.  They effectively wrote off most of their profits by charging it to intellectual property.  In 2007, &euro;6 billion was written off, mostly under the heading of trade charges by the big multinationals.  Two years later that figure jumped from &euro;6 billion to &euro;19 billion, which is a factor of three.  If I were in Revenue or in the Government of the day, I would be asking, "What the hell is going on here?  Has the cost of intellectual property jumped by that much?".  The total trading profits were not that different; in fact they were less.</p></speech>

We need to go into this detail to establish whether the knowledge development box will prevent the sort of tax evasion or the aggressive tax avoidance of the past.  If this committee serves any purpose, it needs to go into this detail.</p> <p>  The gross trading profits in 2007 were actually &euro;10 billion than more they were in 2009, but the amount written off jumped by 200%.  Therefore, the taxable income went from &euro;56 billion in 2007 to only &euro;37 billion in 2009.  This is blatant tax avoidance using intellectual property.  As I pointed out to sub-committee dealing with this, I did not fully understand how this worked until I got an e-mail from an anonymous whistleblower who worked in one of these companies, who explained very simply how they did it.  He said they would just adjust the amount they charged to royalties or intellectual property according to what profit margin they wanted.  They could literally decide what profits they wanted to make.  That is how they were operating.  There have been these absolutely unbelievable increases in the amount they are writing off, and are allowed to write off, under the old scheme.</p> <p>  The first thing to say is that the Government has not got rid of the double Irish, the mechanism through which they have done this; it is being phased out.  The Government has given them the time.  The companies that have been doing this will continue to be able to do it for the next few years until they acquaint themselves with the knowledge box.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, the Minister of State said he did not anticipate that much uptake in the first year.  They do not need to do it in the first year because they will continue with the double Irish, but they will slowly acclimatise themselves to the knowledge box.  Given that this is how they engaged in blatant tax avoidance in recent years, what assurances can the Minister of State give us that the knowledge box is not just the same thing?  It all turns on the question of the value a company can assign to patents and intellectual property.</p> <p>  The Minister of State has just made the really big admission that the sales that derive from the qualifying intellectual property will be able to benefit from the knowledge development box tax break.  There it is.  All they have to do is make the very slightest adjustment to the intellectual property.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n spoke about medicines and stuff.  Making small changes in medicines can actually result in big changes.  It is not medicines that we need to worry about here.  These are the tiniest cosmetic changes, or they could appear to be significant changes but actually be cosmetic changes.  We know the companies involved: the big IT companies, including Google and Facebook.  They can make cosmetic changes.  They might even appear to be significant changes, but they are not significant because they are always upgrading the stuff, with new versions of this, that and the other happening every few weeks.  It is really just variations on basic themes.</p><p>However, those variations will then be constituted as new intellectual property, with new patents associated with them, and all sales deriving from those products will be written off for tax purposes.  The Government has given them six years to refine this measure, just in case there are any difficulties, because we know the Government is under pressure from certain voices in Parliament, but, more importantly, it is under pressure internationally on this matter.  The Minister is clearly having lots of consultations with the multinationals and they are being given a six-year phase-in period to refine how they can fully exploit this new tax loophole.</p><p> It is important to understand just how much we are losing.  We are in an extraordinary position in which the Government does not want a possible &euro;19 billion from one company alone.  That is the upper estimate of what Apple would have to pay us back if it were to pay back the tax that it appears it should have paid to us.</p></speech>

The signals are that the European Commission believes we engaged in state aid in making special deals with companies such as Apple in order for them to avoid paying tax.  I believe that to be the case, as do many others.  That is why there is an investigation.  The upper estimates of how much tax was forgone in respect of one company suggest it could be as much as &euro;19 billion.  We are in an extraordinary situation in which the Government does not want that money.  If I were the Minister of State I would be chasing that money, but he is sitting back and saying "We will see what happens," and "There is nothing to see here," when we could be talking about as much as &euro;19 billion.</p> <p>  Let us look at the serious estimates of the effective tax rates.  The Government refers to a figure of an effective rate of 10.9%, which is laughable, because it is after the deductions to which I referred, namely, trade and charges, which is how companies write down their taxable income.  Any serious analysis of the profits being made by those companies would start with their gross trading profits at least, if not their total income.  Then one gets a very different picture.  One gets an effective tax rate of approximately 6.2%, which roughly coincides with EUROSTAT&rsquo;s estimate.  EUROSTAT's estimate of our effective tax rate is 5.9% for 2012.  As we know, the United States Congress estimated that the companies that are in the eye of this storm, the big players, are paying a rate of 2.2%.  Every time figures about their profits or revenues come out, that is borne out.  We had the extraordinary revelation recently that Google made &euro;18 billion in revenue last year and paid &euro;28.6 million in tax.  I calculate that rate to be less than 1%.  That is what is going on.  Everybody knows it.  I believe the Government knows it and that Revenue is aware of it, but it is being actively facilitated.  The knowledge development box is the new mechanism to facilitate the process.  I am sure the Minister of State will try to tell me that is not true.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.283" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1003" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12015111800002#E01300"><p>Robin Hood would be very good.</p></speech>

That is the Deputy&rsquo;s ideology and I respect that, but it is not how the world works.  In Deputy Boyd Barrett&rsquo;s constituency there are thousands of people, in Cherrywood and other areas, employed by multinational companies.  They are in well paid jobs.  They pay tax to this country and make a living for their families and therefore they contribute to the economy and to society.  The idea that the initiatives put in place by the Government, previous Governments, and presumably successive Governments to try to keep this jurisdiction competitive does not have any bearing on those job creation figures and that it is all just incidental does not stand up to any degree of scrutiny.</p> <p>  It was very interesting when Deputy Boyd Barrett said that - shock, horror - the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation had met with the multinationals.  Shock, horror - the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation interacts with businesses to try to create more jobs.  I will let Deputy Boyd Barrett into a little secret: yesterday I met a multinational company in Cork and I talked to those involved and asked what we are doing well in this country in terms of attracting investment, what made the company decide to locate in Cork, how many jobs it had created and whether it was likely to create more.  That is the sort of engagement we have.  Expressing shock and horror at Ministers with economic portfolios engaging with the business community is the equivalent of condemning the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine for meeting with the IFA.  That is what we are meant to do.  That is what we are duty-bound to do, and should we choose not to have those engagements we should not be in government.  Nobody who has that attitude should be.</p> <p>  I have too much respect for Deputy Boyd Barrett&rsquo;s intellect to believe he genuinely believes that the knowledge development box is the double Irish by another name, because it simply is not.  Deputy Boyd Barrett knows it is not.  First, when he says this country got caught in relation to the double Irish, let us be very clear in terms of setting the record straight.  No Government of any hue ever sat down in any office in Dublin or any other part of this country and designed the double Irish.  The double Irish was an anomaly devised, I presume, by international tax lawyers to enable companies to pay less tax, and we have ended it.  Deputy Boyd Barrett is right that we are phasing it out.  That is factually correct.  The double Irish was never part of the Irish tax offer.  It was never something designed by the Government or by any previous Government.  It is just one of a number of examples of international tax planning arrangements which were designed and developed by tax and legal experts to take advantage of what could best be described as mismatches between tax rules in two or more countries.  That is why the OECD's BEPS process and countries working together on a global level is the only way to address such issues.</p> <p>  In contrast to the double Irish, which was to do with tax residency rules, the knowledge development box is about substance.  It is about recognising that there are companies today in this country and right around the world &ndash; and even more in the future &ndash; that will spend a significant amount of their time, energy and resources in research and development and trying to come up with novel ways of doing things.  It is a policy choice.  As a country we must decide whether we want that to happen in Ireland - if we want Irish companies to be innovative and to invest time, energy and resources in developing new products that could make significant positive differences in society and the economy.  Ultimately, we must consider whether we want foreign companies that are making decisions on where to carry out that research and development to decide to invest and create jobs in Ireland, or whether we should just sit on our hands and allow those jobs and investments to go elsewhere.  We have made our policy decision.  It is one that is internationally recognised as having merit in terms of investment in growth, and that is the reason OECD economies are increasingly driven by knowledge-based development.  It is also the reason the new rules and the new modified nexus recognises the opportunities such boxes provide.</p> <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett also made the point that if there was a tiny change to a product, it would still qualify the company to use the arrangement.  The point I was trying to make earlier is that if there was a tiny change there would be a tiny benefit.  The benefit is proportionate to the qualifying asset - the amount that was invested in the change.  I wish to make that clear as well.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked whether companies that used the double Irish could not just use the knowledge development box instead.  The non-resident company that formed part of the double Irish structure typically owned highly valuable intellectual property which was tax-resident in a zero-tax jurisdiction.</p><p>The substantial research and development activity that led to the development of such intellectual property has typically already been developed, often in the United States.  Following the rules agreed to by the OECD, to which we are referring as the modified nexus, the box has been designed in such a way that the 6.25% rate should only apply to profits that are the result of substantive research and development carried out in Ireland.  In essence, this means that if a country earns 50% from its research and development that led to the development of an asset in Ireland, 50% of the income arising from that asset will qualify for the KDB rate.  It is good that we are aspiring to have that research and development carried out in this country as it will benefit our constituents and the economy, but I take the point that the Deputy and I will not agree on it.</p><p> The Deputy also raised the issue of transfer pricing and royalties.  Differences can, obviously, arise in the legal and tax systems between countries, an issue we have discussed.  International tax planning takes account of these differences in national systems and rules.  From an Irish perspective, the profits arising here are taxed at the appropriate rate.  The Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 requires that a company's trading profits be computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice, subject to any adjustment required by tax law.  In computing such profits expenses incurred wholly and exclusively for the purpose of trade, including royalties and licence fees paid for the use of intellectual property, are deductible.  The tax code contains transfer pricing rules that apply the OECD's arm's length pricing principles to trading transactions between associated companies.  This ensures the profits chargeable to corporation tax in Ireland fully reflect the functions, assets and risks located here by a multinational group.</p><p> What companies do outside Ireland is beyond the scope of the Irish tax system.  That is the reason we have been having discussions at OECD level for the past few years.  We cannot conclusively determine the effective rate of tax paid under international tax structures by reference to the taxation paid in Ireland alone.  However, we are continuing to work with international bodies to ensure there is fair play on the international stage.  That is what the OECD process is about.  Regardless of how long I speak, I doubt that the Deputy and I will agree on this issue, but that is the explanation of my position and that of the Government.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.286" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/993" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12015111800002#F00200"><p>What is the expectation for the additional research and development activity this will generate over time?  The Minister of State has put a cost on the introduction of the knowledge development box of &euro;50 million in a full year, which presumably means that some of the profits currently taxed at 12.5% will be taxed at 6.25% when the knowledge development box is implemented.  For me, the real value of having a knowledge development box is that is generates additional investment, additional research and development related activity and, ultimately, additional employment and corporation tax revenue.  That must be the objective and the ultimate measure of whether this will work.  There should not be a cost to the State by way of tax forgone in net terms in the introduction of a knowledge development box.  The purpose is not just to change the basis on which certain profits are taxed from one rate to another, as that would not achieve the overall purpose.</p> <p>  What the Minister of State said about the European Union was interesting.  It does not require separate approval from the European Union because it meets the OECD standard.  However, that does not mean that the European Union will not at some stage initiate a probe, as it is entitled to do and as it did in the case of the United Kingdom's patent box some time ago.  Will the Minister of State clarify where this places Ireland in terms of its attractiveness as a location for research and development related activity?  Our rate of 6.25% is lower than the 10% rate in the United Kingdom.  Are there other countries in Europe that offer similar rates?  Where do we rank in the European Union, in particular?</p> <p>  On what Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett said, the key issue in terms of profit shifting, undoubtedly, relates to transfer pricing, royalty payments and moving profits from one jurisdiction to another.  As long as there are so-called Crown dependencies and overseas territories of the United Kingdom such as Bermuda, the Cayman Islands and the Virgin Islands which charge no corporation tax, companies will do what they can to channel profits to these destinations.  The way to deal with that issue is through international co-operation.  What we can control here directly are the allowable deductions against trading profits, capital allowances, research and development allowable expenditure, losses forward and so forth.  However, we must nail the issue of transfer pricing because profits are being moved from one jurisdiction to another through the transfer pricing mechanism.  Ultimately, however, I always make the point that this is about real jobs.  Last week Apple announced an additional 1,000 jobs in Cork.  When they come on stream, there will be 6,000 people in Cork city working for Apple, which is truly extraordinary.  Ireland cannot be compared with the brass plate operations in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands which are book companies facilitating the transfer of billions of euro to destinations where there is no corporation tax charged.  That is what it is about.  Until that matter is dealt with collaboratively with other countries on an international basis, we can only get our house in order.</p> <p>  I welcome the introduction of the knowledge development box, but it is right to probe and ask serious questions about it because it should enhance value and revenue.  Ultimately, that will be the measure of it.</p></speech>

I also agree that the value and benefit of the knowledge development box, KDB, to the economy should be measured in new research and development, additional jobs and investment.</p> <p>  To clarify my earlier comments on the OECD process and the European Union, while the Irish box complies with the OECD BEPS process owing to the modified nexus, that modified nexus has now been adopted in the EU code of conduct.  The European Union has given the OECD model the seal of approval, for want of a better phrase, in that regard.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked where this positioned Ireland.  That is a key question.  As the Deputy knows from engaging with multinational companies in his constituency and nationally, tax is only one element.  Companies locate here for a variety of reasons, including our talented workforce, the low turnover and high retention rates of staff, the ease of doing business, infrastructure, connectivity, access to the European Union and being the only English speaking nation in the eurozone.  This is another tool in the toolkit.  It is just one tool but when one combines it with all of the other parts of Ireland's offering and the roadmap for tax competitiveness, it places us in a strong position.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked if other countries had patent boxes.  The United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium, Hungary, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey and China have them, but ours is the only such box that is compliant with the OECD modified nexus.  As a result, it is highly likely that the boxes in competitor jurisdictions will have to be updated, modified or changed.  Luxembourg has announced that it is ending its box.  The United Kingdom is now obliged to consult on updating its box and Spain has recently announced details of its updated box.  Ireland is well positioned and IDA Ireland and the Government can now state proudly that people can come to this country, carry out research and development and avail of the knowledge development box knowing that it is fully OECD compliant and compliant with the new modified nexus.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about new research and development.  That is a pertinent question.  Anecdotally, we all know that more effort and time are being put into research, development and innovation.  One of the hard facts is the increase in the amount being availed of through the research and development tax credit, which dramatically increased from approximately &euro;290 million in 2012 to &euro;430 million in 2013.  This shows that an increasing number of companies, including Irish companies, are availing of the tax credit to carry out research and development in this country.  We must continue to monitor this closely and ensure we are putting supports in place in order that Ireland can be competitive and proudly invite people to come here as a good location in which to conduct their research and development.  We can also tell Irish indigenous companies that they can carry out their research and development here and that the Government and the State will support them.</p></speech>

I was referring to the fact that, according to the reports, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, was discussing the knowledge development box with multinationals and essentially seeking their approval.</p><p>He received very positive feedback.  There have been many such meetings with key multinationals which are not happy that there is a move internationally to close down tax avoidance schemes, but it is not the job of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, or any other Minister, to reassure them that we will not go after more of their profits in tax and that is what it sounded like in the reports.  It sounded like we were reassuring them.  I wish the Government had engaged with the water charges protesters and asked them what they would like in the tax code and how they would like taxes to be levied.  If it had, we would have a very different tax system.</p></speech>

That is not right.  The amount of tax they pay on their profits is shockingly low and obscene compared to the amount ordinary workers must pay and we should seek more from them.  Our proposal is to charge them 12.5% as a minimum effective tax rate and specify that allowances or deductions would kick in only after they had paid the 12.5%.  God almighty, 12.5% is a pretty low level of tax for them to pay on their astronomical profits.  However, even 12.5% is not low enough for these companies and we are giving them a mechanism by which they can pay half of it, which is what they have been paying through other mechanisms.  It is no coincidence that the figure set for the KDB is 6.25%.  According to EUROSTAT, 6.25% is approximately what these companies are paying.  We are establishing a system which will ensure they will not have to pay any extra tax.  We should be asking them to pay a little extra.</p> <p>  This will come back and bite us all.  If the Minister of State walks down to the Liberties area where Guinness is based, he will notice that Guinness built houses for its workers, parks, swimming pools and other infrastructure.  It was not a sublimely progressive or benevolent entity.  It made a lot of money for itself, but it understood that, in order for it to make profits and sustain its business, it had to contribute something to the infrastructure and give the employees who made its profits for it houses, basic sanitation levels, etc.  These multinationals do not think they have such responsibilities.  However, they rely on our infrastructure and need our educated workforce.  We are running into a problem, whereby the lack of affordable accommodation in the city may become a disincentive for the multinationals to locate here.</p></speech>

Why do we not have the money to provide affordable accommodation?  The answer is we will not make these companies pay taxes to contribute to our universities and infrastructure, including water infrastructure, on which they rely heavily.  They do not want to pay anything towards the cost of our infrastructure and we are facilitating them.  It is a pity we do not demand that they pay a minimum of 12.5% which they could well afford and which would give us &euro;4 billion extra in tax.</p></speech>

We can contrast this with the figure for citizens in County Wicklow, whom the Minister of State represents, who pay a tax rate of 40%.  They will not have a knowledge development box or any other tax loophole.  Ireland has been a leader in competition on corporation tax rates.  It is a central element of our international economic attractiveness.  Competition in corporation tax rates robs the citizen and locates the profits in the hands of the corporations.  Over time, it erodes the tax base and transfers money to corporations.  Around the world countries are losing corporation tax, given that they are forced to reduce their corporation tax rates as a result of a very negative competition that Ireland is leading.</p> <p>  Some 50% of the planet's wealth is owned by 1% of the population.  This extremely unequal distribution of wealth is being driven by a number of very large corporations which are making massive profits, on which they are not being taxed, while citizens are being taxed.  The Government, instead of having a big flashing neon light over the State stating &ldquo;bargain basement corporation taxes, please come in&rdquo;, must invest more in education and show it has a smarter, better educated citizenry than any other country.  We must say we have a broadband system that will beat anybody&rsquo;s such that events such as the Web Summit will not have to leave.  We must say we have a transport infrastructure in which, if an accident takes place on the Lucan bypass or the M50, the whole of the Dublin region&rsquo;s transport network will not be snarled up.</p> <p>  Paul Krugman has carried out analysis which shows that the sunshine states of America are experiencing more growth owing to the fact that their house prices are far lower than in New York and other centres.  Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett is correct.  When a company such as PayPal asks its staff if they have spare rooms to provide accommodation for potential workers in the company, it is clear that our infrastructure is snarled up.  We have reached capacity in areas that should be competitive advantages for the country.  The level of the Government's investment will decrease between now and 2020, according to the figures included in the spring statement.  We are at the bottom of the list when it comes to Government investment in these areas, which means that our competitive advantage will weaken and become more located in bargain basement corporation tax rates.  There is no doubt in my mind that the knowledge development box is part of it.  We have been forced down this route owing to the lack of Government investment.</p></speech>

Therefore, the tax rate in Northern Ireland is primarily a matter for the Northern Ireland authorities and the British Government.</p><p>The Irish Government is fully supportive of any measures that will help promote the all-island economy and make the island of Ireland more wholly competitive.  However, as I was saying in my exchange with Deputy McGrath, a low stable corporate tax rate is only one piece of that broader, more complex competitiveness jigsaw.  A reform of the Northern Ireland corporation tax system does, in my view and in the view of the Department of Finance and the Government, have the potential to generate benefits on both parts of the island.  That can only be good for the island of Ireland and the economy, North and South.  It is obviously a very current issue in terms of yesterday's announcement.

Let us remember where the modified nexus for knowledge development boxes came from.  It did not come from this Government, from the Department of Finance or from the Minister, Deputy Noonan.  The modified nexus came from the OECD BEPS process, which recognised that while there is benefit in having boxes that enable and incentivise research and development, investment and growth, it is important that those boxes do not allow or facilitate aggressive tax planning.  The modified nexus is exactly what we have applied to our knowledge development box, which means that as we sit here today in this committee room, Ireland is the only country that has a knowledge development box that is compliant with the OECD modified nexus, which was put in place to reduce aggressive tax planning.  We just need to see this debate in that context.  This was an important measure put in place to combat aggressive tax planning.</p> <p>  Whether we like it or not, research and development is happening.  Every day, companies in Ireland and around the globe are using the brains of our brightest to develop new products, new ways of doing things and novel inventions to make the lives of our citizens better.  We have a choice: do we want that research and development to happen, in terms of jobs and investment in this country, or do we want Irish companies who wish to engage in research and development feeling they need to leave and move to another jurisdiction that is more supportive of incentivising that research and development, and foreign direct investment and multinational company members sitting in boardrooms around the globe today deciding they are not going to Ireland but to another jurisdiction?  I know my position on this and I know the Government's position.  We want to make sure we have a competitive but transparent regime in place to attract jobs and investment in terms of innovation, research, patents and copyright.  As has always been the industrial policy of this country through successive Governments, we want that to be based on substance and real jobs.  That is why we are doing this.</p> <p>  I am still confused about the difficulty with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Employment engaging with multinationals.  Obviously we are going to talk to businesses to see what we are doing well in this country that is making them likely to invest more in the country.  We had a public consultation process and there has been active engagement with stakeholders.  Those stakeholders included a range of NGOs over the course of 2015.  There was also a public consultation in 2015.  There were nearly 40 written submissions and officials met nearly 100 companies.  The process also included engagement with a range of Government agencies and Departments, including Enterprise Ireland, which works with indigenous Irish companies.  As is always the case with public consultations, the submissions received will be published on the Department of Finance's website.  I do not think I can say anything more to influence or change anyone's mind.</p></speech>

The general issues have been bashed around and will be again on Report Stage.  Will there be an upper limit on the amount of relief a company can get?  The Minister of State spoke about small and medium enterprises, and I am all for incentivising small and medium enterprises, but I do not believe they will be the main beneficiaries.  If it was targeted at small and medium enterprises, as the Minister of State suggested, should there not be an upper limit on how much any company can benefit?</p></speech>

However, it is missing public transparency.  It is very interesting that the public still is not allowed know what is happening.  In England, for example, when it was found out that large multinationals operating there - Google, Starbucks and a number of others - were paying extremely low corporation tax rates, the people of the country became quite annoyed and political pressure on these organisations started to grow.  These organisations began to say they had to maintain good public relations with customers, and that they would, therefore, step up to the plate regarding a better corporation tax regime.  Society is a powerful leverage with regard to tax justice.  If the information is not made public, consumers are not making full decisions on the justice behind the behaviour of these companies.  It is not good for the public not to have this power and knowledge.  Although we live in an information society, this information is withheld.  It neutralises the citizens&rsquo; ability to effect change on these companies.</p><p>I alluded earlier to the fact that many developing countries feel they are being robbed of tax by the fact that we have bargain basement tax rates here.  These countries are not necessarily in the same global tax treaties as we are.  Therefore, even though country by country reporting is going to happen, they may not have full access to the information.  These are the poorest countries, and they are likely to lose out regarding global taxation rules.</p><p>One of my worries is that I do not know how much profit companies such as Tesco make in the State.  This is a long-term bugbear of mine.  The Revenue understands, and there is a report into Revenue of the profits that are made, and they paid tax on this basis.  However, the citizen and the consumer of these large companies are deemed unworthy of full knowledge of their expenditure.  The companies operate within this State and tax is an enormous part of the justice of any state.  We, as citizens, cannot ascertain whether these companies are fulfilling tax justice.</p></speech>

Under the internationally agreed approach for country-by-country reporting, the reports filed and shared with the tax authorities must remain confidential.  The OECD and other countries involved in agreeing the BEPS report have been clear about it.</p><p>The nub of the reason I cannot accept the amendment arises from the fact that if Revenue was to make these reports publicly available, other countries would be entitled to stop exchanging country-by-country reports with Ireland.  This would result in a lot less information being made available to our tax authorities, in this case the Revenue Commissioners, and dilute the significant benefit of this important BEPS measure, which I know the Deputy welcomes. </p><p> The purpose of country-by-country reporting is to provide Revenue with the information necessary to make informed risk assessments.  It will give a clear overview of the global activities of large corporate groups.  This will enable Revenue to target audits and interventions by highlighting where there may be particular transfer pricing, something we discussed.  Making the reports public would not improve Revenue's ability to carry out this work.  Instead, it would actually make it much more difficult as Revenue would not receive, as I said, the country-by-country reports filed with the other tax authorities.</p><p> Separate from the OECD proposal for country-by-country reporting to tax authorities which is being introduced in the Finance Bill, which means that this country is implementing this proposal very quickly, the European Commission is examining the issue of public country-by-country reporting.  This would require companies to make information about operations, activities and profits in each country in which they operate publicly available, which is something the Deputy would welcome.  The Commission recently held, as the Deputy will know, a public consultation on the issue and has commissioned an impact assessment.  I and the Minister for Finance await the outcome of the impact assessment, but in any event departmental officials and the Minister will continue to engage actively in the debate on the issue at an EU level while introducing country-by-country reporting to tax authorities as agreed at the OECD as part of the BEPS process.</p><p> In general, I and the Minister, Deputy Noonan, believe it is important that a consistent approach is adopted globally to country-by-country reporting.  If we do not have a globally consistent approach, we are nearly back to square one.  For the reasons I have outlined, I am not in a position to accept the Deputy's amendment.</p></speech>

Does he think it is right that people are kept in the dark with regard to their expenditure and the tax justice behind that?

My exchange today has been with Deputies T&oacute;ib&iacute;n and Boyd Barrett.  They have rightly highlighted the need for certain information to be available to Revenue and have expressed concerns about the lack of information available.  Extra information will be available to the Revenue Commissioners and other tax authorities that we did not have before.</p> <p>  I am a firm believer in a co-ordinated and consistent multilateral approach.  As I said, the EU is carrying out an impact assessment of the issue.  We will do what any prudent Government would do, namely, when the impact assessment is completed, we will assess it and make our position very clear at that stage.</p> <p>  There is another fundamental issue.  Taxpayer information is confidential.  I do not know Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's tax information details nor do I want to.

We will wait and see the outcome of the impact assessment, but I remain to be convinced about the benefit of taxpayer information being publicised.  I want to have an independent and robust tax authority that has all the information available to it.</p> <p>  Like I said, the tax information relating to the Deputy, me, his and my party is not public.  Are we going to decide that certain people's or organisations' tax information will be public?  That is why the European Union is examining the issue and why there is an impact assessment.  It is important to recognise the progress that has been made.  If Ireland does one thing on its own, that can have knock-on consequences.

This was leaked to several European Governments before it was leaked to the media and absolutely nothing happened.  As a result of the inaction of governments across Europe, it was leaked to a host of international media organisations which then published the information.  That is one example of why we need public country-by-country reporting.</p> <p>  To put it bluntly, governments cannot be trusted to make known to the public important information that is in the public interest.  I am reading quite a good paper on this very issue, which points out -  the Minister of State can confirm whether this is true - that the Irish tax authority has 201 members of staff in its office for large taxpayers, but this covers more than 12,000 companies of domestic and foreign origin, among which are 1,000 foreign transnational enterprises.  The paper goes on to point out that even with the best systems and procedures, it seems unlikely that 201 staff members would be able to scrutinise effectively and ensure the accuracy of these companies' tax returns.  That seems like a pretty good point.</p> <p>  By having them publish the information, we would save ourselves a lot of work and effort.  It would allow the public and all sorts of people to scrutinise these accounts and establish whether multinationals are playing by the rules.  It would establish whether Government policy is working.  It might be useful to know what subsidies of various types are going to companies.  The public is entitled to know all this information, particularly given the sheer size and significance of multinational companies, many of whom have bigger economies than large countries.</p> <p>  These companies are like Colossi, dominating the world economic system, and we know very little about what they are really up to.  They have extraordinary influence on what happens in the world, to the point that, effectively, they can blackmail governments.  They have pretty much succeeded in doing that here because the Government is afraid of them.</p></speech>

Regardless of that sub-committee, they should attend to answer questions just as they had to appear before the British Parliament and the American Congress.</p> <p>  In 2014, PricewaterhouseCoopers conducted a poll of business leaders, of whom 59% stated that there should be public country-by-country reporting.  Even the business leaders do not see a problem with it, yet a minority of business leaders - those associated with the large multinationals - and governments with close relationships with those multinationals do not want it.  I do not see how anyone can sustain the claim that we do not need this information, given the aggressive tax avoidance of such companies, their importance to all of our lives and the way in which they influence the global economy.  It is not on that this reporting would not be done publicly.</p></speech>

It will empower the independent taxation authority - the Revenue Commissioners - to have information available to it.  The Deputy was at pains to point out examples of where such information, which Revenue did not have previously, would be useful.  I presume that, regardless of his view on whether information should be public, he accepts the logic of the current situation, whereby if we unilaterally decided to conduct country-by-country reporting, we would deprive Revenue of the vital information it needed.  The Deputy is looking confused.</p></speech>

The OECD BEPS process agreed country-by-country reporting on the condition that the information remained confidential, as all taxpayers' information remains.  If the Oireachtas decides to make such information public, it will untangle the BEPS agreement and allow other taxation authorities not to give that information to the Revenue Commissioners because we are not in compliance with the agreement.  That would be an extraordinarily foolish step to take.</p></speech>

Let us see where they go.</p> <p>  I will make a point about HSBC because the Deputy was not factually correct.  The Committee of Public Accounts probably received information regarding HSBC, but it is important to point out that there were three prosecutions in this country in respect of issues arising from that situation.  My understanding is that it all occurred before any information was made public.  Can we please give credit to the Revenue Commissioners for the job that they do?  If the Deputy wants a comparator, the UK received information on more than 1,000 cases, which resulted in one prosecution.  In this country, Revenue received information on fewer than 100 cases, which resulted in three prosecutions.  The Deputy must recognise the benefit in the role of independent Revenue Commissioners.  We decide tax policy and it is their job implement it.  They do that well.</p></speech>

The basis of many of these changes is the fact that Ireland has been an outlier as regards corporate tax, which has cost us dearly in terms of the amount of tax that we should have been receiving over a long number of years.  Changes have been made and are welcome, as is country-by-country reporting, but when the likes of Trinity College academic Professor Jim Stewart uses information from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis and estimates that the effective corporate tax paid by foreign firms is 2.2%, the damage caused by this policy shocks to the bone.  It all affects everyday human experiences.  Yesterday, we discussed with the Minister, Deputy Noonan, the 7,700 people on trolleys since the start of this year in my local hospital in County Meath, the 400,000 people on health service waiting lists, the 130,000 people on housing waiting lists and the thousands of children in emergency accommodation.  Two weeks ago, a woman rang me from a tent with her daughter because of the lack of housing in County Meath.</p><p>We see on the one hand a country whose delivery of public services has been vandalised significantly over the past five to ten years, and on the other an effective corporation tax rate - not by my estimation but that of the US Bureau of Economic Analysis and Trinity College academics - of 2.5%.  That is jarring information.  Citizens in all the constituencies are paying income tax at a marginal rate of 40%.  The purpose of this amendment and the previous amendment is to empower citizens with information and to ensure that they are no longer left in the dark as regards their spending power and their understanding of the contribution that companies make to the tax base of the State, and that information is to be made clear.</p><p> I understand the Minister stated that a change within the agreed negotiated position would reduce the ability for that to function properly.  However, there is a logic to what I am saying.  Potentially, the Minister would become a champion of information to citizens.  He should seek to push this, either through the mechanism within the amendment or in negotiations on an OECD and a European basis.</p></speech>

Obviously there are lots of different figures quoted for effective corporation tax rates, but the report, which was co-authored by Mr. Seamus Coffey and the Department of Finance, found that the effective corporate tax rate in this country was 10.7% or 10.9%, and that is documented in the report that we published.</p></speech>

I am not accepting them on the basis of the report that the Department published and co-authored with Mr. Seamus Coffey.  Let me respond directly to the amendment from Deputies T&oacute;ib&iacute;n and Doherty.</p> <p>  At 12.5%, as we have already discussed at length, Ireland has one of the most competitive headline corporate tax rates in the OECD.  Our competitive rate of corporation tax has been an important part of industrial policy in this country since the 1950s, and has attracted real and substantive operations to Ireland since then.  I refer the Deputy to an ESRI report published on budget day last year which showed what would have happened in terms of job losses and investments not made had we altered the rate of corporation tax to a higher level.</p> <p>  All companies in Ireland pay the standard 12.5% rate on their profits generated in Ireland.  A standard 25% rate applies in respect of investment, rental and other non-trading profits and profits from certain petroleum, mining or land-dealing activities.  A rate of 33% is applied to the chargeable gains of companies.</p> <p>  Some other countries may have a high headline rate of corporation tax which is then supplemented by a high number of tax reliefs.  The approach in Ireland, however, is more transparent.  We have a relatively low headline rate of corporation tax, which is applied to a broad base.  We therefore have only a small number of incentives in Ireland, but we ensure that these are targeted.  They are focused, first, on the creation of additional employment, as is consistent with current Government policy, and second, on areas of innovation, as we have already discussed, with a view to generating high-value-added economic activity.</p> <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in 2014 the Department of Finance produced a technical paper, Effective Rates of Corporation Tax in Ireland, for this committee.  The paper was produced - I acknowledge the work of this committee - as a result of discussions held during the Committee Stage of previous year's Finance Bill.  It contained a comprehensive analysis of effective rates of corporation tax paid.  It was submitted to the committee and published in April 2014.  The paper was prepared in order to provide clarity about the seemingly conflicting figures that are frequently quoted, and is an excellent resource for those seeking to understand and obtain more information about what is clearly a complex technical issue.</p> <p>  There is no internationally agreed standard for calculating effective rates of tax.  Therefore, the paper examined three different methodologies used in the calculation of effective rates of corporation tax generally.  The paper also analysed eight different figures that are quoted in respect of Ireland in greater detail.  Each of these different approaches is relevant depending on the nature of the question being addressed.  However, in attempting to assess the effective corporate tax rate applying to the total profits earned by companies in Ireland, the paper concluded that the approach based on national aggregate statistics from the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Statistics Office is the most suitable.</p> <p>  The paper found that the effective rates of corporation tax, as measured according to statistics from these two sources, are reasonably close to the headline rate of 12.5%, and that the difference is mainly accounted for by double taxation relief and a small number of other reliefs, including the research and development tax credit.  The report was based upon the analysis of effective rates across a ten-year period and, therefore, does not need to be re-examined on an annual basis.  On the basis of this extensive analysis, we are comfortable that companies in Ireland are paying the appropriate rate of corporate tax on profits generated by those companies in Ireland.</p> <p>  In relation to the publication of details on the effective rates of corporation tax paid by individual companies in the State, both the Department and the Revenue Commissioners would encounter, as we have already outlined in previous discussions, a number of issues regarding the confidentiality of individual taxpayers.  There are strict taxpayer confidentiality rules which would prohibit the Revenue Commissioners from providing taxpayer-specific information.  It would not, therefore, be feasible to publish any individual details while maintaining a taxpayer's right to confidentiality.</p> <p>  In the budget, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, announced that from 2016 onwards that certain multinational companies would be required to submit to the Revenue Commissioners an annual report of their groups' activities on a country-by-country basis - we have dealt with that already.  This will ensure that the Revenue Commissioners have improved information about the global activities of multinational companies and will help them with assessing high-level transfer pricing risks.</p> <p>  Between this new country-by-country reporting and the fact that a detailed report was provided to this committee following on from previous engagement with this committee, the Minister does not see the need to publish another report on an annual basis, considering the report looked at a ten-year period.  Given that a detailed report has previously been prepared by my Department and the need to allocate scarce resources most effectively, I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment.</p></speech>

They go from the 2.2% rate from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis to the EUROSTAT or so-called implicit rate, which is estimated at 5.9% for Ireland.  I do not accept 10.7% as a credible estimate of the effective rate precisely because, as I explained earlier, it is after the deductions that have been the mechanism through which these companies have aggressively avoided tax using intellectual property and patents.  That method of calculating the effective rate comes in after all that has been taken out of their taxable income, and one ends up with something that looks like 12.5%, but it is following the deduction of billions of euro in profits under the heading of trade charges.</p> <p>  I also believe, as I stated earlier, that it was a huge gap in the remit of that investigation into the effective rates that we did not bring some of the companies at the centre of this controversy in here to be questioned in detail about their tax affairs.  We did not get to the bottom of what was going on with effective tax rates.  The public still has the right to know the truth about this matter.</p></speech>

the exclusion from the relief of disposals by entrepreneurs of shareholdings in a company or companies which they started and which may become a quoted or public company is removed; and the amendment ensures that the relief should not be denied in cases of a reconstruction or reorganisation of a business where an original company or shareholding is replaced with a new company or new shares.</p><p> I commend the amendment to the Committee.</p></speech>

That is important, because lumping both together does not make sense.  Active investment, where investment is being made to improve the functionality and health of a business, will have outcomes for the State in that it will make the business more competitive and, hopefully, lead to more employment.  There is no doubt that this type of investment needed to be differentiated from passive investment.</p><p>My concern here is that the Government took a huge jump in reducing rates here and that this is a significant cut.  There has been significant analysis in regard to the Government having hollowed out the tax base, to a certain extent, in the budget.  USC contributors to the tax base who are on salaries over &euro;75,000 have shared in the &euro;169,000 in cuts to the USC on income below &euro;75,000.  This cut, along with the collapse in CGT here, is a difficult blow for Revenue.  Fine Gael has mentioned it expects to reduce USC further in the future and I understand there is an &euro;8 billion fiscal space in the next five years to get rid of USC, which would amount to &euro;4 billion.  This makes for a further significant cut in the tax base.  Given that we face so much pressure in regard to public service delivery, for example, the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, stated yesterday that universal health insurance is too costly and ambitious, the reduced revenue from USC and CGT at the same time, is a concern for us.</p><p>We welcome the differentiation between active and passive investment.  We were<i>en route</i>to a 33% rate for active investment and a 35% rate for passive investment but we were taken aback that the Government collapsed that to 20%. </p></speech>

These people are highly mobile and can decide to start or grow their business in any jurisdiction.  The regime being introduced is a step in the right direction.  The rate in the UK is 10% for entrepreneurs.  The level here is quite low, a threshold of &euro;1 million, but it is a step in the right direction.

I know that earlier this year the Minister established a special working group comprising the Irish Charities Taxation Reform group, the Minister's Department and the Revenue Commissioners to examine how the impact of VAT on charities could be addressed.  The report published at budget time confirmed that the issue can be dealt with at national level by way of a compensation scheme rather than a direct rebate.  There are a number of such schemes already operating in different EU member states, including Denmark, which provides compensation with an in-built cap to limit exposure in the Danish exchequer.  The practical effect of the Danish scheme is to provide a partial refund of VAT to charities based on independent income collected by way of fund-raising.  I fully understand the concern that would exist in the Department to limit the scope of any change because it could ultimately continue to rise and lead, in effect, to a demand-led process, which would be of concern.</p><p>The essence of the issue is that various charities are working exceptionally hard, raising money through their volunteer networks in many cases and buying goods and services for end-users.  However, they also pay VAT.  As this is not in the course of business, as such, the charities are not able to register for VAT and reclaim any they pay.  There is an equity issue that must be very carefully examined.  I welcome the steps taken so far with the special working group but I would like us to go further with this Bill and have a report on the introduction of a capped VAT compensation scheme for charities prepared.</p></speech>

A report from the group was provided to me in my deliberations ahead of the 2016 budget.  It was published and is available on the budget 2016 website.</p> <p>  We have not taken any action on foot of the report because tax expenditures can be quite a blunt instrument and I am not convinced they constitute the best way to address the issue.  Following consultation with other member states, the report of the working group found relatively limited favourable VAT treatment for charities across Europe.  Furthermore, the existing ministerial refund orders already in place in Ireland provide some VAT relief to charitable causes.  Introducing a VAT refund scheme for charities would also, most likely, lead to similar claims from other VAT-exempt organisations, most notably sporting organisations.  Requests for new ministerial refund orders have been consistently refused since the 1980s, primarily to maintain the integrity of the VAT system.</p></speech>

The Minister seems to have concluded his own deliberations on the matter but he might clarify if the report is still under consideration.  Has the Minister reached the conclusion that this does not warrant any change to the VAT system?  It is important to establish the view of the Department and the Minister.</p> <p>  I understand the concern that this could lead to further calls in other sectors, especially from sporting bodies, which could make a legitimate case.  They are selling lottery tickets and fund-raising every week to buy equipment and pay for services on which they pay VAT.</p><p>There is a legitimate concern that there would be further related demands.  The Minister might clarify his comment that there is already provision for some VAT relief for charitable causes.  If he has a note on that provision or any information on what it involves, it would be helpful to this debate also.</p></speech>

In my party's alternative budget we proposed that a 3% tax be paid by the punter.  My party has engaged massively with many of the smaller firms operating within the industry.  We have heard the view that a 1% turnover tax on a small firm could equate to a tax of 20% or 30% on the profits made by that firm.  Therefore, we have decided that a 3% tax should be paid by the punter.  That would lift the weight from the smaller operator or bookie and create a level playing field.  The proceeds of such a tax could be used to fund the horseracing industry or resource services for people with gambling addictions, etc.  It would establish greater revenues.  There is a concern, especially among smaller operators in this sector, that one or two very large players in the gambling industry have a great deal of influence and control.  It has been suggested they potentially have the ear of the Government.  Does the Minister agree that it would be economically beneficial to small businesses that are trying to create jobs and that it would improve the market structure if the burden was not placed on small operators in the manner in which it is currently placed on them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.424" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12015111800002#BB00900"><p>The Betting (Amendment) Act 2015 was enacted on 15 March last.  It provides a regulatory system for remote bookmakers and betting intermediaries, otherwise known as betting exchanges, that offer betting services in Ireland, regardless of their location.  The Act provides for fair and equal treatment of all bookmakers by extending betting duty to remote operators, thereby widening the tax base and protecting the Exchequer from the leakage of potential tax revenue.  Prior to the enactment of the legislation, excise duty was payable at a rate of 1% on bets entered into with a traditional bookmaker.  Since the application of duty to the remote sector from 1 August 2015, licensed remote bookmakers are now liable for 1% duty on the amount of a bet from customers in the State and licensed remote betting intermediaries are now liable for 15% duty on the commission charged to customers in the State.  </p> <p>  There have been a number of calls for an increase in the rate of duty applying to betting.  However, my preferred approach has been to put a regulatory regime in place for the sector and then to extend the base on which the 1% rate applies, thereby ensuring the tax is applied fairly and widely on a level playing field for all.  This system is now in place.  The first two months of duty from the remote sector have yielded &euro;3.3 million, which would imply a yield of approximately &euro;20 million in a full year.  It is better to wait until the new remote taxation regime has bedded in before considering changes to the rate and type of taxation.  As I said, the priority is to allow time for the new regulatory regime to bed in.  In addition, the application of a charge directly on the punter as requested would be problematic.  Punters who bet via remote means are highly sensitive and such a change would incentivise tax avoidance.  All betting firms, including betting exchanges, share this view.  They would prefer the tax liability to remain with the firms.  That these companies would prefer to bear the tax is a clear indication of how challenging it would be to enforce this proposal.  </p> <p>  All taxes are reviewed on an ongoing basis by officials from my Department and Revenue.  I assure the Deputy that the betting tax will be kept under review to monitor the operation of the new regime.  Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

In regard to section 6 which amends section 123B of the 1999 Act, I announced in the Budget Statement that I was replacing the current flat rate charges for cash cards and debit cards of &euro;2.50 and &euro;5, respectively, with a charge of 12 cent for each cash withdrawal from an ATM.  I am seeking to incentivise consumers to use more modern forms of payment such as debit cards instead of withdrawing cash from ATMs.  I am also seeking to reduce the amount of cash in circulation.  After the publication of the Finance Bill, my officials engaged in further consultation with representatives of the financial services sector.  A number of amendments are proposed on foot of this consultation.  The amendments are intended to address concerns that have been raised about the practical effects of changing from a flat rate charge to a charge based on usage.  They will also generally update section 123B of the 1999 Act in order that it reflects current banking practice.</p><p>Amendment No. 69, the main amendment in the group, specifies 31 December in each year as the date that determines whether a charge arises.  A charge will arise where the particular card is valid on that date and where the cardholder has an address in the State on that date.  The charge is also being confined to cash withdrawals from ATMs situated in the State.  Provision is being made for circumstances in which a card that is cancelled or expires during a year is replaced by another card before 31 December of that year.  The original card and the replacement card are treated as a single card for the purposes of liability to the stamp duty charge and imposing the monetary cap on the charge.</p><p>There are a series of minor technical amendments in relation to the removal of references to debit cards as such cards, within the meaning of section 123B, have become redundant.  In practice, cards that a debit function only have been replaced by cards that contain the dual functions of a cash card and a debit card.  Section 123B refers to such cards as combined cards.  The higher monetary cap of &euro;5 compared to the lower cap of &euro;2.50 is only applied where both functions of a &quot;combined card&quot; are used.  Where only the cash card function is used the lower monetary cap applies.  <br/><br/>An amendment that is not connected with the charge on the basis of charge was made to sections 123B and section 124 of the Finance Bill, as published, so as to update the definitions used in these sections for different types of financial institution.  These definitions are based on those used in EU regulations.  However, an unintended consequence of adopting the current EU regulation was to bring An Post and credit unions within the charge to stamp duty.  These latest amendments to sections 123B and 124 exclude these bodies and maintain the <i>status quo</i>in relation to chargeable persons.  <br/><br/>I recommend the amendments to the House. </p></speech>

What the Minister is trying to do here to incentive electronic payments is a positive development.  In these amendments he is trying to deal with some of the anomalies that have been flagged on foot of the introduction of this measure.  As the Minister is aware this is on foot of the movement to the interchange fee cap which kicks in from 9 December.  Is it possible for the Minister to introduce it at an earlier date than 9 December? I asked on Second Stage that it be introduced from 1 December, purely because there are only 24 days in the run up to Christmas, to give retailers the maximum opportunity to comply, rather than on 9 December as proposed under the EU directive.</p> <p>  We are moving from a fixed rate charge per transaction to a percentage of the overall value of the transaction.  While that incentivises people to use cards for small payments the difficulty is it prohibits them from using cards for large payments because the charge is now a percentage of the overall bill.  Traditionally, the cohort that has been slowest to move from the cheque book has been the farming community.  If a farmer is buying cattle at a mart and given that the charge is a percentage of the transaction we are talking about a significant fee being generated which either the farmer or the co-operative in the mart has to carry.  Is it possible to have a look at the directive before it is implemented fully so that we are not introducing a further disincentive to electronic payments where large amounts are involved and forcing people to go back to the old paper-based systems and cheques?  I understand that some businesses that deal with large transactions including the co-operative livestock marts are looking to withdraw this particular service because of the banking fees involved. </p></speech>

My estimate is that is worth about &euro;37 million to the retail sector not in a transfer from the taxpayer but in a transfer from the banks and the finance houses.  That is beneficial.  I am advised that 9 December is a date that the industry has selected following EU regulation.  I have no role in setting the date so we cannot change it here.</p> <p>  Caps are being introduced on debit cards by Visa which will limit the total charge on debit cards to &euro;1.  That is additional information. </p></speech>

I know quite a number of people, some related to me, who work with cash and cheque book and would be horrified at the idea of buying a bullock with a piece of plastic.  It does not work out that way.  I am sure the Deputy knows such people also.  Younger people are more adaptable and will move on.  I do not think the effective date, as long as it is pretty quick, matters that much.  What matters is that we are putting the new facilities in place to encourage people to avail of these systems of payment which are electronically transacted.</p></speech>

I agree that people have some flexibility and an opportunity to reduce the level of stamp duty they are paying but this has to be viewed alongside the actual bank charges because these are Government charges.  Bank charges are a different animal.  The present bank charges can be very significant.  I have checked AIB as a case in point - it charges 35 cent for an ATM withdrawal, 20 cent for each debit card purchase, something the Minister is encouraging in the drive for an cashless society, combined debit card purchase with cash back, 20 cent and any staff assisted transaction, 39 cent.  These are the sample charges of one individual bank.  The Minister's policy is fine but it needs to be consistent with what the banks are doing in practice because the amount the customer is paying is the Government stamp duty plus the actual bank charges.</p><p>I submit the bank charges are not going in the same direction as the initiatives the Minister is proposing.  Has the Central Bank examined this issue?  Is it talking to the individual banks?  It is true that the staff-assisted transactions incur higher charges than automated transactions but if they did not impose such high charges for each withdrawal or debit card purchase, for example, people might be prepared to hold less cash.</p></speech>

I understand AIB charges 35 cent for a withdrawal at an ATM machine and Bank of Ireland charge 20 cent.  Some cards are free at point of use but they charge a quarterly fee.  One will find it has been done when one gets the statement, but Deputy McGrath is right.  There must be pressure on people and one of the most significant actions we took in this package of measures in the budget was to reduce the bank fee on the credit card and debit card transactions for purchasers in a shop, for example, from 20 cent to ten cent.  As I said to Deputy Naughten, that is a delivery of approximately &euro;37 million to the retail sector from the banks by reducing the fee.  It is something with which we will likely continue.</p></speech>

If a bank charges 20 cent to use that debit card to buy a newspaper for &euro;2, it is 10% of the cost of what they are buying so if they have cash in their pocket they will use that instead of using the debit card because of the cost incurred.  If it is a small transaction people will be much more likely to use cash because of the bank charges that apply to automated transactions.</p></speech>

I will read the full note.</p> <p>  There are two important dates that are relevant for the taxation of an inheritance.  These dates are used for different purposes. First, the date of death of a disponer is the date by reference to which the group tax-free thresholds and tax rates are determined.  Therefore, whatever thresholds and rates are in force on this date apply for the purpose of taxing the value of an inheritance.  These rules are based on statute and are strictly applied.</p> <p>  Second, the date on which probate or administration is granted is generally used as the "valuation" date.  The valuation date is the date on which the market value of the assets or property comprising the inheritance is established.  This market value is then compared to the relevant group threshold and the tax rate applied as appropriate on any excess of the market value over the threshold.  This date also determines when any inheritance tax must be paid and a tax return must be submitted to Revenue.  However, as stated, the thresholds and rates in force at the date of death of the disponer apply for the purpose of taxing the value of the inheritance.</p> <p>  Also, for capital gains tax, CGT, purposes, where a person acquires assets as a legatee of a deceased person, that person is treated as acquiring those assets at the date of death of the deceased person.</p> <p>  It is a general legislative principle that tax legislation should follow general law.  According to the law of inheritance an inheritor comes to own an inherited asset on the date of inheritance, rather than on any other date.  This is therefore the soundest and most appropriate date for the rules relating to the rates and thresholds relating to capital acquisitions tax, CAT, which are necessarily specific and precise to apply.</p> <p>  The amount of time elapsing between inheritance and grant of probate can vary greatly, and can also be determined to a large extent by inheritors themselves.  As such, were the rate of tax due and the tax-free threshold available to be defined by date of probate there would be considerable scope for individuals to delay probate with the hope that the CAT regime would become more favourable for them.</p> <p>  While I understand that there are inheritors for whom it would currently be advantageous for the tax-free threshold and rate of tax to apply according to the date of probate, as the threshold for inheritances from parents has been increased, there have been and could again be situations where the opposite is the case, for instance, when the thresholds have been reduced or the rate increased.</p> <p>  To apply CAT rules with respect to the date of probate would also be in conflict with the CGT provisions that treat the date of death of a deceased person as the acquisition date by a legatee for the purposes of that tax.</p></speech>

This proposal is to go further to increase it to &euro;300,000.  This is not an issue on which there is agreement.  Different parties and representatives have different perspectives on it but it is a legitimate aspiration for elderly people in particular who wish to pass on a home or another asset to a son, daughter or other family members and it should be encouraged because, ultimately, that asset has been built up after tax income, a point often forgotten.  People pay for the home and pay their mortgage from their net income, which has already been taxed.</p><p>The move the Minister has made is a significant one.  It is going in the right direction but I would like to see it go further.  Did the Minister examine at any stage the possibility of having a separate treatment for a home?  There are provisions in law whereby somebody can inherit their parent's house tax free if they have been living in it and caring for the parent for a period of time and so forth but has the Minister examined the issue of dealing with a home separately from other assets?  Also, why did he decide not to amend the thresholds that apply to the other two categories, B and C, for inheritances from wider family members?</p></speech>

The examination I did on the family home was to satisfy myself that persons who lived in the family home and who previously were acting as carers could inherit the family home without any inheritance tax liability.</p><p>Having established that this was the case and that the conditions attached were not very onerous, I did not move to make changes in this regard.  I changed the threshold from &euro;225,000 to &euro;280,000 because property prices have been increasing and the cuts the Government made in the thresholds on capital taxes were made when the State and the Exchequer were in penury and the Government needed every euro it could gather.  However, the provisions now are fairer, and this will be reviewed in future years if I am in a position to so do.  This year, while I initially looked beyond the parent-to-child transaction, I did not have enough resources to do anything more significant.  My point is that it was not because I disagreed in principle but because I thought it better to dedicate the resources I had to parent-child transactions, rather than letting it go out to those in class B and class C.</p></speech>

According to the figures he presented, the most affluent 20% in the State own 73% of the State's wealth, while the poorest 20% in the State had 0.2% of the wealth of the State.  By any judgment, this divide is severe and shocking.  He also stated that the combined wealth of the top 5% was almost double that of the entirety of middle earners - that is, the squeezed middle.  According to Revenue data, the top 1% of income earners in Ireland had an average income of &euro;373,300 on an annual basis, whereas the bottom 90% earned approximately &euro;27,000 per year.  Members are not discussing normal times by any means.  They are not talking about the 1970s or the 1980s or the normal left-right or rich-versus-poor debate.  This is about a modern phenomenon of incredibly concentrated wealth in the hands of extremely few people.  This has happened under the Minister's watch in recent years and many would state that it has accelerated under his watch.</p><p>The idea of a wealth tax is not new.  Interestingly, the Aire made an important and true statement yesterday, when he noted that there was a difference between wealth and income.  There is a significant difference between the two, and therefore there must be a method whereby both income and wealth are taxed.  There is a strong body of opinion worldwide to the effect that for those who have a high level of wealth, perhaps in excess of &euro;1 million, that is not concentrated in farms or businesses, the wealth itself can offer an opportunity to source income for the State and can be used to address the inequalities within the State.  The Nevin Institute calculated, on the basis of 2013 data from the Central Statistics Office, that a wealth tax which excluded people's homes, farmland, vehicles and pensions and which was levied at a rate of 0.5% could raise approximately &euro;400 million per annum.  In a response to a question from Deputy Pearse Doherty in the D&aacute;il Chamber a year or two ago, the Minister admitted that this was the ballpark figure.  Given the catastrophic division between rich and poor and given the life-and-death challenging experiences of many people at the bottom, would it not be a good idea to accept this amendment?  This amendment does not proceed as boldly as to suggest that a wealth tax should be implemented.  All it seeks is for a report to be written on the options available in this regard.  In other words, the Minister is merely being asked to research the options available in order that he might have the possibility of another tool in his toolbox regarding the raising of revenue.</p></speech>

I do not propose to accept this amendment.  The Government has no plans to introduce a wealth tax, although all taxes and potential taxation options are of course constantly reviewed.  Wealth can be taxed in a variety of ways, some of which are already in place in Ireland.  Capital gains tax, CGT, and capital acquisitions tax, CAT, are, in effect, taxes on wealth, as they are levied on an individual or company on the disposal of an asset, in the case of CGT, or the acquisition of an asset through gift or inheritance in the case of CAT.  Deposit interest retention tax, DIRT, is charged at 41%, with limited exemptions, on interest earned on deposit accounts.  The local property tax, which was introduced in 2013, is a tax based on the market value of residential properties.  The domicile levy introduced in budget 2010 also constitutes a form of wealth tax.  It is aimed at high-wealth individuals with a substantial connection to Ireland, regardless of whether they are tax-resident, to ensure they make a tax contribution to this country in a year of at least &euro;200,000.</p> <p>  In order to estimate the potential revenue from a wealth tax, it would first be necessary to identify the wealth held by individuals.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they currently have no statistical basis for compiling estimates on a potential wealth tax.  Although an individual's assets and liabilities are declared to the Revenue in a number of specific circumstances - for example, after a death - this information is not a complete measure of financial assets in the State, nor is it recorded in a manner that would allow analysis of the implications of an overarching wealth-based tax.  Comprehensive data on household wealth in Ireland, including assets and liabilities, were published for the first time earlier this year by the CSO.  These data have been collected across the entire eurozone according to a standardised methodology.  The data indicate that wealth inequality in Ireland for 2013, as measured by the Gini coefficient, is lower than the eurozone average.  The results also show that wealth is less concentrated at the top of the distribution here than the eurozone average.  Central Bank analysis of the data also indicates that while wealth inequality has increased since 2011, it is actually lower than in 2006, the earliest period for which data are available.</p> <p>  As part of the research programme agreed between my Department and the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, covering macroeconomic and taxation issues, a research project involving detailed analysis of wealth distribution and taxation has been included.  It is intended that this research project, based on the household finance and consumption survey, HFCS, published this year by the CSO, will commence shortly.  A number of the issues highlighted by the amendments proposed by Deputies Pearse Doherty and Richard Boyd Barrett, including the estimation of the potential tax base and the yield of a wealth tax in Ireland, already feature as part of the work planned for the project.  It should be noted that the data gathered by the CSO as part of the HFCS were not collected for the purpose of calculating the potential yield from a wealth tax but to collect general information on the financial situation and behaviour of households.</p> <p>  My Department will monitor and consider any additional information and data that come to light and will continue to examine potential taxation sources, as I stated at the beginning of this reply.</p><p>I do not intend to accept the amendment.</p><p> The Deputy referred at length to Mr. McWilliams's television programme.  Mr. McWilliams relied heavily for his data on a Credit Suisse report but that report indicated that much work remained to be done to refine estimates of wealth in a country.  I do not know whether the television piece was completed before the CSO report was published in January but Mr. David McWilliams did not reference it.  I refer to the report on the household finance and consumption survey which was published by the Central Statistics Office in January 2015.  It presented the results of the household finance and consumption survey I referred to already.  The survey was carried out between March 2013 and September 2013 on behalf of the Central Bank.  Such surveys were carried out across Europe.  The main highlights of the report were that a household's main residence accounts for the majority of most households' gross wealth at 48% on average.  Financial assets account for a much smaller proportion of gross wealth at an average of 13%.  More than half of households hold some form of debt, with mortgage indebtedness proving to be a particularly heavy burden for young cohorts.  However, the mortgage repayment burden is more evenly spread across the age distribution, with younger borrowers benefiting from lower interest rates and long mortgage terms.  The median value of net wealth is &euro;105,000.  This is in line with other European countries where the average is &euro;109,000.  The top 20% of households hold 70% of net assets, which is similar to the position in other European countries.  In Ireland, the concentration of wealth at the top end of the distribution is driven by two factors, namely, larger holdings or real assets and relatively smaller holdings of debt.  As such, a great deal of the Deputy's argument was based on incorrect facts.  It is not his fault they are incorrect, they come from other sources.</p></speech>

I presume it is on the CSO's website.  I am not criticising Mr. McWilliams.  It was January 2015 and the lead-in time to the broadcasting of television programmes can sometimes be quite lengthy.  As such, the data may not have been available when the programme was filmed.  However, it casts a totally different light on the distribution of wealth in Ireland.  Anybody who is pursuing the option of a wealth tax should remember that, on average, 48% of a household's gross wealth is the family home.  We have already taxed the family home with the local property tax, a move on our part with which some of the Deputies do not agree.</p></speech>

The CSO references those in the top 20% of the income distribution having 40% of the wealth.  The CSO crosses the two items there.  It says that those in the bottom 60% of the income distribution are at the same level of wealth.  That is approximately two thirds.  The top 20% in the income distribution has three times the wealth of the bottom two thirds.  Even on the basis of the figures to which the Minister refers, there is no doubt that we have a lopsided wealth distribution.  By the Minister's own admission, it has got worse since 2011 when he took office.  That was one of the first things he said.</p> <p>  I have been a Deputy for four and a half years.  Approximately two years ago the Minister admitted the need for a budget costings office which Opposition parties could use to develop and cost alternative proposals.  Such a service would improve the quality of the budgetary debate and avoid the same old arguments about how Opposition proposals are not properly costed.  We could then discuss real figures and real policy differences.  That has not happened.  One of the outcomes of acceptance of the amendment before us would to allow us to begin examining the options available with regard to a wealth tax.  The Minister mentioned that we were in penury while ago and said that every single available cent was chased.  He also said that capital gains tax is a wealth tax.  That tax was reduced in the budget.  There were changes regarding a capital acquisitions tax, which led to it also being reduced.  The Minister also referred to the property tax.  The latter is a blind and blunt asset tax.  People who own houses worth &euro;200,000 on which they owe &euro;400,000 come to my office on a weekly basis.  They are being taxed at the same rate as those who own similar houses debt free.  There is a blindness there.  It is not a smart tax.  It does not identify the differences in the wealth of individuals.</p> <p>  A woman in my constituency had her home heating oil stolen from her tank during the summer.  For the next few months she got up late in the morning in order to skip breakfast, ate lunch in her own home and went to her daughter's house for dinner.  She would not have had enough money to pay for the oil without making those savings.  Some people are on the edge of existence yet they are subject to a blind and blunt property tax which they pay the same rate as the millionaire next door who owns a yacht.  All we are saying is that we should be developing smart taxes which take into account the real worth of an individual and which take account of the fact that if a person is extremely wealthy and has deep pockets, he or she should contribute a little more.  That is why I tabled the amendment.</p></speech>

In so far as the Department of Finance can cost them for the Deputy, it will do so.  However, I pointed out in my initial reply that there is no database of the wealth of the nation within any State agency, including the Revenue Commissioners.  It is very difficult to construct a tax if one does not know the base to which it applies.  The positions the Deputy has taken up are exaggerated because the distribution of wealth in Ireland is fairer than in most countries across Europe.  The CSO's research proves that.  It also shows that the position now is more fair than it was in 2006 when the first data became available.</p><p>It is not deteriorating.  The Deputy makes the comparison with 2011.  The reason the situation is different from 2011 is that the policies pursued by the Government have caused a recovery in the economy and the recovery is happening rapidly.  Part of that recovery is a growth in asset prices.  As the Deputy says, people on the top incomes tend to have more assets than people on low incomes.  As a consequence, their wealth increases because the value of their assets increases.  That is not a deliberate action of the Government; it is a consequence of the success of the Government in getting the economy out of hock and getting it to grow at rates of 6.2% in net terms in 2015.  The Deputy is right to say that 20% of the top earners have 40% of the wealth, but the same 20% pay 80% of all the taxes.  Any analysis of Irish society shows that it has one of the fairest tax systems in the OECD.  Many of the rhetorical points the Deputy makes are exaggerated.  That is not to say that his party is not fully within its rights to propose a wealth tax to the electorate, but it needs to make sure that it knows the asset base on which it is applying the wealth tax, especially if it is omitting family homes, as 48% of all wealth is in the value of family homes.</p></speech>

If the Government does not collect the information, it cannot manage this issue properly either.  It is quite shocking that the Government does not know the wealth of the nation.  It does not know the wealth in the hands of the people of the State.  That means it is blind to one of the biggest economic aspects of running the country, and if it does not know that information it cannot manage that process properly.  It is not an argument for non-collection; it is an argument for the collection of that information.  If the Nevin institute can work that out from the 2013 CSO data, surely the Government can put in place some level of information to collect.  We might disagree on the wealth tax but, at the very least, can we not agree on the necessity to manage the affairs of the nation with the information at our hands?</p></speech>

There are a number of points I want to make.  For some time we have been arguing for a wealth tax.  In our pre-budget submissions I quoted extensively from both the most recent Credit Suisse report and the one before that to press the argument for a wealth tax.  The Minister comes back with the same arguments each year.  To some extent we are on ideological terrain, because the Minister just does not believe in doing this, but it is worth responding to some of the points he has made.  There is a distinction between wealth and income.  That is absolutely true.  Sometimes when we talk about the need to tax wealth and higher incomes, other Government spokespeople - not so much the Minister - blur that distinction for political and rhetorical purposes.  We are very clear about the distinction and believe we need to capture extra revenue for the State from higher incomes and wealth from capital and financial transactions.  We are very clear on the distinction, as I am sure the Minister is, so he should not misrepresent our view on this.  I said to the Minister yesterday that there is a connection between income and wealth.  It is spelt out in the Credit Suisse report - if the Minister has read it - and it is obvious if one thinks about it.  They are not the same thing but there is a connection.  Credit Suisse makes the point explicitly in its report that those who receive higher incomes over time generate wealth because-----</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for making my point for me.  Only a tiny group of people has surplus wealth.  That is critical.  Only a very small group of people has surplus wealth.  Most people have debt.  That is what they have.  The owe money.  When income, wealth and assets are set against liabilities, for most of their lives most people are operating in negative territory.  For a small minority of people, that is not the case.  We are trying to get at the very small group that has extraordinary wealth.  That is also linked to the fact that they have very high incomes, so they have surplus wealth every year that they can translate into wealth, as the Minister put it.  That wealth becomes self-perpetuating.  If someone has a lot of money, a million quid, it makes money for them.  They just sit there and watch it accumulate.  As the Minister pointed out, it is not just property.  We understand the distinction, but the point is to get at that accumulated wealth.</p> <p>  The Minister says that for the majority of people the wealth they have is primarily made up of the family home.  This is obviously by way of justification of the property tax.  That is true for the majority of people but when one reaches the top 5%, or the top 1%, that is no longer true.  Their family homes are a much smaller proportion of their overall wealth, which is made up of commercial property interests, big investments and cash.  The purpose of a wealth tax is to capture that.  Even on the most conservative assessment of wealth distribution, as the Minister has set out with the CSO report, if we accept that the top 20% - approximately 300,000 people - have 40%, a conservative estimate is that they have &euro;151 billion, most of which is assets other than family homes.  That is the point.  One will find that the concentration is even greater when one gets to the top 10%, but with that top 20%, the &euro;151 billion that they have consists mostly of commercial property or financial assets.  If a 2.5% tax was put on that &euro;151 billion owned by the top 20%, it would raise &euro;1 billion a year.</p><p>They would still end up wealthier at the end of each year if a wealth tax at a rate of 2.5% were levied on them annually; it is just that the growth of their wealth would be slowed down.  The average increase in the value of that wealth, accounting for investments, etc., is probably running at 4% to 5%.  Those affected would still end up better off, but the accumulation and concentration of their wealth would be slowed down.  It would be a very significant boon to the Exchequer.  Why would the Minister not even consider opting for this, or even a measure that was a little more conservative?  We suggest a rate of 2.5%, but even a slightly more conservative rate would result in a few hundred million euro.  Why would the Minister not even consider this as a source of revenue rather than unloading a regressive property tax on those who cannot afford it?</p></speech>

I just disagree with him, but I am also pointing to the difficulties in his construction.  We have wealth taxes - capital taxes - and they are imposed at high rates.  If one transfers property or anything else to somebody else, there is gift tax at a rate of 33%, with very low thresholds.  On inheritance, one pays at a rate of 33%, with very low thresholds, particularly if one is not in the direct line of descent.  There is also the property tax, to which I referred on a number of occasions.</p> <p>  I do not understand socialism in Ireland.  If one was to search the world, one would not find a group describing itself as socialist that refused to tax property.  I do not get it.  The Deputy requested that we not tax property.  The property tax is on all property, but the Deputy will not tax the big mansions in which those against whom he targets most of his rhetoric live.  They comprise the wealthy, multimillionaires or those with all of the wealth he describes so graphically, but he opposes me when I tax big mansions.  I hope to convert him as time passes.  At least Deputy Paul Murphy has now paid his property tax, which is an advancement on what has happened.  He probably has a date in 2017 with a circle around it on the calendar on which he will pay his water charges.</p> <p>  I do not understand Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett's position and I am forced into wondering whether, for populist reasons, he is afraid to tax property.  I wonder why he would not do the simple thing and tax property.  He opposes doing so.  The party the members of which are beside him proposes to remove property tax when it gets into power, yet property tax is a tax on fixed assets.  All wealth taxes are on assets.  The most effective wealth taxes, if there are effective wealth taxes, are on fixed assets.  The proposal from the Deputy is that family homes, including mansions, be exempt.  According to Sinn F&eacute;in, land would be exempt.  What fixed assets are left?  One could tax liquid assets such as cash in the bank, but DIRT is paid on them already.  For how long does the Deputy believe the money would stay in the Irish banks if one was to levy a tax on it at a rate of 2.5% or 3%?  For how long does he believe there would be share transactions in the Irish Stock Exchange if share capital value were to be levied on the basis of his belief that it constituted wealth?  What is his position on pension funds?  I placed a levy on pension funds to provide me with the resources to reduce the rate of VAT in the hospitality sector from 13.5% to 9%.  I introduced it as a temporary measure, but there was outrage among the Opposition.  It was opposed to left, right and centre and I was told I could not do it.  It was an effective wealth tax, but, again, it was opposed.</p> <p>  The Deputy is against every wealth tax, except some mythical one that applies to very little or assets that will move.  He should go back to the drawing board and come up with realistic propositions.  Sinn F&eacute;in is seeking to exempt so much from the wealth tax it proposes that I do not know exactly to what wealth it would apply.  I notice that it did not exempt farmyards, although it exempted land.  Dairy farmers would need to look out for this because bulk tanks, equipment and machinery constitute quite a lot of wealth on a farm.  Now that I have mentioned it, I suppose another exemption will be proposed when the wealth tax is refined.</p> <p>  I disagree with what the Deputy is doing.  He does not propose the obvious steps such as building on the wealth taxes we have and supporting a property tax such as the one in place.  He should agree with a levy on pension funds such as the one we had, although I removed it completely.  That gave me the resources I needed to do a good job for the tourism industry, yet the Deputy keeps talking about a wealth tax that would bring in hundreds of millions of euro.  He will not do the obvious.</p></speech>

In responding to the suggestion we collect data on wealth I must re-emphasise that we are focusing, in particular, on those at the very top, not the ordinary person who has a house.  I refer to those with multiple properties and vast financial and other assets.  They are the people at whom we are trying to get.  The Minister says he or people might balk at collecting data for each individual, but that happens all the time in the case of the ordinary citizen.  If the poor apply for a social welfare payment, they are means-tested forensically on their income and assets before receiving it.  The Minister has the information on property through the property tax system.  He has gathered it.</p> <p>  The second home tax was progressive.  It was levied on properties one had, in addition to the family home.  We could reinstate and increase that tax and consider the property assets in question and their concentration.  It would be interesting to see who owned multiple properties and ascertain what tiny group of investors and property owners owned multiple properties.  We would find there was a heavy concentration in this area.  We should direct taxes at those who are generating considerable revenue and have an appreciating asset because of concentrated ownership of large amounts of property.  There is nothing to stop the Government from gathering information that would allow us to have a wealth tax targeted not at family homes but at the very wealthy, or those who have many financial and property assets above and beyond the family home.</p></speech>

The Minister referenced second and subsequent homes.  If the Minister were to abolish the property tax and impose a &euro;400 tax on second homes, a person who owns two homes would be a net saver under the Sinn F&eacute;in policy because instead of paying &euro;300 property tax on the first home and &euro;300 in property tax on the second home he or she would pay only &euro;400 on the second home.  What is being proposed would only apply in respect of multiple homes.  The key issue is that the wealth of a family in terms of the price of a house suffered a massive rupture because of the housing crisis, which rupture has not been experienced anywhere else in the world.  As a result, property prices are not a good analysis of the wealth of a family.  The Minister has frozen the property tax this year because he knows that the value of property over the next couple of years could increase so much it would be out of all proportion to the wealth of the family.  That freezing of the property tax is an admission that the tax is a blind, blunt instrument to identify the wealth of a family, which does not take into consideration the debt of a family.</p> <p>  There is an ideological reticence within the Fine Gael Party to take money from those who are extremely wealthy in this country and to invest that money in services for those are extremely poor.  That is the bottom line.  That cannot continue.  The Minister can dress this up any way he likes but it cannot be hidden from people.  I propose to press the amendment.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 76 provides that the Minister report on the cost of the proposed freezing of the local property tax and the likely property prices in 2019.  We are dealing with a method of taxation of families which is unstable.  To stabilise it in the election cycle the Government had to freeze it.  I would like to know the likely cost of the property tax freeze and likely property prices in 2019.</p><p>Amendment No. 78 deals with an issue of significant importance to a large section of our population.  The amendment provides:</p><blockquote>The Minister shall, within one month of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann a report on options on extending the exemptions from the Local Property Tax to residents in buildings unsafe because of fire safety regulations or other structural issues.</blockquote> <p>The Minister will have a lot of experience of people with regard to pyrite.  These are people whose homes, because they are crumbling, have almost zero value.  My understanding is that if following the carrying out of a particular test a house is identified as having significant pyrite damage, the owner can seek an exemption from the local property tax on that basis, and that the exemption applies for only six years.  As such, in terms of the cost of the test, the exemption is useless.  There are other people similarly affected, for example, the people of Longboat Quay and Riverwalk Court, which is in Meath.  These people are living in houses that are practically valueless because they do not meet necessary standards.  Would it not be useful to extend the exemption to these individuals?  Deputy Doherty has constituents in Donegal whose houses contain muscovite mica, and similar to those affected by the pyrite disaster, they have lost confidence in living in their houses or else the value of their properties has dissolved.</p></speech>

That is the purpose of the decision.  The revaluation date was due in November 2016.  We will now defer it.  It is difficult to estimate the potential loss because determination of that requires insight into the expectations of the percentage rise in value up to 2019.  It is difficult to give the Deputy a figure in this regard but it is probably in excess of &euro;100,000 or &euro;125,000 on average.  That is a very loose estimate because, as I said, it may be the case in 2017 or 2018 that house prices have stabilised.  If appeared last year that there would be a continuing rise.  I cannot give a realistic estimate.  That can only be done retrospectively from 2019.</p> <p>  On the pyrite issue, I answered a question this morning in the D&aacute;il which set out the position in this regard.  The Government has accepted the proposals of Dr. Don Thornhill in respect of pyrite-affected houses as set out in his report.</p><p>I published the report in the documents accompanying the Budget Statement.  Effectively, it is no longer necessary for a householder to have an expensive assessment, which might cost &euro;2,000, carried out, especially when the benefit is much smaller than the cost of acquiring it.  It will be done on a self-assessment basis.  The Revenue Commissioners will accept the Thornhill recommendations on an administrative basis in the first instance, pending legislation being passed to give it the statutory basis that is required.  In the next two weeks the Revenue Commissioners will publish a protocol setting out the position, to make it easier for persons whose family home is affected by pyrite to claim the exemption from property tax.</p><p> Regarding the other categories of houses mentioned by the Deputy, such as those in Donegal and Longboat Quay, the local property tax is self-assessed.  If somebody decides that his or her house is of very low value - and I presume no house has nil value - that is what he or she should return to the Revenue Commissioners.  The tax is based on the value as self-assessed.  The legislation governing the administration of the local property tax provides for a limited number of exemptions from the tax.  There is no specific exemption for properties affected by mica and there are no plans to introduce such an exemption.  Local property tax operates on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for the property owner, in the first instance, to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the market value of the property.  When making an assessment, issues such as the presence of the mica will be one of the factors that a property owner should take into account in valuing the property.</p><p> If somebody is claiming their house is worth very little because it has a mica problem, it would be prudent for the householder to indicate this when returning the property return to the Revenue Commissioners and to provide some evidence that this is the case.  Otherwise, the Revenue Commissioners might revert to them if comparable houses in the area were paying significantly more in property tax and the discrepancy could not be explained from the Revenue Commissioners' perspective.</p></speech>

The latter was a brake on families proceeding in that direction.</p> <p>  I worry about the self-assessment element.  Many of the people in Riverwalk Court, Longboat Quay and in Donegal suffering as a result of the impact of muscovite mica are under fierce stress already.  One's home is one of the foundations of one's well-being and if it is unsafe or is crumbling, that can have a massive impact in the context of stress.  In addition, self-assessment is very stressful.  Most business people or self-employed people who use the Revenue on-line service to carry out the self-assessment can be very stressed about being correct that their liability is X or Y.  Even if they are entitled to money back, they second, third and fourth-guess themselves to ensure they have done it right.  They wonder if they will get stuffed three or four years hence if somebody carries out an audit.  They also wonder whether they should leave money aside in case they have not paid enough thereby ensuring that if they are audited, they will not fall into arrears with the Revenue Commissioners.</p> <p>  The good news is that the Minister sees that a person who lives in a nearly valueless house should not have to pay property tax on it.  Would it not be easier for everybody if a black-and-white understanding could be given by the State to people living in these houses that this is the case, and that it is one of the stresses and strains they do not have to deal with this year as a result?</p></speech>

They cannot provide the black-and-white criteria the Deputy seeks.  However, the test for liability for property tax is whether the house is occupied.  If the damage is so severe that people have moved out, there is no liability on the property.  Once it is occupied, there is a liability for property tax and the question that arises is how much should be paid.  That depends on the valuation and the valuation is a self-assessment exercise.  However, the Revenue Commissioners have oversight of that and they might get back to somebody who has included a much lower valuation compared with the value of other houses on the road.  There are auctioneers and valuers all over the country and they do not charge much.  The auctioneer in a local village will write a statement of what they think the house is worth on the market and can outline that the reason they believe its value is lower than all the other houses on the street is because of severe damage due to X or Y.  That is the process.  It should work and I believe it will.</p></speech>

Account is also taken of some welfare changes.  This year the tables give examples of families with children and the increase in child benefit is taken into account.  However, my argument, especially in view of the expenditure cuts in recent years, is that there is no holistic measure of the impact of the budget on different family types and people in different circumstances, be that as regards gender, income, age, marital or disability status.  The ESRI publishes a report on the distributional impact in terms of tax, welfare and public service pay policy, and the Minister has taken issue with some aspects of that.  To put that issue to bed, I strongly recommend that the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform jointly publish a comprehensive analysis of the impact of the budget.  The tables that are published on budget day are a help.</p><p>They go some way towards it, but they do not take account of the full distributional impact.  If the Minister is not going to accept in full the ESRI analysis, which he has not done in recent years, then the Government should take responsibility for publishing its own.</p></speech>

Someone on &euro;28,000 received little.  We had the USC debate yesterday about the difference between those at the top and at the bottom.  Social Justice Ireland said that somebody on social welfare was not getting the same level of help or support as someone earning &euro;50,000.</p> <p>  By any measure, equality budgeting is an internationally accepted method of dealing with inequality and poverty.  I do not believe anyone on the Government benches who would claim there is not inequality or poverty in this country.  Approximately 60 countries either use equality budgeting or are in the process of doing so.  Such countries include England, South Africa, Canada and African countries such as Tanzania and Uganda.  This is not some kind of new dawn that we are asking the Minister to introduce.  We are not asking him to develop anything other than something that is tried and tested.  One benefit is that the Minister would not have to listen to me or other Members belly-aching after a budget because he could point to the fact that the equality budgeting objectives had been met.  I would be interested to hear why exactly the Government opposes the amendment.</p></speech>

A substantial amount of analysis covering some of the groups the Deputies have listed has already been published.  The Department of Social Protection has, on 4 November last, published a social impact assessment of the welfare and income tax measures in budget 2016.  The social impact assessment was completed in consultation with the Department of Finance in respect of the income tax elements of the budget and is consistent with my Department&rsquo;s analysis of the impact of the budget package.</p> <p>  Using the ESRI&rsquo;s tax-welfare simulation model, SWITCH, the social impact assessment includes a breakdown between the impact of tax and welfare measures respectively, as well as presenting the overall distributional impact of budget 2016 by income group and family type.  It also examines the impact of the budget on the at-risk-of-poverty rate and on work incentives, as well as the impact of the change in the minimum wage.</p> <p>  Expansion of the SWITCH model has also enabled the incorporation this year of investment in the early childhood care and education scheme into the social impact assessment.  The distributional impact by family type in the SWITCH model facilitates comparisons between the distributional impact of the budget on families with and without children, by employment or retirement status, and for lone parents.  All of those are presented in the social impact assessment.</p> <p>  At this time, it is not possible to use the SWITCH model to assess the impact of the budget on groups of people based on their disability status.  As I have pointed out previously, there are already significant efforts under way to expand the capacity of the model.  This is evidenced by the work which has allowed modelling of medical cards and the early childhood care and education scheme.</p> <p>  For further information, the budget book includes a range of material addressing distributional issues and explaining the impact of budget 2016.  A series of tables show the impact of budgetary measures at a range of income levels for different income earners.  A variety of illustrative cases provide examples of the change in net income for sample household types.  The extent to which income is redistributed through the tax and welfare system and the progressivity of the income tax system are also addressed in the budget documentation.  On the basis that the analysis proposed in the amendment is already published, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

The purpose of this amendment is to allow Revenue to report unprofessional conduct by solicitors, in acting on behalf of taxpayers, to the Law Society so that the Law Society can carry out an investigation into the alleged misconduct.</p><p>Section 851A provides reassurance to taxpayers that personal and commercial information received by Revenue for tax purposes is protected against unauthorised disclosure.  The authority to disclose taxpayer information requires a specific statutory basis and the use to which the disclosed information can be put by the recipient of the information is prescribed by statute. </p><p>One of the circumstances in which it is permitted to disclose confidential taxpayer information is where a Revenue officer is satisfied that the work of a tax adviser acting on behalf of a taxpayer does not meet the professional standards of the professional body of which the person is a member.  Thus, for example, a Revenue officer may disclose taxpayer information to the Irish Taxation Institute so that the institute can investigate whether the alleged misbehaviour of one of its members has breached its professional standards. </p><p>Section 851A defines &ldquo;professional body&rdquo; as those accountancy bodies that come within the remit of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority and the Irish Taxation Institute.  This amendment includes the Law Society in the definition.</p><p>The current situation whereby Revenue can report unprofessional conduct by certain tax professionals but not solicitors is a source of grievance for those tax professionals who are not solicitors because of the perceived competitive advantage it gives to solicitors in the provision of taxation advice and related work.  In so far as possible, I would like to see a level playing field between all tax advisors and I consider that this amendment will contribute to this.

Everybody else must pay DIRT at 41%, whether they have no income liable to income tax, pay tax at the standard rate of 20% or pay tax at the marginal rate of 40%.  There is an issue of equity here, especially for the many people who are dependent on interest income.  At a time when interest rates are so low, such income is lower now than it may have been in the past.  At the same time, DIRT has increased substantially, from 27% to 41%.  Moreover, for some people with unearned income, there is an additional 4% PRSI charge on the interest income.  I am asking the Minister to review this issue with a view to ensuring greater equity.</p></speech>

The standard DIRT rate has increased significantly since 2008, from 20% to 41%, and is now one percentage point above the higher rate of tax.  Up to budget 2009, the rate of DIRT was equal to the standard rate of income tax at 20%.  The increases in recent years were introduced to generate additional yield and encourage spending in the economy to stimulate growth and employment.</p> <p>  I am informed by Revenue that the estimated cost of charging DIRT at rate equivalent to individuals' marginal income tax rate, that is, either 40%, 20% or 0%, depending on the highest rate of tax applicable to their income, would be of the order of &euro;77 million for 2016, based on a forecasted DIRT yield of &euro;298 million.  This is a necessarily tentative estimate as it cannot, for instance, account for any individuals moving bands.  That said, it represents a substantial loss to the Exchequer, particularly given that under the terms of the Stability and Growth Pact, Ireland may not introduce discretionary revenue reductions unless they are matched by other revenue increases or expenditure reductions.  This means the Government must consider carefully any tax changes, as any reductions will have to be offset elsewhere.  I am further advised there would also be significant administrative issues and costs associated with such measures, both for Revenue and for financial institutions.  In the circumstances, I am not disposed to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

I accept that what I am proposing would be administratively difficult to implement.  An estimated cost of &euro;77 million in 2016 is a very significant sum.  Over time, however, as commissions on taxation examine the overall structure, the taxation of interest income should be aligned to the overall taxation of a person's income from other sources.  It would be the fairest way to do it.  It is not something that can be done overnight because it has a significant associated cost, as the Minister outlined.  Nevertheless, in the longer term, it is an objective that is worth working towards.  It is not fair that persons on very low incomes who have an asset that is earning interest must pay tax at 41% on that interest.  I accept the changes required will take time, on which basis I do not propose to press the amendment.</p></speech>

There are two points at which PRSAs are severely disadvantaged when compared to normal occupational pension schemes.  The employee is liable for a universal social charge, USC, on employer contributions to a PRSA.  In the case of PRSAs, both employer and employee contributions are subject to Revenue limits allowable for tax relief, while in the case of occupational pension schemes, only the employee contributions are subject to Revenue limits.</p><p>The Finance Bill provides for an exemption for employees from USC on employer contributions to a PRSA, which is welcome.  It brings the USC treatment of such contributions in line with employer contributions to occupational pension schemes.  However, there is no proposal to address the second anomaly, whereby both the employer and the employee contributions to the PRSI are reckonable or taken into account in terms of the overall amount which can be contributed within the allowable limits.  That is an issue which needs to be examined.</p><p>The current situation means that more contributions can be made to defined contribution plans than to the PRSAs.  This has a major impact for a small number of PRSA holders and is deeply unfair.  It particularly impacts those whose pensions are underfunded and who are striving to close the gap.  PRSAs are principally designed for those with no occupational pension scheme.  National and government policy for some time has been to encourage people to provide for their future well-being and their retirement.  To discriminate against PRSAs <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>occupational pensions by counting employer contributions towards the allowable limits for tax relief strikes me as unfair.  I am not sure what the original justification of it was.</p></speech>

During that debate, he highlighted the differential treatment afforded to employer contributions to trust-based occupational pension schemes as compared to PRSAs, in so far as the operation of the annual limits on employee tax-relieved pension contributions are concerned.</p><p>Basically, the amount of tax-relieved contributions which an individual or an employee can make towards pension savings in any one year is subject to a limit based on an age-related percentage of his or her annual earnings and to an overall earnings cap of &euro;115,000 per annum.  In the case of PRSAs, any employer contributions are aggregated with the employee&rsquo;s contributions for the purpose of determining if these limits are adhered to.  In addition, employer PRSA contributions, unlike employer contributions to trust-based occupational pension schemes, are treated as a benefit-in-kind of the employee.  As against that, however, they are also deemed for tax relief purposes to be a contribution made by the employee.  This means, in effect, that, where the aggregate amount of employer and employee contributions to the employee&rsquo;s PRSA does not exceed the employee&rsquo;s annual age-related limit, no effective benefit-in-kind charge arises.  This is because any potential benefit-in-kind charge arising for the employee, as a result of the employer contribution, is exactly offset by the employee&rsquo;s tax relief on those contributions.  It is only where the combined contributions exceed the age-related limits that an effective benefit-in-kind tax charge arises.</p><p>I am assuming that the intent of the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment is to, first, remove employer contributions to PRSAs from the compass of the employee annual age-related limits; second, although not specifically provided for in the amendment, to remove the benefit-in-kind charge on the employee in respect of the employer contributions.  This, I think, the Deputy would view as levelling the playing pitch <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>trust-based occupational pensions schemes.</p><p>In that regard, however, I have explained several times over the years in response to parliamentary questions on this issue, that there are good reasons for this differential treatment, which are of long standing.  In the case of trust-based occupational pension schemes, employer contributions are effectively controlled, first, by the statutory limit on the maximum benefits that can be provided for an employee under a scheme, that is, a pension not exceeding two thirds of final salary; second, by the standard fund threshold regime which places an overarching limit on all pension benefits of &euro;2 million.</p><p>In the case of PRSAs which were introduced in 2002, these are contract-based products which are beneficially owned by the PRSA holders.  As with other contract-based pension products, for example retirement annuity contracts, no benefit limit as such applies to the contract.  Control of benefits in such instances is exercised through restrictions on the annual amount of tax-relieved contributions that can be made by, or in respect of, the PRSA holder.  In the absence of contribution-based controls, it would simply not be possible, under the current legislative structure, to restrict the amount of benefits arising under such contracts, other than by way of the standard fund threshold limit of &euro;2 million mentioned earlier.</p><p>I do not propose, therefore, to accept the Deputy&rsquo;s proposal to amend the legislation in a fashion which would remove the impacts of the current restrictions on employer-related contributions to PRSAs.  Apart from increasing the annual cost of tax relief on pension contributions to the Exchequer generally, it would also mean that employers would be in a position, of which I have no doubt they would avail, to pick and choose favoured employees in respect of whom they would make significant additional contributions above current levels and above the levels made by them to employee PRSAs generally.</p><p>All of that said, I accept the differing approaches to the treatment of contributions to PRSAs and to occupational pension schemes, while having a sound basis, is just one manifestation of the overall complexity of the rules surrounding private pension provision.  These are being looked at in the context of the broader reform of the pensions area being considered by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection.  This change agenda includes work to reform and simplify the pensions landscape, to ensure schemes operate effectively and there is a regulatory structure which gives pension savers confidence in the system.  This encompasses consideration of potential impediments to the uptake of PRSAs.  It is in that context that the issue of concern to the Deputy can best be considered.</p></speech>

The Revenue Commissioners undertook the national contractors project which yielded significant revenues for the State.  It was a significant initiative by Revenue to examine the issue of the tax treatment of travel and subsistence payments for self-employed contractors.</p><p>I welcome that the Minister held a public consultation on this area a number of months ago and I know a number of submissions were made to that public consultation exercise.  We are talking about contractors working across the information and communications technology and health care sectors in particular, and the tax treatment of costs associated with contractors working away from their normal place of work.</p><p> The point made to me is that the current system and interpretation from the Revenue Commissioners has caused some uncertainty.  I assume the Minister may accept that to a point as he has initiated the public consultation.  The point has also been made that our capacity to deliver on major capital projects, with very large companies seeking to bring in the required expertise on a contracting basis, is meeting difficulties.  The issue must be examined.</p><p> It is some time since I studied the tax law surrounding deductible expenses for employees but the general rule of thumb about an expense being wholly, necessarily and exclusively incurred in the performance of the duties is, I presume, still the test used by the Revenue Commissioners.  Many of these contractors, by the nature of their job, move between locations.  I would have thought the expenses incurred in doing that job are inextricably linked to the performance of their duties in the course of that job and would be deductible, but there seems to be a different interpretation put on it.  There is also the acceptance of whether a person's home can be the normal place of work, which it is for some contractors.  For example, that would be the case for some people providing information technology support.  Many of these people have received very hefty tax bills, perhaps legitimately, and I am not holding a candle for anybody trying to avoid their taxation responsibilities.</p><p> I suggest there is a need for certainty in the taxation treatment of self-employed contractors and we must be cognisant of the ability of major employers in this country to deliver on capital investment projects and have access to the required expertise in this country.  The nature of the working environment has changed and more people are now self-employed.  They have incorporated and are offering their services as an independent contractor.  We are dealing with old taxation legislation and although I welcome that the consultation has been done, will the Minister's Department and the Revenue Commissioners, if they have not done so already, consider very carefully the submissions and bring certainty to the issue in order that it can be clearly explained to all the stakeholders, the Tax Institute, employer bodies, large companies and the contractors?  We should have clear rules on how travel and subsistence payments in particular should be taxed and this should be consistent.</p></speech>

Many people who pay in instalments are affected by penalties as a result and typically a person paying by instalments in the first place is likely to have viewed the total cost as unaffordable at a particular time.  It is not logical from a justice and human basis that such people incur an extra cost because of that position.  We live in a high-tech age with much connectivity and it is very easy to share information.  There is a logic to ensuring there is no penalty for payment by instalments.</p></speech>

However, my response on the general point raised by the Deputy regarding the payment of tax by instalments is that the abolition of these arrangements would impose an unacceptable cost on the Exchequer.</p> <p>  A core provision in the Revenue Commissioners' powers to collect the taxes and duties within their care and management is the provision for specific monetary sanctions on taxpayers in the event that payments are made late or not made at all. These monetary sanctions can comprise interest, surcharges and penalties of various kinds and exist principally to ensure the Revenue Commissioners are not placed in the invidious position of becoming an involuntary interest-free creditor to individuals or businesses as regards the late payment of tax.  Equally, where repayments of tax to taxpayers by the Revenue Commissioners are unreasonably delayed, provision is also made to include interest to compensate the taxpayer for the temporary lack of those funds.</p> <p>  From the overall perspective of servicing the national debt as well as funding the provision of public services generally, the Exchequer cannot be placed at the mercy of taxpayers as to when they may or may not choose to pay their taxes.  While the payment of certain taxes, such as local property tax, may provide for instalment payments without interest, this is not generally true in circumstances in which a statutory payment deadline has been missed.</p> <p>  The argument that tax payment deadlines are unfair is unsustainable for the very good reason that, in general, the events which have given rise to the liabilities will have already occurred by the time the tax has to be paid.  I am thinking of VAT or the remittance of PAYE deducted by employers.  There could be no justification for fiduciary taxes such as these to be paid by instalment.  In summary, there is no unfairness in the current system and the existence of these sanctions is fully justified.  For this reason I am not prepared to accept the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment.</p></speech>

A real estate investment trust, REIT, can be set up in this State and can invest in retail properties and collect income from rental properties - and possibly the sale of the rental properties - without paying corporation tax.  If the beneficiary is resident in this State, that beneficiary will then pay tax on the dividends.</p><p>If the beneficiary were living in the United States, for example, that beneficiary, because of international taxation treaties, could manage not to pay tax on the dividends, or at least could have a significantly reduced tax on the dividends.  First, this is obviously a cost with regard to potential taxation that could be received into the State.  Second, it has the effect of distorting the property market in real terms, because the REITs can become an efficient way to dodge tax responsibility.  A selling point for a REIT built in that fashion would be that it was very tax-effective.  It could create distortion in the market.  In the long term we would see more internationally owned REITs than Irish people owing properties and dealing with them in that fashion.</p></speech>

The REIT framework is designed to produce an after-tax result for shareholders similar to that from direct investment in property, while also providing the benefits of risk diversification and attracting of new sources of capital and professional management associated with collective investment.</p> <p>  A REIT must distribute at least 85% of its property income profits annually to the REIT shareholders.  Instead of being taxed directly on the rental income, investors are subject to taxation on dividends paid from REIT profits arising from that rental income.  Distributions to Irish-resident individuals are subject to dividend withholding tax, DWT, and are also subject to income tax, PRSI and USC at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate.  Such investors will also be liable to capital gains tax of 33% on disposal of their shares in the REIT.  Irish corporate investors are liable to corporation tax on the dividends received at the same rate that would apply had the income been earned directly - that is, the non-trading rate of 25% applies.  They will also be liable to corporation tax of 33% on their chargeable gains on disposal of REIT shares.</p> <p>  Distributions to non-resident investors by Irish companies are generally exempt from DWT if the appropriate declaration of non-residence has been completed.  However, this exemption does not apply to distributions from a REIT.  In the absence of any other provisions, foreign REIT shareholders would not have any liability to Irish tax on REIT dividends, despite the fact that the REIT itself benefits from a tax exemption on qualifying profits of the rental business. </p> <p>  In order to ensure that tax from foreign investors is retained, a dividend withholding tax at the standard rate of tax was legislated for, specifically applying to REIT dividends.  All REIT distributions to non-resident investors are subject to DWT at a rate of 20% at source.  The non-resident investor may also, depending on the national tax rules in her or his country of residence, be subject to tax in that jurisdiction.  However, non-resident investors who are resident in countries with which Ireland has a double taxation agreement, DTA, may be entitled to claim a refund of some of the DWT, if the relevant DTA permits.  The taxation of dividends varies from treaty to treaty, but commonly a source state would retain the right to approximately 15% tax on dividends paid from that state.</p> <p>  Non-resident investors will not be liable to capital gains tax in Ireland because the REIT is a publicly listed company.  However, non-resident investors will be liable to such taxes in their home jurisdictions.</p> <p>  A REIT may pay gross dividends to certain Irish-resident "excluded persons," such as pension schemes, charities, investment funds and other exempt bodies, provided the appropriate declaration has been provided.</p> <p>  When considered in conjunction with the many benefits that REITs bring, such as risk diversification and attraction of capital, the potential loss of tax relating to foreign shareholders is mitigated to a level that is acceptable within current budgetary constraints.  Therefore, I cannot accept the proposed amendment.</p> <p>  This arose back around 2011 or 2012 when the property market was in total collapse and effectively there was no property market in Dublin.  People with buy-to-let properties trying to get out could not do so because the price was frequently less than the mortgage they had on the property.  On doing research, we found that REITs were commonplace across the OECD countries, particularly in Canada and the United States, but also in some European jurisdictions.  The big benefit from the investor's point of view is that he or she does not need to raise &euro;300,000 by way of a mortgage and savings to buy a property to let but can invest &euro;5,000, &euro;10,000 or &euro;15,000 in REIT shares.  So it suits small investors who are building up a pension.  They can have things like bank shares and a bit invested in property as well, without having their total life savings in property.  In 2009, 2010 and 2011 people were absolutely burnt, with all their life savings consumed because they had invested in property.</p> <p>  The motivation for introducing this was to encourage people to continue investing in property.  As we know from the debate over the past three or four months, we need good-quality rental property, especially in our cities, and the REITs have fulfilled that need.</p> <p>  It is not being driven by tax exemption.  If a publicly quoted company were constructed, it would need to pay corporation tax before paying a dividend and then the dividend would be subject to income tax, USC and so on in the normal way.  In this case it is analogous to ordinary citizens having a three-bedroom house up for rent.  They have a liability for income tax, USC, PRSI and so on.  If they sell it, they incur a capital gains tax liability.  Absolutely the same applies to a person who invests in a REIT, but because it is not incorporated, the company is not subject to corporation tax, provided it complies with certain conditions.  The principal one is that, rather than retaining profits, they distribute 85% of the profits each year by way of dividend to their investors in proportion to the amount invested.  It has worked very well since it was introduced in Dublin.</p> <p>  There are other advantages.  Because they tend not to buy individual properties and tend to have an apartment block, or two or three apartment blocks in the same complex, REITs can afford to put in professional managers.  So the quality of the accommodation and the management of the accommodation will usually be higher than in the case of the one-off rentals, which were the only option when I was in rental accommodation.  It has many advantages.</p> <p>  I stress that there is no loss of revenue to the Exchequer.  If the investor is abroad, the rules apply as they would to another investment.  Investors in Ireland are subject to income tax, USC, PRSI and whatever else on their investment.  If they were to sell the shares, it would be the equivalent of selling the property; they would be liable for capital gains tax on any capital gains made on the shares.  It is a good scheme and it is working well.</p></speech>

However, we are not dealing with a punctured property market at the moment.  Many people would feel that in much of the country it is too inflated again.  I grant that REITs might provide a more consistent level of quality.</p><p>Let us say John and Patricia are investors in a REIT.  Patricia lives in Ireland and pays tax on her dividend.  John lives in the US and, under an international taxation treaty, can reclaim the tax he pays.  There is an advantage to being non-domiciled under these programmes.  Has there been any review of the effective rate of tax paid on the dividends of REITs in Ireland as opposed to abroad?  We cannot manage if we cannot measure.  Is the Department confident that there is no disparity, or has any research been done to deliver confidence that there is no disparity?  If there is a difference and the net tax of a foreign investor is lower, and there is a potential distortion that could lead to a loss of tax, would the Minister agree to legislative changes to ensure it no longer exists?</p></speech>

The income is treated is the same, except that it comes by way of dividend rather than rent.  Capital gains tax is the same.  It is far more flexible.  One does not need to sell the house in order to get one&rsquo;s money out; one need only sell the shares.  A person who has an investment of &euro;20,000 and who needs the money can sell the shares.  It is a much more flexible way of having a property play which is unlikely to lead to the madness we had during the Celtic tiger days.  The same rules apply to an investor who lives abroad.  The taxation of persons abroad who have investments in other jurisdictions is governed by tax treaties with the sovereign states concerned.  A withholding tax applies, and a portion of the withholding tax is recoverable.  As I said in the note, one would expect that 15% to 20% of the withholding tax would be retained in the jurisdiction of the investment.</p> <p>  The purpose of tax is to pay for the goods and services, and cover the liabilities, of the State.  People living in New York are not enjoying the goods and services of this State.  They are not driving on the State's roads or having their roads lit up by public lighting from this State, their children are not going to school here and they are not availing of the hospitals.  While they should have a liability as investors, they should have a different liability from the generality of taxpayers.  In the Deputy's example, Patricia is taxed under Irish law, and while there are various measures regarding residence and domicile, if John&rsquo;s tax jurisdiction is the US, he is taxed in accordance with that law.  If there is a crossover, it is governed by the tax treaties.</p></speech>

If there is a difference, will the Minister seek a change in the legislation?</p></speech>

The legislation allowing REITs to set up investment funds was introduced in the 2013 Finance Bill.  Many of the REITs did not actively invest for a year after they had accumulated the fund.  It is very new.  I agree with the Deputy&rsquo;s point.  In due course, an assessment must be done of how it is working, given that it was a novel scheme for Ireland, although it works very well in other jurisdictions.  I am glad we have REITs.  In the Dublin market, they are providing good rental accommodation in the absence of domestic investors.</p></speech>

I have speaking notes on the amendments, which I wish to put on the record.  I wish to clarify the position on local property tax in respect of houses affected by pyrite damage.  I dealt with it in the response to a parliamentary question this morning.</p> <p>  On foot of the report of the review of the local property tax, which I commissioned, and which was recently submitted to me by Dr. Don Thornhill, I have decided to ease the qualifying criteria for relief from local property tax for homeowners whose properties have been severely affected by pyrite.  The current pyrite exemption will continue in place and will remain confined to properties with a damage rating of grade 2 or grade 1 with progression.  However, where a property has been accepted for remediation by the Pyrite Resolution Board, PRB, without testing, or a property has been remediated by a guarantee company or a builder or developer, or where a party is compensated in lieu of remediation without testing, the Revenue will accept confirmation of remediation or compensation from either the PRB or the relevant party for the purpose of exemption without testing.  In such cases, it will obviate the need for expensive testing.</p> <p>  Deputies are aware that the necessity of this change was due to the fact that people were deemed to be exempt if they proved their houses had suffered grade 2 damage or grade 1 with progression, but had to pay &euro;1,500 to &euro;2,000 to get engineering certificates to prove it, and the cost of proving it was greater than the value of the exemption.  This deals with the issue, which has existed for some time.  Given that Deputy Boyd Barrett is interested in this, I wanted to put it on the record for the benefit of him and other members.</p></speech>

The State has 14% of its shares and private investors have the rest.  The shares trade every day on the Dublin Stock Exchange and, more significantly, on the London Stock Exchange.  Like any publicly quoted share, the shares rise and fall.  I saw a reference to the transaction the Deputy referred to in the newspapers and the matter was also a subject of a parliamentary question.  I do not have the text of the reply and will not try to summarise it as it was quite technical.  I believe the information I got from the Central Bank adequately covered the situation.  I refer the Deputy to the relevant parliamentary reply and if she wishes to submit a supplementary question to adduce more information, I will do my best to provide her with the information she requires.</p></speech>

I apologise for the early start.  Unfortunately, the committee room is booked again at 11 a.m. by another committee as the Finance Bill is before the Houses.  We must therefore try to get this meeting concluded as quickly as we can.</p> <p>  Before we start, I am sure all members will wish to reflect briefly on the tragic events in Paris last Friday night.  I express my own sympathy and condolences to the families of those killed and injured and to the people of France and those countries whose citizens have been affected by the terrible attacks.  It is very sad that such a barbaric event was thrust upon innocent people going about their daily lives.  It is up to the people of Europe and the world to stand together and ensure a solution is found to stop future tragedies.  I propose that the joint committee writes to the French ambassador, H.E. Jean-Pierre Th&eacute;bault, to express the joint committee's sympathies and condolences.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Does anybody wish to comment?</p></speech>

These attacks demonstrate the need for solidarity within the West and especially within the European Union.  They are our brothers and sisters in the European Union and it is a family issue - an international family issue - for the European Union.  As we express our condolences, we should also say that we are with them and that the terrorism visited on the French is visited on all of us who believe in freedom.</p></speech>

Our thoughts are with those who have been badly injured.  We wish them a speedy recovery.  I agree that it is incumbent on us all to stand together in solidarity as it is incumbent on world leaders to come together to address the root causes of this mindless terrorism and to address the issues in Syria from which country a great deal of this is emanating.  It is a wake-up call for us all.  We all now realise how vulnerable we are every time we get into a plane or go to a large event, whether it is a football match or concert.  Now is the time for cool heads and a coming together of world leaders and the European Union to address this issue and bring about a satisfactory outcome for everybody.</p></speech>

Of course, our concern must now be how we can prevent future attacks.  We have had many reports of citizens from the UK and Ireland going to Syria to join the fight with Islamic State.  Their <i>modus operandi</i>is to send those people back to their home countries to perpetrate attacks similar to those in Paris in other European countries, including Ireland.  We need to ensure that that does not happen.  I propose that at some stage we should have the relevant leaders of various State agencies, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces in here to outline what they are doing to prevent this.</p><p>It has been pointed out for many years that there are elements within the communities in Ireland who will assist Islamic State in perpetrating these attacks in other countries, but who could do it here too.  There is no point in having more motions of sympathy about deaths in Ireland.  We must prevent those deaths and attacks in Ireland because it is highly foreseeable that people will return from Syria having fought there and their mission will be to carry out an attack here in Ireland.  That is not beyond the bounds of possibility.  That is what our intelligence services would tell us is going to happen, so our task now is to prevent it from happening.</p></speech>

It has brought home the reality of life for people in places like Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon and Syria.  They face that almost every day of their lives because there are suicide bombs and other bombings going on.  The West now realises in a very real way what other people have been suffering and how vulnerable their lives are.</p> <p>  Prevention is a wider issue.  We know that this all stemmed from a totally illegal invasion of Iraq.  That has been acknowledged.  The biggest protest was in Dublin, where 100,000 people marched against that invasion in 2003.  That is where it stemmed from, so the powers that be must look at their actions, as well as the possible unintended consequences of those actions.</p> <p>  It was horrifying to read the release from ISIS, including the reasons and the way in which it described ordinary people doing ordinary things in Paris.  I find it very difficult to understand how well educated girls from the West could go off to be jihadi brides, knowing that ISIS is totally against equality for women.  It is against education for women or any sort of equal rights for women.</p> <p>  One does not fight fire with fire.  While I can understand the rationale of the French wanting to do that, it is only going to create a worse situation.  In that bombing there is absolutely no doubt that more civilian lives are being lost in Raqqa and other areas.</p> <p>  Our sympathies are with those who have been bereaved in Paris, Lebanon and elsewhere.</p></speech>

The very important 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, COP21, is to take place in Paris soon.  I warmly welcome Mr. Jim Clarken, Oxfam Ireland, Mr. Ois&iacute;n Coghlan, Friends of the Earth, Ms Anja Murray, Stop Climate Chaos, and Mr. Jerry Mac Evilly, Tr&oacute;caire.  We need only look at this morning's weather and the amount of rain falling to know exactly how our climate has changed.  It is a timely meeting, in advance of COP21 and the 11th session of the COP serving as the meeting of the parties of the Kyoto Protocol, CMP11, which will take place from 30 November to 11 December in Paris.  We will hear a presentation from each member of the delegation and will then have a question and answer session.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Gallery to switch their mobile phones off for the duration of the meeting because they cause interference with the recording equipment, even in silent mode.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p></speech>

We are very fortunate that we have such a body that has robustly engaged on a wide range of developmental issues over recent years.  Climate change is paramount to success in this area.  We will talk initially about climate impacts and what climate justice means.  We will give some background on the negotiations and how we have reached this important point before the Paris meeting, which will happen in a couple of weeks.  We will focus specifically on climate finance and what the EU and Ireland should do.</p> <p>  Although some members might be more than acutely aware of it, I will reinforce the point for those in any doubt that climate change is real and is happening today, not in the distant future.  It has been happening for a number of years and is having a very devastating impact.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, was an unprecedented scientific collaboration and it is now a consensus view of the world's scientific community, approved by the world's governments.  It is a landmark way of working on climate issues.  The evidence of where the climate has moved to and where it is headed is indisputable.  It is important to note this, given that occasionally there are suggestions that the conclusions could be discredited or doubted.  It is very clear where climate is heading.  It is also clear, based on the scientific evidence, that if the increase reaches 2&deg; Celsius, it will be a tipping point from which it will be very difficult to return, and we will have a potential spiral of other events which we will be unable to control.</p> <p>  The committee and Ireland have shown great leadership in development support and assistance over many years.  Mr. Coghlan and I were in New York at the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, SDG, summit, where we were very proud to see the leadership Ireland had shown, particularly the team led by Ireland's ambassador to the UN, David Donoghue, in the negotiations to get the extraordinary agreement over the line and in such a business-like fashion that embraced a huge consultation process.  More than 1 million people across the globe participated and had their voices included.  We have 17 challenging but achievable goals to which the world's governments, including ours, have signed up.  It is a tremendous credit and the fact Ireland was in a position to co-chair it and lead it to this important conclusion reflects the long-standing credit and reputation Ireland has had in this space for many years.</p> <p>  I have started with this because this tremendous leadership, despite dark times in our country, is contradicted by our approach to the environment and climate.  The important message I want to communicate is that one cannot be committed to one but not the other.  If one believes in the importance of our international potential to make change happen and reverse extreme poverty, which we as a people and this body do, we must also firmly believe in what we can do in terms of the environment and climate change.</p> <p>  During the past 15 years leading up to the SDGs, we worked through the millennium development goals and halved global poverty and dramatically reduced hunger.  However, climate change very much threatens the future and the development successes we have had.  We are on the cusp, during the next 15 years, of ending extreme poverty and hunger forever.  It has been shown that it is possible and can be done.  However it will not happen unless we robustly challenge and tackle the climate change reality.  Some of the figures are staggering.  By 2050, up to 50 million more, rather than fewer, people will be put into hunger.</p><p>Rain-fed crop production could fall by up to 50% in some African countries by 2020, that is, in the relative short term.  The WHO estimates that climate change has already been responsible for 150,000 deaths and that will increase to a quarter of a million per year from 2030 to 2050.  A 2&deg; increase in temperature could lead to a 30% reduction in water in rivers in southern Africa and South America.  Sometimes it is hard to move beyond these statistics.  I travelled with Tony Connelly from RTE a couple of years ago to make a documentary on the impacts in Malawi.  In the programme, we talked to real farmers whom we met.  Prior to that, we travelled with Mary Robinson to parts of Kenya and spoke to ordinary farmers about their lifetime experience and what they had seen.  The change in rainfall means that huge areas of land are no longer arable at all.  Unpredictable rain has an impact on societies that have always known exactly when to plant, when they should harvest and what kind of crops they would have.  The yields would go up and down every year but they would be fairly predictable within a range and that has completely changed.  It is having a drastic impact on families, on the lives of people and on the hunger trajectory.<br/><br/>To discuss it in the geopolitical space, it is estimated that a million farmers in Syria have left the land in the past ten or 20 years.  Who knows how that may or may not have contributed to what is happening in that country.  That level of uncertainty has not been helpful. let us put it like that.  Into the future, more and more conflicts and issues will arise because of the impact of climate change.  Large cities in coastal areas are likely to disappear and hundreds of millions of people will have to flee.  The impact on migration and those types of crises will be dramatic.  It seems we have not taken this as seriously as we take other issues, and we have to change that mindset and trajectory.<br/><br/>To give a sense of the justice element, my presentation shows that the northern, so-called developed countries are responsible for creating climate change, yet the developing countries are the most impacted by it.  The entire continent of Africa produces about 2% of the world's carbon, yet people there are suffering as a result of what we have done in the past 150 years in terms of the Industrial Revolution and so on.<br/><br/>With regard to vulnerabilities, I have produced a chart showing the issues that those of us who work in the development and humanitarian space deal with all the time - natural disasters, poor governance, water insecurity, livelihoods, hunger and conflict.  That is in the normal run of things.  When one adds the impact of climate change to that, one sees those kinds of vulnerabilities are increased dramatically, namely, increased droughts, flooding, erratic rainfall, temperature rises, increases in vector borne diseases, land loss and displacement.  Many of these things can lead to greater conflict and can make the governance situation even worse.  It can dramatically increase the number of natural disasters.  The past ten years have been some of the hottest on record.  There has been a huge impact on crops in places like Australia, Russia, the US and developing countries.  The impact of that in this part of the world is that prices increase and change.  In other parts of the world it means that people starve.  There is widespread hunger which leads to widespread conflict which leads to many other issues with which we will also have to grapple.  This leads to humanitarian crises where there is extreme food insecurity and conflict can result from these issues.<br/><br/>I will give an example of one family that has a farm that has been completely decimated by drought.  This is something we are seeing increasingly.  We have first-hand examples of how that is happening dramatically in many places.  From a development perspective, we have made great strides and we cannot allow them to be reversed.  This will require a concerted effort.  We will present to the committee what we believe Ireland's position should be leading into these talks.  If we are to be honest, we are not there yet.  We are concerned that there has been a slightly schizophrenic way of thinking by Government so far on the approach to development, hunger and those issues we care about when it comes to the climate part of the story.<br/><br/>As this progresses, none of us will be immune.  I will show another picture that was taken in Ireland.  It was not taken in Bangladesh.  Up to &euro;2 billion a year is lost by small farmers in Ireland.  There have been lengthier rainfall events in winter, more intense downpours in summer, increased droughts in summer and health risks to farm animals, which will have a tremendous impact on our important agricultural sector.  We will talk more about that later, but agriculture is a concern in terms of the impact and the cause.<br/><br/>We are a coalition of development and environmental organisations working closely together because we care about the same issues.  The message from the development side of this coalition is that a sense of justice is required.  If we believe in a just world - and we do - we have to be responsible and deliver on that responsibility, particularly to those who have had nothing to do with creating this huge problem we face.<br/><br/>I have another small chart showing the <i>per capita</i>CO<sub>2</sub>emissions.  <i>Per capita</i>, Ireland's emissions are a hundred times those of Uganda and multiple times those of everyone else.  We have one of the largest in the world, so we have much more to do in this regard.  The message from the development space is very much that this is a justice, fairness and responsibility issue.  We have managed to support others to lead themselves out of poverty.  It is also about ensuring we do not erode the good work we have done.  We have worked too hard for that.  People here have been committed and farmers, rural communities and people in developing countries have struggled to deliver what we have got so far.  We cannot allow ourselves to go backward.  We have to move forward.  If we are going to deliver on the sustainable development goals, we have to deliver on our climate commitments.<br/><br/>I will now hand over to Mr. Mac Evilly who will take the committee through the next phase.</p></speech>

I am the climate policy officer working with Tr&oacute;caire and I have been following the climate negotiations.  I thank the Chairman.  Our executive director, Eamonn Meehan, sends his apologies.  He is out of the country at the moment but he thanks the committee for its invitation.  Mr. Clarken has set out the ongoing impacts on climate change and the issue of climate justice.  I will now very quickly go through what is going on in the negotiations, the EU and Ireland's role, and our final recommendations.  I will try to get through this quickly.</p> <p>  I will address some of the jargon first.  Some members of the committee may be aware of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change which was signed in 1992 with a focus on driving down emissions.  It focuses on three main areas: adaptation, in other words, protecting the poorest from the worst impacts of climate change; mitigation by preventing further climate change by reducing emissions across all sectors; and the overarching objective of climate finance, which I will speak about in more detail later.</p> <p>  I will give some background on what has been happening in recent years in the run-up to Paris.  Some members might be familiar with the Kyoto Protocol which was the first international agreement on mandatory emissions reductions.</p><p>This commitment has been renewed and runs until 2020.  Negotiations have been taking place in recent years with the aim of putting in place a new post-2020 agreement.  This has been a very difficult process and negotiations have not succeeded thus far.  One reason has been that parties have attempted to negotiate on what is known as a top-down agreement, in other words, specific overall emissions reduction objectives which all parties would have to meet in the relative near term.  What is different about Paris is that it is based on a bottom-up rather than top-down approach.  Parties have put forward voluntary and non-binding national pledges.  In the context of the European Union, this has been done as part of a bloc.  These pledges would then sit as part of the agreement but not within the core legal agreement.  The upshot of this is that there is a high degree of positivity that agreement will be reached in Paris in a month's time. </p><p> While there is likely to be a high degree of political recognition of the need for action, the bottom-up approach on the basis of national pledges has been shown to be insufficient.  The national pledges that have been put forward will not be adequate to prevent the worst impacts of climate change.  The United Nations did an analysis which has shown that 3&deg; Celsius of global warming is likely on the basis of the voluntary national pledges.  In Paris, many civil society organisations and non-governmental organisations will focus on the need for a process to improve, ratchet up or increase commitments and to ensure that this procedure is a core part of the agreement.  In other words, we would not simply have a process of reviewing the pledges, known as intended nationally determined contributions, INDCs, every few years.  Instead, the INDCs would be analysed early and there would be rolling cycles of commitments.</p><p> Our other focus is on the need for a long-term objective based on the latest available scientific evidence.  This means that to prevent the 3&deg; temperature increase, fossil fuels must be phased out and a process introduced for achieving 100% renewable energies.  This means achieving zero carbon emissions by 2050.</p><p> Many non-governmental organisations are focusing on the need for human rights protections to be integrated as a core part of the agreement.  The principal reason for this is that climate impacts and the actions taken to mitigate them have significant potential to undermine human rights.  For example, the use of biomass or biofuels to reduce emissions can have the effect of increasing competition for land.  The upshot of this is that the poorest and most vulnerable people can be displaced from their land as a result of land grabs.  For this reason, human rights protections need to be a core element of the agreement.  </p><p> In addition, climate finance is a major part of the agreement and relates both to pre-2020 and post-2020 processes.  Climate finance is financial support to ensure that the most vulnerable communities can adapt to current and future impacts and develop in a sustainable fashion, in other words, development will not be based on fossil fuels, as has been the case here.  Tr&oacute;caire and other organisations are very much involved in ensuring that there is proper adaptation to climate change.  Improving systems in sustainable agriculture is one example of the type of adaptation currently taking place using climate finance.  </p><p> Having provided a brief overview of the agreement, I will now address what actions need to be taken at a European Union and national level.  The next slide features two statements from the recent encyclical by Pope Francis.  Members may ask why a Papal encyclical features in a presentation on climate change.  The encyclical, which was released in June 2015, is an excellent document that sets out the grounds for climate action.  It makes clear that the need for a climate response is effectively a moral and ethical issue.  The two statements I have included note the injustice of allowing the most vulnerable to pay the high costs of climate impacts and of developed countries taking a business as usual approach that hampers the finalisation of a new international agreement.</p><p> We have spoken a great deal about climate justice and the need for an equitable response.  What is a fair response and how can we support equitable action by developed countries?  Civil society organisations have carried out a detailed technical assessment of how countries need to respond in respect of the INDCs or climate pledges they made as part of the Paris agreement.  This analysis includes the level of emissions that needs to be reduced, the pledges that have been made by countries and an assessment of their capacity, on the basis of income and wealth, to produce a fair share.  The analysis shows that the European Union's response in terms of mitigation and reducing emissions is approximately one fifth of its fair share.  </p><p> How must the European Union respond?  I will not discuss this in great deal other than to note that the EU's pledge or INDC to reduce emissions by at least 40% is too low and must be increased.  EU legislation, particularly on energy efficiency and renewable energies, needs to be improved.  Fossil fuel subsidies must be phased out, as must the use of coal.  We must also address land emissions effectively.</p><p> I will provide a little more context on the European Union's response to climate finance before doing the same for Ireland.  What can the EU do to provide more climate finance?  It can ensure that finance provided is new and additional to existing overseas development aid.  This revenue can be generated by auctions of emissions rights under the emissions credits system.  The revenues from such auctions could be used to generate climate finance.  We are strongly focused on ways in which climate finance can be generated.  Ireland has, however, been silent on this proposal.  At European Union level, we are also strongly focused on the provision of grants for adaptation.  This means avoiding the use of loans, which countries would struggle to repay.  We should also have targets for climate finance post-2020.  </p><p> Having provided the EU context, I will move on to Irish foreign policy.  In May last, the United Nations Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, made a powerful statement on Ireland's inaction or rather its need to take action on climate change.  To be clear on this matter, Ireland is not in a leadership position in its climate response.  The UN Secretary General focused on the need for a whole of government approach to climate change and the risks for Irish foreign policy if inaction continues.  What is the level of inaction?  The commitment made under the 2012 Kyoto Protocol was achieved largely due to the impact of the recession.  However, Ireland has not had a strategy since 2012.</p><p>We have a climate Bill, which I hope will be finalised in the coming weeks.  We are one of only four member states that is not meeting its 2020 EU targets.  The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has clearly stated that we are not on a path to meeting our 2020 and 2030 emission reduction commitments.</p><p> To reduce emissions, we need to finalise and implement a mitigation plan as part of the climate Bill as early as possible.  We must ensure that Government policies that affect developing countries work to promote poverty reduction.  We need coherence between our domestic and development policies.  This commitment was set out in Irish Aid's document, One World, One Future: Ireland's Policy for International Development.  There needs to be action on two key commitments within that document, namely, producing a report on policy coherence and using a relevant interdepartmental committee to review that coherence.</p><p> The final few slides are on what Ireland needs to do regarding climate finance.  As part of the previous Copenhagen Conference of the Parties, COP, there was a commitment that developed countries would generate $100 billion per year in climate finance by 2020.  This may sound like an extremely large or aspirational figure, but it must be put in the context of subsidies to fossil fuel companies, which amount to approximately five times that.  Ireland's fast start financing, which supports adaptation and resilience, totalled approximately $100 million between 2010 and 2012.  This was new and additional to overseas aid but, since 2011, it has counted as part of our overseas aid.  Our contributions to the $100 billion commitment should not result in commensurate reductions in our aid programme.  In other words, this should not be an accounting or labelling exercise.  The $100 billion is to be delivered internationally through the Green Climate Fund, GCF.  The first period for generating funds to that is 2012 to 2018.  Unfortunately, at the last COP in Lima, Ireland was one of only four countries that had not made any pledge to it.  This was a source of some embarrassment and we were given a fossil of the day "award", that is, when environmental organisations during negotiations single out the worst performing countries.  This slide shows the delivery of our "award".  By the end of that COP, the other three countries - Belgium, Austria and Australia - had made pledges.</p><p> In 2015, we did not provide any contribution to the fund.  However, there was a pledge of &euro;2 million as part of the 2016 budget.  The committee may see this as a positive and believe that we have taken a step in the right direction, but the &euro;2 million is insufficient and dwarfed by the pledges and contributions - what is actually delivered - of other EU member states of the same capacity and population.  We have not made a pledge for subsequent years that is in line with similarly developed countries.</p><p> I discussed the EU context, but how will Ireland deliver these funds?  As part of our Stop Climate Chaos coalition, NGOs have done a great deal of research into what is the best approach.  One of our recommendations is for a separate fund to be established to ensure that financing is new and additional.  This was also recommended in 2013 by the Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  To generate these revenues, we recommend using the carbon tax or emission trading revenues.  There is precedence for this, in that a similar fund was set up in Scotland.</p><p> Mr. Clarken gave an overview of climate impacts and the case for climate justice.  Our response needs to be done on the basis of climate justice.  It is clear that the effects of climate change are undermining human rights in developing countries and that Ireland's response is insufficient.</p><p> To summarise our final recommendations, which we hope that the committee can advance, Ireland needs to make a significantly increased pledge, by which I mean ten or 20 times the existing pledge, to the GCF in line with our capacity and what other member states have done.  This can be generated through the establishment of a climate justice fund.  At EU level, Ireland needs to support ways in which climate finance can be generated, namely, the auctioning of emissions rights.  To mitigate and reduce emissions, we must finalise and implement the mitigation plan as soon as possible under the climate Bill and take action on our existing commitments on policy coherence.</p><p> I thank the committee.  I have set out a lot of information for it to consider.</p></speech>

I am conscious of our role in human rights, for example, our membership of the UN Human Rights Council and our overseas development aid, ODA.  We give with one hand, but it is obvious that we are taking with the other hand.  Does it suit us to do that?  Unfortunately, we will have an election in 2016 and do not know what will happen afterwards or what the priorities will be.</p> <p>  Mr. Mac Evilly mentioned subsidies to fossil fuel companies.  I would like to hear more about those.  Policy coherence is vital, yet we are not making the necessary commitments to it.  What are the priorities in that regard?  We received a commitment to climate justice, but is it translating into actions that will make a difference?</p> <p>  I apologise, as I must be somewhere else shortly.  I will listen.</p></speech>

I have never seen weather like it.  The way from Terenure to town was nearly all flooded by the rainfall.  I apologise for being late, as I am normally on time.  I congratulate the witnesses on their contributions and will ask a question.  Climate change affects Africa severely.  What is the up-to-date position of Ethiopia?  It was our pride and joy.  Visits were made and politicians were impressed by what was developing there.  I understand that it has a population of approximately 90 million and a catastrophic crisis is about to begin.  Have the witnesses information in this regard?</p> <p>  My pet subject is beginning to evolve in my brain.  Do the witnesses address the issue of the contribution that we as human beings make by way of our numbers?  A population of 90 million is a lot for such a food insecure area.  Should we tackle the issue of family planning or argue that we are having too many children?  Should some countries consider their reproduction rates in the family system more carefully?</p><p>We do not want to see more starving, pot-bellied children on the African continent.  I was informed and reassured at this committee on various occasions that there was an early warning system to ensure there would never be a recurrence of these events.  Am I being alarmist or worrying too much about Ethiopia?  How much does overpopulation contribute to the degradation of the landmass?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.710" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1159" speakername="Mark Daly" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015111800002#G00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for attending.  I was delighted to request that they come in before the Paris conference.  I think they should come back in January to give us their analysis of what happens there.  The holy alliance of the Pope and the Pentagon says this is one of the most important issues facing the world and the Pentagon says climate change is on a par with the threat of terrorism.  We witnessed the tragic terrorist attacks in Paris last week.  Between 1970 and 2010 half the mammals, birds and reptiles on the planet have disappeared.  That is serious.  It is very difficult to highlight to the public the enormity of this issue.  It is bigger than the threat of nuclear warfare.  While humanity had to prevent the latter from happening, it must also prevent what is happening in terms of climate change.</p><p>The witnesses asked about ending the use of fossil fuels by 2050 but there are silent actors who will try to prevent that from happening because people are making massive sums of money out of such fuels.  How can we prevent those actors lobbying in Washington and Brussels to prevent what needs to be done?  Our guests outlined the consequences of that to which I refer, saying that this is the world&rsquo;s life support system and that there is a threat to life involved.  It is not just a question of climate change.  Life expectancy in China has dropped by five years because of air pollution.  According to an article in today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent</i>, if this is not checked, an extra 25,000 will die because of climate change.  Some articles about the Paris conference made the point that it will decide who lives and who dies.  It is not a question of being optimistic or pessimistic but determined.  The National Geographic Society has joined the Pope and the Pentagon in saying this is what needs to be done.  The 2% target the witnesses have outlined means that we go into the law of unforeseen outcomes but what will happen is highly predictable.  Once beyond the tipping point, there is no going back.  It is a long way to 2050 to reach that target.</p><p>There are things Ireland can do, particularly in respect of farming.  In a presentation to this committee, Mr. Eamonn Ryan said 80% of fossil fuels that we know of today must stay in the ground.  Given that people make billions of dollars out of the oil industry, it will take a serious effort to keep that in the ground.  That analysis must be done.  This committee should reflect and in January learn what happened in Paris.  Copenhagen was not good enough and we have to ensure this is top of this committee&rsquo;s agenda because it affects us all.</p><p>Agriculture creates a huge emissions problem for Ireland but we are not turning it into something positive.  In other countries the emissions are used to generate electricity and energy.  That is where we should put our money, instead of wasting it on carbon credits and wind farms - a matter on which we could have another debate - and make the emissions an income generator.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.711" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ois&iacute;n Coghlan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015111800002#G00300"><p>I am grateful for the invitation, which is timely, and to talk about coming back when we know more about the outcomes is also very welcome.  I will respond to Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s question about Ireland&rsquo;s role and how to counter the power of the fossil fuel industry in the upcoming policies.  I will leave the question about Ethiopia to my development colleagues and others will touch on the population question.  I will also speak about opportunities because it is not all sacrifice.<br/><br/>I spent ten years in the overseas aid and development community before my ten years with Friends of the Earth and have studied Ireland&rsquo;s role from both sides of that coalition.  I was conscious when I moved to Friends of the Earth of Ireland&rsquo;s proud record on overseas aid.  At the time, in 2005, before the recession, we were the sixth most generous country in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, development assistance committee, DAC, <i>per capita</i>, in overseas aid contributions.  We were just below the top five club who were at the 0.7% of gross national income level.  When I came to this job I made a calculation that no one in Ireland had made before and discovered that in the same peer group we were the sixth most climate polluting country <i>per capita</i>.  It seemed unreconcilable over time, otherwise we would be giving with one hand and taking with the other.  Recently, I returned to those figures because I knew that we had essentially met our Kyoto targets, through the impact of the recession more than policy.  We have dropped in aid to eighth place in the OECD DAC <i>per capita</i>and because our emissions have fallen we are now eighth in the peer group for climate-changing pollution emissions <i>per capita</i>.  There is not much of an improvement.  In terms of objective reality Ireland still has this - &quot;schizophrenia&quot; was mentioned earlier but that may be too strong - contradiction in its approach to, and policy on, climate change.  We have not squared that circle yet and the mitigation plan that is hopefully coming out next year has to do that.<br/><br/>I have a fear about our approach to climate diplomacy, which is relevant to this committee.  We have a particular emissions profile where agriculture plays a large role, more so than in other European countries.  For years, Ireland considered that and other issues such as peat and coal and Moneypoint and so on.  We have looked for ways to bring down emissions and had plans to do it, unlike now when we have no plan.  I am fearful of our approach now, watching how this Government has acted in recent years although it is about to bring a climate change Bill over the line.  This is the fourth environment Minister I have watched make this effort.  It will happen before the Paris meeting, which is good and significant, but it will be just a framework and will not include measures for dealing with emissions.  <br/><br/>We have watched the real concerted effort across Departments, which we had hoped would focus on actual solutions, but instead aims at a diplomatic effort to get Ireland off the hook of its 2020 targets under the EU, which are being renounced because they came from the last Government as if they were somehow wrongly calculated and an effort to obtain easier targets for 2030.  This comes across as Irish exceptionalism, as in &quot;We are special and different and should not have to make the same effort as everybody else&quot;.  We would state that this comes across as saying we should not have to do our fair share.  A lay person hearing the messages from the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Taoiseach, who have intervened in this debate, would say that it sounds like Ireland should not act and the current targets are not good for us.  The Taoiseach has spoken at European level about Ireland's being screwed if the targets set for 2030 are proportionately the same as those for 2020 and that this would be catastrophic for the Irish economy.</p><p>Normally we hear such words about climate change when talking about its impact.  The overall targets for Europe are not adequate to the science.  Therefore, when one country is speaking about its targets as being catastrophic, the message to its people and to Europe is that it does not want to act in a way which is commensurate with the issue.</p><p>  We have particular challenges but everyone has particular challenges.  The Germans could say - well, they could have said - Germany produces the best, most climate efficient cars in the world so if the Chinese middle class wants new cars it should buy German cars.  We are saying the same about beef and dairy products.  Of course, food is different, and we can discuss it in more detail, but this approach comes across as seeking not to act.  The risk is that if every country adopts this approach, we will not get anywhere near a deal commensurate with the challenge.  </p><p> This approach is an issue for us because it is an inappropriate way of going about climate diplomacy.  It is also ineffective from a strategic game theory perspective.  Ireland is not getting the traction it hoped it would get at an EU level.  Huge efforts went into getting particular wording in the European Council conclusions last October.  It was trumpeted by Ireland as a success because it did two things.  It gave special recognition to land use and agriculture, which would pan out in how the European target was applied to different countries.  It also recognised, in obtuse language, that it would look again at each individual country's target based on its GDP.  Our GDP is higher than our GNP.  The question was, therefore, what is our real capacity to act.  These were taken by the Government as two very significant moves by the EU.  Now our understanding is that it is not clear that those rhetorical assurances are panning out in real policy changes as Europe gears up next year to adopt national targets under whatever comes out of the upcoming meeting in Paris.</p><p> One analogy is the concession we got at the European Council level with regard to the recapitalisation of the banks and breaking the link between sovereign debt and bank debt, which was trumpeted at the time.  It is much more difficult in practice to get it applied.  In that case it was, exceptionally, retrospective as well.  In this case, the concession would be prospective.  However, applying a special treatment to one country opens a can of worms for the Commission and the European Council.  Our understanding is that there is a significant push back.  Officials inside government are now worried that because we are not meeting our 2020 target and not on track to meet it, we are facing potential non-compliance costs, namely, fines or costs for buying credits overseas.  These costs could run into multi-billions of euro over the course of the decade from 2020 to 2030.  This is not just for farm emissions but transport emissions as well because we have not broken the link between economic activity and emissions.</p><p> There is also a push-back from the European Commission because Ireland's approach has been quite confrontational.  We are saying we are different, the last targets were unfair and that we should not have targets which are commensurately proportionate for 2030.  The approach has been quite pushy.  While it achieved some traction rhetorically, there is now a push-back in practice.  I fear an analogy can be drawn between this and how Ireland dealt with the troika versus how Syriza dealt with the troika.  Ireland seems to be ignoring its own lessons.  In the case of the troika, Ireland complied but then asked for changes along the way and got them.  The argument would be that significant gains were made.  Syriza rejected on principle the way it was being done and, as we know, faced an even stiffer challenge.  Ireland's approach to climate change at the European level is much more like Syriza's approach to the troika than that of Ireland.  I worry that our climate diplomacy is not and will not be effective and will come back to bite us.  The calculations of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Finance suggest the approach runs significant financial risk.</p><p> Our analysis is that Ireland is not even trying to meet its 2020 targets.  The narrative is, "we said they were too high and too difficult and we cannot meet them".  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government recently said that we cannot meet our 2020 targets, even though, as an NGO, we do not think the targets are particularly high.  Therefore, the attitude adopted is not "we must try harder" but rather "we should be given easier targets for 2030".  With regard to climate justice, our overseas reputation and our effort in the sustainable development goals and so on in terms of coherence,  it would be much more appropriate and effective if we were being seen to act as much as possible on transport, retrofitting our houses, farming and energy.  There has been some movement in the area of energy at least.  If we were seen to be as effective as possible in such areas, then when we say we have a particular challenge in agriculture and are different, we would get a much more sympathetic hearing and a much fairer, more realistic, more practical and proportionate deal in Europe on our climate actions.</p></speech>

Many of my questions have been answered already.  I do not think anyone now doubts that climate change is happening notwithstanding the fact that this morning's weather was not that much different to typical Irish weather.  If one goes to places such as Africa, one sees that once arable soil is now dust.  One thing that is really telling is the shrinking of the lakes.  It is frightening to see how much they have shrunk.</p><p>To discuss Ireland's situation, which is Mr. Coghlan's purpose in attending today, I wonder if it is a valid comparison when he says our emissions are so much higher <i>per capita </i>than India or China.  I appreciate emissions <i>per capita</i>is a good way to measure emissions and changes in emissions over time but I am not sure that it is fair to compare us with countries such as China and India.  However, that is neither here nor there.  </p><p>Mr. MacEvilly's presentation looked at the three strands of policy and so on.  Two of the strands were all about money, and I accept that is the case, but we have to acknowledge that we high levels of debt in Ireland.  Our heart is in the right place, we do what we can and we will continue to do what we can.  I feel that is cross-party and not something just for this Government.</p><p>What do the witnesses really expect in terms of mitigation measures?  Mr. Coghlan has covered the issue to some extent.  Is it realistic that we would get out of fossil fuels by 2050?  What is the big ticket item that will replace fossil fuels without a major change in people's psyche, never mind Government policy and so on?  What will happen?  What level of technological breakthrough do we need to achieve something like that?  </p><p>On farming, Mr. Coghlan was saying to sign up to the targets and then look for concessions.  Is that realistic?  We are a special case in the sense that we cannot grow grapes.  Even though we might not have a bigger farming sector than many European countries, the reality is we cannot grow grapes.  We keep cows.  What is the alternative?  How can we damage such a big industry yet still be able to contribute to development aid and all the other things required of us?  It is a big question.</p><p>There is the undoubted role of big powers such as oil development corporations, which certainly are a lot cleverer than the rest of us, and what they will do to try to fool us on and so on.  How do we change people's minds?  How do we change the minds of Governments.  How do we convince people that we have to make that big leap.  What is the big leap?</p></speech>

A depressing picture was painted.  We should all be much more worried about this issue than we are.  We all know that Governments react to pressure from citizens.  Given the picture painted, why is this so far down the political agenda?  Why are ordinary citizens not putting more pressure on governments to respond more positively to the goals about which we speak?</p><p>Is it because they fear meeting more demanding targets will cost ordinary citizens more by way of carbon tax or other taxes?  Is that the reason climate change is so far down the political agenda in Ireland?  How do we change that?  If we do not, and if we do not get the temperature increases below 2&deg;, the world's people are facing a very uncertain future with much hunger and poverty.  Are we over-estimating the impact that 4.5 million people have in the overall equation?</p></speech>

We have another 20 minutes, which is not bad.  Regarding CO2 and our carbon emissions, there is one coal burning station in Ireland at Moneypoint.  That is the main problem we have with CO2 emissions at present and we must decide what we can do about it.</p><p>To take up Deputy Mitchell's point about the <i>per capita</i>CO<sub>2</sub>emissions, in China it is 3.8 as opposed to Ireland's 10.5.  However, China is building coal burning power stations at a rate of one almost every three weeks at present.  Where do big countries that are being heavily industrialised and polluted fit into the equation?  This applies to India as well.  Coal is the cheapest form of energy at present but it has most CO<sub>2</sub>emissions.  There is an abundant supply of coal throughout the world and there are enough supplies for another 150 years.  Have we examined taking the CO<sub>2</sub>out of coal?  That would go a long way in helping us to reach our targets.</p></speech>

The IPCC fifth assessment report states clearly that there must be deep and fundamental changes to business as usual if we are to keep warming below a 2&deg; threshold.  That is what we must do.</p> <p>  There is a worrying theme through some of the responses here with regard to the contribution of 4.5 million people, the coal, agriculture and what else we are going to grow.  We will not achieve anything in responding to climate change if we do not start to put a collective global common good before a short-term national interest.  I have been alarmed that Ireland's response has been about a short-term national interest.  In particular, the focus of all of our negotiations in the past couple of months, if not longer, has been about finding a concession for agriculture.  Agriculture is a very important sector in the Irish economy.  It contributes approximately 7% of our GDP; it is 2.6% with respect to primary agriculture.  It also accounts for approximately 10% of Irish exports.  Most of those exports go to the UK and other European countries.</p> <p>  We must look again at the polluter pays principle.  We have seen the quote from Ban Ki-moon and there are incitements to change our behaviour and systems from people such as Mary Robinson, President Higgins and Pope Francis.  They are not talking about seeking concessions for Irish agriculture, as this is just free-loading on the efforts of other countries that are making cuts to emissions.  We need an overall cut to emissions.  We will overshoot our targets and that is largely attributed to the impact of agriculture.  The general taxpayer will pay for that, whether it is through purchase of credits or fines.</p> <p>  That is an unacceptable situation.  I realise there is a good case to be made, but if one zooms out a little and looks at the ethics of the situation and whether we will achieve our emissions reduction targets and play our role fairly, as we have done for so long with regard to aid and development, seeking concessions for one sector is not ethically acceptable.  I will leave the other questions to other members of my group.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.719" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ois&iacute;n Coghlan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015111800002#J00400"><p>I will reply on the practical questions raised.  There are two aspects to the issue of China.  It is still building coal fired power stations, only it is doing so less fast than it was.  It is also now the largest investor in renewables in the world.  It is taking pollution very seriously because it is seeing the local impact of local air pollution.  The biggest difference between Copenhagen in 2009 and Paris this year is that there have been two big deals in the past year between President Obama and President Xi Jinping in advance of this conference.  The two biggest polluters in the world are showing some degree of leadership on it.  China is taking action and has committed to peak and reduce its emissions towards 2030.  China has been used as an excuse in the US and was raised in the media here as well.  People asked what the point was if China was not moving, but China is moving.<br/><br/>Indeed, one of the things it is doing is capturing much of the business opportunity.  Germany is moving away from nuclear power and into renewables in a big way.  It thought it would build the solar panels but it was out-competed by the Chinese.  The Germans own much of the renewable energy; local people own 51% of it, not big companies.  However, it is mainly Chinese solar panels.  The investment by German taxpayers in subsidised solar energy has driven change in both Germany and China.  We must also acknowledge that much of the Chinese manufacturing is for our consumption.  One can no longer cite China as a reason for the other countries not acting.<br/><br/>With regard to 4.5 million people, nobody is asking Ireland to do more than its fair share.  We are the fourth highest <i>per capita</i>in the EU, so that is another way of looking at our peer groups.<br/><br/>There was a question about whether we can get off fossil fuels by 2050 and how we cope with the power of the industry.  Countries such as Sweden, Finland and Denmark have set that fossil free target for themselves for 2050.  It is possible and there are models for how it can be done and what it involves.  The technology is evolving.  A solar panel in Ireland will get 80% of the impact of a solar panel in Madrid because of our long daylight hours.  However, there is no payment for having one for electricity generation.  That is one change we must see here.  Solar has potential, as does anaerobic digestion.  Obviously, wave and tidal power have possibilities.  The biggest, easiest win is in retrofitting our homes and reducing our need for heating in our homes.  Down the line there are electric vehicles combined with storing the renewable power that is generated.  Almost all of the reductions we need can be done with existing technology.  It is a question of deployment and change, and not getting locked into new investments in fossil intensive power.<br/><br/>On the power of the fossil fuel industry, there are some changes.  Rather than campaigners focusing mainly on the high level issues, as we are here today and will be in Paris, or even the semi-abstract content of a climate Bill, more public attention and focus is going on fossil fuel infrastructure.  President Obama made a big decision a couple of weeks ago not to build the Keystone XL pipeline from the tar sands in Canada, the most polluting source of oil, for the oil to be refined in the US.  He did not think it was economically useful, given how things are going, or climate appropriate.  It is the first time a country has rejected major infrastructure because of its impact on climate change.  That is leadership from the US, but we must see it more generally.  Ireland will face decisions about peat, Moneypoint and fracking in the future.  Do we go down the energy efficiency and renewables path or the fossil path?  It is the choices we make.  It will not be one big thing, just many choices.</p><p> There was a question about taking the CO2 out of coal.  There is a lot of talk, particularly from the coal-producing states in the US, about clean coal and the potential of carbon capture and storage, CCS.  That process involves putting something at the end of the tailpipe, sucking out the CO2 and storing it underground, often in old gas fields.  It is potentially possible and there is no harm in researching it, but there is no sign of it happening as yet.  The UK has given particular concessions to gas-fired power stations that were CCS-ready, which meant, in the case of Drax or one of the other large stations, having an empty space on the site so that when the technology came along, there would be somewhere to put it.  Beyond that, however, we are not very close to progress in this area.  We certainly cannot use the potential of CCS as a reason not to act.  We must act now, and perhaps in 2030 or 2040, or whenever CCS comes on stream, we can make use of it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.721" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Clarken" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015111800002#K00200"><p>I will try to cover some of the questions that have not been addressed.  Deputy Eric Byrne referred to the situation in Ethiopia, which is a major concern for us all.  That country has made tremendous strides in the past ten, 15 or 20 years, but the whole region is now facing a food crisis.  We must ensure Ethiopia is supported now, when it is struggling, after a period of doing so well.  We all recall the darkest days for the country and how far it has progressed.  The situation in Ethiopia is a watching brief and we are working with partners there to see what can be done.  Of course, Ethiopia is affected by the conflict in South Sudan.  There is a regional issue that needs to be addressed, with a greater focus on pushing the parties involved to come to a resolution.</p> <p>  The population question is something of a perennial for some of us, specifically in the context of climate impact.  To respond in a personal way, I have three children under the age of five and it is fair to say they probably have already used more carbon than their counterparts in developing countries.  Certainly, through the course of their lifetimes, they will, with the best efforts of their parents and our society, use multiples of what people in developing countries use.  It is the parents and grandparents of children in Ireland today, and previous generations, who are the cause of the climate impact on countries like Ethiopia, not the Ethiopian people themselves or the fact that more Ethiopian children are being born.  There is an inevitability in terms of where the population trajectory is heading in the next 20 or 25 years.  We can do nothing about that but we must push for better levels of education in developing countries, particularly for girls and women.  We need to ensure girls stay in school longer, space their children better and have fewer of them.  There is nothing more definite than that when one has middle classes in a society, people will have smaller, better educated and more protected families.  It is really about the need for poverty alleviation rather than blaming population increases.  That is an important message to get across.</p> <p>  In his analysis of the threat of nuclear power, Senator Mark Daly wondered whose lives will be saved and whose will not.  Those are very strong lines and I am glad the Senator is using them because that is how serious this issue is.  As Senator Michael Mullins said, for some reason we have not quite captured that imagination yet.  There is a great deal of activity going on in this area.  For example, a large protest march is planned for Paris and a stepping up of public engagement.  Many of us have been engaging with the public on these issues for years.  Lots of people, for several generations, have been hugely passionate about them, and more and more are taking the concerns on board.  People are joining the dots and getting more involved.  The flip side to this is that action requires leadership as opposed to followership, which in turn requires courage and doing things even if they are not yet on the popular agenda.  It is a question of working together to find out what we can do to mobilise people and how we can collectively ensure they are fully engaged.</p> <p>  Deputy Olivia Mitchell spoke about Ireland's share or part in bringing about change.  It is about equity, fairness and justice.  Nobody is asking Ireland to do any more than what is proportionate to its share.  During the worst of the economic crisis, the aid budget was cut by 35% or so.  In the past five years, however, it was more or less kept steady.  That required political leadership, and we should give credit where it is due.  The public was not clamouring for the level of aid to be retained but the political leadership decided it was important enough to do.  Equally, this is important enough to do and it requires that kind of leadership.  I am absolutely convinced the public will come along with us on this.  People are becoming more and more aware of the impact climate change is having not just somewhere far away but in our own country today, in the course of their lifetime and in their children's lifetime.  That is something we need to work on together.</p></speech>

I apologise for missing the start of the meeting.  Unfortunately, I had a clashing event to attend.  I am not convinced there is a groundswell of support to tackle climate change such as Mr. Clarken described.  Those of us who have for several years been giving the leadership he referred to find ourselves facing assassination from all sides.  I have to attend a public meeting tomorrow night to explain why I am supporting wind energy and other initiatives.  There is a lot of money being spent to ensure I am convinced otherwise.  However, I remain committed to recognising the need to respond to climate change and was formerly a party spokesman in that area.</p> <p>  Agriculture in this country represents a major part of the economy and was instrumental in the economic recovery we experienced in the past four or five years.  Without it, as well as the pharmaceutical and IT sectors, we would not be where we are now.  It is 90% indigenous - that is, generated locally  and 85% export-led.  In other words, a minimum of 85% of all the agricultural produce made here is exported.  It is a huge part of our economy and it must be protected.  There is a variety of ways to do that, including via alternative energy.  I am not and never was in favour of nuclear energy.  There are dangers to it, as we saw not too long ago with the Fukushima event.</p> <p>  When it comes to road transport, we cannot change the amount of fuel used and, consequently, the amount of carbon.  We are not going to run big trucks electronically; that is not going to happen.  It is a question of weaving a path between the needs of agriculture and road transport, on the one hand, and the carbon penalty regulations on the other.  We are in trouble if we do not find a way to do that.  It is all very fine to say Ireland should lead the charge and make the sacrifices.  Certainly, we are committed to meeting our targets and are doing our best in that regard.  I do not know whether we will meet them, but we should be very careful not to sabotage our own industries in the course of our efforts.  I do not agree, moreover, that every country in the world is pulling its weight in this area.  China has come on board in recent times, but in terms of the totality of the problem it has to deal with, there is a long way to go yet.</p> <p>  A number of options have been put forward as alternatives to carbon fuels, one of which is hydroelectric energy.  The Turlough Hill idea is a feasible one that could be merged with wind to replace what we have.  The Moneypoint generator produces 1,000 MW and is the largest single contributor to the national grid.  If we take that out and replace it with something else, then we have a serious void in terms of reliable energy production.  We can replace it with biomass but for that we need 1 million acres to grow the food for the biomass, which would have to come from land currently used to produce food for human consumption.  That creates its own problems, particularly in places such as Latin America.</p><p>I spoke with a guy about solar power.  I am finishing on this, Chairman, but this subject is of particular importance to me.</p></speech>

I am not sure support from me on wind energy is useful to Deputy Durkan, but I recognise the challenges he has been facing.  It is a debate we engage in frequently in public and private with people to find ways to involve communities positively in looking for solutions.  I recognise the challenges the Deputy faces.</p> <p>  On the question of whether there is a groundswell for action more generally, politicians have been saying to us for years that climate change does not come up on the doorsteps.  I take their word for it, but our response - and I do not mean it tritely - is that banking regulation did not come up on the doorsteps in 2002 or even in 2007.  The challenge for leaders, as people with a far greater awareness of what is going on than people who are struggling through the challenges of daily life, is to take on board the evidence of an overheating planet, as evidence of an overheating economy should have been taken on board, and to act on behalf of all of us.</p></speech>

One recommendation of ours is that the committee could examine the issue of policy coherence.  Deputy Durkan referred to biomass and biofuels, and those are issues we have concerns about.  We ask that those matters be taken forward also.  In relation to Ireland's emissions being perhaps irrelevant in the context of the big players, while they may be small in comparison with the biggest countries, it does not change the fact that our harmful emissions contribute and will contribute to damaging climate change.  It also goes back to the point about exceptionalism.  This is also true of a lot of other smaller developed countries and it is an issue of responsibility, as the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, has stated.</p> <p>  As to why this is not high on people's agendas, it is probably not understood that this is a human rights issue.  It is affecting food security in the developing world.  By 2025, two thirds of Africa may be subject to water stress, with similar pressures on crop production.  With that in mind, we are making recommendations on mitigation which Ireland needs to put in place.  It is not about putting pressure on an individual industry, but about a mitigation plan across all sectors.</p> <p>  Deputy Olivia Mitchell asked about Ireland being subject to financial pressures.  That is precisely why we have recommendations as to how climate finance can be generated.  In other words, it is about finding new mechanisms to generate those funds.</p></speech>

I remind members and those in the public Gallery to ensure their mobile phones are switched off completely for the duration of the meeting because, even when in silent mode, they cause interference with the recording equipment in the committee rooms.</p> <p>  The purpose of today's meeting is to consider two motions, referred to the select committee by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, on the economic partnership agreement between west African states, the Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS, and the West African Economic and Monetary Union, UEMOA, of the one part and the European Union and its member states of the other part.  The second motion is the economic partnership agreement between the CARIFORUM states of the one part and the European Union and its member states of the other part.  Under the terms of the D&aacute;il motion of 11 November 2015, the select committee must consider the matter and report back to the House not later than 26 November 2015.</p> <p>  On behalf of the select committee, I welcome the Minister of State with responsibility for development, trade promotion and North-South co-operation, Deputy Sherlock, and his officials.  I congratulate him and the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, on their superb work in recent weeks.  We know it has been very difficult to get them because they have been in Belfast.  It is good that the Stormont talks were successful and I congratulate our delegation from the Irish Government which took part in the talks.</p> <p>  We will hear an opening presentation from the Minister of State and then take questions from members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.754" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/979" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOS2015111800002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for his expression of congratulations.  I will be sure to convey the message to the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and the team involved in the talks at Stormont House.</p> <p>  I am joined by Ms Dympna Hayes and Ms Mary Barrett from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Ms Lorraine Benson from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  If there are any very technical questions which I am not able to answer, we have three experts here.  I thank the Chairman and members for this opportunity to discuss the two motions before us, which have been referred to the select committee for consideration.  The motions seeks D&aacute;il approval of the terms of the EU&rsquo;s economic partnership agreements with 15 Caribbean countries and with 16 west African states and their two regional economic organisations.</p> <p>  As members of the committee are aware, the agreements in question involve mixed competence.  This means they cover matters falling within the exclusive competence of the European Union, such as the common commercial policy, as well as issues which remain within the competence of member states, such as development co-operation.  For this reason, each EU member state is a party to these two agreements and they can only formally enter into force after they have been ratified by all member states.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, the approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is required prior to ratification whenever the terms of the agreement involve the possibility of a charge on public funds.</p> <p>  As it can take a considerable length of time before ratification procedures are completed in all 28 member states, arrangements are usually made for some aspects of agreements such as these to be applied on a provisional basis pending their formal entry into force at a later date.</p><p> These two agreements are significant in that they are the first full economic partnership agreement, EPA, signed between the EU and African, Caribbean and Pacific, ACP, countries.  Members of the committee will recall that historically ACP countries benefited from unilateral trade preferences with the EU.  However, these were deemed to violate World Trade Organization, WTO, rules on the basis that they established unfair discrimination between developing countries.</p><p> In 2000, the EU and 77 ACP states concluded an agreement known as the Cotonou Agreement.  This provided for a new trade and development framework based on EPAs.  These are a new type of multilateral agreement combining both trade and wider development issues in a unified framework and containing reciprocal preferences in trade between the EU and ACP states.  On this basis, in 2001 the WTO agreed to give a waiver to the EU to continue the unilateral preferences until 31 December 2007 when these agreements were expected to come into effect.  The original intention was for the EU to conclude comprehensive EPAs with the six regional groupings of ACP states.</p><p> Following protracted and difficult negotiations, only the Caribbean was in a position to initial a full EPA before the December 2007 deadline.  Twenty-one other ACP countries initialled interim agreements in smaller subgroups or individually.  In west Africa, two interim EPAs were concluded with Ghana and the Ivory Coast.  The interim agreements have been acting as building blocks to full EPAs, negotiations on which have been ongoing in Africa and the Pacific.  Last year, a full EPA was signed with west Africa and negotiations were concluded on two full EPAs with the east African community and southern African development community EPA states.</p><p> These EPAs are pioneering agreements in the international trading system.  They are the first genuinely comprehensive north-south trade agreements which seek to promote sustainable development, build a regional market among developing countries and help eliminate poverty.  The agreements seek to put trade at the service of development.  The EU&rsquo;s trade and development partnership with the ACP states stretches back more than 30 years.  These agreements build on that partnership.  The aim is to make it easier for people and businesses from the EU and the Caribbean and west Africa to invest in and trade with each other, thus helping Caribbean and west African countries grow their economies and create jobs.</p><p> I will now introduce the EU-CARIFORUM economic partnership agreement to the committee for approval.  The agreement is between the EU and its member states and the Caribbean forum of African, Caribbean and Pacific states, CARIFORUM.  The CARIFORUM members party to this agreement are Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, the Dominican Republic, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Christopher and Nevis, Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago.  The agreement was signed in the Caribbean on 15 October 2008 and Guyana signed on 21 October 2008.  It entered into provisional application on 29 December 2008.  The EU worked together with the Haitian authorities to adjust some of that country&rsquo;s tariff commitments in light of its specific needs as a least developed country.  This made it possible for Haiti to sign the agreement on 10 December 2009.  As of now, it has been ratified by 17 EU member states and eight CARIFORUM states.</p><p> The agreement comprises six parts.  Part I, trade partnership for sustainable development, sets out the objectives of the agreement with specific articles on sustainable development, regional integration and monitoring.  It recognises development co-operation as an essential factor of the agreement with the EU to support implementation of the agreement via the European Development Fund and other relevant instruments.  EU member states undertake to provide support via its development policies and instruments, in accordance with complementarity and aid effectiveness principles.</p><p> Part II, trade and trade related matters, removed tariffs and quotas on CARIFORUM exports to the EU immediately.  From the Caribbean side, there is a gradual opening of markets covering 61.1% of the value of CARIFORUM imports from the EU over ten years, 82.7% over 15 years and 86.9 % over 25 years.  The agreement contains considerable flexibility for the Caribbean countries to exclude sensitive products and industries from liberalisation.  The main exclusions from tariff cuts are agricultural and processed agricultural products, some chemicals, furniture and other industrial products.  The agreement provides for rephasing of the CARIFORUM liberalisation schedule if serious difficulties arise in respect of specific imports.  It also provides for possible modification of the CARIFORUM commitments, having regard to the special development needs of nine of the CARIFORUM countries.</p><p> Part II also includes provisions on investment, trade in services and electronic commerce.  The EU is making substantial concessions in the services sector, opening up new markets for Caribbean companies, investors and professionals to offer services in the EU in areas like international phone calls, banking and architectural services, including new services sectors such as entertainers, chefs de cuisine and fashion models.  In turn, CARIFORUM countries have also made offers, in particular in export-oriented and infrastructure sectors key for their development, such as telecommunications, transport, tourism, manufacturing and environmental services.</p><p> Part II covers trade defence instruments and non-tariff measures.  It includes provisions to support WTO and other multilateral compliance and co-operation with regard to customs and trade facilitation, agriculture and fisheries, technical barriers to trade as well as sanitary and phytosanitary measures.  The agreement seeks to improve the business climate and boost trade.  To this end, Part II also covers commitments in trade related issues such as competition, innovation and intellectual property, public procurement and the protection of personal data, along with complementary co-operation and assistance.  There are provisions to protect and uphold environmental standards and workers&rsquo; rights while guaranteeing the rights of the CARIFORUM countries to regulate and manage their own affairs.</p><p> On the trade aspects of the agreement, under Protocol I, Caribbean countries now benefit from improved rules of origin that support the development of industries that import materials to make goods for onward export to the EU.  This is important for industries such as processed food or fisheries which might import raw materials from outside the Caribbean.</p><p> Part III outlines the procedures for dispute avoidance and settlement.  Part IV provides for general exceptions, for example, in the areas of security and taxation.  Part V provides for supervision and monitoring of the agreement via a ministerial council and three committees comprising senior officials, parliamentarians and civil society representatives.  Part VI covers sundry general and final provisions.</p><p> Last July, the Caribbean EPA ministerial joint council reviewed the first five years of implementation of the agreement.  A study conducted as part of the review found that efforts to implement the EPA were hampered by the global recession which hit just as it was being signed in 2008.  Our Caribbean EPA partners are all small island developing states and were particularly impacted, given their openness to the global financial and economic system and high dependence on a narrow range of income-generating sectors such as tourism.  Nonetheless, the study found a positive EPA effect for some agricultural and industrial exports from the Dominican Republic and for products such as rice, frozen shrimp, citrus and rum in the other CARIFORUM countries.</p><p> The study identified five big ticket items to be addressed.  The first of these is ratification by all CARIFORUM and EU states.</p><p>With my attendance at the committee today, I hope Ireland can play its part in addressing the recommendation.  Other actions recommended are continued support to the regional and national EPA units and substantive discussion on a regional development fund, and continued engagement with the private and public sector on the EPA.  The other two recommended actions have already been addressed, namely, the establishment of a sub-committee on development and the convening of the consultative committee, and the establishment of a monitoring task force.  The July EPA CARIFORUM-EU ministerial council concluded that in spite of the challenges which had so far confronted implementation, the EPA has tremendous potential for contributing to the sustainable development of CARIFORUM states.</p><p> Between 2008 and 2013, the EU, including Ireland through our contributions to the European Development Fund, supported a &euro;75 million EPA implementation programme for governments and businesses.  This was part of a wider &euro;165 million EU package promoting regional integration in the Caribbean.  Additional support was provided bilaterally by the United Kingdom, Germany and Spain.  From 2014 to 2020, the EU will provide a further &euro;102 million for region-wide development programmes, with regional integration and EPA implementation among their main goals.  This is one of three focal sectors in a package of &euro;346 million, the others being climate change and crime and security.  Implementation in all three sectors will be boosted by the work of the Caribbean Investment Facility, which will receive &euro;135 million to blend grant resources with additional funding, notably from European and regional finance institutions and the private sector, to facilitate the mobilisation of much-needed key infrastructure investment.</p><p> I introduce the EU-West African EPA to the committee for approval.  The agreement is between the EU and its member states and the west African states, the Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS and the West African Economic and Monetary Union, UEMOA.  The 16 west African states are Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo.  The agreement was signed by Ireland on 12 December 2014 and in west Africa on 15 December 2014.  All EU member states and 13 of the 16 west African states have signed.  Gambia, Nigeria and Mauritania have yet to sign.  The agreement comprises seven main parts.  Part I, entitled "Economic and trade partnership for sustainable development," sets out the objectives and principles of the agreement, with specific articles on economic growth, sustainable development and regional integration.  Part II, entitled "Trade policy and questions concerning trade," removes tariffs and quotas on west African exports to the EU immediately.  West Africa will liberalise 75% of tariff lines over 20 years, with no liberalisation in the first five years.  A wide range of west African goods considered most sensitive are permanently excluded from the requirement to liberalise, ranging from agricultural goods to industrial goods and including the following: meat and poultry; processed meat; fish and fish products; milk and milk products; eggs; cocoa and cocoa preparations; cement; and textiles and apparel.  At the same time, the progressive elimination of tariffs on goods such as equipment and other inputs will make them cheaper for local businesses.  In addition to this gradual and controlled liberalisation, west African countries will be able to avail of safeguards if imports of liberalised products are increasing too quickly and jeopardising local markets or where food security is threatened.  Special protection is also foreseen for infant industries.  In addition, the agreement recognises the special development needs of west African countries and provides scope to change their tariff commitments.</p><p> Part II of the agreement also covers trade defence instruments and non-tariff barriers.  It includes provisions to support WTO and other multilateral compliance and co-operation with regard to the following: technical barriers to trade, sanitary and phytosanitary measures; facilitation of trade, customs co-operation and mutual administrative assistance; and agriculture, fisheries and food security.  Specifically on agriculture and fisheries, the EU will not subsidise exports of EU farm products to the region, and a high-level dialogue on agricultural policies will be established, creating transparency and improving coherence on agricultural matters within the region and with the EU.  In conclusion, on the trade aspects of the agreement, under Protocol 1, west African countries will benefit from improved rules of origin which will allow them to source materials from other countries to produce duty-free exports to the EU.</p><p> Part III of the agreement, entitled "Cooperation for implementation of development and achievement of the objectives of the EPA," provides for support from the EU via the European Development Fund and other relevant instruments and from EU member states in accordance with aid effectiveness, co-ordination and complementarity principles.  The agreement links support to the EPA development programme, known by its French acronym PAPED.  The PAPED was developed during the negotiations by the west African parties.  The conclusions of the EU Council of Ministers of 10 May 2010 and 17 March 2014 confirmed the commitment of the EU and its member states, with more than &euro;8.2 billion provided in the period 2010 to 2014 and a commitment by the EU to provide at least &euro;6.5 billion for the period 2015 to 2020.  The latter amount corresponds to the existing needs as estimated by the west African authorities.</p><p> Of the &euro;3 billion to be delivered by the EU institutions, the delivery of almost &euro;1.2 billion by 2016 has already been committed to.  Following discussions with west African countries, support will focus on key priority sectors relating to trade, including agriculture, infrastructure, energy and capacity building for developing civil society.  The European Commission is in discussions with member states and the west African countries to co-ordinate the response to the PAPED, and Ireland is taking part in these ongoing discussions to determine how we can best assist in implementation of the agreement.</p><p> Part IV of the agreement outlines the procedures for dispute avoidance and settlement.  Part V provides for general exceptions - for example, in security and taxation.  Part VI provides for supervision and monitoring of the agreement via a ministerial council and three committees comprising senior officials, parliamentarians and civil society representatives.  Part VII covers final provisions.  These include a provision for the suspension of trade benefits where any party fails to fulfil its obligations on human rights, democratic principles, the rule of law and good governance under the Cotonou Agreement.  There is also a revision clause providing for the agreement to be assessed or reviewed every five years while also allowing review as required.</p><p> I thank the committee for its time.  I am happy to recommend these two agreements for approval.  They present a strategy to assist our Caribbean and west African partners to build larger markets and foster trade in goods and services as well as stimulate investment.  They reaffirm the EU's commitment to a close trade and development partnership with the two regions.  I encourage the committee to recommend to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann that the two proposed motions be approved so that Ireland is in a position to notify the Council of the completion of its ratification procedures.  I am happy to take questions, and if there are any very difficult questions that I cannot answer, I have a very competent team of experts with me.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.757" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/970" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOS2015111800002#C00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his very detailed presentation.  In his introductory remarks, the Minister of State referred to the promotion of sustainable development, building a regional market among developing countries and helping to eliminate poverty.  In his concluding remarks, he referred to sustainable development and a close trading and development partnership between the Caribbean and west African regions and the EU.  We fully concur with these aims and recognise the potential for development for the benefit of both partners.</p><p> It is not just the text of the agreements that is critical, it is their implementation and mechanisms to review their workings as well are necessary.  Flexibility is important as well in the implementation of the agreements.  What safeguards are in the agreement to ensure its fair implementation to suit the needs and capabilities of both the European Union and west African countries?  It was clearly outlined that the agreement will seek to facilitate EU food exports to the west African region.  As eradication of global poverty is a cornerstone of Irish foreign policy, could the Minister of State confirm whether research has been conducted into the impact of the exports on the ability of local agricultural interests, both farmers and producers, to engage with their local and regional markets?  It is clear to us that a worthwhile agreement should not be about displacement of local produce or industry which would in the long term continue to restrict overall growth in the local economy.  We must be very cautious in that regard.  I hope at the level of the Council of Ministers and at the exchange at official level with the European Commission that the agreements would be examined sector by sector to see how they are working out.  Recent comments in the early part of this month by the trade Commissioner were brought to my attention.  She said that the West Africa- EU economic partnership agreement, EPA, protected west African producers in the poultry sector.  I take that as an example of where the very opposite is happening to what the Commissioner told the rest of the world.</p><p> Based on current trends the export of poultry products is likely to destroy livelihood opportunities not only for tens of thousands of local poultry producers but also for hundreds of thousands of cereal producers who provide the animal feed for the local poultry farmers.  A few statistics were brought to my attention in regard to this sector.  Between 2004 and 2014, consumption of poultry meat in sub-Saharan Africa increased by 99%.  However, local production grew only 57% while imports from the EU grew 209%.  By 2014, imports of poultry meat accounted for 44% of sub-Saharan African consumption compared to less than 30% in 2014.  There is increased consumption but the share of the market by local producers is in decline and the European Union is displacing local producers.  That is the type of issue on which we must keep a very close eye.  Ongoing reviews are necessary of the mechanisms and workings of the agreement.  The poultry sector is a very small one from a European Union point of view but it is a hugely important sector for so many impoverished farmers and producers in impoverished regions in the area.  I could not emphasise enough the need for flexibility and for considerable oversight to ensure the spirit of the agreement is followed, with which all of us agree, in terms of trying to grow trade and improve the economic fortunes of people in less-developed areas.  It is very important that the mechanisms are in place to do that.</p><p> The other issue that was brought to my attention was Article 34 of the agreement which deals with the agrifood sector and the export of food.  Could the Minister of State indicate whether there is provision in the agreement for the transfer of knowledge to build up the capacity in those regions to grow their own local agricultural sector and to grow the food industry there?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.759" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOS2015111800002#D00200"><p>Ordinarily, I would be very supportive of proposals of this nature and I wish to be supportive but I am a little bit at sea as to the detail.  The Minister of State is probably relaying what is in the general agreement and we may not find out the detail until a later stage.  We have had one bad experience in relation to a similar agreement in the past, namely, the termination of the sugar regime in Europe.  The selling point at the time was that sugar would become cheaper for consumers all over Europe and it would be hugely beneficial to the individual farmers in Africa to whom the Minister of State referred, rightly so if that were to happen, but that did not happen.  In fact, the reverse happened.  It was of huge benefit to multinational corporations who seized the opportunity not only to replace the poor indigenous farmers in African and other countries but also to improve and enhance their position in the European sugar market.  I do not want such an outcome to be hidden somewhere in the fuzz that goes along with agreements.</p> <p>  I am also aware of the large European dairy companies that have made major acquisitions which will be of huge benefit to them in the context of this particular agreement.  They readily admit that African producers will not be able to compete with them and it was never intended that they should compete with them.  Problems will arise.</p> <p>  Another issue to which we referred in the past is the concept of trade for aid.  Ireland is one of the very few countries which does not employ a policy of aid for trade.  Rightly so, but as you well know, Mr. Chairman, we have visited certain African countries where there was ample evidence of aid only for trade to the detriment of the poorer countries.  I would like to see much more detail.  I would like to know, for example, to what extent engagement took place with the small producers in the African countries with a view to asking them how the agreement would affect them or how beneficial it would be for them, if they expect to enhance their trade and would it be trade with no strings attached.  I would also like to know the extent, if any, to which the whole concept of aid for trade was advanced in the course of the preparation of the agreements.  In addition, I would like to know the extent, for example, to which producers in this country and across Europe &ndash; the ordinary small producers, not the multinational corporations &ndash; are likely to be affected or are being affected in the context of the agreements.</p> <p>  I am fully in favour of removing barriers to trade.  We talked about the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, and other such matters in the past.  There are benefits from it accruing to the poorer nations and all participants.  However, I am very concerned about the extent of the detail that may be wrapped up in the context of the two agreements which spread very wide.  Two Continents are covered by them, and there will be an impact on both Continents.  I am concerned that some of those issues might be of negative content from the point of view of first, the people for whom the help is intended, and second, the producers in this country, for example, the poultry sector, and the impact it might have on the agrifood sector.</p> <p>  I wish to be supportive.  The concept is a good one but I am deeply suspicious.  I have many bad memories.  I was one of the very few people in a previous incarnation of this committee who asked the question about the doubtful benefits of the cessation of the sugar regime in Europe.  Deputy Denis Naughten, who was spokesperson in a different incarnation at the time, also raised concerns.  In fact, the implications were not recognised by the people who were directly affected, either in this country or in the countries for whom the intention was to assist.</p> <p>  I do not wish to be negative but I am happy about the agreement until I see a much greater level of detail trotted out.  I would love to meet and greet some of those people such as FrieselandCampina, Danone and other companies that have launched major investment programmes throughout Africa and made major acquisitions throughout Europe recently and continue to do so.  That is all I wish to say at this stage.  I will not read the list into the record but I will do so at another point.</p></speech>

In terms of how we trade with developing countries, I am satisfied that this country's foreign policy with respect to Irish Aid policy is clearly structured in a way that ensures we trade on the basis of such trade being a sustainable relationship.  That feeds into our position in terms of an EU position on these negotiations.</p> <p>  Specific reference was made to sugar and I want to make a broad point in response to that.  I hail from the town of Mallow and if people check the historical debates of this House, they will note my surname is possibly synonymous with some of those historical debates.  A political decision taken at Council of Ministers level on the future of that industry.  I take the point made by Deputy Durkan regarding the ACP Cotonou Agreement with respect to the broader sugar industry, globally speaking.  The global market for sugar has transpired in a way in which it was not sold to us at the time.  I would make that objective point.</p> <p>  I want to defer to Ms Mary Barrett.  Dare I say it, the people accompanying me are global experts on these agreements and we are lucky to have the benefit of their expertise here.  If there is further political response needed, Ms Barrett can defer to me.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.762" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Barrett" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOS2015111800002#E00400"><p>I will respond first to Deputy Smith's questions.  He raised the question of flexibility and asked if there will be oversight of these agreements.  We can see from the example of how the Caribbean European partnership agreement is already being implemented that this is the case.  The five yearly review was held and a joint ministerial council meeting was held last July to review that.  It found there were areas that implementation has not proceeded as expected because of the global economic circumstances.  That review, and the recommendations flowing from it, shows that there are systems in place once these agreements are being implemented.  There is the joint ministerial council, the trade and development committee, which is made up of senior officials, the parliamentarians group, which is made up of the Caribbean and EU parliamentarians, and a consultative committee, which is made up of civil society.  All these parties are involved in reviewing the agreement and feeding into how it can be improved in the future.  That is the oversight.  There are also examples of flexibility given that so far some Caribbean countries, because of the legislative procedures involved, have not been able to meet all the targets on reducing their tariffs.  It is not a case of the EU coming in with heavy boots and saying they have not met the deadline.  The EU is talking to the countries involved and listening to the issues they have.  It is not pushing the issue but rather is taking it on board as part of this five yearly review.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to safeguards in the agreement to ensure fairness.  As the Minister of State mentioned in his opening statement, there are safeguards in place whereby in the case of too much of a product being imported into a country and that affecting local markets, the country can avail of the safeguard in the agreement.  Also, infant industries are protected by safeguards.  These safeguards are more flexible than one would get at the World Trade Organization.  They have been specially designed for these development agreements.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about studies that have been done.  The European Centre for Development Policy Management did a study for us in Irish Aid in 2012 on trade liberalisation and fiscal adjustment.  It examined previous studies and showed that the fiscal loss impact has been overestimated in many studies, but nonetheless it stated that of all regions west Africa would be more affected than others by fiscal losses.  It is for that reason the negotiators, as the negotiations were proceeding, recognised that west Africa would be more affected.  That is the reason the PAPED was developed.  The west African countries got together and in a participatory way came up with the EPA development programme and they pointed out the issues that would need to be addressed for such an agreement to be successful.  The European Council of Ministers came up with conclusions and said they would address those in 2010 and last year.  Also, a more recent study by the World Bank, specific to Nigeria, has shown that there will be very limited fiscal losses, marginal welfare gains for consumers, and increased jobs and profits for the majority of manufacturing firms in Nigeria from the EPA.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised the issue of poultry.  The EPA has not come into effect yet.  Therefore, difficulties in the poultry sector are not caused by the EPA.  The poultry sector is excluded from liberalisation under the EPA.  The Deputy mentioned the issue of local production, which I have addressed with regard to the safeguards.  Article 34 deals with the prohibition of quantitative restrictions.  If there are any difficulties with that provision, the safeguards will kick in.  The Deputy asked about the transfer of knowledge, and that is exactly what PAPED is all about.  It is about providing assistance in order that the west African countries can build up their trade capacity and move into more intermediate products rather than depending on basic commodities.  We in Irish Aid hope we are playing our part in this.  For example, our support for the international trade centre helps countries build up trade strategies.  It works with the private sector and helps those countries to move into higher value products and to export to the EU and all around the world.</p> <p>  I will now respond to Deputy Durkan's questions.  He raised the question of milk.  Milk is excluded under the liberalisation schedule as a sensitive product.</p> <p>  The Deputy also mentioned how aid for trade was advanced in the negotiations.  Sometimes the phrase "aid for trade" can be a misnomer.  The Deputy was correct in what he said, namely, that there is very much a separation in Ireland between aid and trade in that we provide aid but it is totally separated from trade.  There is an agenda at the WTO and it is called for aid for trade agenda.  It seeks to build up the capacity of developing countries.  For example, at the WTO we support interns at the missions of least developed countries and they provide great support.  They can learn about WTO mechanisms, and when they return to their home countries, they know how to use the safeguards in these agreements and in WTO agreements.  PAPED came about from how aid for trade was advanced.  The west African countries said that to implement this agreement, they would need assistance to build up our trade capacity.  There is where that comes from.</p> <p>  On the question of what this agreement will bring to small producers in Europe, it would bring them potential increased markets.  However, we must recognise that when the Caribbean EPA was being brought in, there were estimates that there would be increased exports from the EU, but because of the economic crisis, that has not come to pass to date.  There was an increase in exports at one stage but then it declined again.  Over the course the Caribbean EPA, the volume of exports from the EU has gone up and down and then levelled off.   Trade agreements in themselves do not ensure something will happen.  They provide a framework and then the companies need to inform themselves about the framework that is in place and take advantage of it.  It can take a while for that to happen.  Such agreements create a framework, an opportunity and clarity for business, and then that opportunity must be grasped.  That is the idea of PAPED and the development co-operation for the west African side, namely, to help them grasp that opportunity.</p><p>For example, Irish Aid has given &euro;800,000 to the International Trade Centre in Geneva this year.  It produced a guide to the agreement for the Caribbean businesses.  Such initiatives will help businesses grasp the opportunities these agreements present.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.764" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1005" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOS2015111800002#F00200"><p>These motions are presented to us in a way that is totally positive and suggest this will be a wonderful success.  Page 7 of the Caribbean agreements refers to the positive EPA effect for some agricultural and industrial exports from the Dominican Republic and some other projects.  That does not come across as a glaring success of what is happening in the Caribbean.  In the previous D&aacute;il, the now President, Michael D. Higgins, was most critical of EPAs and the lack of debate in the Parliament on them.  We should have a full and frank debate in the D&aacute;il on these issues.</p> <p>  Deputy Durkan spoke about how people in west Africa feel about this.  There was an open letter from west African farmers to the European Parliament.  Another document was produced an amalgamation of NGOs, called CONCORD.  The common concerns coming from them was that instead of lifting people out of poverty it will plunge them further into poverty, which will lead in turn to further migration to Europe; that there will be massive impacts on local markets and on long-term food security; and, very significantly, that it will undermine our development aid programme.  We were discussing climate change this morning where we seem to be giving with one hand and taking with the other because of our lack of real commitment on climate change.  I think there is a further element of that with these EPAs.</p> <p>  We know the saying that to give a person a fish allows them to feed for a day but teaching them how to fish or giving them a boat has potential.  Cynically one could say it would be a lost opportunity for the home base.  Therefore, how serious are we with helping Africa to feed itself and lift itself out of poverty?</p> <p>  The letters from the west African farmers and from civil society make us wonder why we are not on the same side as those people in addressing these issues.  Is there something significant in the fact that the most populous of the west African countries, Nigeria, has not signed this yet?  The EU Commission is carrying out a trade policy review but EPAs do not seem to come under that review.</p> <p>  Page 11 refers to the final provisions which sound vague and woolly.  The Minister of State said that there would be a revision clause providing for it to be assessed or reviewed every five years while also allowing review as required.  Is there not a need for much more stringent monitoring of this?  We know it will pass here.  Where is the role for this committee in such monitoring?  Will the Minister of State come back here on that one?</p> <p>  The Taoiseach has said that developing countries across the world have a growing thirst for dairy products, especially infant formula.  However, much of the milk powder that we export is fat filled, meaning that the valuable cream has been extracted and has been replaced with cheaper vegetable fats.  It is also taking from those programmes, including Scaling Up Nutrition, that promote breast feeding, which has been found to have the potential to reduce deaths in infants by double-figure percentages.  This is where I see the contradiction.  That is just one small example.  If we go into it further, we could see other contradictions.</p> <p>  There are very serious concerns here.  I do not think the safeguards are sufficiently rigid or stringent.  Much more active oversight is needed.</p> <p>  On the Caribbean agreement, I do not know whether Cuba wants to be part of it, but I presume the embargo is preventing it from even being there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.765" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1026" speakername="Olivia Mitchell" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOS2015111800002#F00300"><p>Generally speaking, I would be in favour of trade agreements and economic partnership agreements.  I am sure the Minister of State is somewhat surprised to find so much negativity coming from this side of the table.  These agreements are with some of the poorest countries in the world and traditionally the relationship between rich sophisticated Europe and poor Africa has been an uneven relationship.  As other speakers have said, we have received a certain amount of correspondence from civil society groups expressing concerns about the agreement's contents.</p> <p>  For instance, one concern is about the non-tariff barriers to trade which are being eliminated straight off, as far as I understand.  I presume that refers to all products.  It may be protected products; it is not clear.  They are being retained while the tariff barriers, the import duties, are being gradually and partially reduced.  However, the countries have traditionally depended on the non-tariff barriers to protect their indigenous industries and particularly their agrifood sector.</p> <p>  The other major point they have been making is that trade with Europe is not necessarily the best thing for Africa.  The population of Europe is falling and the population of Africa is growing.  The demand in the future will be in Africa and they feel that promoting trade between us and Africa is thwarting the development of inter-regional development in Africa.</p> <p>  The objectives of this agreement include improving governance, sustainable development, increasing capacity, regional integration and eradication of poverty.  One could not be against those.  I am reluctant to argue in any way with what the Minister of State refers to as global trade experts.  However, we want some reassurance the progressivity on liberalisation will be dependent on the progress in implementing the commitments that we, Europe, have made.  Irish Aid has always had the tradition of trying to work for the benefit of the countries with which we trade, but that might not necessarily be the agenda of the entire EU.  We need some assurances that we are aware of these pitfalls.</p></speech>

I have attempted to read these agreements, which are quite substantial, and the Minister of State's contribution.  It is all contained in the documentation if one can fully understand it.  It is terribly technical.</p> <p>  It is very important to be reassured that the Minister of State is the person arguing in favour of these agreements.  The Minister of State covers a very important portfolio, encompassing overseas development aid.  If we were to be fearful of what he is trying to implement on behalf of Ireland within the EU, it would beg the question as to whether he is being honest with us parliamentarians given that we are very enthusiastic about and supportive of the Irish Aid development programmes on which we engage with the Minister of State.</p> <p>  The last time I was involved in this type of debate was when we discussed similar agreements with Colombia, Peru and Europe.  One must respect the role of NGOs in the field and their perspective of what is happening with big brother, big governments or big regional authorities.  I would hate the wrong image to go out from this meeting to the ambassadors of the seven African countries who meet this committee once a year as a group.  When they appear before the committee they insist that they want Africa to be seen as a trading area, they do not want this old image of poor quality agriculture production.  They want to be seen as a continent that is growing and bustling, and wants and is arguing in favour of trade.  Who am I to tell the west African countries that they have it wrong because NGOs have pointed to some possible negative effects?</p><p> The Minister of State will know that I am a fanatical supporter of one of the agencies he supports financially.  It is called Fair Trade produce.  I only buy fair trade bananas and a wide range of fair trade produce, including coffees and other products.  When I give my imprimatur to this deal, I want the people to know that I support it and I want the Minister of State to convey our support for the development of fair trade in the real sense of fairly trading.</p><p> I want to ask two questions.  Who am I to argue against these agreements when so many African nations are arguing for and signing up to them?  From reading this documentation, the missing link in the context of the agreement is Nigeria, which is the biggest country we are talking about and which is conspicuous by its absence.  Yesterday, I was attended the Latvian national day celebrations and I called over and had a chat with the Nigerian ambassador.  It may not be appropriate but I told him that we would be debating this issue and asked him if he had any preliminary direction on his country's thinking in respect of it.  He said that it would be favouring it.  If one looks at the documentation, Nigeria is one of the three countries that have not yet signed the agreement.  The other two are Gambia and Mauritania.  The governments of these states do not need me to shout on their behalf but I will make the case for them, especially those in west Africa.  If I have read the documentation correctly, I see that there is an East African Community and Southern African Development Community EPA.  If we imagine Africa as a continent and see that at least two of its big regional power brokers have already negotiated, signed and sealed EPAs with Europe, who are we to dictate to the west African countries that somehow or other we know more than they do about the implications of this?  Therefore, if my interpretation is correct, we are saying that we will not ratify it even though their competitors on the continent of Africa have ratified these two agreements.  </p><p> Where do I get my sense of security?  Many of these documents refer to the role of the International Labour Organisation, ILO, which can and is likely to be consulted.  There are also provisions to protect and uphold workers' rights and environmental standards, which is very important.  It says that the ILO can be brought in to advise on labour rights.  I do not want to sound as though I have swallowed this whole document in one clean swoop but I would appreciate the Minister of State's opinion on these two key issues.  Why has Nigeria not yet signed up?  How can we talk about west Africa without the biggest and most important of all the countries in the region being party to it?  Can the Minister of State confirm that the neighbours on the continent, the Southern African Development Community and the East African Community, have already signed up to these agreements?</p></speech>

I will bring them in now because there could be overlapping questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.772" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/998" speakername="P&aacute;draig MacLochlainn" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOS2015111800002#G00300"><p>I listened to the Minister of State's presentation.  I have read the CONCORD assessment which, as the Minister of State is aware, is the umbrella group of NGOs across Europe working in development aid and assistance.  From reading its paper and listening to the Minister of State's presentation, one would almost think there were two different agreements.</p><p>I must to put a number of issues to the Minister of State.  These agreements operate outside the framework of the WTO.  They go further in terms of liberalisation by including services, investment and procurement alongside goods.  West Africa had been opposed to this.  This goes further in terms of impacting on its ability to protect its key public services from privatisation.  Twelve of the 16 west African countries are in the least developed countries, LDCs.  They would, therefore, have been entitled to trade with Europe under the Everything But Arms system but Europe has opposed this.  It appears that we have a situation where Europe wants to go further than this.  I see the Minister of State nodding his head.  The reality is that the wealthiest economic region in the world is engaging in a trade agreement with one of the poorest economic regions in the world.  We have a situation where it would clearly be better for many of those countries to trade with each other and trade within their regions rather than being in competition with the established stronger global corporations.  Many of these trade agreements are negotiated in Europe against the best interests of civil society in west Africa.  West African farmers have spoken out on their concerns about this matter.  The Minister of State has presented it almost as if it is benign.  Everybody supports the idea of trade between Africa and Ireland and Africa and Europe and we want to turn the investment we have made in development aid to the point where the countries involved will eventually move toward prosperity and trade with the world.  They need to trade with each other and meet their own market needs first, particularly in terms of agriculture.  How can the Minister of State give the presentation he has given today and not be cognisant of the concerns in the report from CONCORD?  One quote that really alarmed me is from G&uuml;nter Nooke, Angela Merkel's adviser on Africa, who is a pretty important person.  He says:</p><blockquote>Part of the German and European taxes are devoted to various development programmes in Africa.  The new economic agreement concluded between the EU and certain African governments will have the effect of cancelling the impact of these programmes.</blockquote> <p>That is a pretty big statement for the individual who is an adviser to Angela Merkel - the most key political leader in Europe on Africa - to make.  The Minister of State is asking us, as parliamentarians, based on a debate in this meeting, to pass this agreement and to put the imprimatur of the Irish people on it.  Our reputation has been a proud one of world leaders in investment in overseas development aid and assistance and the Minister of State is asking us to put it on the line for this agreement without any debate in the D&aacute;il or Seanad on the matter.  He has the ability to remove this motion from a vote.  I assume it will be put before the D&aacute;il tomorrow and I ask the Minister of State to withdraw it and make time for debating it in the D&aacute;il and Seanad and to include the voices of the NGOs that work on the ground, not only those of civil society leaders in Europe.  Every umbrella group of European NGOs working in Africa is deeply opposed to this.  They say that the support of trade with Africa can be achieved without going down the road of these agreements which are outside the framework of the WTO.  They go further than the WTO would want.</p><p>What is the Minister of State's response?  Has he read this document?  Who benefits from the EPA between the EU and west Africa?  Has he read this, as the Minister of State with responsibility in the area?  If he has, what is his rebuttal of the points that are made?  Will he agree to a debate in the D&aacute;il and Seanad on this vitally important issue which puts the reputation of our State and people on the line before we go down the road of this agreement?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.773" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1177" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOS2015111800002#G00400"><p>I am not a member of this committee but I have an interest in this matter and I welcome the debate.  I think trade is good.  We are probably one of the more forward-thinking countries in the world because we have now brought overseas development aid and trade together.  That is an innovative step.  Hopefully, whatever the composition of the Government that enters office after the election, I hope those two sections remain together because it is vitally important.  It is an area that Ireland can have a big say in.  Trade agreements are vital.  They are vital for these developing countries to get access into premium markets in Europe.  No deal is better than a bad deal.  It is not the African countries that are saying that but our own farmers here in Ireland on TTIP, which is another trade agreement in which we are involved.</p><p>Our own farmers and people are saying one thing while Ministers and the European Commission, who are negotiating this, are saying something completely different.  Both groups cannot be right.  The proof of that will be in the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP.  Across Europe there are governance issues in governments and parliaments.  It is the same in Africa and the developing world.  We are relying on the belief that governments will fight for their citizens and get the best deal for them.  That reminds me of a negotiation in the early 1970s, when our Government negotiated with the European Economic Community, EEC, as it was known at the time, on an economic partnership and hung our fisheries industry out to dry.  To this day, Deputy Mac Lochlainn and many of his peers on the western seaboard say that was a fundamental mistake.  When the French Minister for foreign affairs or trade brought it to the French Parliament at the time and a member of that parliament asked about the fishermen in Ireland, he was told that the Irish Government was dealing with it.  We have seen the effects of this.</p><p> It is not the case that individual governments will always focus on the issues and the impacts of policies on the ground.  Our Government told us the price of sugar was going to collapse but now it is called white gold.  The end of our sugar industry was supposed to benefit the developing countries.  The African, Caribbean and Pacific, ACP, countries, through the Everything but Arms agreement, have not had preferential access, and they, along with Irish farmers, have been the big losers in this, as the Minister of State knows better than anyone.  The problem with EPAs is that they are far too focused on EU net exports rather than economic stability in these developing countries.</p><p> I made the point in the D&aacute;il last week that leaders across Europe are wringing their hands about migration from Africa, but in tandem with that the EU is pushing through these trade agreements that are loaded against local farmers.  The EPAs are leading to food insecurity in some of these countries and to conflict, which forces people to migrate from there to Europe.  The EPAs in some cases are pouring fuel on the fire of migration.  We need to take that into account when we consider and negotiate the EPAs, but that has not happened to date. </p><p> In respect of the west African EPA, the Senegalese Minister of Commerce has criticised the lack of effectiveness of the safeguards in the EPAs that should be written into them.  Poultry is not part of this EPA, yet the legs and wings of European chickens are literally being dumped on the West African markets, completely undermining the sector there.  The sector will find it hard to recover from that.  The farmers have moved to the cities where they cannot get jobs.  They see a better life in Europe, and they move to North Africa, get on dinghies and end up being drowned in the Mediterranean.  That is what can happen if the agreements are badly structured.</p><p> The Caribbean EPA is a good example, because it was implemented seven years ago, and we can see whether the EU delivered on its part of the bargain in these negotiations.  One of the issues arising now are the para-tariffs, special levies that are not official import duties but that are a huge source of revenue for these island communities, making up to 15% of government revenue in some of them.  Those Caribbean countries have to eliminate the tariffs by the end of this year.  That will undermine the economic stability of some of them.  Part of this agreement was to do with knowledge transfer.  Members of the European Commission have been coming here for the past few years.  Love them or loathe them, they have been providing advice and assistance to the Government and the public service on how to bring about reform.  That has not happened in these Caribbean countries.  The Commission has not advised them on how to replace these para-tariffs with something else.  Have we as a country worked with some of these countries to explain the Irish experience in bringing in foreign direct investment and using a low corporation tax rate as an incentive to drive economic development?</p><p> Ms Barrett mentioned Haiti.  She is right in that there are particular challenges there, but the EU has not been prepared to provide the type and scale of assistance that Haiti needs to reform its structures.  It is the least developed country in the Caribbean agreement.  If as a community we are not prepared to bend over backwards and facilitate one of the poorest countries in the world, what hope do the four least developed countries in the east African EPA have, or the 12 least developed countries in the west African EPA, or the two poorest countries in the south African EPA?  The European Commission is saying one thing but failing to deliver on it in these bilateral agreements.  It undermines the EU responsible trade policy, which aims to introduce flexibility into these agreements, particularly where there are economic issues at play.  One example is the sanitary and phytosanitary provisions which are standard in these agreements.  It is all well and good to say we will open up trade from these countries into Europe and reduce the tariffs for a certain amount of goods or for all of a particular product, but we are putting up other trade barriers in the way of sanitary and phytosanitary provisions.  As someone from the most rural constituency in the country I know how important it is to have disease protections in place.  I am not talking about that, but in the Caribbean agreement in respect of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, one condition was that the EU would build an airport so that the people could export goods from their islands into the European Union.  The promised investment was delayed, but hopefully by the end of this year the airport will be opened.  The export of flowers to Europe, particularly into the United Kingdom, is a market with huge potential for them, but to do that they must send 200 consignments a year for three years into the EU before they will get a reduction on their inspection charges.  Those inspection charges over the next three years are 400 times the inspection charges of other established export countries into the EU.  They are in effect a barrier.  If for some reason they do not get 200 consignments next year - because the airport will only open, hopefully, next month - that will kick the agreement another year down the road, making it four years before they get approval for reduced inspection fees.  Those inspection fees are a further tariff on export to the European Union.</p><p> Irish farmers have been very critical of how the EU rules are interpreted and implemented, because it is creating additional barriers.  That is the problem with the EPAs and that is the frustration we find in talking to NGOs and organisations working with communities on the ground.</p></speech>

I wish to make a broad point about EU trade policy, to which we subscribe.  I refer members to &quot;Trade for All: Towards a more responsible trade and investment policy&quot;, a document published last month by the European Commission.  It contains a foreword by Cecilia Malmstr&ouml;m, the EU Trade Commissioner.  The new approach &quot;also involves using trade agreements and trade preference programmes as levers to promote, around the world, values like sustainable development human rights, fair and ethical trade and the fight against corruption.  We will use future EU agreements to improve the responsibility of supply chains.&quot;  In terms of seeking to have a debate on the issue, and referring to Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan's point, I agree that there is a need to discuss the wider EU policy implications of trade agreements of this nature in the House and in this committee.  I will do anything I can to facilitate such discussions.  If one is to interpret this forward, there is definitely a shift in the thinking by the Commission on trade policy and I encourage members to engage with that document.</p><p>I am aware of the position of CONCORD in respect of the west African farmers' organisation.  I note that Germany, one of the countries that was mentioned, has signed up to this agreement.  The focus of CONCORD with regard to the west African farmers was on unfair competition from EU agricultural products, fiscal losses, trade diversion towards the EU and the undermining of regional integration.</p><p>On unfair competition from EU agricultural products, west Africa decided internally to exclude almost all agricultural products from liberalisation.  We are confident that if difficulties arise, the agreement also contains robust safeguards which west African countries can use.</p><p>Mary Barrett referred previously to the Irish Aid report which kicked the tyres, as it were, on this.  That was in 2012.  On the issue of fiscal losses, there was a general tendency to over-estimate the direct fiscal losses resulting from an EPA, but it was found that the greatest fiscal impacts were to be expected in west and central Africa.  The report suggested possible strategies to address this.  One was playing with liberalisation schedules in the EPA, second was direct compensation, third was accompanying assistance leading to higher tax collection through economic growth and fourth was using EPAs as a catalyst for wider tax reform to broaden the tax base and increase compliance.  All of these strategies have been accommodated with the agreement with the west African countries, taking sensitivity for revenue purposes into account in their excluded product lists, and the EPA development programme, or PAPED, to deliver assistance in this regard and provision for dialogue on tax reforms and associated support from the European Union.  It was the recognition of potential for fiscal losses to be a bigger issue in west Africa that led to the detailed discussions on the PAPED and the associated commitments outlined in the Council Conclusions in 2010 and 2014.  The European Commission has clearly stated in its latest fact sheet on the EPA that the amount allocated under the PAPED corresponds to the existing needs as estimated by the west African authorities and that the EU will continue helping west Africa throughout the implementation process.  The EU support will continue beyond 2019.</p><p>On trade diversion, which was another point raised by CONCORD, under the agreement west African states have agreed to grant each other at least the same treatment as they are granting the European Union, which speaks to a point made by Deputy Eric Byrne.  This is designed to encourage regional integration and prevent trade diversion by EU products.  On the issue of undermining regional integration, the negotiation of the EPA actively supported integration in west Africa as the 16 countries and two regional organisations define common positions and policies on the issues at stake.  The west African market access offer to the EU is fully aligned with the ECOWAS common external tariff adopted in October 2013 which lays the basis for the ECOWAS customs union.  The implementation of the EPA and the ECOWAS-CET are going hand-in-hand and they will mutually reinforce each other.  Regional integration will be enhanced as the agreement's provisions make customs procedures easier and more efficient.</p><p>Issues were raised regarding the Irish dairy sector, exporting certain types of products and whether those products had been lessened in quality in any way.  That is something on which we need further engagement.  If there are specific and concrete examples of that, we would wish to hear about them.  I am confident, and I speak objectively on this, that there is transparent production from farm to fork with anything we export.  We adhere to the highest standards in that regard and we are bound by EU rules regarding the standards of those products, whether they are exported within the European Union or externally.  The use of the farm to fork motto is something Deputy Smith might have fashioned when he was Minister with responsibility for agriculture.</p><p>My central point is that we must be careful about assertions being made about Irish product going to third countries.  If there is a contention that some of those products are being undermined or devalued in any way to meet export goals and bottom line and profit margins, we must engage further on that.  However, we are absolutely clear in terms of Irish Aid policy and Irish foreign policy.  Irish Aid policy has always been about ensuring that whatever we bring to internal trade negotiations, in terms of an Irish position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>a final EU position, it has been on the basis that the best rules of probity apply and that it is not a paternalistic trade relationship but a relationship of equals.  That is inherent in Irish Aid and in Irish foreign policy.</p><p>Integrating values into EU trade policy also means using trade policy as a lever to promote European values with all parties around the world.  Trade agreements and trade preference programmes can be vehicles to enhance respect for sustainable development human rights, fair and ethical trade and the fight against corruption.  The Commission is saying that it will use future EU agreements to better address those issues.  For example, for the first time the Commission has proposed to include anti-corruption rules in EU free trade agreements.  I hope we will have more time in this committee to debate that policy, &quot;Trade for All: Towards a more responsible trade and investment policy&quot;.</p><p>With regard to TTIP, before engaging on the current Irish farmers' response to TTIP, it is important, with the Chairman's indulgence, to give a technical brief as to the current position of those trade negotiations.</p><p>Sometimes there is a perception that it has been locked down and absolutely concluded but that is not the case.  There are some political points in respect of the concerns of Irish farmers with regard to the TTIP rules.  If I may defer to Ms Benson, she might give a current overview of TTIP.</p></speech>

We just heard that news today.  To give an overview of where we are on TTIP, negotiations commenced in 2013 under the Irish Presidency.  Ireland has a big interest in TTIP because we stand to gain hugely by virtue of the volume of trade we have with the US.  This has been demonstrated in an economic impact study which we conducted and published earlier this year.  The negotiations have reached the 11th round.  It is difficult to know if it is at the half way mark and we have another half to go, or if the glass is half full or half empty, but the negotiations continue apace.  They are heavily detailed and cover many areas and not just market access, including market access for agriculture products.  They also cover, for instance, public procurement rules and regulatory standards, so there is a vast area of work yet to be done.</p> <p>  The council of trade Ministers will be discussing TTIP with the European Commissioner on the 27 November.  Following that meeting, the TTIP statements in December will probably be a good opportunity to have that information on a political level progress report from the Minister in the D&aacute;il.  </p></speech>

I do not think the Minister of State, in his opening statement, claimed that it was.  There is a recognition that the global economic crisis had an impact on implementation.  As I said, trade agreements just provide a framework and there is a recognition that both sides have to work very hard to reap the benefits they can potentially bring.  In saying that, the Caribbean agreement is showing us the way these agreements can work.  The overseeing committees are in place and taking on board the concerns raised by the Caribbean side.  The Caribbean side has brought forward issues about the timing of the tariff lifting and the EU is listening and trying to accept longer phasing and so forth.  The Minister of State addressed some of the points Deputy O'Sullivan raised on CONCORD, west Africa and so forth.  I will, therefore, address the Cuba point.  Cuba is not a signatory of the 2000 Cotonou agreement.  The EPAs flow from the 2000 Cotonou agreement, which gave the mandate for the negotiations agreed by both sides.  This means that Cuba is not party to the EPAs.</p></speech>

It has other issues in it and Cuba would have made the decision not to sign up to it.  That being said, the EU is currently negotiating a bilateral EU-Cuba political dialogue and co-operation agreement and hopes to finish it next year.  That agreement will increase political dialogue and economic relations.  Deputy O'Sullivan also mentioned an EU trade review and EPAs not being included in it.  I will ask Ms Benson to say something about it because she deals with the trade review.</p></speech>

She also mentioned regional integration.  The Minister of State addressed that point and noted the provision on the treatment they would give each other.  On the reassurance on Europe's commitments, the commitment to the west African EPA in the Council conclusions in 2010 and 2014 is at the highest level.  The commitment made in 2010 was exceeded.  It was for &euro;6.3 billion but more than &euro;8 billion was given in the heel of the hunt.

If the five yearly review does not suffice, there is a specific provision in the west Africa agreement that it can be reviewed as issues arise.</p> <p>  Deputy Eric Byrne asked about Nigeria.  The position with Nigeria is that there were elections earlier this year but there has been a big gap between the elections and the appointment of the cabinet.  The cabinet was appointed last week.  In light of the very positive World Bank study last year, which showed the benefits of the EPA, we are very hopeful that Nigeria will be ready to sign now that it has a new cabinet in place.  The committee has received good feedback from the Nigerian ambassador in that regard. </p></speech>

Those have not got to the stage we are at with the west Africa community yet.  Last year, all the negotiations concluded in respect of the west Africa, east Africa and southern Africa communities.  The west Africa community agreement was then quickly put through legal scrubbing and translation.  The EU member states and most of the west African states were ready to sign last December.  The east Africa community and southern Africa development community agreements have been through legal scrubbing, which is where the wording is fine tuned.  The negotiators would have been working late at night so the lawyers on both sides collaborate and agree the final agreements.  That has now been concluded.  It went a bit longer than usual in respect of those two regions but they are now being translated and the next step will be for the EU to bring them to the member states.  We will then proceed to sign and revert to the committee on them in due course.</p></speech>

I heard Deputy McLoughlin's concern on going further than the WTO.  The Caribbean EPA does go further than the WTO because it has extensive sections on services but that is because Caribbean countries wanted those provisions.  They are interested in services such as tourism services.  They are the lifeblood of their countries.  They were, therefore, very keen to move forward on services.  In respect of the west Africa agreement, those countries want more time to go into the area of services, competition and those other elements.</p><p>The west Africa agreement deals only with goods.  The other areas will be discussed in due course.</p><p> Reference was made to the LDCs being entitled to everything but arms, which is the case.  The LDC countries are not obliged to sign up to EPAs but some have opted to do so.  Our key partner country, Sierra Leone, and another partner country, Liberia, have signed up to them.  We are keen to show our willingness to implement these agreements given those countries have signed up to them.  Outside of west Africa, Mozambique wants to move beyond basic trade into the area of services and so it is keen to move forward on those issues.  While some countries want to move forward on issues which go beyond the WTO framework, others do not.  For this reason, there are a few clauses in the EPAs which allow for the countries that are not keen to get involved to be parked and dealt with later.</p><p> Deputy Naughten referred to Senegal.  It has signed up to the agreement.  Irish Aid is attempting to do its bit in respect of sanitary and phyto-sanitary conditions by way of supporting the standards and trade development facility at the WTO.  That facility supports projects in-country.  For example, it assisted in the food flight project to help west African countries deal with such problems.  The EPAs should further efforts in this regard because they include specific sections on sanitary and phyto-sanitary matters to increase European co-operation with the countries in this regard.  Where difficulties are identified in a particular country, the European Union is willing to send veterinary officers to help resolve them.  The EU does not want technical issues to stop trade between countries.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

My concern relates to the countries in respect of which no problem has been identified such as, for example, Saint Vincent, to which 200 consignments must be sent each year for three years despite that it has been shown that it does not have a problem.  The cost involved in that makes it prohibitive to get involved in the trade.  Perhaps some of the EU or Irish overseas development aid could be used to cover the cost of the additional levies until such time as the countries involved - subject to there not being any identified health or disease problems - have open market access.  For a country that has been given a clear bill of health, getting the access is a challenge.</p></speech>

I warmly welcome its president, Mr. Eddie Downey, whom I will ask to introduce his colleagues.  The format of the meeting is that I will invite him to make a brief opening statement lasting approximately five minutes, after which we will have a question and answer session with members.  We find this to be a highly effective approach.  I ask everyone present to switch off his or her mobile phone or set it to airplane mode or another in order that it will not interfere with the recording system.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>I)</i>of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members should be aware that under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/><br/>I ask Mr. Downey to introduce his colleagues and make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I know that members are well aware of the real anxiety among the farming community and rural communities generally about crime in the countryside.  The theft of valuables from rural homes and livestock and machinery from farms is a major concern.  It must be recognised that many farmers and other rural dwellers are living in real fear of their personal safety and that of their families.  That is why it is so important that the issue be addressed as a matter of urgency.<br/><br/>I am joined by Mr. Jer Bergin, national treasurer, who has responsibility within the organisation for dealing with the issue of rural crime and Mr. Colin Connolly who has recently taken up the newly created staff position of rural crime prevention executive.<br/><br/>According to CSO figures, more than 2,500 farm crimes were reported in the first six months of 2014.  They include 1,720 instances of farm machinery being reported as stolen and 218 cases of vehicle theft.  There is also a serious problem with the theft of livestock, with 48 cases reported, including instances of cattle rustling.  There were 280 burglaries or break-ins to farm houses.  We do not have separate figures for burglaries at the homes and businesses of other rural dwellers.  I stress that these are reported figures.  We believe there is considerable under-reporting of rural crime, in particular, the theft of machinery, fuels and other items from farmyards and lesser break-ins to family homes.  <br/><br/>The theft of agricultural equipment and livestock can be financially devastating for farmers who, like all rural dwellers, are very vulnerable when it comes to criminality.  This vulnerability is compounded by geographic and service isolation.  It is the IFA's contention that rural dwellers and farmers are not guaranteed the same level of service and security provided in urban areas.  Many areas have seen the effects of cutbacks and closures of local services, including post offices and other vital institutions, as well as Garda stations and the presence of Garda members.<br/><br/>In response to the concerns of its members, the IFA has taken a lead role in addressing these challenges and we are working with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other agencies to support rural crime prevention.  The IFA has partnered An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in developing the TheftStop crime prevention initiative, a new, practical, simple and cost-effective theft prevention system now available nationwide.  Following successful pilot schemes in counties Tipperary and Donegal last year, the initiative is being rolled out nationwide on a county by county basis.  All rural dwellers are invited to join TheftStop by registering at It has been designed to deter criminals and recover stolen items by ensuring machinery and other equipment are clearly marked with a unique ID, with the details registered on TheftStop's nationwide database.  I thank An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for its co-operation in this initiative and, in particular, assistant commissioner Jack Nolan for his continued commitment.  I encourage all country dwellers, farmers in particular, to become part of the initiative by registering today.<br/><br/>The IFA has welcomed publication of the Sentencing Council Bill 2015 by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  It must lead to longer jail terms for burglars, in particular, for repeat offenders who continue to target family homes and businesses.  The issue of bail also deserves close examination.  There is clearly a serious problem with the level of crime being committed by people released on bail.  Law abiding citizens deserve to be better protected.<br/><br/>The IFA has been campaigning for increased policing hours and the presence of mobile units in rural areas by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to reduce crime and, in general, provide for a safer, more secure rural environment.  I welcome the addition of 200 new vehicles to the Garda fleet and the commitment to continued Garda recruitment.  Last August the IFA launched a policy charter for rural Ireland to support the 440,000 families and businesses in the countryside.  It proposed the following measures to address members&rsquo; concerns about rural security.  The seniors alert scheme which provides financial support for the use of personal pendant alarms by elderly people should be extended to cover the installation of house alarms and there should be full enforcement by local authorities and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of the legislation to curb metal theft.  It was enacted in 2014 and requires all scrap metal dealers to keep proper records and seek proof of identity from those supplying such materials.  A key element of Government support for rural areas is delivery on its commitment to provide a high-quality rural fibre broadband network across the country to support homes and businesses.  <br/><br/>The IFA has taken a lead role in terms of action on rural crime and been proactive in identifying solutions to the problem.  As a clear indication of its commitment we have appointed a rural crime prevention executive, Mr. Connolly, to assist the organisation in this task.  We have established a reward fund of &euro;10,000 with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Crimestoppers to combat livestock theft and developed a community-based text alert initiative in which IFA branch officers play a key role in crime prevention.  Building on our community text service, we are exploring the development, with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, of a full nationwide text alert service that would lead to safer and more secure rural communities.  We are engaging with local communities on the issue of CCTV installation in local villages at locations where it would assist crime prevention and detection.  <br/><br/>The IFA will continue to campaign for support from elected representatives and the Government to protect rural dwellers and businesses.  Today I am looking for further engagement from the committee on the IFA's activities in rural crime prevention, together with its support for the IFA's initiatives in this regard.  We look forward to a constructive discussion with it.</p></speech>

The committee is looking for submissions on electronic tagging and curfews.  If anybody who is listening has comments to make on these issues, he or she is welcome to send them in.  There are different views on how effective electronic tagging is and we would need to have a good look at it before rushing to implement it.  There has been some pilot scheme work done on it.</p> <p>  We had representatives of Muintir na T&iacute;re before us recently in what was a very interesting engagement.  What engagement has the IFA had with that organisation?  I would also like to find out about farmwatch which is active in some parts of the United Kingdom and seems to be quite an interesting and effective approach.</p></speech>

A few years ago the IFA carried out a survey in which one in three respondents said he or she had been the victim of crime in some way.  There was an issue with the recording of crime and a sense that some crimes were not taken seriously.  Other surveys produced similar findings for rural areas, but the official crime statistics gave a very different picture.  What is Mr. Downeys view?</p></speech>

I have attended a number of meetings around the country at which crime officers from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have spoken.  One of them described a farm as a supermarket for thieves because the opportunities for thieves at a farm were endless.  It is as if we invite thieves onto farms.  We need to take action to prevent this from happening.  It is very clear that some people think it is not necessary to report certain crimes and they do not see any value in reporting them.  We have to get the need to report every crime into people's minds because, while a crime on one farm may seem trivial, in combination, they are all serious and reporting them might lead to the detection of a more serious crime later.</p><p>While a crime committed on my farm might seem trivial, the combination and culmination of various crimes might lead to the detection of more serious crimes further on.  I think we need to get that into place.  We cannot expect the system to deal with all of these issues.  People dwelling in rural Ireland need to be part and parcel of the solution.  The IFA believes it has a role in that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.826" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jer Bergin" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015111800002#C00200"><p>Mr. Downey is right when he says that a great deal of low-level crime is not reported.  I refer to diesel theft and that kind of thing.  I will explain why reporting has to be part of the IFA's Theft Stop initiative, which is being rolled out by my colleague, Mr. Connolly.  There are two issues at stake here.  The first is crime prevention and the second is that the Garda is unable to return much of the stolen equipment it recovers to its rightful owners.  There is a need for reporting through official Garda channels, to be followed by uploading, identification and all the rest of it.  This should result in being able to trace owners and return equipment to farmers.  However, this is not something that always happens at present.  I think that is a key issue as well.</p></speech>

The IFA has taken up some very good initiatives in the county.  I refer to the marking of farm machinery, etc.  What level of co-operation exists between the IFA and the Ulster Farmers Union?  Is a joint approach being taken?  We have recently heard language suggesting that a joint task force of the PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is tackling criminality in Border areas.  The issues that need to be addressed include not only diesel laundering and cigarette smuggling but also cattle rustling and the theft of farm machinery.  This type of crime is having an impact on the farming community.  I want to get a sense of the level of all-Ireland co-operation to address crime.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.828" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eddie Downey" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015111800002#C00400"><p>My colleague, Mr. Connolly, might want to come in on this as well.  We have a very good relationship with the Ulster Farmers Union.  I recently spoke at a farm safety conference at which the union was represented.  We are developing links with the union because there is commonality across the Border.  When machinery is stolen from a farm, it is a unique thing.  The number of customers for a piece of machinery might be quite limited.  It is a question of finding out where these things are going, who is receiving them and who is moving them on from there.  I think that is the key part of this.  That is where the marking system that is part of the Theft Stop initiative comes in.  A unique mark on each piece of equipment will make it more traceable.  We are going to work with interested parties in the North.  I have already had discussions with the president of the Ulster Farmers Union on the potential for the roll-out and use in the North of a similar system to our Theft Stop system.  We are looking at how it could work on that basis.</p></speech>

Part of my function with the IFA is to liaise with the Garda in respect of these matters.  Having worked in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I understand the way this needs to work.  It says a lot that the Theft Stop initiative originated in County Donegal as a cross-Border initiative.  At the moment, the Garda is fully engaged with this system and the PSNI is very aware of it.  We can ensure the system works by transcending the Border, bringing it across and getting the North engaged in it.</p></speech>

I want to get a sense of the role played by community alerts and text alerts.  A delegation from Muintir na T&iacute;re, which is a fantastic and important initiative in rural areas, attended a recent meeting of the joint committee.  With regard to joint policing committees, I have concerns about the ability of community organisations and public representatives to engage with senior members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the concerns that exist in a given county.  When the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Policing Authority and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2015 is passed, which should happen soon, the new policing authority will have an important role in policing the joint policing committees.  I would like to get the thoughts of the witnesses on how we can improve those committees, particularly as they pertain to rural areas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.831" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eddie Downey" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015111800002#C00700"><p>While the theft of machinery and various other items from farms is worrying, the particular danger associated with cattle rustling and cattle theft is that it has the potential to damage the system of full traceability on which we pride ourselves in this country.  We have great confidence in this robust and good system, which is being well policed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Cattle rustling is creating a real worry for us, however.  The co-operation that is being received North and South to try to stamp this out is an example of how various systems can work well together.  I think we are making major progress in this whole area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.832" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jer Bergin" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015111800002#C00800"><p>I think there is a strong role for the IFA in this area.  We have almost 950 branches across the country.  Like the GAA, we are in every parish in every county.  Farmers have a unique role to play because they are present in rural areas at times of the day or night when other people are at work or college.  Their local knowledge and skills of observation are used as part of the text alert system, for example.  Reference has been made to Muintir na T&iacute;re.  We are working with the Garda as part of that to get it running better and to spread it out.  We intend that all our branch members will be able to be part of community text alert systems, which are used by people to make reports to the Garda when they see something wrong.  Such reports go to local garda&iacute; and nobody else.  Those garda&iacute; assess the vehicle or whatever it is and make decisions on that basis.  It is a case of using local knowledge to help garda&iacute; to do their jobs.  Our role does not involve replacing garda&iacute; or the resources that need to come to the Garda to police rural Ireland.</p></speech>

Some of the issues I want to raise have already been discussed.  A large theft of livestock in my constituency was devastating for the family involved.  I would like to hear more from the witnesses about what we can do in that regard.  What do they think Members of the Oireachtas should be doing to protect farmers from these crimes?  I am interested in the Theft Stop initiative, which farmers often raise with me.  I am aware that the IFA is encouraging the national roll-out of the initiative, which was rolled out on a pilot basis in counties Tipperary and Donegal.  What was the uptake of the scheme in those counties?  How much success did it achieve?</p></speech>

We need to look at where these animals are going, how they are being processed, how they are being brought through the system and who is the ultimate customer for them.  It is hugely worrying for us.  We have put up &euro;10,000 as a reward to try to find out exactly what is going on here.  Major progress is being made in that regard.  The Garda is closing in on this situation.  We would like to allow it to do its job on that basis.  I think that is what we should do.  What was the other issue raised by the Deputy?</p></speech>

No item that has been marked as part of the Theft Stop initiative has been stolen since the start of the initiative.  We can stand 100% over that figure.  I think it is a very good figure.  It suggests the strength of the system.  At the moment, we have a county-by-county roll-out plan.  While Theft Stop is available nationwide and any member of the public can log on and use it, we have decided to launch it on a county-by-county basis through our IFA executive meetings.  We carried out our first launch in County Laois the night before last.  Although it is probably too early to quantify the figures for registration and sign-up, it is obvious from the expressions of interest and the national and local media coverage that Theft Stop will be put on a national footing.  The cross-Border links with the PSNI will be invaluable as we try to close down the systems that are used to move machinery and cattle across the Border.  The IFA is associated with tagging.  Essentially, we are now tagging property with a serial number that makes it uniquely identifiable.  When I was a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I encountered the problems that can arise with the repatriation of property.  This is the first time this country will have a database of property that can be used in this way.  This initiative is being initially rolled out to target the theft of farm machinery and other crimes that take place on farms but I do not see why it cannot go out into the wider community.  The Garda deals on a daily basis with the theft of bicycles and other items that are not returned.  A cost is associated with storing this property if it is not located.</p><p>Therefore I think it is definitely a system that can and will be expanded upon.</p></speech>

It is a good idea.  Mr. Connolly spoke about the seniors alert scheme and the wish for support to extend it for installing alarms, but how will that work?  In my constituency, my late father, Lord have mercy on him, used Helplink South which was an alarm he wore on his wrist.  It was very effective for an elderly person.  Is Mr. Connolly suggesting that, similar to that, we would put alarms in houses to counter burglary?  How does he expect that would be rolled out?</p></speech>

I saw one recently with a panic button that was completely tamper-proof.  We need items like that which can give more security to people in the countryside.  The personal pendant has worked very well and is an excellent system, but we need to extend it further to give more security to people.</p></speech>

We are examining the issue of funding.  I acknowledge that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has put seed funding of &euro;50,000 into a text alert group and a community group in our area for cameras.  Those initiatives help us to work with people who want to help themselves.  That is where we are coming from.</p></speech>

Deputy Mac Lochlainn mentioned the soon to be created independent police authority.  As a large organisation, the IFA should seek membership of that authority.  There is currently a call under the Public Appointments Service.  It is open to individuals to seek inclusion in the authority's membership.  I think the IFA would have a constructive and valuable role to play in this regard.</p> <p>  Will the IFA representatives quantify the scale of cattle rustling, including the headage stolen?  Are the cattle brought to unlicensed, unregulated abattoirs or are they sold on?  What is the dispersal method?  I am trying to get a sense of the scale of the problem.  We had some reports of it happening in my constituency in Limerick.  Thankfully, however, the most recent report turned out to be a false alarm.  It was reported in the newspaper that there was a large theft of cattle, but apparently they found their way home the following week.</p></speech>

That was not reported in the press, by the way.  I want to get a sense of it, including the insurance implications.</p></speech>

There are good neighbours as well.</p> <p>  Forty-eight cases of cattle rustling were reported.  In one case, 100 cattle were stolen in Westmeath.  It is not that the numbers are huge but it is the potential damage this can do to the industry, including the traceability system.  Livestock theft can wipe out individual farm incomes.</p> <p>  The other question was where these animals go.  They do not all go to the one place, so there have to be multiple destinations.  Some of them are finished cattle that can go to certain places, but others are not.  We have to figure out where these are going and what criminals are involved.  Some of those criminals must have knowledge of how to deal with animals because not just anybody can walk into a field, load them and move them on.  There are groups of people involved in this and we need to break that down.</p> <p>  There was no insurance for cattle theft until 18 months or two years ago.  FBD Insurance has stepped into that space now, so insurance is available for farmers.  That is not the way we want to go, however.  We want to get to the stage where cattle theft is not profitable.</p></speech>

The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI are working together to try to track it down.  In recent weeks, we have seen one conviction in that region of which I am aware.  As I understand it, that was an ongoing investigation for a long time.  As the IFA president said, it is a specialist job and needs targeting by both police forces.  I think it can be rooted out.</p></speech>

At least one such case has been found due to the activities of the Garda and the PSNI following up on thefts.  It is positive that we found those but we need to root it out completely at this stage.  Let us not rush in with one piece of evidence.  Let us wait until we have the full picture and then stamp it out completely.</p></speech>

They are going to other jurisdictions, which is a problem.  Does the same problem apply to stolen farm equipment being moved to another jurisdiction in the main or off the island altogether?  I am glad to hear such equipment is being tagged with serial numbers.</p></speech>

Cattle and machinery are moving across the Border.  Unfortunately, however, there is also a market within the country for it.  Members tell me at meetings that if one attends markets at the weekend, one can see in the early hours of the morning that various things, including tools, are available for purchase.  Part of the solution to that is engaging with people, including through the development of a text alert service.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a confidential phone number for information, but a forum where people can communicate their knowledge is also useful.  One must have an in-depth knowledge to be able to carry out cattle rustling and achieve one's aim.  A communications facility, perhaps through the IFA, to the Garda or Crimestoppers and back into the PSNI would be helpful.  We need to encourage people to communicate in that way with us.</p></speech>

The initiatives certainly seem to be working.  I am particularly struck by the fact that not one of the tagged cattle has gone missing.  As regards international best practice, has the IFA looked at other jurisdictions and, if so, are there similar problems there?  I imagine there are, so how have they dealt with them?  Is there anything we could all learn from what is happening internationally?</p></speech>

One of the things we are doing, and which Mr. Connolly will do in his role, is assessing various vehicle-tracking technologies and different types of equipment, seeing what works and what does not.  We are not salespeople for security system companies.  Our responsibility is to our members and to rural communities and putting together policies and packages that will work for them.  The advantage we have over everywhere else is our broad membership base.  We have 90,000 members and 950 branches, which gives us a reach.  Ireland is a small country and if we can use that bit of knowledge, we will do so, through text alerts, reporting to the Garda, uploading information and documenting it, so that garda&iacute; can access it.  We will also work to change policy in terms of encouraging the Legislature to put resources into the Garda.  Some of the recent initiatives are very good in terms of extra resources but we also need, for example, to target the markets that were referred to with a van - there has been some targeting by garda&iacute; early in the morning - and we need to close off the market at the other end as well.</p></speech>

In his new role, Mr. Connolly is going to go across the country, talking to farmers and county executives to get information as to how we can best be defensive in managing ourselves and what measures we can take to make our farms and equipment safer and more secure.  We see working with other groups as key to this process.  We work with Muintir na T&iacute;re and with different groups along the way.  We see the GAA as a major organisation in rural Ireland.  This area of security has to be addressed from that point of view.  As I said already, and maybe I did not get that across the way I wanted to, we do not see this totally as the Garda's problem.  The Garda is part of the solution, as are we, the people who live in the communities, and we have to work together to make best use of the resources, be it the farmers themselves, who are, as Mr. Bergin said, our eyes and ears on the countryside, the GAA, or whoever is out there, all those organisations.  We have to work together and become more security-conscious in what we do.</p></speech>

I really like and affirm the holistic approach the IFA is presenting to us in terms of the issue of rural crime, identifying some of the legislative concerns, the issue of broadband, the ways in which various kinds of partnership are being formed, CCTV installation and so on.  It is great to hear that kind of leadership.  So much of it is about prevention.  Could the witnesses tell us specifically a little more about the rural crime prevention executive, and more generally is it getting enough Government support for that prevention approach?  We have spoken a little about the resource issue.  Is it about more resources?  Surely it is also about new ways of working with the resources the organisation has.  Is it about a bit of both?</p></speech>

Obviously we also have to identify what is working out there and, as Mr. Bergin said, what is working in other jurisdictions and what we can bring back here.  If we find something that works really well, we can see if we can get funding for that.  The evidence about CCTV footage is anecdotal.  The new road structure in this country is wonderful.  I came through the port tunnel this morning and I got here before everybody else, which makes a change.  However, that is also facilitating the reverse of that: criminals moving out into the countryside.  They are using those arteries to get into these areas.  If we had proper CCTV coverage on those roads, we might be able to identify more of these criminals and where they are working.  It is a mix of small things that will give solutions.  We have to build intelligence within the Garda to help us resolve that.  Co-operation with the Garda is essential at all times and the co-operation we have had so far has been excellent.</p></speech>

We have worked through this for two years and came up with a list of recommendations, including a rural crime prevention officer.  It is not about doing something outside the existing structures, it is about trying to add to the existing structures.  That is the unique element of it and that could be rolled out in other areas of industry and so on.</p></speech>

In anything we do, or anything I am involved in developing, I will always look at the cost element of it.  Security should not necessarily come with a cost to a rural dweller, because if we put a cost on it with high-tech security implementation systems, it keeps people outside of it, whereas initiatives like Theft Stop or text alerts are relatively inexpensive to implement.  We are not asking the Government to invest millions in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; we are asking it to invest time and effort and to put garda&iacute; back in rural communities.  If we are putting them back into the area, we are investing in our communities, which is ultimately going to invest in the overall system.  It is a simple basic structure and it is a holistic approach.</p></speech>

Is that similar to Farm Watch in the UK, where people sign up, a little like community alert?

With Theft Stop, we have a farm gate sign, which is clearly displayed on a person's property to show they are part of the system.  Then there are serial numbers.  One will begin to see obvious serial numbers on trailers and people will start to know what they are very soon.</p></speech>

There is a company in the UK called SmartWater, which operates quite an effective system, whereby it is a unique number.  However, it does come with a cost element to it and there is an end case element.  Ultimately, if something needs to be prosecuted in court, I would always be keeping an eye on the end product.  If we do catch somebody with something, we need to be able to prosecute them.  The system we have in Ireland is quite robust in that regard in its make-up.</p></speech>

That message came from Muintir na T&iacute;re as well, because we have heard people saying from time to time that there in no point in reporting these incidents.  The IFA's message is obviously, in contrast to that, to report everything, no matter how minor, to garda&iacute; so they can build up a picture.  Mr. Downey mentioned in his opening statement that people were living in real fear for their personal safety, and we have seen reports of people going to bed with shotguns and firearms.  We know farmers use firearms for other reasons as well on farms.  Could he comment on the fear of crime?  Muintir na T&iacute;re told us the fear of crime can be more devastating than the crime itself.</p></speech>

What we are seeing in rural areas is the impact of an almost siege mentality.  When an alarm is installed, one will put it on when one is going out or at night, such that one feels one locked in.  This is creating a fear factor.  Electric gates and CCTV cameras are being installed all over the place.  What we want to try to do is to bridge it to some extent by working in conjunction with other organisations to have community involvement to release some of the fear.  It is not just older people, everybody is experiencing genuine fear.  There is nothing as devastating as walking into one's house and seeing it ransacked.</p></speech>

It is a combination of things that will give people a sense of security and a sense that they do not have to live as if they are under siege.  Legislators must be seen to deal with the legal issues and take repeat offenders out of the system.  The simple community systems we are trying to initiate are the way forward.  We should avoid turning Ireland into a prison camp.</p></speech>

That is the reason we are trying to get into this space as quickly as we can.  We have not come before the committee because of a reaction to recent media reports; we have been working on this issue for a long time and will continue to work on it as we normally do.  We would be very worried if people were to take the wrong action at particular times.  What is really frustrating for us is that repeat offenders out on bail are committing crimes.  When they are convicted, they receive the same treatment on their 100th crime as on their first.  That is where the problem lies.  There has to be a ratcheting up in order that repeat offenders are dealt with more severely.  Everybody on the ground and the Garda have to make that call.</p></speech>

The other reason is that as I am chairman designate, obviously I do not have too much to say as yet.</p> <p>  I am a retired solicitor now acting in a consultancy capacity with the firm Ensor O' Connor, a firm which was founded by me, but as I have reached the age at which one qualifies for the bus pass, I have stood down to let younger solicitors at it.</p> <p>  I was involved in the Law Society of Ireland for many years when I chaired a number of committees, including the regulatory and education committees.  I was fortunate enough to be president in 2000, in which capacity I chaired the council of the Law Society of Ireland for a full 12 months  I set then on the disciplinary tribunal which would be partly on all fours with the Property Services Appeal Board in the sense that one deals with the same matters.  The statutory limit in serving on the disciplinary tribunal is ten years.</p> <p>  I am honoured to have been asked to become chairperson of the Property Services Appeal Board and I have set out its role.  It is relatively limited in relation to the powers of the regulatory authority which deals with issues on a day to day basis and, of course, has its own board.  Effectively, what happens is that if a party which has to comply with the regulations of the authority feels disgruntled in any manner and wishes to appeal, he or she can appeal on certain grounds to the appeal board.  I have had the opportunity to talk to some of the board members to see exactly what they do in their day to day business.  It is a very strong board.</p><p>Ms Sunniva McDonagh and Mr. James Bridgeman are both barristers, Mr. David McGarry is a chartered accountant, Ms Dorothea Dowling was chairperson of the Personal Injuries Board and Mr. Philip Moynihan was a superintendent in Enniscorthy when I was practising there, so we came across each other.</p><p> The board deals with major issues coming to it from the authority.  On hearing an appeal, it can confirm the authority's decision and state it is happy the authority dealt with the matter properly or remit the matter to the authority for certain directions.  A number of matters have been remitted for reconsideration, the reason being - and this is anecdotal because, of course, I have not sat on the board because I have not yet been fully appointed - the board felt the authority should look at them in more detail.  I have spoken to board members and examined the board's annual report.  Some matters failed, probably because they were outside the jurisdiction of the appeals board.  The appeals board can make determinations and substitute penalties, in other words overrule the authority, by increasing or reducing fines.  The board is somewhat limited in its jurisdiction as set out in the statute.  An appeals board must always have regard to applying natural justice and fair procedures.  This will be my priority.  The authority must do its job and we may be seen to have a more compassionate view, if appropriate.  This is how I see it.</p></speech>

He spoke about natural justice.  We particularly think of the establishment of the position of Ombudsman as a very positive development in Irish democracy in recent decades.  It is important that people have a right to appeal and it is good that the board will be entirely independent.</p></speech>

However, the board has notified me - and because I am not yet chairman I must say this somewhat guardedly - that it feels easy-to-follow guidelines should be set out to make it easier for a person who may want to appeal a decision.  This would be fairer.  I intend to follow up on this once, and if, I become chairman.  This would make it easier.  We must remember the Act setting up the authority and the board is relatively new, dating from 2011, and the clear intention was to relieve the Ombudsman of this particular function.  We see ourselves as doing the same job in a slightly different manner.</p></speech>

I have referred the committee to the board, which is very strong from a personnel point of view.  The people on it have huge experience and this can be seen without singling out anybody.  These people have been working on it for several years.  When they started to operate a number of appeals came through in a bit of a rush but this has now levelled off.  The authority seems to be doing its job very well.  We do not want to be <i>functus officio</i>but, at the same time, it is nice to know that not too many appeals are coming forward.  This suggests people feel they are being dealt with properly by the authority.  I see us as giving the benefit of compassion and fair procedures to people coming through because if they appeal a decision, they may feel that all matters were not considered by the authority.</p></speech>

A number of people in the real estate business informed me recently that the property register is not up to much with regard to entering the price of houses.  It does not detail the number of bedrooms or the style of house.  It might cover the square footage but it does not provide the type of information necessary to protect its integrity.  It should be like booking an airline ticket whereby if one does not have all of the boxes ticked and completed properly, one should not be able to register the price of a property.  Auctioneers and real estate agents and, in particular, valuers find it very frustrating.  This may have nothing whatsoever to do with Mr. Ensor's organisation or it may have a role in an advisory capacity.</p></speech>

I will briefly introduce my colleagues.  I am joined by our senior policy officer, Ms Naomi Feely, and one of our members, Ms Angela Gallagher, whose story was part of our submission to the committee.  Mandatory retirement ages are deeply ageist and that they have been permitted for so long is a reflection of the ageism still publicly acceptable in Ireland.  Whereas some people cannot wait to retire and are very eager to do so, there are others who want to keep working.  There is a large and growing group of workers who realise that with retirement comes a major drop in income and for these people, the longer they can work, the more they can save.  If Deputy Anne Ferris's Bill becomes law, older people who are willing and able to keep working would be able to do so.  It would eliminate the growing problem of older people being forced to retire at 65, or even earlier, with years to go until they can claim the State pension.   Like everyone else, we welcome the continuing fall in the unemployment figures but although there are schemes and programmes to help young people find work, what is there for a forklift driver forced to retire at 55 or the civil servant pushed aside on her 65th birthday?</p> <p>  Older people frequently tell us they feel they are invisible and undervalued.  They see the media refer to them as bed blockers or as a burden on society.  Against this backdrop, one would need to be very determined to go job-hunting as an older worker.  With people retiring today expected to live, on average, for another 20 years or more, we need to have an honest debate about the role of older workers in Irish society, the kind of honest debate that led, four years ago, to the abolition of the default retirement age in Britain.  The abolition of mandatory retirement in Britain was no less challenging, difficult or controversial than it would be  in Ireland but the political will was there, the recognition of the rights of older people was there and the understanding that older workers have something to contribute to their communities and to the economy was there.  It can be done and as the demographics in Ireland change in the coming years, it will be done.  There should be no doubt about this.  Mandatory retirement ages will be abolished in Ireland, so why not now?</p> <p>  I will ask my colleague, Ms Angela Gallagher, to add a few words on her own experience of mandatory retirement.</p></speech>

I appreciate that the issue and its implications for employment law, for pensions policy and for many other areas is very complex.  At the same time, it is also very simple.  People should not be forced out of their jobs because they are a certain age.  If we accept that basic principle, we can overcome the complicated policy issues thrown up by abolishing mandatory retirement.</p> <p>  People like me, who are able to work, willing to do so and capable of doing our jobs effectively should not be forced to retire because of our age.  To me, this is simply ageism; it is discrimination against me and thousands of people in Ireland like me who are deemed expendable.</p><p>In my own case, the frustration of losing my job for no other reason than because I had turned 65 years of age was exacerbated by the financial hardship this policy of mandatory retirement inflicted on me.  I was trying to pay a mortgage to the bank and a loan to the credit union at the same time.  It was very difficult to keep going.  I had to cut right back.  I had to get rid of my telephone, television and anything I could to save money.  I even had to cut back on my medication several times because the cost exceeded the maximum per month under the drugs scheme and I simply could not afford it.  There were weeks and months when I did not know how I was going to pay the bank and when I worried whether I would even be able to keep my home.</p><p> The thing that annoys me most and the reason I am before the committee today is that none of this was necessary.  I wanted to work and I was able to work.  I liked what I was doing and I was good at my job.  If I had not been forced out of my job I would have been able to work until I was secure.  I would have been able to keep contributing to the economy as well.  I urge committee members to recognise what older workers have to offer, in particular, the skills, experience and wisdom we have built up in our careers.  I strongly support the legislation proposed by Deputy Ferris.  I thank the committee members for their attention.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by the vice chairman, Mr. Loughlin Deegan and another member, Ms Deirdre Malone.  The employment inequality committee of the Law Society of Ireland is made up of a number of specialist lawyers in the area of employment and pensions.  In making our submission I am keen to point out and make clear that we are not here to represent the interests of the profession or the interests of employment lawyers generally.  Our submission serves to offer our expertise in so far as any legislation introduced is compliant with developments in EU law and does not contradict any existing provisions of domestic law.</p> <p>  From a legal perspective the context is that the current provision in the Employment Equality Act 1998 permits employers to set a compulsory retirement age.  Certainly, it does not prevent them from setting a compulsory retirement age.  It does not set out any requirement that such compulsory retirement age must be objective.  While that may have been in compliance with the law in 1998, there have been developments at European Court of Justice level in the interim which indicate that setting a retirement age is potentially a type of age discrimination.  However, those cases suggest that in certain circumstances where there are objective justifications, it may be possible to set a retirement age.</p> <p>  We have made submissions relating to Deputy Ferris's Bill and the Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, both of which would ensure Irish law was compliant with developments in law at the Court of Justice of the European Union.  The two Bills are incompatible, however, and could not be introduced together because they are conflicting.  Our role and our submission serves to ensure that any legislation brought in is legally clear and from an operating perspective does not create any conflict with either EU law or any other provision of Irish employment equality law.  My colleague, Ms Deirdre Malone, will comment specifically on the Bill.</p></speech>

We have some comments in respect of the drafting.  There is provision within the Bill for a fixed-term contract to be offered to someone over retirement age.  We are seeking clarity around the drafting, especially in regard to section 6(3)(c) of the 1998 Act and the proposed amendment to section 4 of the 2013 Bill.</p> <p>  Deputy Ferris has drafted the other Bill.  As we have said, we are neutral on which Bill would be enacted since both are compliant with the provisions in the EU directive.  However, I wish to draw the committee's attention to some particular things.  We wish to raise a concern relating to the potential costs.  In particular, the 2014 Bill permits age discrimination and disability discrimination where an employer can demonstrate that treating the person equally would entail significantly increased costs.  Cost alone is not generally an accepted appropriate justification for discrimination.</p> <p>  There is a question over the potential impact on unfair dismissals.  We maintain that the Unfair Dismissals Act permits fair dismissal on the grounds of capability.  We believe that the drafting in its current form may remove an employer's obligation to participate in performance improvement programmes and other managed processes whereby someone could be fairly dismissed.  As currently drafted, the Bill would permit an employer or company to get a report from a doctor to the effect that a person is not fit to do the job.  The ground of capability could be a fair ground to dismiss a person.  Another aspect we highlighted relates to looking to establish whether a person was capable of doing the job.  We take the view that there may be an increased cost to employers where they have to assess employees on a regular basis, for example, on a yearly basis, once they have reached a particular point.</p> <p>  We had concerns on the drafting and around the language used.  For example, reference is made to significantly increased costs.  How could that be shown?  What other evidence would be required?  There should be more clarity around the wording.</p> <p>  There is a potential conflict with section 16 of the 1998 Act dealing with disability and when someone cannot do a job.  This is a new departure in terms of introducing disability on the grounds of age.  The idea is to ensure that both are compatible.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.923" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms M&aacute;ir&eacute;ad Hayes" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015111800002#GG00800"><p>My colleagues include Ms Imelda Brown, who is on our executive committee, and Mr. John Walsh, who is the president.  I am the chief executive officer.  The Irish Senior Citizens Parliament welcomes the opportunity to address the committee on this issue, a critical issue for older people.  We thank Deputy Ferris for tabling the Bill.  We urge the committee to take action in the term of this, D&aacute;il, the 31st D&aacute;il.  I thank Senator White, Deputy McFadden and Deputy Se&aacute;n Kenny for attending the hearing.</p> <p>  As the Age Action Ireland representatives have said, the Irish demographic patterns continue to be favourable despite predictions of changes in future.  We reckon that the 2016 census will produce an opportunity to validate these predictions.</p> <p>  The Bill is brief but cleverly worded and simple in its construct.  In September, Senator John Crown introduced the Longer Healthy Living Bill 2015 in the Seanad.  The main focus of the Bill was to allow health professionals to continue to work after normal contract.  Both Bills focus on capability and people being capable.  One of our submissions has said that perhaps all the Bills could be brought together and we could see them in that context.</p> <p>  We welcome the desired intention of the Bill to abolish mandatory retirement ages for people who are able and willing to continue in the role for which they have been employed, as outlined by Deputy Ferris in introducing the Bill.</p><p>The element of choice is critical in respect of how long people wish to continue to work.  The choice for the individual is made on the basis of whether he or she will have sufficient income in retirement.  Some countries allow access to state pensions at an earlier age and also allow people who so desire to continue to contribute for a longer period.  Uncle Sam in the US sometimes is not so good, but workers can get their pensions at 62 there and can continue to work.  That is important. <br/><br/>At least 50% of people are dependent on a State payment in retirement.  Many of them are working on contracts which require them to retire at 65.  I bow to the Law Society in some of these matters.  Since 2014 the effective age for receipt of the State pension has moved to 66 years.  There are people who are retiring at 65 but will not get a State pension until they are 66.  Effective from 2021, which is not that far away, it will be age 67 and from 2028 it will be age 68.  A mechanism must be found which will ensure that if these workers wish to continue to work they are enabled to do so.  Ideally we would seek that on the enactment of the Bill, a new contract<b><i></i></b>would be given to each employee which would substitute the word &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; for &rdquo; 65 years&rdquo;.  To be effective, the Bill must ensure that it is applicable and monitored in both the public and private sectors.  We recognise that there may be some cost involved but it is important this should happen in the beginning.<br/><br/>Many in the private sector do not have occupational pension schemes and are solely dependent on the State pension.  Late joiners to pension schemes and those with interrupted service due to caring or other duties, in both the public and private sectors, will have access only to small occupational pensions and many in this category are women.  We are aware of people who are being forced by their employer to retire at age 65.  They are then offered re-employment at a lower rate and on a new contract.  These women - we have mainly had contact with women - are clearly capable of doing the job but their employers are getting the benefit of their experience at a lower rate.  Their capability is beyond doubt as they are being offered re-employment.<br/><br/>Section 1 as drafted proposes the amendment of section 34 of the Employment Equality Act 1998 by the substitution of subsection (3) and the insertion of new subsection (3).  We have a concern that the proposed amendment to the Act in subsection (3)(a) may not be robust enough to secure and achieve the intent of the Bill in its wording of &quot;an employee who is doing a job for which he or she is employed&quot;.  Our concern is that this qualification may not reflect the evolving nature of some jobs and we would welcome a comment from the drafters in respect of this matter.  The wording presupposes regular engagement with employees in respect of the job for which they are employed.  Our evidence is that this does not happen all the time in a lot of cases.  We would also have a concern that manual workers in particular may be forced to retire early in such circumstances.  Ideally we would wish to allow for a position where provision could be made for those with an acquired disability to be accommodated within the same employment but perhaps on a job for which they were not originally<i></i>employed.  That is one of the areas on which we would like some comment.<br/><br/>Where an occupational pension is part of a package for an employee, there can be conflicting dates with regard to the contract of employment and the so-called contract or promise to pay them a pension.  We have been told on many occasions of difficulties encountered when the deed establishing a trust from which pensions are paid may have a pension payment date which differs from the retirement date.  In some cases it is a requirement that access to a pension can only occur when the person leaves that employment.  If they continue to work they will continue to pay superannuation costs but will accrue no additional benefit.  It is vital that the possible conflicts between trust law and this Bill are fully investigated. <br/><br/>There are three important dates as people approach retirement: the date of the contract between themselves and their employer; the date at which the State pension will be paid; and, if they are in an occupational pension scheme, the matter of whether there is any impact resulting from changes to State pension payments on the amount they will receive from the occupational pension provider.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the Government has published a national positive ageing strategy and we know that, with some amendments, the enactment of this Bill will be seen as a move towards the achievement of positive ageing for all citizens.</p></speech>

I fully support the Employment Equality (Abolition of Mandatory Retirement Age) Bill 2014, sponsored by Deputy Anne Ferris.  I am delighted that my recent submission was selected for inclusion at today&rsquo;s committee hearing stage.  I am employed as a community employment supervisor.  I am 63 years of age and have worked in this position for the past 22 years.  Under current law I must retire in three years at the age of 66.  I will still have two sons in third level education and I know my wife and I will find it very difficult to make ends meet.  Can I afford to have my sons finish college?</p> <p>  Large numbers of people like myself are working today in the community and voluntary sector with no retirement or pension entitlements to alleviate these fears when we reach the State retirement age.  In light of this fact, the Labour Court recommendation LCR 19293 July 2008 stated that &ldquo;an agreed pension scheme should be introduced for community employment scheme supervisors/assistant supervisors and the scheme should be adequately funded by F&Aacute;S as the recognised funding agency&rdquo;.  This recommendation was not honoured by F&Aacute;S or by the Department of Social Protection, which is the current funding body.  As such, many of us face into a poorer and more stressful time in our latter years.  Deputy Ferris&rsquo;s Bill offers us, in these circumstances, an opportunity to remain in continued employment provided that the Department of Social Protection will continue the funding of our positions beyond the age of 66, which it currently fails to do.</p> <p>  An article from Age Action Ireland under the heading "employment and income" states: &ldquo;the Government view access to quality employment opportunities as the best route out of poverty and social exclusion".  Community employment employers - community groups mandated by the State to be incorporated company status - under the auspices of the Department of Social Protection fund and control the day-to-day operating procedures of each and every project throughout the State to such a degree that one wonders who the employer is.  One very important procedural demand made by the Department of Social Protection in respect of today&rsquo;s Bill is that the Department instructs all community and voluntary employers that no funding be given to any employee on reaching the State retirement age of 66.  Employers in this scenario have no choice but to make those workers redundant, as these voluntary groups do not have the financial resources to fund the wages of any staff.</p> <p>  People today are healthier and fitter and thankfully are living longer.  They are therefore much more able to continue working if allowed to do so.  As an individual approaching retirement age, I feel that I should have the right to determine how long I wish to remain in the workplace.  Retirement should not be dictated by the State.  The Global Health and Aging report, in the "Living Longer" section, states: &ldquo;the dramatic increase in average life expectancy during the 20th century ranks as one of society&rsquo;s greatest achievements".  It will be the greatest achievement of this D&aacute;il to pass into law Deputy Anne Ferris's Employment Equality (Abolition of Mandatory retirement Age) Bill 2014.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.927" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. William Quinn" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015111800002#HH00400"><p>I am very grateful for the opportunity to speak on this matter.  My Name is William Quinn.  I am almost 59 years old.  I have 32.5 years of service with Dublin City Council.  I am one of three area supervisors in the waste management services division, which provides cleansing services, with approximately 40 staff, for the north central regional administrative area of Dublin city.  In addition, I deal with divisional attendance management issues and imminent staff pensions.</p><p>It is very important to change the existing legislation on the mandatory retirement age for public servants and other workers for a number of reasons.  When the original legislation was enacted, life expectancy was only a couple of years more than the mandatory retirement age.  That demographic has dramatically changed, and people now live much longer because of better diet, education, housing and medical knowledge.  Many of the experts in this field contend that staying as active as possible is very important for our more mature citizens, and one of the ways of doing that is by continuing to work.  It is inherently unfair to offer the option of staying on after the age 65 or 66 only to those who came into public service after a certain date, namely April 2004, providing they are fit enough to carry out the full range of their duties.  This is an option that should be equally offered to all public sector staff.  Many staff will not want to exercise that option, but it should be available nevertheless.  Otherwise, it appears that they are being penalised because of their age and excluded from a benefit afforded to others.  Due to the major difficulties in the public sector over the last number of years, there has been an embargo on recruitment.  We have lost a lot of very good, talented and experienced staff who have not been replaced.  My own division has lost almost 50% of its staff and, if anything, the city has grown upwards, not outwards, and does business for far longer every day.  This means we are now under pressure to provide more services with far fewer resources.  The recruitment embargo is now slowly starting to lift in some public sector areas, but it will still be some time before the benefits unfold.  Indeed, some sectors may never recover.  It is very important, therefore, to ensure that we have enough mature and experienced people to pass on their vital knowledge to a new generation.</p><p> If the legislation is changed there will not be hordes of people in their 60s holding onto jobs at the expense of school and college leavers.  Many people are very happy to shake off the yoke of work when their mortgage is paid and their children have moved on.  However, it will help to prevent many public sector retirees born from 1956 onwards from having to sign on for jobseeker's benefit and allowances until they qualify for their State contributory old age pension.  At that age, and because of the type of work they do, they would be unlikely to get a new job.  It will help these people to stay healthier for longer because of their active contribution through work and thus they will be at less risk of becoming a burden on the State through long-term ill health.  Furthermore, it will help the beleaguered public sector pension schemes, which were not designed to cope with today&rsquo;s demographics.  If the legislation is not changed then all public servants hired before 2004, if unsuccessful in finding alternative employment when forced to retire, will have to claim State benefits or allowances for between one and three years, depending on their grade, until they qualify for the State contributory old age pension.  That is a horrendous prospect for many of us.  I fully endorse the changes advocated by Deputy Anne Ferris.</p></speech>

I work in retail, have extensive experience and certified skills and am well able to carry out all duties assigned to me.  I feel I am being forced to retire against my will.  I have made a request to my company to continue working until pension age, which for me is 66, but the company is refusing to discuss this issue with me or my union representative, making it clear that the retirement age is 65 years.  There is no retirement age on my contract of employment.  I am sure I will be replaced by someone on a lower wage and with a zero-hour contract.  This represents a cost reduction towards the minimum wage, part of a race to the bottom.</p> <p>  I find it difficult to understand why the Government, when changing the pension age to 66 years, did not introduce legislation allowing people to stay at work until pension age or longer if they so wish.  Why would anybody want to leave a job that he or she is experienced and skilled in after 17 years and have to look for another job?  I find it ludicrous that I will be forced onto jobseeker's allowance against my will when I could, through the transfer of payments, continue to contribute to society.  This will also result in a substantial drop in my income.</p> <p>  Older staff have a major contribution to make, and age is irrelevant.  Many employers recognise the contribution that older, experienced sections of the workforce have to offer.  In the retail sector, Tesco and SuperValu are just two examples of such employers.  The State pension is inadequate, as the recent economic crisis has left many people with substantial debts and in need of money.  Other countries have greater flexibility around keeping older staff in employment.  Retirement should be an option and should not be compulsory.  Forced retirement because of age is discrimination.  I fully support the proposal from Deputy Ferris.</p></speech>

I have worked in the service for 35 years and am 55 years of age.  My contract of employment states that I may retire after 30 years of service but that I must retire at the age of 60.  It is unfair that at 60 I will no longer able to work as a servant of the State, despite the investment of large amounts of money by the Prison Service in developing my various skill sets, while elsewhere in the EU members of the prison services can continue to work until they are 67.</p> <p>  In 2005, under the proposal for organisational change in the Irish Prison Service, an annualised hours system for attendance was introduced.  The aim was to eliminate the large amounts of overtime being worked by staff and to improve our work-life balance.  Staff are liable to attend for a certain number of hours over and above their normal 39 hours of work per week.  In my case this was set at 112 hours a year, which works out at an average of two extra hours per week.  In my current role I am responsible for the human resources function for 700 staff in the west Dublin campus.  As a result of my current conditions of service I must retire at 60, while a person in the Irish Prison Service headquarters carrying out a similar function may work until he or she is 65 years old.  The reality is that if I wish to work beyond the age of 60 I will have to look for a job outside the service now, as the chances of getting something at age 60 will be greatly diminished.  There is a provision whereby sanction can be sought from Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to extend service on grounds of public interest, which is covered in Circular 13/752.</p> <p>  The grounds for forcing staff, particularly at the grade of governor, to retire at 60 no longer exist due to the changes in working conditions that I referred to earlier.  Staff in the headquarters of the Irish Prison Service working in a similar role can continue working until they are 67 years old.  There has been no recruitment in the Prison Service for the last ten years but approximately 850 staff are eligible to retire in the next three years, which is roughly one third of the total.  This will result in the loss of a substantial knowledge base.  In contrast to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, there is a provision in the Prison Service whereby sanction can be sought from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, but this is at the discretion of the director of the Irish Prison Service. </p> <p>  To sum up, when a person has reach the required service age for pension entitlement the choice should be with that person as to when he or she retires, and not with the State.</p></speech>

I also thank Deputy Ferris for introducing this Bill.<br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">  People in Ireland today are living longer.  Life expectancy has been revised upwards and people who have reached retirement age should have the option of remaining in employment.</font>Life expectancy at the average effective retirement age can be as high as 18 to 20 years, about a third longer than it was 30 years ago.  It is projected to increase further, so the retirement period will lengthen unless retirement itself is delayed.  As we can look forward to living longer, we need to rethink what retirement looks like.  As the population dynamics change, there are many potential advantages for all of us, including a stronger economy, higher living standards, less pensioner poverty, reduced spending on benefits, and improved national well-being and inter-generational cohesion.<br/><br/>The obvious solution is to embrace later-life working, helping to realise the potential of older workers who have so much experience and talent to offer.</p><p>This is not about being forced to work on but enabling and encouraging those who want a fuller working life.  Older workers can play a vital role in future growth both for individual businesses and the wider economy overall.  Employers need to adopt age-friendly policies such as flexible working, phased retirement, family care leave and even gap breaks.  This can facilitate a new type of retirement in which people cut down rather than suddenly stop working, where health and well-being policies take account of older workers&rsquo; needs and where employers enable staff to combine work with caring responsibilities.  Managers with the right skills are crucial to supporting older workers successfully.</p><p> Working in retirement offers many benefits.  For example, not only can working delay the onset of age related diseases such as dementia, but keeping mentally and physical active helps one feel younger for longer.  It is generally accepted by most people on reaching retirement age that they would prefer to continue working beyond retirement.  Working also keeps one socially active, preventing isolation and providing a sense of purpose.  Senior citizens who stay in the workforce are much more likely to retain their cognitive ability.  Many senior citizens become isolated after retirement which can have widespread psychological consequences for anyone.  Senior citizens who stay in the workforce are much more likely to stay up to date with technology, since technological changes have an effect on each and every workforce.</p><p> By simply working a few extra years, one can put oneself into a much better financial situation.  Whatever a person&rsquo;s circumstances, working into the second half of one&rsquo;s 60s or beyond offers the prospect of a happier and more financially secure retirement when one finally does retire.  The financial benefit from working is obvious.  One keeps earning income.  This regular income allows one to continue to pay for one&rsquo;s life expenses without needing to turn to one&rsquo;s retirement benefits for necessities.  Workers generally have become healthier and more educated while jobs have become less strenuous.  This means more people are willing and able to work longer.  The definition of retirement has changed.  Rather than retire altogether, many older workers are phasing out of one career and into another.  On reaching 65 years of age, an employee should have the option to continue working.  We must ensure older people&rsquo;s skills do not go to waste.  It is generally accepted by most that on reaching retirement age, they would prefer to continue working beyond retirement.</p></speech>

I invite Dr. Enda Shanahan to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.937" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Enda Shanahan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015111800002#KK00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to speak on the Employment Equality (Abolition of Mandatory Retirement Age) Bill 2014.  I worked in the public hospital sector until I had to retire on reaching the age of 65 years, nearly two years ago.  I did not wish to retire at the time as I was able and willing to continue working.  There was no objective reason for my retirement.  I was still rated fit for purpose by the Medical Council and was physically fit, as demonstrated by being able to run distances from 10 km to the marathon.  Retirement was entirely because of a date in the calendar.</p> <p>  The forced retirement of experienced, able and willing workers is commonplace and represents an enormous waste of human resources.  This is particularly acute in the public health sector where there is an ever-increasing demand driven by increasing numbers of people using services due to population increase, reduced numbers having private health insurance due to increased unemployment and premia, and an increasing number of older people who inevitably require health treatment.  This situation is made worse by the great reduction in staff numbers in recent years and by difficulty in recruiting both doctors and nurses because of the terms and conditions offered by the Health Service Executive, HSE.  As well as the loss of numbers, there has been a disproportionate loss of experienced workers.</p> <p>  If there were no mandatory retirement, many workers would work on which would alleviate skills shortages.  There would also be retention of knowledge and experience built up over many years.  It would be possible to provide mentoring to less experienced workers.  These older workers would continue to contribute to society, both by their work and their taxes, and by either deferring or reducing pension payments, they would reduce demand on pension schemes.</p> <p>  The EU has legislation prohibiting discrimination on age grounds.  However, the wording of the directive allows member states to interpret this more or less as they wish.  The rulings of the Court of Justice of the European Union tend to favour the member states.  There is no doubt that age discrimination is treated far less favourably than other types of discrimination.  The UK recently changed its employment law to ensure there must be appropriate and objective grounds for mandatory retirement.  The United States abolished mandatory retirement in the 1960s and it has continued to have the leading economy in the world.  It must be doing something right.</p> <p>  One of the objections made against retaining older workers is that this would reduce employment prospects for the young, a point touched on by the Minister of State on Second Stage.  This idea is known as the lump of labour fallacy, which has repeatedly been disproved by economists such as the Nobel laureate, Paul Krugman, as well as by exhaustive research performed over many years and covering many countries by such bodies as the National Bureau of Economic Research in the United States and the Institute for the Study of Labor, IZA, in Bonn.  There are multiple publications in peer-reviewed journals which confirm it is a fallacy to suggest retaining older workers interferes with the employment of younger workers.  All the published work on youth unemployment asserts that education, training and motivation are the keys to dealing with it.</p> <p>  It is also alleged that retaining older workers impedes the advancement of younger employees.  In the real world, promotion is based on ability and work performance, not on seniority in an organisation.  It is known that as most workers age, they wish to reduce stress and tend to stand aside from the most challenging types of work.  They also have more interest in having a better work-life balance, a point which they have in common with workers with young children.  The National Health Service, NHS, in the UK is a model for how to retain and value older workers and it is benefiting greatly by this.  All over Europe, businesses are making changes to retain older workers by reducing hours, having flexible working times, working from home, changing benefits, changing workplaces to meet workers&rsquo; needs and ensuring older workers retain skills and feel valued.</p> <p>  Working past 65 years of age will not be for everyone.  Those doing hard manual work, especially outdoors, and those in stressful occupations will probably welcome retirement.  Those who have contracts with specified retirement ages should be allowed to retain these.  However, those who are willing and able to work should be allowed in law to do so.  There should be no age cleansing as a means to get rid of underperforming workers.  There needs to be objective and independent assessment of suitability for work regardless of age.  As someone who regularly runs with people of all ages and as a doctor of 42 years&rsquo; experience, I am aware that chronological age is not the same as biological age.  One size does not fit all.</p> <p>  In Canada, for example, 12,128 physicians aged 65 and over are still working, comprising 15% of all doctors there.  Another 25% of doctors are in the 55 to 64 age group.  Most of them will continue to work after 65 because the Canadians deal with this by having an assessment of fitness to practice.  They use a questionnaire for those who have been in practice for more than 35 years.  If a warning flag is raised, such as in the case of a doctor who has been working for 35 years or more or a doctor who is working solo as a locum with not much contact with others, then there is a further review.  It works well for the Canadians.  Their experience of disasters in the health service is probably better than ours.</p> <p>  Any system for assessing fitness to continue in work should be objective and independent.  Human nature is such that some colleagues may want to work and not to retire because they want to keep something that he or she has.  Self-interest is very good at disguising itself as the public interest.</p></speech>

I thank the joint committee for giving me the opportunity to make my contribution to this important draft legislation.  I am here in a personal capacity.  My interest in the proposed legislation is personal and also has regard to the broader policy implications.  I refer to the article by Professor John FitzGerald in  <i>The Irish Times</i>on 10 November 2015 in which he set out the economic policy argument in support of the proposition in a far better and more trenchant way than I could.<br/><br/>I am 66 years of age and fortunate to be in full-time employment.  If the current situation continues - I see no reason it should not - I will be required to retire when I reach the age of 70 years.  As the committee will have discerned, I work for a progressive employer who takes account of the contribution older employees can make.  Even so, in a few short years I will be surplus to requirements.  My mother worked until she was 73 years old and would have kept going but for the fact that the firm for which she worked closed down.  Many well known people continue to work past normal retirement age, including President Michael D. Higgins and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan.  This suggests the concept of &ldquo;retirement age&rdquo; is a societal construct which draws its legitimacy from our culture rather than from any scientific or biological fact.  If I am able to continue to do my work in a capable manner that meets the expectations of my employer, what relevance does my age have to the decision on when I need to stop working?  Apart from convention, I do not think it has any relevance.<br/><br/>For many working people, men in particular, their job is a vital source of identity and self-worth.  If I am enjoying my work and performing well, why should I be forced to stop simply on age grounds?  Many employees look forward to the opportunities retirement may bring and the Bill will not alter this in any way.  While I may be in a minority in being less enthusiastic about retirement, it is an important equality consideration.  The decision to retire is very personal and age is just one of the factors that should be taken into account.<br/><br/>Regarding the broader policy issue, the dependency ratio has been referred to by many speakers.  It worries policy makers throughout the world.  Professor John FitzGerald has pointed out that the Irish dependency ratio has been trending upwards since 2005.  It seems to be an odd policy choice to require people to become dependent.  For many older people, the State pension system is the only, limited, support they have to sustain a basic standard of living.  Approximately 50% of citizens have no other pension entitlement.  Where continued employment is a possibility, it seems perverse to require a person to depend on the State pension.  Although there is no legislatively defined mandatory retirement age, there are a raft of regulations, contacts of employment and pension schemes that <i>de facto</i>legislate for it.  While youth unemployment is a very significant policy concern, the shorthand connection drawn between the numbers leaving the workforce and the numbers wishing to join it, to which my colleague referred as the &ldquo;lump of labour&rdquo; theory, is very simplistic.<br/><br/>The Minister of State is not opposing the Bill, although he raised questions about how it might impact on employers&rsquo; contractual rights.  It is the proper function of legislation to address this issue and it is the subject of the Bill.  The proposed change would not disadvantage any sensible employer by allowing productive employees to remain working.  While there may be differences of opinion between an employer and an employee about whether the employee is productive, there is a raft of legislation to deal with this issue.  The proposed legislation would remove an important discriminatory barrier for a minority of employees.  In doing so it would add to the progressive transformation of our society, sustained by the Oireachtas, in a small but significant way.  Deputy Anne Ferris is to be commended for taking the lead on it.</p></speech>

I will be 65 years old in January 2016 and due to retire, as my contract states.  I am well and healthy and feel I could work for at least another three to five years.  It is an absolute disgrace in this day and age that workers are being forced into retirement against their will when there are so many role models of older citizens working creatively and contributing so much to the economy.</p> <p>  I work as a dental nurse for the HSE.  It makes no sense for a skilled, competent and widely experienced dental nurse to be asked to cease employment based on a mere number on the calendar.  Given my knowledge and experience, my compulsory retirement would be particularly disadvantageous to the service.  The age factor should be removed when considering suitability and necessity for retirement.  The Government has already increased the retirement age in the public sector to 68 years, thereby recognising people's capability to perform their duties competently past the retirement age of 65.  People of sound mind and body should be allowed to work for as long as they choose.  Retirement should be voluntary.  We, therefore, need to remove the age factor.</p> <p>  I fully support Deputy Anne Ferris and hope the Bill will be passed and enshrined in law before my retirement date.  I do not know if that will happen, but it would be great if it did.</p></speech>

The people present have given their personal stories which cannot be easy to do and for which I salute them.  I have been Chairman of the joint committee for almost five years and almost 600 people have given evidence to us on topics including criminal law, insolvency, burglary, prostitution and missing persons.  It goes on and on and we have sent 35 reports to the Government.  The submissions made today have been some of the most powerful, sensible, well thought out and well researched I have heard and I congratulate those who have made them.  While I usually speak last, I have been very moved by them.  From what I have heard, unless I am persuaded otherwise, I will support the proposal.  There are anomalies that could be addressed on Committee Stage and it must be done.  Whether it can be done before the end of the year remains to be seen, as a raft of legislation has backed up.  The delegates have put down a very powerful marker, for which I congratulate them.  Given that it is her Bill, Deputy Anne Ferris will speak first.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.942" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1105" speakername="Anne Ferris" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015111800002#LL00500"><p>I thank the organisations and individuals who have made very powerful presentations on their own stories.  They are very moving and it is a very personal issue for them as they approach retirement age.  I had not realised staff in the Irish Prison Service had to retire at the age of 60 years.  When I introduced the Bill last year, many people contacted me to tell me their stories.  I was delighted when the Bill was chosen.  When one introduces a Private Members' Bill, it is included in a lottery to be given the opportunity to debate in one of the two Friday D&aacute;il sittings per month.</p><p>I was over the moon when my proposal saw the light of day in the D&aacute;il.  That it has now come as far as Committee Stage means it will not die, as do the many Private Members' Bills which do not get a hearing.  Even if it does not get through before Ms Haughton's retirement, it will, I hope, become law during the next D&aacute;il.</p><p> I do not have any questions because the witnesses are preaching to the converted.  I know all of their stories and am aware of the major anomalies that exist in this area.  The delegates from the Law Society raised a number of issues that can and will be teased out.  The Bill was drafted by a senior counsel who is now a judge.  If there is a need for further clarity on certain provisions, it can be achieved on Committee Stage.  The main anomaly under the current regime is that people are being forced to retire at age 65 and, because they cannot claim their pension until age 66, they are obliged to seek jobseeker's benefit and apply for jobs they do not want.  The biggest culprit in this regard seems to be the Health Service Executive.  This is not just a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality.  It is a broader equality issue which the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and others must take on board.  If the pension age is pushed out to 67 or 68 and people are obliged to work until that age, then the whole area of pension provision will have to be reviewed.</p><p> I thank the Chairman for accommodating this debate.  It is not often that a Private Members' Bill proceeds to Committee Stage so quickly after First Reading in the D&aacute;il.  I am obliged to the Chairman and committee staff for their efforts in this regard.  A great deal of work has gone into these proposals and I assure the delegates that I will keep pressing the legislation.  If the good people of Wicklow and east Carlow return me to the D&aacute;il after the election, I will work on it further.</p></speech>

I congratulate her on bringing this legislation forward and I hope it goes well for her.  To clarify, we are not dealing with Committee Stage today.  When Second Stage of the Bill was completed in the D&aacute;il, it was referred to us for public hearings and scrutiny.  The next Stage will be Committee Stage in the select committee, where the Minister and members will have an opportunity to table amendments.  The next Stages will be Report and Final Stages in the D&aacute;il, after which the Bill will be referred to the Seanad.  There are issues and complications that need to be ironed out but the will is there to move the legislation forward.</p></speech>

Subject to clarification on some of the issues raised by Ms Malone, I cannot see why these proposals should not have the full support of members.  I thank all the delegates for attending.  As the Chairman said, the submissions were very powerful, moving and intelligent.  I have an aunt whose age I will not give, because she would kill me if I did, who retired from the HSE in her 60s, although she did not want to.  She opened a business 21 years ago and it is still going strong today, as is my aunt.  She worked in that business for more than 12 years and still has an input into it.  She made the decision to set up on her own because she did not want to retire.  She should not have had to retire because she is a very capable and intelligent person.  She should have been able to continue in her job until she was ready to leave.</p> <p>  Mr. Kenny spoke about the people, men in particular, for whom their job is a source of identity and self-meaning.  That applies to women just as much as men.  I congratulate all the delegates on their submissions and assure them the legislation has my complete support.</p></speech>

The Chairman summed up the importance of proposals like these being brought before the committee.  I apologise to the delegates for not being here in corporeal form but I was watching proceedings on my monitor.  I had another meeting that ran late.  I read most of the submissions and take this opportunity to express my appreciation for the time the witnesses have taken to make their views known.</p> <p>  Like previous speakers, I do not have any specific questions.  I have some personal experience of the issues concerned in that my father was obliged to retire many years ago from the public sector at age 52.  He still had a huge amount to contribute to society and that is what he did, for a further 20 years, by way of voluntary work for several charitable organisations in Malahide and further afield.  The experience he garnered over 30 years in the public service was wasted to the sector when he had to retire due to downsizing.  It was a personal choice he made not to return to paid employment.  If he had been in a position to stay on within the public sector and provide his skills and experience, it would no doubt have been of benefit to those with whom he worked.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the fact that the pension age and retirement age are not aligned.  It is outrageous to force individuals either to sign on or participate in schemes like JobBridge.  Last weekend, at the Pavilions shopping centre in Swords, I met a constituent of mine who I have known for many years.  When I told him he looked well and asked how he was getting on, he informed me that, at 65 years of age, he is doing a JobBridge scheme and that he had no choice in the matter.  It is not appropriate that people who have been out of work because of the economy and who are somewhat discriminated against because of their age should be treated like that.  Such people have a wealth of experience earned over a lifetime of working.  The opportunity, particularly within the health service, to use one's skills and experience to nurture young talent coming through as to best practice and so on is extremely important.</p> <p>  In regard to social isolation, as referred to by the Chairman, that is a very important matter for us to consider in the context of this discussion and, indeed, when the Bill comes to Committee Stage.  Allowing a person who has 30 or 40 years experience working in a particular industry to continue is far preferable to putting them out to pasture.  We must ensure people, particularly in the later stages of their working life, are valued for the important role they can play.</p></speech>

I introduced an Employment Equality (Amendment) Bill in the Seanad in 2012 on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il, which had the same objective.  I brought that Bill to Second Stage but did not push it to a vote in case the Government chose not to support it.  However, the former Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Phil Hogan, who was in attendance, indicated his support for the proposal.</p> <p>  In the past 40 years, the Oireachtas has introduced many progressive legislative measures to ensure people in the workplace are not discriminated against on grounds of gender, race or sexual orientation.</p></speech>

One of the most dramatic moments at my public meeting was a woman, not unlike Ms Gallagher, stating that she had to retire upon her marriage.  She cried.  She was approaching 65 years of age and had to retire again.  I congratulate Ms Gallagher on her statement at this meeting.  I am not allowed to state my reasons but I would like to put on the record the fact that if there was age discrimination in the Oireachtas, Senators Quinn and &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, would not have been able to contribute their experience.  Nor would President Higgins.  I would love to express my reasons that I stated in the Seanad but I will give the killer sentence instead.  The witnesses and those elsewhere who are approaching retirement know the heartbreak and trauma faced by people who go over the cliff's edge of compulsory retirement at 60 or 65 years of age.  I would love to have had the opportunity to say everything but that is the bottom line.  It is a cliff's edge.  Many people's health deteriorates after they have had to retire.  We are not forcing anyone to retire.  If people wish, they should stay on in the job and negotiate the hours that they want to do.  I am fully supportive of this Bill.</p></speech>

I also welcome members' responses and contributions.  I will be brief.  A term that keeps arising as we examine this issue is the concept of &quot;legitimate aim&quot;.  It is mentioned in the Employment Equality (Amendment) Bill 2013.  Under the equality directive, age discrimination is wrong and should not happen unless it enables us to meet a legitimate aim related to employment policy or the labour market.  This raises the quick question of what constitutes a legitimate aim.  In 2007, the European Court of Justice found in Spain that it was legitimate to discriminate against older workers if it allowed younger people to get employment.  In Ireland's Donnellan <i>v</i>. Minister for Justice, a Garda Commissioner was forced out of his job because doing so was seen as facilitating promotion prospects.  There have been similar High Court equality cases.<br/><br/>Something that I admire about Deputy Ferris's legislation is that the two little words &quot;legitimate aim&quot; are not included.  It is not legitimate that older workers should be forced aside to make room for younger ones.  As Mr. Quinn and Dr. Shanahan observed in some detail, there is no research to support that idea.<br/><br/>I thank the committee for inviting me to this meeting and the Chairman for allowing me to speak again.</p></speech>

I commend Deputy Ferris on her work on this legislation and Senator White on her previous work.  It is important that their work be recorded.  I support the legislation.  This is not an issue of equality in society but of common sense.</p> <p>  The Chairman will be delighted to know that I only have two short questions.  I encountered something in the disability sector.  I speak as a former chairman of the Dublin branch of Down Syndrome Ireland.  Has any of the groups present ever encountered a complete breakdown in services for people with intellectual disabilities because people who have worked therein for years have been forced to retire?  A major problem emerged, given the relationship between the older members of staff and adults with intellectual disabilities.  As parents, we encountered this breakdown.  Often, the role of senior citizens who work with adults with intellectual disabilities is not recognised in broader society.</p></speech>

Many experienced people left over a few years.  They used to mentor younger staff.  We did not have enough people to mentor and help some of our young students and foreign national nurses, who were not only adjusting to a new job, but to a new culture.  It was stressful for everyone.  This problem will be repeated in the next few years unless we address the issue.</p></speech>

My aunt died when she was 88 years of age.  She had been looked after by a succession of care workers.  She did not have the same care worker from one week to the next.  It affected quality.  I am sure that the cost was the same but the quality of the service that she received was poor.  That cost does not show up in the books.</p></speech>

A further 15,555 doctors are in the 55 to 64 years age group, equalling 25% of all doctors working.  It is not a problem in Canada because it has a means of assessing.  Quebec has had it since 1970 and the other provinces followed suit.  Canada does not target doctors until they are 70 years of age or older, at which point a questionnaire is taken.  If that raises a red flag, for example, a doctor doing locum work solo or having been 35 years or more in practice, Canada follows up on it.  This approach works.  Does that answer the Deputy's question?</p></speech>

The National Bureau of Economic Research in the US, which is a private, non-profit research organisation committed to undertaking and disseminating unbiased economic research among public policy makers, business professionals and the academic community, has repeatedly examined this issue in the US and various other countries.</p><p>It has found there is no link between employing older workers and reducing employment for younger workers.  It also found that having older workers continue to work does not reduce the wages of younger workers.  In the European Parliament, the Directorate-General for Internal Policies of the Union produced something similar in April 2013.  The Journal of European Labor Studies, IZA, in Bonn has come up with the same findings.  I have umpteen references on this.</p></speech>

The more older people are employed, the more younger people are employed.  Four of the countries with the top ten employment rates for older people are also in the top ten for the employment of younger people.  I suspect Dr. Shanahan and I have been looking at much the same research.  An OECD report states, "It is important to dispel a number of myths in this area [...] the claim that fewer jobs for older workers results in more jobs for younger workers, though unfounded, is proving especially stubborn".  This proves the Deputy's point; it is a stubborn myth but a myth nonetheless.</p></speech>

I hope it is well-researched, as we say at the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, because I get a lot of people in their 50s coming to my constituency office who say they find it very difficult to get a job as some of the companies they go to say they can get a young man or woman in their 20s for half the price, from a salary point of view.  The over-55s are telling me this.  That seems to contradict what the witnesses are saying about their research.  A private company, in IT, human resources or some other sector, can get a young person in their mid-20s or 30s for half the salary of this older person.  It is an issue.</p></speech>

That is not to say that I have not experienced exactly the same anecdotal, rather than empirical, evidence from constituents from time to time.  It goes back to the example I gave of the 64 year old who is not in a position to find employment.  I often find that is cyclical with the economic profile of the country being studied and that was the case in the OECD report Mr. Moran referenced.</p></speech>

Even though the Bill could be law tomorrow morning, if the Department does not change its policy in regard to extending funding beyond retirement age, which is 66 this year or next year and 67 in two years' time, it will be of no value to the staff employed in the community and voluntary sector.  Community and voluntary groups do not have the funding to maintain salary and wages without funding from the State.</p></speech>

One is about activation of older people.  At the beginning of austerity or the recession, the tendency was not to activate older people.  We are now seeing that trend changing because there are more people employed.  The skills of older people will again be recognised.  We are seeing people in their 60s being activated, which we had not experienced at the beginning.  We would always make the point that the skill sets they bring, as evidenced by the contributions here, are very important.</p> <p>  I wonder whether it is possible to put a question.  I am not sure about the protocol.  Two equality Bills have been brought forward by committees.  There is the longer healthy living Bill and the other equality Bill.  These Bills seek to do the same thing, namely, to allow people to work longer.  This Bill is simple.  That has been mentioned before.  I know groups have been working in this regard because I have participated with some of the people from the law group, particularly Mr. Loughlin Deegan, and have had conversations on this.  Is it within the power of the committee, along with other committees - I know there are different Departments - to push this as an objective before this D&aacute;il finishes?  That is what is important.  There are a lot of things that can be worked around. </p> <p>  What the witness from the community and voluntary sector is saying is that there are so many community and voluntary groups which are going to have to disband, including our one, because they have no funding.  That is a huge issue for people.  It is about the principle.  I am concerned that this would work particularly well for the public sector but not so much for Ms O'Toole's situation as she is in retail and may not have as much power.  It should be a choice for everybody, not just for people in the public sector.  I appreciate the scarcity of skills and that is very important.  We are hopefully moving into a different era now, as 2016 looms.  I would say to the legislators that they should make it an objective to get this through before the end of this D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

I do not distinguish between them.  Age discrimination is just that.  I do not care what the age is.  What the Deputy says is correct.  People who lose their jobs in their 50s have great trouble getting into the workplace because they are considered too old.  That is age discrimination and it should be made illegal.  It is downright wrong and takes no account of the experience or the skills of that person.  The Deputy is right in saying that the companies are probably employing younger workers because they can pay them less and treat them like dirt.  It is not exclusive to what I was saying.

Part of how we begin to deal with it is to name it.  Age discrimination is still very <i>sotto voce</i>in our society.  It is talked about but in whispers.  I will give a short anecdote.  A friend of mine lost his job at 62.  He sent out 600 applications and got one or two responses.  Somebody told him to take his age off his application and he got eight or ten responses from the next 20 or 30 he sent out.  It is a live issue in our society but we tend not to talk about it.  This Bill sends a powerful message from the Oireachtas and the people of Ireland that this should be an unacceptable practice.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses who came here today.  Senator White alluded earlier to the marriage bar that was brought in to force women out of their jobs when they got married years ago and was subsequently lifted.</p><p>There was a major debate on the lifting of the marriage bar.  The argument was that men would lose their jobs or not get them if married women were allowed to work, but the sky did not fall in.  The lifting of the mandatory retirement age is an issue of equality and concerns getting rid of discrimination at all levels.  The age of 65 years is the new 55 and I am nearer to 65 than to 55.  Believe me, we will do our best to have the legislation coming down the track enacted.  I ask organisations such as the HSE that have people like Margaret Haughton who is due to retire to take another look at the issue of retirement age.  In one year organisations will not have a choice because the legislation will have been enacted.  I plead with them to look with compassion, honesty and equality at what they are doing.</p></speech>

All public sector organisations should look at this issue to see what they could do to retain staff with ability, energy, knowledge, wisdom, skills and experience.  I join members in thanking the delegates for being here as it is very important that we hear the public.  This is not a forum in which members should make speeches but for members of the public to engage and have their views made known to the Oireachtas, the Legislature and Parliament.  That is the reason we invite groups and citizens to come before us because this is the parliament of the people.  They are the bosses, not us.</p></speech>

I would like to introduce the team.  I am from the social welfare policy unit and I am based in Sligo.  I am joined by Ms Mary Pracht, who works with me in the unit, Ms Aideen Mooney, who is in the policy section of the PRSI credits, and by Mr. Carl O'Rourke, who is the operational manager for our homeless persons and new communities unit in Dublin.</p> <p>  I thank the joint committee for this opportunity to appear before it today on the matter of the recommendations of the committee in its report on direct provision and the supports provided by the Department of Social Protection to persons resident in these centres.  As regards financial supports provided to asylum seekers, the Department&rsquo;s role with regard to persons living in direct provision is mainly the provision of financial assistance.  Asylum seekers are offered accommodation under the system of direct provision operated by the Reception and Integration Agency of the Department of Justice and Equality.  Under this system, persons are provided with accommodation, all food and health services, together with other facilities and services designed to ensure their needs are met while seeking the protection of the State.  In addition to the provision of basic necessities, a weekly allowance for personal expenditure, known as direct provision allowance, or DPA, is paid to protection seekers who reside within the system of direct provision.</p> <p>  DPA is administered by designated persons in the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s community welfare service on an administrative basis on behalf of the Department of Justice and Equality.  Payment of the DPA, therefore, is not provided for within social welfare legislation and is not paid in accordance with the provisions of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005. At the end of October 2015, there were more than 4,800 persons in direct provision accommodation with total expenditure of over &euro;3 million by this Department on DPA.  </p> <p>  In addition to DPA, the Department makes exceptional needs payments, ENPs, to persons in direct provision to help meet essential costs, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their income.  ENPs made to direct provision residents are largely towards clothing costs, transport costs and the purchase of child-related items such as prams and buggies.  To date in 2015, more than 13,100 ENPs have been paid to asylum seekers in direct provision at a cost of over &euro;1 million.</p> <p>  Once granted status, persons can apply for the relevant Department of Social Protection weekly payments such as the jobseeker's payment or the one-parent family payment, including child benefit, appropriate to the circumstances of the individual person or family.  ENPs are also paid to support the move from direct provision into the community, including assistance towards rent deposits.  Applications are determined on a case by case basis, having regard to the individual circumstances presented.</p> <p>  Persons in direct provision also receive payments under the Department's back to school clothing and footwear scheme, which provides once-off assistance towards the cost of returning to school each September.  In 2015 to date, approximately &euro;113,000 has been paid in respect of 525 families under this scheme to persons resident in direct provision.</p> <p>  As regards service delivery, I refer to recommendation 8.7 of the committee&rsquo;s report which refers to the provision of service in direct provision centres.  The Department continues to examine the operation of all its services, including the administration of the community welfare service, in the context of the efficient delivery of services nationally to all its customers.</p> <p>  Where the community welfare service has been restructured, alternative arrangements have been put in place to ensure that customers are provided with ongoing access to the supports provided by the Department.</p><p>For example, in the event that a customer has difficulty attending a clinic due to illness, a visit to the client's residence may be arranged.</p><p> The Department continues to provide a presence in some of the direct provision centres.  Where this is not the case, service is generally provided in the local Intreo centres.  In these cases, the level of service has generally increased with improved facilities available to both customers and staff of the Department.  The Department has received positive feedback from residents attending community welfare services in Intreo centres as it provides an opportunity to engage with the local community and fosters a more inclusive community spirit. </p><p> I will now address the issue of credits for social welfare contributions.  In recommendation 8.6 of its report on the direct provision system, the committee sought recognition of time spent in direct provision for individuals who are subsequently granted residence, subsidiary protection or leave to remain in Ireland.  The social insurance system in Ireland is based on the contributory principle whereby contributions are paid by workers which will give entitlement as a right to a varying range of benefits and pensions that are payable if and when particular contingencies arise.  Therefore, for an individual to qualify for social insurance benefits, they must have paid PRSI contributions.  Paid PRSI contributions are based on the payment of PRSI by the worker and if appropriate, their employer, calculated as a percentage of the worker's income.  In addition, credited PRSI contributions, which are commonly referred to as "credits", may be awarded to protect social insurance entitlements of employees by covering gaps in insurance where they are not in a position to pay PRSI, for example, during periods of unemployment, illness, etc.  To qualify for credits, a worker must have paid at least one PRSI contribution while working and have had an attachment to the workforce in the past two tax years as evidenced by having paid or credited PRSI contributions in that period.  If these conditions are met, credits are only awarded in specific circumstances.  These circumstances include proven unemployment or certified illnesses, receipt of specific social welfare payments or entitlement to certain statutory leave, such as parental leave.  The award of credits is therefore predicated on the attachment of an employee to the workforce and only serves to bridge periods of temporary absence from the workforce.  Credits on their own do not give an employee entitlement to social insurance benefits.  It is only in combination with paid PRSI contributions that credits assist employees in qualifying for short-term schemes and enhance the level of benefit for long-term schemes.  Therefore, the award of credits would not achieve the objective of providing persons who have been granted residence, subsidiary protection or leave to remain in Ireland with entitlement to social insurance benefits.  </p><p> Where such persons enter the workforce, the payment of their first PRSI contribution as an employee will entitle them to pre-entry credits.  The purpose of pre-entry credits is to enable new entrants to the social insurance system to qualify for benefits within a reasonable period after their date of entry once they have sufficient paid PRSI contributions.  Pre-entry credits are awarded from the beginning of the relevant contribution year to the date on which they began to work,that is, their date of entry into social insurance as an employed contributor, and for the two previous contribution years before entry into insurable employment.  In effect, the award of pre-entry credits to those granted residence, subsidiary protection or leave to remain and who take up employment will provide recognition for social insurance purposes of a period of between two to three years spent in the direct provision system</p><p> In respect of ongoing engagement and work in the area of asylum, a lot of work has been undertaken regarding the supports to asylum seekers within the past 12 months and officials in the Department of Social Protection have fully engaged with colleagues in the Department of Justice and Equality who have policy responsibility in this area.  In its capacity of providing ongoing income support, the Department participated on the working group that reported to Government on improvements to the protection process, including direct provision and supports to asylum seekers.  The Department has recently re-issued guidance to officers in the community welfare service administering DPA and other financial supports to ensure consistency throughout the various centres as recommended by the working group.   </p><p> Following on from the recommendation of the working group, the Department was also represented on the task force on transitional supports for persons granted status in direct provision, which was chaired by the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.  The outcome from this group was the development of a comprehensive multi-agency information programme, including representation from this Department, which will be rolled out to all persons transitioning from direct provision centres and the production of a detailed information booklet.  </p><p> I note the concerns of the committee regarding the transition of persons from direct provision into the community following receipt of status and the current rent limits under the rent supplement scheme.  Provision of accommodation for those exiting direct provision is a matter, in the first instance, for the local authority either through social housing or the housing assistance payment, HAP, if HAP is being operated in that area.  If these supports are not available, rent supplement will be considered.  A review of the rent limits earlier this year found that the impact of increasing limits at a time of constrained supply will increase costs disproportionately for the Exchequer with little or no new housing available to recipients.  Rather than increasing limits, rent supplement policy will continue to allow for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of the limits.  Under this flexible approach, the circumstances of tenants are considered on a case-by-case basis and rents are being increased above prescribed limits, as appropriate.  This approach has assisted over 4,900 households nationwide to secure and retain their rented accommodation. </p><p> To conclude, I assure the committee that the Department is committed to the ongoing provision of a high level of service to persons in direct provision and those arriving under the new Irish refugee protection programme as recently announced by Government.  I trust the presentation is of assistance to the committee and I am happy to discuss any issues. </p></speech>

We are all worried about people in direct provision, particularly those who have been there for years.  If people come out of direct provision, how difficult is it for them to access rent supplement because people have contacted me and this seems to be the greatest difficulty they face?  It relates to trying to find somewhere to stay with the amount they receive.</p></speech>

I am advised from statistics provided by the Department of Justice and Equality that once people are granted status, almost 60% have left the centres within three months and approximately 85% have left within about six months.  There are a number of reasons for that.  People might want to stay in the centres while their children are at school, they are linking to school terms and so on.  In respect of rent supplement, our community welfare services engages with individuals and we do provide increased payments.  At this point in time, we have provided excess payments in 4,900 cases.  We also operate a special protocol with Threshold in the Dublin area and Cork city where supply issues are particularly acute.  Under this process, an individual contacts Threshold directly which will provide support, including engagement with the landlord, the PRTB if there is some kind of dispute and the Department if it is felt that an increase is required under the rent supplement scheme.  As I said, we have already increased 4,900 payments and under the threshold specifically, that accounts for about 1,500 of the 4,900.</p> <p>  We pay rent deposits and rent in arrears under the exceptional needs payments scheme.  To date, we have issued over 2,100 payments for rent deposit to the tune of approximately &euro;1 million so we are assisting people.  In the context of the information groups I referred to that came out of the transitional task force, staff actually engaged with residents from eight centres through six information sessions.  They were attended by representatives from our Department, the local authorities, the Citizens Information Board, MABS and the HSE.  We provided information on the next steps and engaging with our office to seek assistance towards rent deposits.  We are out there and are providing support and we want people to come to us about rent supplement.  </p> <p>  I also spoke about HAP, which is a new payment administered by the local authority.

I will leave that to somebody else.</p> <p>  Is it automatic that every child in the direct provision system will receive child benefit?  I understand the idea of credits and that it is difficult to imagine a scheme under which credited social insurance contributions would be given to those in the direct provision system if they had not worked in the country before.  In some cases, however, they might have because not everybody in the direct provision system applied for asylum straightaway.  There must be some scheme to recognise the period when the State denied them the ability to work.  It is not necessarily a scheme under which they can immediately receive social welfare payments.  I imagine more a scheme such as that for women when they were refused back into the Civil Service after they had married.  Many years later the Government gave them some recognition for the period in which they were prevented from working.  It could be something similar in this case.  It would not necessarily give people a benefit immediately but would be more for pensions where a whole-life contribution would be taken into account.  In 40 years time a person who had been in the direct provision system for ten years might have a gap in his or her social insurance contributions.  It is a scary concept that such a person could be punished again in the future because he or she had no mechanism to plug the hole in contributions which had not been caused by him or her.</p> <p>  I welcome the assistance the Department is providing for people with rental deposits.  There are over 400 people in the direct provision system who do not need to be in it who but cannot find a home suitable for themselves because of the cost involved.  Most people interviewed by the committee wanted to be close to the direct provision centre because their kids went to school nearby.  The kids at the Mosney centre, for example, attended local schools in Julianstown or Drogheda.  They hope to locate in these areas, but there is not enough social housing available and they are not in work because they have not been allowed to work and are disconnected from the workplace.  The current facility mentioned in the report has to do with landlords in the main who are increasing their rent; therefore, it does not apply to those in the direct provision system.  If people cannot access housing in their own right outside direct provision centres and they have to keep taking up a space in a centre which otherwise would either be closed or given to someone else, does the Department of Social Protection pay rent to the Department of Justice and Equality?  In other cases older people&rsquo;s housing units run by different agencies charge tenants a certain amount.  The tenants are told then to obtain rent allowance.  Is there a similar set-up in these instances?</p> <p>  Much play has been made of the contribution made by the emergency needs payment.  It is welcome that it is available.  However, it is not as substantial as has been made out.  Up to &euro;134,000 has been made available, but with 4,800 people in direct provision accommodation, it means a figure of &euro;280 per person per year.  That is not that substantial, given the heartache and hardship endured by those in direct provision accommodation.  On top of this, why is it that not all children in the direct provision system receive child benefit?</p></speech>

There are quite a number of people resident and working in the country whose children cannot claim if they are in the European Union.  It is a random approach in child benefit provision.

He or she can claim child benefit for his or her children if there is a difference in the child benefit payable here and in Italy.</p></speech>

Asylum seekers and persons seeking protection are excluded in law from satisfying the habitual residence condition until they have actually been given leave to remain and their status of refugee has been determined.  Accordingly, a person resident in a direct provision centre who is awaiting a decision on his or her asylum application does not qualify for child benefit.  There are 500 people in the direct provision system with status, or approximately 230 family units.  These families are in receipt of child benefit because their asylum applications have actually been determined.  There are some families who are waiting to move out which are in receipt of child benefit.  However, it is not payable to asylum seekers.</p></speech>

It has to do with the child in the main, unless there is an unaccompanied minor or he or she is not the asylum seeker.  There are European Court judgments which state the child has different status from the applicant for asylum.  In some instances elsewehere in Europe and here in the past, people were granted leave to remain on the basis of a child, not on the basis of their own applications for asylum.  It concerns me that a child is penalised because the parent or the State has not managed to have his or her application sorted out.</p></speech>

The recent <i>daft.ie</i>report shows that availability is at its lowest level since 2006.  It is acknowledged that rent supplement in and of itself will not resolve the issue of supply but the Department is doing its best to alleviate the immediate issues customers are facing.  Further, the increased payments we are providing - the 4,900 - apply to both existing and new applicants.  We are providing increased payments which are over the limit to new applicants.  This covers people, for example, who leave the direct provision system.<br/><br/>Landlords refusing to take people as tenants was also mentioned.  We hope the housing package announced last week by the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, in particular the increase in mortgage interest relief for landlords who commit to accommodate customers in receipt of State support under rent supplement and HAP for a period of up to three years, will go some way towards addressing that issue.  The housing assistance payment limits have also been increased as part of the announcement last week by the Minister to facilitate discretion along the lines of that of the community welfare service in local authorities.  <br/><br/>The Deputy asked if the Department of Justice and Equality pays an equivalent of rent to the Department of Social Protection-----</p></speech>

However, once an individual gets status and remains in one of these centres, we will pay the individual his or her weekly social welfare payment, be it jobseeker's payment, basic supplementary welfare allowance or another payment.  Social welfare legislation allows us to carry out an assessment of the non-cash benefits provided to people while in a direct provision centre.

Not that I am aware of anyway, but I do not think that to be the case.</p> <p>  I am aware that there has been a lot of media interest and commentary on exceptional needs payments over recent days.  Exceptional needs payments are a demand-led scheme.  The provision this year is approximately &euro;27.9 million.  Of that sum, we have paid more than &euro;1 million to persons in direct provision.  This year, to date, we have paid in the region of &euro;80,000 in exceptional needs payments of which more than &euro;13,000 has been to persons in direct provision.  This represents approximately 16% to 18% of the total.  Payments to persons in direct provision are primarily made in respect of clothing and travel costs.  Travel costs constitute the greatest proportion.  Of the payments made so far to date, 57% of them are in respect of travel costs.  An asylum seeker may have to attend in Dublin for legal, medical or other appointments.  Some 35% of the payments relates to clothing.  Those are the main payments we make under the exceptional needs payments.  </p></speech>

Some things based on our recommendations in the report should be clarified and put on the record.  My understanding from the presentation is that the Department is purely the administrator of the weekly allowance and that any increase in the weekly allowance is an issue for the Reception and Integration Agency and the Department of Justice and Equality.  Therefore, the increases mooted by the working group would have to be granted by the Department of Justice and Equality in the first place before they could be administered by the Department of Social Protection.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

The policy is primarily the responsibility of the Department of Justice and Equality.  The Department of Social Protection was represented on the working group and made a number of recommendations which included the proposed increase to the direct provision allowance.  The Government agreed during the summer that, in the first instance, those recommendations would be subject to detailed discussion by the Cabinet committee on social policy.  My understanding is that it will be considered by Government in due course through the Cabinet committee.</p></speech>

The habitual residence prerequisite for child benefit seems quite unfair.  Most citizens would balk at the condition and say all of the children of the country should be treated equally.  I appreciate the stance and the position on it but is the interdepartmental group making any recommendations on changing it.  Is it being discussed at the interdepartmental group given it was a recommendation from this Oireachtas committee?  I think it was included in the working group report as well.</p></speech>

I do not recall it being there.  The high level interdepartmental group consists of representatives from our Department, the HSE and the Department of Justice and Equality.  As far as I am aware, the habitual residence condition and how it relates to child benefit has not been discussed.  Government policy is that the habitual residence condition must be satisfied for a number of schemes, including child benefit.  Any change to the policy would require a change in legislation, which would obviously require Government approval.</p></speech>

Surely it would be an idea to put it on the table.  Could we suggest when the Department goes back to the next meeting that it is something that could be considered?  The group may decide not to do it but it would only be fair that it would consider it, if possible.</p> <p>  On rent flexibility, can the local welfare office find in advance of someone taking up a lease that it would allow an increase on the rent supplement given the circumstances?  Take for example someone who is moving out of direct provision and finds a suitable house in Galway, where there is an issue with rent limits.  The rent for the house identified by the person is above the rent limit.  Can he or she go to the Department of Social Protection, explain the rent supplement limit is &euro;750 but the house will cost &euro;950 and have the increase approved in advance of signing a lease?  Alternatively, is it that only a person who has a lease and is in a house can ask for the increased payment?</p></speech>

Our rent limits have been in place for some time.  In areas such as Dublin, payments are being made in excess of the limit.  Under the rent supplement scheme, a formal or statutory decision is only made regarding entitlement once a person has engaged in the lease and it is determined that a bona fide tenancy is in place.  We encourage people to engage with the community welfare service in terms of the flexibility that is there.  Our community welfare service, given its local knowledge, is in a position to make a determination on what is reasonable rent.  It can also determine what kind of accommodation a person may qualify for in terms of family size and so on.  I would suggest in those cases that people make contact with the community welfare service - although a formal or statutory decision will not be made on the rent supplement - to discuss the level of flexibility because flexibility is being shown to new applicants as well as existing ones.</p></speech>

I appreciate that the allowance is an issue and that the Department is the administrative body for it.  On the issue of emergency needs payments, child benefit, etc., will Ms Harrington outline what appeals mechanisms are available to somebody who is not happy with the decisions that are made?  What guidance does the Department give to its welfare officers if, for example, a person appears at the Intreo office, a decision is made, they go through and appeals mechanism and they are not happy with it?

It is not means tested; it is paid once a person is resident.  In many ways, the payment of that particular allowance is fairly black and white, as it were.  If someone is resident in a direct provision centre, they will get the allowance.  We would not generally have queries or issues on the DPA allowance.  In the case of ENPs, a person can request a review by another officer within the Department.  An officer can review the decision of another officer.  Once a person is granted a particular status, for example, if he or she claims jobseeker's allowance, one-parent family allowance or basic supplementary welfare allowance, the payment is appealable to the social welfare appeals office.  While persons in direct provision are seeking asylum, the direct provision would not be an issue because there is no means test.  If one is resident in direct provision, the Department is advised and it pays the payment.  In the case of exceptional needs, another officer would review the case.</p></speech>

The only payments that an individual in direct provision gets from the Department of Social Protection are the exceptional needs payments and the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, neither of which are appealable to the social welfare appeals office for anyone in the State.  My understanding is that if an individual has a query about those payments, he or she could bring them to the Ombudsman.  I am not aware of any.  None has ever been brought to my attention, given the once-off nature of those payments.  I see no reason why an individual could not query with an ombudsman if they had an issue about an exceptional needs payment.</p></speech>

One cannot go from direct provision straight onto the RAS or HAP scheme.  One can receive rent supplement once the assessment of need has been made.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh was asking if there was some recognition of the length of time a person spent in direct provision, not for the purpose of the housing list because that would mean that many people would jump straight ahead but rather for allowing them to access a different form of longer-term housing need scheme such as the HAP scheme.</p></speech>

In an area where HAP is rolled out, it is available to new applicants and rent supplement is no longer available.  Residents leaving direct provision, if they are in a HAP area, would apply to the local authority for a housing needs assessment, in the same way they would have for rent supplement.  Those customers, subject to satisfying the conditions set down in the relevant legislation, may be eligible for HAP.  Someone coming from a direct provision centre may be eligible for HAP or rent supplement.  The RAS is different.  It is a scheme that people transfer to when they have been in receipt of rent supplement for 18 months or more.  New people can move onto HAP directly in areas where HAP has been rolled out.</p></speech>

If I understand correctly, it is up to the Government to make decisions on some of the more contentious issues such as the level of the direct provision payment and the right to work.  I think I am right to say that Ms Harrington is not in a position to shed much more light on those matters.  People who have been there for more than six months - many have been there for ten years - have been robbed of the right and opportunity to work.  They should be compensated for that by being credited for those years when they were denied the opportunity to work.  That is a policy decision.  Did Ms Mooney say that once they start work, a three-year credit is given?</p></speech>

Once somebody starts to work as an employee and pays his or her first PRSI employment contribution, there is an automatic period in which he or she is back-granted credits, if one likes, for between two and three years.  It is for two full tax years and some of the third year, depending on when the person starts during a particular year.  As this applies to everybody, those in direct provision are not at a disadvantage <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>other individuals starting to work in the workforce.</p></speech>

However, it is obviously a decision for the Government as to whether it will grant such people credits based on how long they had been in direct provision and denied the right to work.</p> <p>  Is it possible for the witnesses to provide members with the guidelines the Department gives to community welfare officers in respect of flexibility?  I would be interested in seeing them because it seems to be a sort of moving goalpost or whatever is the expression as to how such flexibility is or is not granted.  There also does not appear to be a great deal of consistency in the discretion that is given and it often appears to vary between individual community welfare officers.  One community welfare officer may be much more flexible in applying the flexibility than others who might be highly inflexible and who will simply tell people that X is the rent allowance limit and they cannot breach it.  If this is stated to people by a community welfare officer, I advise them to indicate that they wish to make a formal application in any event and to not accept a verbal refusal.  I advise people to seek, in writing, the reason the community welfare officer is refusing them because the rents in question are what the rents are for any available properties in the area, of which there are very few.  I suggest this in order that there will be a requirement on the community welfare officer to provide, in writing, the reason he or she refused somebody a breach on the allowance cap.  If such a written reason is provided and people still cannot get accommodation, I advise them to submit a formal appeal.  However, I wish to know what precisely is the instruction or memo that is passed on to community welfare officers in this area that leads to such a wide variety of responses from those officers in granting discretion in these cases.  This is not just for asylum seekers but for anybody.  Can the witnesses enlighten members?</p></speech>

We implemented a document - I think it was the national tenancy sustainment framework document - that we issued to community welfare service staff in January 2015.  The type of information or advice we gave on that was to be aware of the local properties in the area, to measure the request in the context of similar properties in the area, once it is reasonable, to establish that the person is not under immediate threat of homelessness or loss of tenancy and, again, to have regard to the needs of the family and the household composition.  That is a flavour of the document and by its nature, it is difficult to prescribe discretion.  However, we have advised officers to be aware of similar properties in the area, of what is the market rent for other areas and to take this into account when making their decision.

Before we suspended for the vote, it was said that the direction given to community welfare officers was to take rents in the area into consideration in terms of deciding what constituted a reasonable rent before breaching the rent allowance cap.  Is it possible to see a copy of the memo?  Could it be sent to the committee?  I am interested in seeing it, not because I doubt Ms Harrington but because there is such a wide diversity in how the advice seems to be interpreted.  It would be quite useful for members trying to represent people to have the wording of those guidelines so that we could, as it were, arm people who are going to community welfare officers with precisely what the instructions say in cases where there might be a dispute about the interpretation of discretion or flexibility.</p> <p>  Is the instruction being given to community welfare officers on whether to accept an application dependent on where the person was previously located in an area, in this case where the direction provision centre was?  This is a general issue but I seek clarification on it.  What I have come across in general is people being told applications are not being accepted because they have no proven link to the area and they are somebody else&rsquo;s problem.  We have had to fight, sometimes successfully, sometimes unsuccessfully, to establish a person&rsquo;s right to apply for rent assistance in a particular area.  Given the chronic lack of affordable rental accommodation, that is a crazy situation.  I would have thought it applied very much to people coming out of direct provision trying to find what is very difficult, namely, affordable rental accommodation that accepts rent allowance.  It seems to me that we must have great flexibility at that level as well.  In other words, regardless of where somebody has been in a direct provision centre, if he or she could find accommodation anywhere that would accept him or her, he or she should be able to go to the community welfare officer in the area and ask for rent allowance and for permission to breach the cap because the accommodation in question is all he or she can find.  Could Ms Harrington comment on that point also?</p></speech>

By its nature and the changing and dynamic environment in which we find ourselves at the moment, it is difficult to prescribe for discretion other than to offer guidelines.  We issued guidance to community welfare staff on two occasions in 2014 and we also implemented a national framework tenancy document in January.  I can arrange to send that to the committee for its information.</p></speech>

I will arrange to send that information to the committee.  In relation to rent supplement, my understanding is that generally people in direct provision tend to stay in the locality or area where the direct provision centre was located.  Most people do not necessarily want to leave there because they have built up links in the local community and their children are at school there, among other factors.  Based on the information I have from the Department of Justice and Equality, people tend to stay in the same area.</p> <p>  Generally speaking, people in direct provision who want to get rent supplement must have a social housing assessment carried out by the local authority.  Our policy is generally to have the assessment carried out by the local authority in the area where the person wishes to reside, although there is some flexibility in particular among the Dublin local authority areas.  Once that is done, we will administer and pay rent supplement.  I am not sure whether that answers the Deputy&rsquo;s question.</p></speech>

I accept that most people want to stay in the area in which they are living and where their children go to school.  One might get one or two places available and several hundred people in a month chasing those one or two places.  In an ideal world, they would find somewhere close by but often they have to go further, for example, to Little Bray or into Bray, which is administratively under the jurisdiction of Wicklow County Council.  Boundary issues arise in terms of people being told they are not the problem of the local authority area in which they are seeking accommodation.  That is crazy.  People might be reluctant to go to Bray but if they can get somewhere and they are happy with that, then there should not be any issue about them being able to get rent allowance in whatever area they can find accommodation.  Such flexibility should be available.  If a person is willing to move to an area where he or she might have some prospect of getting somewhere close to the rent allowance limit and there is a slightly higher likelihood of rent allowance acceptance, for example, on the edge of the city such as Tallaght, it should be possible to do that.  Understandably, many people do not want to go there but others might accept it and then boundary issues arise.  Maximum flexibility should be provided given the mess in terms of trying to find rental accommodation that will accept rent allowance.  Instructions should be given to community welfare officers to exercise the maximum flexibility and not to say "No" on the basis of administrative demarcation lines.  I wonder what the situation is in that regard.</p></speech>

Specifically, it is making it more difficult for the cohort coming out of direct provision to source accommodation.  In my experience dealing with colleagues and former superintendents, there has been flexibility and a desire not to create an obstacle.</p></speech>

Going by my experience, which is not specifically with direct provision, I would anticipate that this could become an issue for people who have got their status and are trying to exit direct provision and find rental accommodation, which is very difficult to find.</p> <p>  We should not let these demarcation lines be an obstacle.  People have been told when they go to get rent allowance that the community welfare officer would like to give it to them but cannot unless they are on the list in that particular area, while the local authority is resistant.  Sometimes we argue with them and can get there but sometimes we get resistance.  Given the difficulty of the situation, we need joined-up thinking between the relevant Departments and flexibility across those administrative lines.</p></speech>

Joined-up thinking is required between ourselves and the other organisations.  The task force I mentioned earlier is providing information supports to people before they leave direct provision.  A pilot was undertaken as part of the work of that task force in which the Department, the housing authority, MABS, the Citizens Information Board, CIB and so on met with groups of people who were transitioning.  It also was attended by those who were not transitioning and did not have status, purely for information purposes.  As part of that programme, people were advised to engage with the Department of Social Protection once they receive status so that their full social welfare entitlement could be determined.  They were also advised to engage with the local authority on their housing needs assessment.  They were being asked where they would like to go in terms of locations.  It was a pilot programme and based on its success and usefulness, the task force agreed that it will be rolled out on an ongoing basis.  It will be facilitated by the CIB, which will bring all the various Government Departments and agencies together.</p> <p>  There is no legal requirement that the housing needs assessment be carried out in the local authority area in which a person resides.</p></speech>

Saying that, however, the policy generally has been that it is better if that is how it is administered in normal circumstances.  I appreciate that we are in very difficult circumstances at the moment in terms of supply.  If a person is established in an area, they are better off on the social housing list for that area if they want to continue to stay there.  Otherwise the individual could end up missing out as they develop links and so on.  That has generally been the policy but there has been increased flexibility.</p> <p>  I would request that committee members bring it to our attention if they know of a case in which a person has been treated incorrectly or unduly harshly by the Department in this regard.  I am aware that there is increased flexibility but also that it would be to the benefit of the individual to be on the housing list for the area in which he or she is residing.</p></speech>

By now, we are all very well aware of the Government decision in May 2011 that put new arrangements in place for the appointment of persons to State boards and bodies.  Reference to this arrangement is made in the guidelines of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on appointments to State boards of November 2014.  The committee welcomes the opportunity to meet the chairperson designate in public session to hear her views.  We trust that this provides greater transparency in the process of appointment to our State boards and bodies.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Ms Graham.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l)</i>of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If witnesses are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons, or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Any submission or opening statements witnesses have made to the committee will be published on the committee website after the meeting.</p><p>I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or persons outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I invite Ms Graham to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

Perhaps it would help the committee if I introduced myself briefly.  I was born and grew up in County Down in Northern Ireland.  I joined Ulster Bank in 1982, working in Belfast and, for many years, here in Dublin.  My most recent role was as head of Ulster Bank in Northern Ireland and managing director of SME banking across the island of Ireland.  Prior to that, I was chief operating officer for Ulster Bank Group, again on an all-island basis.  In those roles, I came to know the bank's customers and stakeholders.  This included engagement with many public representatives here in Leinster House and in Stormont on issues affecting their constituents.  Prior to that, I was in charge of RBS operations for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  This involved responsibility for more than 3,000 staff and servicing retail and commercial banking customers from a range of locations abroad.  My other current activities include chairmanship of the Economic Advisory Group in Northern Ireland.   I am also a board member of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry and a member of the advisory board of the Women's Executive Network in Ireland.  These roles provide a really helpful perspective on wider policy and community issues both in Northern Ireland and in the Republic.</p> <p>  I do not want to burden the committee with too much biographical detail but it may be helpful if I say that my career to date as an executive and non-executive has taught me the value of sound business judgment, leadership, customer focus, pragmatism, ability to influence people and tenacity.  As someone who has lived and worked in Dublin and Belfast, I know at first hand the importance of business relationships between the North and South.  These business links have played a key role in the progress we have made in recent years.  I am very proud of the contribution women make to business and I am delighted to be the first woman nominated to chair the ESB.</p> <p>  As chairman designate, I am very conscious of the great history of the ESB.  It was established as a commercial State company at the very beginning of the State to be a key enabler of the economic development of the country.  Electricity remains vital for economic development and the ESB continues to play a crucial role in the national economy.  I am mindful of being responsible not only to the Government, as owner, but also to those industries, businesses, hospitals, schools, homes and all those who rely on the ESB for a safe and secure supply of electricity.  My appointment is an honour and it is also a challenge that I very much welcome. </p> <p>  As a serving board member, I have come to see the scale and complexity of the ESB's business.  The ESB is a major employer, with 7,200 staff, &euro;13 billion in assets and &euro;3 billion in annual revenues, and it contributes more than &euro;2 billion annually to the Irish economy.  The ESB has a presence in every county and townland in the country.  The ESB Networks business serves more than 2 million customers.  There has been major investment in the networks to deliver the infrastructure critical to a modern economy.  As the members all appreciate, there is great commitment from staff to maintaining a safe and secure energy supply in all weathers.</p> <p>  The ESB's generation and supply businesses have undergone major transformations over the past decade, from being monopolies to operating in an open and competitive marketplace.  We can all see that ESB International brings Irish engineering expertise to serve the needs of clients right across the globe.  The ESB is a large-scale business, investing up to &euro;1 billion each year.  Some &euro;500 million to &euro;600 million of this is spent upgrading Ireland's electricity network.  The ESB invests hundreds of millions of euro each year in its generation, supply and innovation businesses.  To finance these investments, the ESB has to be a financially strong and profitable business.</p><p>It has to raise debt in the international financial markets.  Current debt stands at &euro;5 billion.  I am aware of the scale of this investment challenge and of the role of the board in maintaining a financially strong ESB for the benefit of all of us.</p><p> On looking forward, the first thing I would say about my vision for the future is that it is a very exciting time for the energy industry.  We are all working to address the challenges of climate change and to decarbonise our economies.  This is giving rise to a huge focus on renewables, the development of clean energy technologies and the efficient use of energy.  EU and national policies are driving these efforts and the ESB will continue to play a leading national role.  These developments are changing not only the way we generate electricity but also the way we supply it to customers.  Smart technologies are already improving the efficiency and operation of the electricity networks.  All of this progress will place the customers much more in control of when and how they use electricity.  It will also enhance the whole customer experience and engagement in our own homes.</p><p> It is a really interesting time to be on the ESB board.  As chairman designate I look forward to the challenge of developing and supporting the ESB's innovation strategy.  The key strategic challenges I see for the ESB are supporting public policy in delivering an affordable, secure and sustainable electricity service; meeting the challenges of the all-island and all-islands electricity market, particularly the competition we now face in our traditional home market, including from the big UK utilities; delivering a high-quality, cost-efficient electricity network; disruption in our industry from emerging technologies; maintaining the financial strength of ESB; and attracting and retaining the high-calibre people critical for the success of the company into the future.</p><p> It is clear to me that the ESB board is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance.  This reflects both the heritage of the organisation and also the commitment of board colleagues.  As a board, we are never complacent, and that will continue to be my focus as chairman.  I place particular emphasis as chairman on the board's oversight responsibility for strategy and governance, oversight of internal controls and oversight of risk.  In doing this, I see the board as supporting and challenging management, who have the operational responsibility for the business.  I appreciate the trust that is being placed in me and I am determined to live up to that trust.</p><p> As chairman designate of the board of the ESB, I look forward to playing my part in ensuring that the ESB remains a vital facilitator of the economic and social development of Ireland. </p><p>I acknowledge the proud history of the ESB since it was established by the members' predecessors in 1927.  I recognise the very distinguished chairmen of the past, including most recently Lochlann Quinn.  My focus as chairman would be to ensure that Ireland and all of our customers continue to have a safe, secure, sustainable and affordable electricity service.  That is the brief for the role and that is what I would be honoured to do.  I will take any questions.</p></speech>

I am sorry for sounding so formal.  I echo the pride that she has in having been appointed.  I am a firm supporter of the breaking of the glass ceiling in relation to women executives.  It is a wonderful progression that Ms Graham is heading up one of the most important public utilities on the island, and not just in the Republic.  She brings enormous experience as a board member but also from her own background in banking and management, which I am sure will benefit the board and, ultimately, the country.</p> <p>  There is a public perception that the ESB has been one of the success stories of the semi-state sector and that it is a hugely profitable company.  At the same time, we have experienced high consumer charges relative to the rest of Europe.  Does Ms Graham have any views on that?  I appreciate that she points out that the ESB needs to have an asset base in order to develop new technologies and the business, but at the same time the euro in the pocket is what bothers people, and energy prices are particularly high.</p> <p>  Ms Graham touched on the question of renewables.  Does she have any views on how the ESB will progress in that regard?  As she knows, we have a very high dependency - something like 90% - on imported fuel.  Obviously, any alternative to that would be helpful to the economy.  Does Ms Graham have any views on the challenges facing the ESB in terms of the expanding economy and increasing population, which place greater demands on the ESB to provide a service?  While it is not within her direct area, there is local opposition to the expansion of the infrastructure of the service.  I presume Ms Graham will see that as a challenge.  I do not have an answer to it, to be honest.  If on the one hand we are expanding our economy and increasing our population, there is a need on the other to continually upgrade our infrastructure.  However, there appears to be a very strong opposition and - I do not mean to be patronising - a NIMBY syndrome.  It is fine to expand the electricity network and ensure we have safe and secure access to energy in our homes, but if that requires extra infrastructure, I do not want it in my backyard or my area.  Does Ms Graham see that as a challenge to be addressed in the years going forward?</p> <p>  I congratulate Ms Graham on her appointment.  She has a very impressive CV and I have absolute confidence in the fact that she will bring a new dimension to her new job.  I wish her well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.1115" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ellvena Graham" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015111800002#F00400"><p>I will take the last question first on meeting the challenges of the expanding economy.  The Senator is right that we need infrastructure.  There is no doubt.  If one looks at what the country is doing around foreign direct investment, it is a good example.  Foreign companies are coming into Ireland.  Very often they ask how much of our energy is produced from renewable sources.  That is one of the drivers.  If we want to continue to expand our economy, we must demonstrate that we are serious about meeting our decarbonisation and, indeed, climate change targets.  We need the infrastructure.  I am from Northern Ireland, as the members know, and I see businesses North and South and the absolute need to have strong interconnections between North and South.  Businesses in the North in particular need that.  I am a supporter of building good infrastructure.  It is similar to what we did with the roads many years ago here in Ireland.  It is the same type of thing that we are trying to do again.  I understand the opposition to infrastructure because, as the Senator says, a lot of people do not want anything anywhere near them.  However, if we want to progress as a modern economy, we will have to continue to develop and build out our infrastructure.  We will need to keep pushing ahead with our renewables.</p> <p>  The Senator asked about energy prices, which is certainly something everyone has asked me about since I took on the role.  The ESB has reduced the price of electricity in the last two years.  One of the things I thought was the right thing to do was to reduce the price of electricity at the start of the winter.  That allowed customers to benefit when there was high peak usage over the winter months.  However, the cost of electricity is made up of a number of things, as the Senator knows.  It is not just the networks or the fuel; there are a number of different elements affecting the price.  We will continue to work to take down the price of electricity.  In my time on the board, we have looked at the ESB's cost base and reduced it since 2010 by more than &euro;250 million.  The costs are coming down and the cost of electricity is coming down, but at the same time we have to invest in the networks.  We have invested &euro;6 billion there in the last ten years.  We are investing in renewables and bringing wind farms online, with the networks having to be upgraded to accommodate that process.  It is a balancing act, but we are doing our very best to reduce the cost of electricity.</p></speech>

I should have asked Ms Graham whether the ESB is looking at the development of wave energy, which is becoming increasingly important.  From being on a committee of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly which prepared a report on this, I appreciate that wave energy is at a pioneering stage.  However, there has been Government investment in the area.  The west of Ireland has the highest potential for wave energy into the future.  Is the ESB engaging in that area and investing in it, and does Ms Graham have any views?</p></speech>

We are looking at waves and tidal energy and we are investing in those.  The only thing I would say is that it is a long-term rather than a short-term play.</p><p>The earliest one will see anything there could be the next decade rather than the next year.  We are investing in it and we are trialling and testing it.  Those things take a long time to come to fruition.  However, we are investing in it and we are interested in it.  If it works it will be very good because we have plenty of water around us.</p></speech>

Having heard her CV she is undoubtedly amply qualified for the role in the ESB.  I have some specific questions.  At this time of the year we are all conscious that ESB staff members are out working in every type of weather, as they were yesterday in my part of County Limerick.  They are out again this morning.  They e-mail constituency offices to give us updates on wind damage.  This time of the year also brings a fair amount of flooding, particularly in Cork city and Limerick.  Both have hydroelectric power plants, on the Lee and the Shannon, and both are susceptible to flooding.  In the recent past Cork city endured a devastating flood when the Inniscarra reservoir was essentially opened and Cork city was left vulnerable.  Millions of euro worth of damage was done to private and public property and many people are still recovering from that.</p> <p>  Similarly, in Limerick the Shannon flows through Ardnacrusha.  Limerick city is low lying and is very susceptible to tidal flooding.  If there is a perfect storm with the fluvial and tidal flooding and the hydroelectric power plant, it is a very dangerous situation for people who live along the very narrow channel from Limerick city to Ardnacrusha and onto the base of Lough Derg.  Will Ms Graham comment on what the ESB is doing at those two places, in particular, and any other places that have hydroelectric power plants that are dependent on the damming of rivers?  Are there others in the country?  Have flood risk analyses and assessments been carried out?  Neither Cork nor Limerick wishes to have a repeat of what happened in 2008.</p> <p>  The other issue is the ESB's relationship with EirGrid.  Representatives of EirGrid appeared before the committee recently and Ms Graham might have seen the exchanges that took place.  Given her previous commercial role she will have a keen knowledge of the Northern Ireland energy market.  It appears from the evidence the committee received that EirGrid is intent on putting the north-south interconnector through the counties of Cavan, Meath and Monaghan to facilitate an energy deficit in Northern Ireland.  Obviously, the ESB could potentially be a beneficiary of that.  The representatives of EirGrid said clearly to the committee that as far as they were concerned, under the instructions from the Commission for Energy Regulation based on the type of lattice structures that are proposed to be erected, the consumer in the Republic could look forward to a cut in their energy prices.  I am not surprised that Ms Graham raised her eyebrows because pigs will fly before that will happen.  What proposal does the ESB have to cut energy costs as a result of the interconnector being built from Maynooth to County Tyrone?</p> <p>  There is a final matter.  I welcome the ESB's recent commitment to apprentices.  That was hugely welcome.  Down through the years the ESB has been regarded as a great company in which to work.  Indeed, my learned colleague beside me is testament to that, although I am sure he can speak for himself.  It was often a family business, in the sense that fathers, sons and daughters ended up working in the ESB.  Will Ms Graham elaborate on what plans there are for future apprenticeships in the company?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.1120" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ellvena Graham" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015111800002#G00300"><p>The Deputy covered a great deal but I will start with the last question on apprenticeships.  The ESB has a long history of taking in apprentices and developing apprenticeships.  Pat O'Doherty, the chief executive, is chair of the apprenticeship association.  Throughout the recession we had reduced the number slightly.  We were taking approximately 60 apprentices, but that is up again now.  We intend to do that as we have seen the fruits of our investment in apprenticeships.  Often we use our training facilities in Portlaoise.  Apprentices spend a number of weeks there in addition to the training provided by the Government.  We are entirely committed to the apprenticeships.  Pat O'Doherty's personal commitment demonstrates that.  It is one of the success stories of the ESB.  When others had stopped taking on apprenticeships we continued to take them throughout the leaner years and we will take on more of them into the future.  I am fully committed to what we are doing in that area.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to the storms.  Last night was probably the stormiest night we have had, when storm Barney hit us.  This morning there are still approximately 15,000 homes without electricity and a number of them will be in the Deputy's constituency.  The area south of a line from Galway to Dublin was particularly badly hit.  ESB staff unstintingly go out in very difficult weather to keep the electricity supply going and to restore it as quickly as possible.  They are hoping to have it restored to all of those homes by this evening.  I am very proud of the work they do.  It is certainly a 24/7 organisation in that regard.  People must work shifts.  During storm Darwin we took over 200,000 calls from customers about electricity outages, so we work hard.  We have invested in the network.  Some of it can be fixed remotely when there are issues.  In other cases people must go out.  If a tree falls down on a line they must go out to do that work.  Unless the wind picks up again today we hope to have the problem addressed by this evening.</p> <p>  On flooding, I recently went to Cork to see the Lee dams and what had happened in Cork, because I am not particularly familiar with the area.  We have appealed the judgment so I do not wish to say a great deal about it.  I believe we operate the Lee dams, and indeed all of our dams, to the highest international best practice.  That is not to say that we do not continue to improve or to examine what we are doing, but I believe our teams on the night managed that as well as they could in terms of what confronted them.  The dams were over-spilling and had to be safely managed.  We conduct a great deal of analysis.  We have had international expertise helping us with analysis of that and we continue to improve how we manage the dams.  At the same time, however, there is a large amount of water when there are high floods and the dams are only a certain height and size.  I cannot say there will not be another flood in any area in Ireland because of the dams.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the north-south interconnector.  I cannot comment on any assertion that there will be a cut in energy prices but the interconnector is certainly necessary, particularly for the businesses in Northern Ireland.  They were pleased when they heard it is now in planning.  I am not sure which route it will take between the North and the South, as that has yet to be conclusively ironed out.  We need an interconnector and we need to be able to use the electricity north and south.  I am not sure that the ESB will be the biggest beneficiary in Northern Ireland.  We only went into the retail supply market in Northern Ireland last month, so we have to build the business of supplying consumers there.  We have been supplying corporate customers for ten years or more but we only started to supply retail customers in Northern Ireland in October last.</p></speech>

What would she say to the communities in Cavan, Monaghan and Meath who will have this structure erected on top of them?  There has been little or no consultation, or it is meaningless consultation, with EirGrid.  At the same time EirGrid walked away from a similar project in the south east and it is due to walk away from a similar project in the west, telling us there will be local solutions.  I asked another chairperson designate this question so I will put it to Ms Graham as well.  Would she like to live beside a pylon?</p></speech>

I am delighted to see that she speaks with a passion for the ESB.  I believe I heard on the news this morning that approximately 15,000 homes are without supply.  One recognises the good name and reputation of the ESB because most, if not all of those affected will have their electricity restored by this evening.  Although we fall out with the ESB every now and again, most of us have a very high regard for the operations of the ESB.</p><p>Ms Graham spoke about the North-South interconnector and I will not go into detail on that. What are her thoughts on the potential for EU-wide electricity supply?  What are her thoughts on microgeneration and particularly the cost of connections to the national grid?  The cost of connections effectively means that we are dampening down the potential for microgeneration of electricity.</p><p>I am happy that Ms Graham mentioned affordability in her paper.  All of us, as Deputies, come across people who just cannot afford the cost of electricity in their homes.  I ask Ms Graham to talk about the role of the role of the ESB <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the regulator in terms of affordability.</p><p>The next group to appear before the committee is an association set up to represent the owners of electric vehicles.  It is unfortunate that the ESB will charge for electric vehicles.  Is there any potential to re-examine that decision?</p><p>What is Ms Graham's view on the relationship between ESB management and the group of unions in the company?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.1130" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ellvena Graham" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015111800002#H00500"><p>There is a lot in that.  I will take the last one first.  I believe ESB management and unions have a constructive relationship.  The Deputy will be aware that we have four worker-directors on our board.  They make a good solid contribution to the board.  I believe they have the good of the company at heart.  The ESB has come on a long journey and once one talks about taking costs out of an organisation, naturally there is a tension there.  However, I think it has been managed as well as it could have been.  The relationship seems to be as open as it could be and I believe both parties are working constructively.  I hope that continues throughout my tenure on the board because as we look to the future it is incredibly important that we continue to work well with the unions.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned electric vehicles.  The ESB has invested significantly and substantially in installing a charging network throughout the country.  There are a number of fast charging points and almost 1,000 standard charging points throughout Ireland, as well as, obviously, the opportunity to charge a car at home.  Recent press reports referred to a monthly charge of &euro;16.99 for people who wanted to use charging points on the motorway, etc.  Up to now it has been free.  We need to run it as a commercial operation and the management is considering a range of options.  Some customers may never what to do that and just continue to charge overnight at home.  They may want to have an option of using one of the public chargers on an emergency basis and paying for that.  There are a range of options and I do not believe we have seen the full story yet.  The ESB needs to run it as a commercial operation.  Those charges will not apply until April 2016, but a range of tariffs will come out between now and then.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about EU-wide electricity.  We no longer operate as an island, but as a group of islands with Great Britain.  We have interconnectors between North and South and between east and west, across into Britain.  Do I envisage having interconnectors into France?  Yes, I am sure that will happen.  Having EU-wide electricity will take time.  The important thing for us is to have security of supply.  That is what the Government is looking for and what ESB is working towards.  That is why we have a diverse mix in our portfolio, incorporating wind, gas, water and whatever else.  It is important for us to look at the newer technologies as well, which is why we are looking at things such as wave technology and solar.  We certainly need to look at energy in an EU context, but we also need to look at it from an Irish perspective and what we are doing to meet our targets and to have a secure supply here in Ireland.</p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about microgeneration and the cost of connections.  If I understand his question, he was asking about smaller operators trying to get on to the grid, very often in remote areas.  There is an additional cost for a person at the end of a line.  Ireland is rather peculiar in that we have double the network that one might have in other places with fewer houses on it.  At the end of every road or lane there is a house and therefore the network has to cover all of that.  We try to make it as competitive and cost-effective as we can.  I am sure not everybody is happy with the price.  That is about the height of it.</p></speech>

Northern Ireland seems to encourage people to set up microgeneration and connect to the grid.  I know of a chicken farmer in Monaghan, an area where with many poultry units.  He spoke to other chicken farmers about plans to convert chicken droppings into electricity.  He invested a lot of money in it but the killing point was the cost of connection to the grid.  I think he has worked through it and hopefully has resolved that, but it was almost a tipping point.  All of his good work might have fallen because of the cost of connecting to the grid.  It seems to be much easier and certainly not as expensive in Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

Yesterday I was in Stormont for another reason.  I know a number of the smaller producers are coming to Stormont because they are not happy with what is going on in terms of subsidies and connections.  So I am not sure they are entirely happy either.  I am sorry, but I do not actually know the cost difference between North and South.</p></speech>

I am not the learned friend of my colleague here, but I spent in excess of 30 years in the ESB.  The organisation has come a long way.  In my young days it was a success to get somebody to sign up to take electricity supply for nothing - people for generations had done without electricity and they did not want it.</p><p>We have come a long way.  I would also like to acknowledge the reintroduction of the ESB apprenticeship scheme.  I am familiar with business people who started out as apprentices in the ESB and are now, as a result of the experience they gained in that regard, running successful businesses in various parts of this country and the world.  The ESB has been a great employer.  During the weather conditions which we experienced last night and the night before, many of my former colleagues were out risking their lives working on poles of up to 35 ft. high while trying to reconnect electricity supplies.  </p><p> The North-South interconnector project is a huge problem for the communities of Meath, Monaghan and, in particular, Cavan.  I am sure Ms Graham is aware that it is proposed to replace the existing 275kV North-South interconnector with a 440kV interconnector.  I do not expect Ms Graham to be able to respond to my question but perhaps she would put to the board the question of whether the existing infrastructure can be used to increase the power or if it would be possible to run a 220kV interconnector underground in parallel with the existing one, such that nothing would change in terms of the current overhead infrastructure.  I would like to know the cost of running an overhead 440kV interconnector in place of the existing one.  In my humble opinion, and based on my little knowledge of this area, it is possible to run an underground 220kV interconnector in parallel with the current infrastructure and thus satisfy demand.  I realise, perhaps more than others, the importance of interconnection in times of demand but I would like to know if what I have proposed is possible and the likely cost in that regard.  Many communities and parishes in Cavan-Monaghan and Meath are divided on this issue.  Farming families are being compensated for allowing these pylons on their land and this is leading to division among families.  Perhaps Ms Graham would put that proposal to the board and communicate with the committee as soon as possible on whether it is feasible.  I wish Ms Graham every success.</p></speech>

Like other Deputies and Senators, I would like to see the ESB drive on its apprenticeship programme.  For far too long, we have neglected apprenticeships in this country.  I would ask Ms Graham to pursue this programme and, where possible, to increase numbers in that regard.</p> <p>  I read in the media recently that the ESB subsidises wind energy to the tune of approximately &euro;100 million.  Is that correct and what is Ms Graham's view in that regard?  In regard to the control of water, in respect of which Deputy O'Donovan spoke about the River Lee, there is a major problem on the River Shannon in that because the gates are not being opened, houses are at risk of being flooded.  Why does the ESB not row-in with the farming organisations and so on to ensure a plan is drawn up to clean the river?  In many cases, the reason for the flooding is pollution in the river.  Gates are not being opened because it is not possible, owing to silt levels, to hold back the river.  I would welcome Ms Graham's views on that matter.</p> <p>  I understand five nuclear plants are to be built in the UK.  Does Ms Graham foresee a day when Ireland will be able to import electricity at a cheaper cost than it can produce it?  I also understand that the existing ESB generator can only handle 50% of electricity generated by wind and that there is pressure on the ESB to increase this to 75%.  The cost of upgrading the generator is estimated to be &euro;800 million.  I know that the ESB is opposed to this proposal and that its hand is being forced in this regard.  I understand the ESB has been asked to review the proposal and report back to the regulator within the next 18 months.  What is Ms Graham's view on that?  Is the ESB, in terms of subsidisation and upgrade of the generation system, being forced to spend money badly?</p></speech>

The Deputy asked if it might be cheaper in the future to import electricity from the UK.  He also mentioned that the UK are building five new nuclear plants.  I was not aware of that.  Nuclear energy is cheaper.  In terms of the interconnectors, we could currently be importing nuclear energy through our interconnector because we sometimes import electricity through that interconnector from Britain.  There is no doubt but that nuclear power will always be cheaper than that which we are currently generating.  It is against the law to build nuclear plants here, so I do not think it is likely we will be doing that.</p></speech>

I am asking if Ms Graham foresees a day when, despite our having put in place additional infrastructure, it will be cheaper for us import electricity than to produce it here?  Electricity prices here are the third highest in Europe.  Businesses here are struggling to be competitive because of the cost of electricity.</p></speech>

I refer the Deputy to what I said earlier in terms of our wanting to have our own secure supply of electricity as an island.  To do that, we have to have our own generation capacity.  We also have to have that if we want to meet our renewable targets.  Currently, approximately 10% or 11% of ESB's electricity is generated from renewables.  Our target is to generate 25% of our electricity from renewables by 2025.  The Government has set a target of 40% of electricity for Ireland as a whole to be generated from renewables by 2020.</p><p>The ESB is playing its part in that.  Our target as a company, and what we have signed up to, is to have 25% of our generation from renewables by 2025.</p></speech>

With the rock-off on the generation, we cannot handle any more than 50%.  There is pressure on the ESB at the moment to bring that higher in order to take more of it when there is a windy day or night.  Is it not true to say that an &euro;800 million investment on the generation side is needed to handle that capacity?</p></speech>

In order to go to that level we would need to find some way to store the capacity that is created, because very often the wind blows at night when there is an over-supply.  We would have to find some way to store that and use it when we need it at peak times.  It is a complex question and many things would have to be looked at before anybody would invest &euro;800 million in a network.</p></speech>

I apologise for being late, but I saw most of the presentation on the monitor.  Much of my focus at the moment is on supply and also diversity of supply.  In County Meath there is a proposal for an industrial wind farm, but we are also on the route of the North-South interconnector.  There is a lot of upset in that regard.  I accept it is not necessarily Ms Graham&rsquo;s area.  I have done much research in the past two and a half years in particular for the oral hearing on the proposed wind farm.  There is disappointingly little focus on solar energy or any other type of energy for the 2020 targets.  All of the focus seems to be on wind.  What is Ms Graham&rsquo;s view on the future of solar energy, bio-energy or other alternatives in terms of the energy supply for the ESB?</p> <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice said the ESB needs to find a way to store energy that has been wasted.  Is research under way at the moment on how to store energy, for example, from wind turbines when the wind blows at night and energy is not needed?</p> <p>  There is a great debate at the moment on renewable energy.  Proposals have been put forward for the conversion of Moneypoint, which uses coal, to sustainable biomass.  It has been suggested that such a change would immediately allow us to achieve our 2020 targets, reduce emissions by 85% and solve many problems in terms of wind turbines and pylons.  What is Ms Graham&rsquo;s view on the matter?  I wish her well in her new position.</p></speech>

People in poorer areas request that meters be installed and they want to have a card.  Is it intended to continue that process or has it come to an end?</p> <p>  Sometimes the fee for reconnection following a disconnection is excessive.  Some people struggle in that regard if they move into a new home and they have to reconnect the electricity supply.  There is an awful rigmarole attached.  Is there flexibility in that regard?  I invite Ms Graham to tell us about the process.</p> <p>  The cost of electricity never seems to come down, in spite of the fluctuations in fuel prices.  It always lags well behind and the benefit is never passed on to customers.  Certainly, that is the impression most people have - that when fuel prices come down the electricity prices do not come down correspondingly.</p> <p>  I assume the ESB is in the market in terms of the roll-out of electric cars.  Stations need to be set up.  Does Ms Graham see potential for the ESB to expand into that area?</p></speech>

I will come back to the questions from Deputy Ellis.  The first question related to diversity of supply.  Deputy McEntee is dead right; everybody does talk about renewables when they talk about decarbonisation.  The ESB is also very interested in solar energy.  We have signed a deal with Kingspan, another Irish company, to put solar panels onto roofs.  In Northern Ireland there is much more of an uptake at the moment because of the subsidies for solar energy there compared to in the Republic.  That is something to which we are very committed.  Solar energy makes up a small percentage of energy generated at the moment.  Wind is a number of years ahead in terms of capacity and the sheer engineering and development of solar energy.</p> <p>  Reference was also made to biomass and Moneypoint.  There is much talk about the future of Moneypoint.  It is our largest station.  It is located in the west and electricity is generated from coal.  We have spent almost &euro;300 million on trying to make Moneypoint cleaner, but it is still using coal.  If we were to convert it to biomass, which I have heard discussed a number of times, first, there is a significant cost attached to such a conversion and, second-----</p></speech>

A similar plant in the UK has been converted from coal to biomass and it cost in the order of &pound;300 million or &pound;400 million.  The other thing about biomass is that to get enough biomass to feed Moneypoint, one would end up having to import a significant amount of biomass.  That brings with it its own carbon footprint when one takes into account transport by boat from the United States or wherever else.  It is not possible to give a straightforward answer and to say we will convert Moneypoint to biomass but it is certainly something we keep under review.  Coal is very cheap at the moment so it is helping to keep the cost of electricity down for the Irish consumer.  There is no easy answer.  It is something we continue to examine.  I am keen for the ESB to retain a focus on diversity.  We have developed wind energy.  We will have to continue with some fossil fuels for the short term but we must have a nice diverse portfolio rather than having all our eggs in the one basket.  There is not an easy answer to that one.</p></speech>

I do not know what would happen, as that would be a policy decision.  It would be hard to say what the cost would be, but at the moment it could cost money just to convert the plant, and we would have to pay to import biomass, so there would be an additional cost.  That said, we are paying to import coal as well, but it is important not to lose sight of those two things.</p> <p>  Deputy Ellis asked me about pay-as-you-go meters.  We have 60,000 of those at the moment and we do not have any plans of which I am aware to stop having them.  We find they are useful.  The Deputy asked about disconnections.</p><p>Disconnecting somebody is always a last resort.  If the customer engages with the ESB, the ESB will not disconnect them.  The ESB wants to engage with customers, as it is a hassle to disconnect and then have to reconnect again, and nobody wants to go through that.  If a customer engages meaningfully with the ESB then disconnection would be absolutely the last resort.</p></speech>

At the moment there is a good grant of &euro;5,000 for buying an electric vehicle, so there are a number of incentives.

We are all more conscious of the benefits of electric vehicles, having recently engaged with the Volkswagen Group on incorrect emissions readings.</p><p>On behalf of the joint committee, I welcome Mr. Frank Barr, Mr. Paddy Carroll, Mr. Joe McCarthy and Mr. Guillaume S&eacute;guin of the Irish EV Owners Association.  I draw their attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l)</i>of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons, or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I wish to advise also that any submission or opening statements witnesses have made to the committee may be published on the committee website after the meeting.  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or persons outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I now invite Mr. Paddy Carroll to make the association's opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-18a.1191" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paddy Carroll" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015111800002#M00200"><p>The Irish EV Owners Association was formed in March 2015 and is the first and only association of this kind in Ireland.  At present, there are 1,100 pure electric cars in Ireland, that is, 1,100 have been introduced in the five-year period since 2011.  In the same five-year period, Norway and the Netherlands have introduced 66,000 and 60,000, respectively.  To us, the reason this is the case is very simple, that is, the Governments of these countries have given huge incentives to the electric car buyer.  There are incentives in Ireland, which include a &euro;5,000 Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, grant.  Moreover, the cars are exempt from VRT, there is a free ESB ecar home charger and there is free use of the ESB charging network.  Ireland's target, under the renewable energy supply directive, is to ensure that 10% of its transport energy comes from renewable sources by 2020.  This would mean 200,000 electric vehicles and to reach the target, we believe more incentives from the Government are needed.</p> <p>  The Irish EV Owners Association proposes to the joint committee a plan of incentives to have in place for five years only, starting in 2016.  First, a national blanket policy should be introduced in cities and towns to allow electric vehicles free access to bus lanes, to have no charges on toll roads and free parking while charging at the chargers in each county, as well as at the Luas and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann stations.  To implement this, we recommend a statutory instrument.  Second, all county councils should be instructed to have painted the parking spaces at the chargers.  A statutory instrument already is in place, No. 330 of 2014, and while some local authorities have done this, for example, Wexford, Limerick, Wicklow and Tipperary, some are quite resistant.  ESB ecars has installed an impressive infrastructure of chargers in towns and cities but to be effective, the parking spaces at the chargers must be painted.  Third, all county councils should be instructed to implement SI 325 of 2014 to the effect that the charging space is for electric vehicles only.  An inability to charge one's vehicle because a non-electric car is blocking the charger makes driving an electric vehicle unviable and totally frustrating.  It can be a huge problem in rural towns where there is only one charger in the town.</p> <p>  Fourth, an SEAI grant of &euro;1,000 should be introduced for points of interest, which have been listed in the submission, towards the purchase and installation of an electric vehicle charger on their premises.  Fifth, an SEAI grant of &euro;1,000 should be introduced for employers to install a charger for motorists to charge their vehicles at work.  Sixth, a charger provider should be given &euro;2 million each year for five years to expand the fast charge point infrastructure.  The network in Ireland already is very good thanks to ESB ecars and a European Union grant under the TEN-T programme.  We believe some routes and areas still are poorly catered for and for example, the Wild Atlantic Way needs a fast charge point every 120 km along the route.  Seventh, the A0 tax band should be reduced to being free.  Our neighbours in Northern Ireland automatically have free road tax when they purchase an electric car and zero emissions should lead to zero tax.  Eighth, an SEAI grant of &euro;1,200 should be introduced towards the purchase and installation of a solar photovoltaic, pv system in one's house, which then would encourage those people to buy an electric car.  Ninth, there should be a zero rate for benefit-in- kind tax applicable to companies and employees who drive electric vehicles.  Tenth, the building regulations should be amended for new homes to facilitate the installation of a 7 kW charge point in the initial build.  Eleventh, there should be an obligation for any new factories or commercial buildings with internal or external car parks to include dedicated charging spaces proportionately, say, two per 100 spaces.  Twelfth, as ESB ecars will start charging for the use of infrastructure and electricity in January 2016, can members, in partnership with the ESB, not subsidise this cost for a period of five years?  Thirteenth, the &euro;5,000 SEAI grant should be continued for the next five years and fourteenth, public education and promotion and Government advertising are needed in this area.</p> <p>  The benefits of electric cars are twofold for Ireland, both economic and environmental.  If Ireland is to reach its mandated emissions targets for CO2, electric cars must play a significant part.  Let us reach our targets as it can be done by incentives; is f&eacute;idir linn.  Finally, EV car sales in Cork have increased by 205% in 2015 to date over the 2014 rate because of incentives given.  The Drive4Zero programme, spearheaded by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, gave incentives that included free parking while charging, free tolls at Fermoy, incentives to companies, 0% finance at dealers, chargers installed in multi-storey car parks etc.  Consequently, incentives work.</p></speech>

Obviously, the association has presented a comprehensive wish list and it is good it is clearly outlined.  Before handing over to Deputy Dooley, can I ask whether there is any particular priority?  Are there key items in that wish list that could make for rapid change?  Second, the joint committee has just interviewed the chair-designate of the ESB on her appointment as chair of the board.  The witnesses may be aware the electric car issue came up in the course of that meeting with regard to the charges that are being introduced in January for new applicants and in April for those who already had electric cars.  Can Mr. Carroll comment on that point and on the charges?  Does the association perceive this to be a setback?  Mr. Carroll mentioned the incentives and my impression, as I read down through them, was that many of them are the responsibility of local authorities.  Mr. Carroll mentioned free toll charges in Cork and was that done with the local authority?  Mr. Carroll might explain how that was done.  I invite him to respond to these points at the outset, after which I will hand over to members.</p></speech>

We met the ESB last Monday and it has stated its intention to bring out other packages.  We have been urging our points of view as to what type of packages there should be on the ESB.</p><p>It is going to look at that issue and meet us again.  Therefore, it is in the pipeline, but it is a setback at this stage when we are trying to promote EV.  However, it is a company that must make money and the infrastructure must be paid for.  We do not mind paying for it, but it must be reasonable and help to promote EV, not take six steps backwards.</p><p> On Nos. 2 and 3, it involves the county councils, some of which are very pro-EV.  I have a list of county councils that will allow us free parking while we are charging our vehicles, while others have stated we have to pay for parking.  Therefore, there is no joined-up thinking.  It does not cost anybody any money, not even county councils.  The ESB will paint the charging bays for ecars free of charge.  Dublin City Council is one of the worst in this regard.  It is only in the past month or so that it has given permission for some spaces to be painted.  Dublin is an EV-unfriendly city.  I was here two weeks ago and had to drive around to find a charger.  The committee could instruct it to implement the statutory instruments in place which are not being implemented.</p></speech>

If people have a journey they want to make and what we prefer to call the charger is blocked, that is end of the journey until somebody decides to move his or her car, which could take a day or two.  The incentives mentioned look like a huge wish list, but they have worked in Norway which is not a country in which it is very conducive to use electric cars because the temperatures are so low and the distance one can travel in an electric car is seriously reduced.</p></speech>

It was very impressive, but somebody said to me afterwards that the price of an ordinary car in Norway was huge compared to that in Ireland.  I did not have that information at the time.  Is VRT taken off?  Somebody mentioned a price of &euro;50,000 or &euro;60,000 for a car.</p></speech>

While I do not have an electric vehicle, I certainly think its use is something we should be supporting through policy.  Electric vehicles will not suit everybody, but they will suit many.  If we are to make a meaningful impact in addressing climate change, they will be a very significant component of the shift.</p> <p>  I agree with nearly everything Mr. Carroll said.  I am working on a policy document that will include many of recommendations sought by the delegates.  There are some issues in the use of bus lanes.  Bus lanes in Ireland generally are not of a standard that they can take additional vehicles; therefore, there are some constraints and concerns.  I recognise that this happens in some countries, that they have high occupancy vehicle lanes, to which cars carrying more than two or three passengers have privileged access.  In that context, we could look at electric vehicles being allowed to use them.  The delegates are pushing an open door with me.  I completely support what they are doing.  </p> <p>  The long-term solution is adopting a whole-of-government approach incorporating the local authorities.  It must be co-ordinated by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in consultation with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  We cannot adopt an approach that is not uniform.  If somebody leaves Kildare to drive into the city, he or she must have the same expectations in terms of signage.  Road signage is not provided on county by county basis.  There is a uniform approach to the mapping system in terms of road signage.  That is the only way we can address this issue adequately.  </p> <p>  I suggest a section of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport act as lead and pull all other Departments into line in order that somebody purchasing an electric vehicle would have a memorandum of understanding on what was available and what he or she was going to receive because it is a considerable step for somebody to take.  As Mr. Barr said, if somebody is away from his or her normal place of residence or destination, he or she must be assured that he or will will have access to a charging point.  Those of us who drive diesel or petrol cars would not dream of heading somewhere if we knew we would not be able to top up our fuel.  That is the reality.  We must provide the infrastructure first.  Nobody is suggesting a person travel to a location where there are no roads and that if enough people buy cars, the roads will be provided.  It does not work like that; one needs the investment first.  </p> <p>  I do not for accept one minute that the ESB should change its charging regime.  We are so far behind in reaching our target that anything that would act as a disincentive should not be considered.  If it is already a disincentive for those who have already converted their vehicles, what must it be like for the people we are trying to attract?  There is a huge job of work to be done that involves considerable investment in infrastructure, a uniform roll-out of services and a very strong marketing campaign.  We also need a carrot approach.  People need to know that for the next five or ten years, there would be a considerable saving to them.  Sadly, they are not of a mind in large numbers to do things because it would be good for the environment.  They will do it if it benefits them financially; therefore, we have to make the financial incentives adequate and appropriate.  </p> <p>  Another issue was not addressed by Mr. Carroll; it concerns the public bus network.  I know that the technology is at an early stage, but where the State invests in public infrastructure and public transport, including buses, through Transport Ireland, we must look at investing in the use of the appropriate technology.  As the delegates know better than I do, it is only when there is critical mass that companies actually start to invest more in the technology available.  </p> <p>  I do not really have questions.  I thank the delegates for the presentation and wish them well in their continued efforts in this regard.</p></speech>

Like the previous speaker, I agree that there is a need for charging points in all places.  Mr. Carroll referred to Cork.  Did the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine not have points made available in all parts of Cork and not get the toll operators to agree not to charge tolls to EV car users?  Will Mr. Carroll elaborate on that point?  </p> <p>  How much does a car that can carry two adults and three children cost when one does not have to pay VRT?  How much does a car cost when one has claimed back all of the money?</p></speech>

In fairness to the ESB, I do not know if the Government subsidises this process but the company cannot just give electricity to everyone willy-nilly.  The company needs to get reimbursement from somewhere, whether that is an EU fund or one from the Government.  I understand that the witnesses are trying to get more people to use these vehicles.  It is a good idea for in and around cities but, as the previous speaker stated and being honest, the bus lanes throughout the country are not sufficiently well designed to cater for taxis and buses, let alone allowing a few cars to use them as well.  That would not work.</p> <p>  I agree with some of the other points.  The witnesses mentioned the Wild Atlantic Way and there is no problem with having a fast charger on it.  The route is probably 350 km from here.  I know there are chargers in Castlebar, Galway and other towns.  I have even seen them in smaller towns like Castlerea.  I agree that councils need to take a full approach.  There was an argument that this committee should invoke a statutory instrument on to councils; we can make a recommendation but we cannot just ring up a council and tell it to do something.  Will the witnesses elaborate on what was done in Cork that can be rolled out in other counties?</p></speech>

Other ideas include an exemption on charges on toll roads and free parking while charging.  The statutory instrument does not refer to it as a parking space but rather as a recharging bay.  It is a bay that I would arrive at in order to recharge my car.  We feel that should be free.  The authorities in Limerick city have said that parking must be paid for but those in Waterford tell us that an electric vehicle can be parked free of charge at any one of the public designated charging bays.  There is no joined-up thinking and instead there is total inconsistency.  If I am going from one county to the next, I might take a chance but I could be ticketed.  Maybe I will not be ticketed.</p></speech>

Our concern is the form which the charges take now.

In Dublin, if one is using a slow charger and paying &euro;2.90 per hour as well as the electricity charge, why would one drive an electric car?</p></speech>

That is the first model of the car.  The second model uses a heat pump, so it is a little more efficient.  The cars are getting better all the time.  The car coming next year will have a battery that is 25% bigger so one will be able to go further.  It is improving.

There is a great opportunity for Ireland, although it is still in its infancy.  In the association, we have seen drivers coming from different countries and asking for information about the infrastructure in Ireland.  One of our members has driven from Cork to Holland and back in his electric car.  The biggest attraction we have in Ireland is the Wild Atlantic Way.  Some of us would like to do the Wild Atlantic Way in electric vehicles but the west coast has the weakest infrastructure.  Hence the proposal that some sort of grant be given to hotels, guest houses and points of interest along that route.  That is so drivers can have a meal or stay overnight while charging the vehicle before enjoying that fantastic coast.</p></speech>

It is very disappointing to hear that there are only 1,100 electric cars in Ireland.  I always believed electric cars would take off.  I know many have said it was down to the oil companies holding them back.  Whether that is true or false is another story.  I am not convinced of it myself.</p> <p>  One of the things that might deter someone from getting an electric car is the time it takes to charge.  The position and number of chargers with such a small number of electric cars in the country is an issue.  It is not easy to get the chargers throughout the country in the way that drivers would require.  It would mean going to the local authorities and making the argument.  It probably will be difficult but not impossible.  I know there is one at Glasnevin in a bay.  People do not seem to park in it from what I can see.</p> <p>  I would have thought solar energy would have been used more in the cars themselves or even in buses where there would be more scope, or in the transport industry.  I would have thought there would have been some kind of self-charging mechanism on the cars without having to go to a charger.  Maybe technology has not reached that point.  I am not too sure.</p></speech>

They seem very reliable.  It did happen occasionally, when the infrastructure was not as good as it is now, that a driver might arrive at a charging station and find it was just not working.  Nissan was providing a free low-loading service to the next charging bay.  It is like running out of petrol in the middle of nowhere.  There is nothing the driver can do.</p></speech>

If I am going from A to B, I have to plan my journey according to where all the chargers are.  I have to give myself extra time to stop and charge.  The style of driving people are used to with petrol, where they just get in the car and go, changes.  That is the decision people make when they buy the cars.  They know that is down the road for them.</p> <p>  I have driven a Nissan Leaf in 2015 and 2014 in all 32 counties in Ireland.  I have done that using only the fast chargers.  I was using it as a kind of holiday and doing a photographic competition as part of a rally we have for electric cars, to get our owners out and about looking at the countryside using their cars.  I got around with no trouble at all.  It was a perfect car to drive.  Of course, I am retired and have time.</p></speech>

I know electric cars make sense for the environment and for people's health.  Do the witnesses find it makes a difference to the quality of air and so on inside the car?

It is becoming much easier.  Every time we stop for a charge we get asked to talk about the car.  We get the usual questions of how far it can go, how much it costs and how long it takes to charge.  There is definitely an interest there, but there is also a huge big fear.  It is like the fear the Deputy mentioned a minute ago.  What does one do if one gets stuck down the country?  It has happened to me a couple of times but I have been rescued.  The Nissan service rescued me a couple of times.  I never ran out of power because there were not enough chargers around the place.  It was because the chargers were not working.</p><p>There have been other occasions when my car has been slowed down because I cannot get a charge due to being blocked from the charger.</p></speech>

That is a big issue in terms of selling this concept to people.  Would snow conditions present a problem for electric vehicles?</p></speech>

One would not have a problem starting the car, which one may have with a petrol car.  The issue of the car sliding on the road in such conditions would be pretty much the same as for petrol cars.  The range in an electric car would drop in colder conditions but I do not think one would have a problem with the car's performance in trying to start the car.  Norway has proved that.  There are 66,000 electric cars in use there and they do not have seem to have a problem in those conditions.</p></speech>

When I saw this agenda item, not having at that time received a copy the presentation, I was intrigued because I do not believe we have ever had representatives of a petrol or diesel car owner's association appear before the committee.

We set up the association in March 2015 because we wanted to be able to reach people, such as the members of this committee and the stakeholders.  We meet with ESB ecars when we request a meeting.  Our association is a small acorn that has been planted and, hopefully, our membership will grow and I believe it will.  We have a constitution, we held an annual general meeting and we have a website,<i>irishevowners.ie</i>, and a Facebook page.  We hold events for our members.  We went on a tour to Turlough Hill and we visited the eco-village in Cloughjordan and we had 15 electric cars down there.  We had a photographic rally that ran from March up to the end of October where members submitted photographs they had taken of monuments, having travelled to different counties.  Those travelling in 18 electric vehicles participated in it.  We have a logo and membership cards.  We are like a car club.</p></speech>

A great deal of work is being done internationally on improving batteries.  If battery technology takes a step change for the better, would the owners have to pay the full cost of the new battery set that needs to go into a vehicle?  In other words, if I have a petrol or diesel engine car, the technology is changing but they are gradual changes and I will not have to change the car engine.</p></speech>

My car has 122,000 km on the clock and I have lost perhaps 10% capacity, which I do not think is bad for a car with that mileage.  If I were to lose another 10% capacity, I have the option of paying &euro;6,000 for a new battery and that would be like getting a brand new card.  There is practically no servicing required on an electric car.  I had my national car test two weeks ago and the breaks have never been adjusted or changed; they are still operating at 96% efficiency because the car has regenerative breaks.  The technology of the cars is very good.  The body and motor of the car will probably last, it is only the battery that one might need to change.  I could maintain the current range by changing the battery.  I do not know if that answers the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

The engine in the newer model has improved but I have not had to replace the engine with the newer model engine.  It would not be financially beneficial for me to do so.  Some &euro;6,000 is a good deal of money to pay for an engine or a battery.  If battery technology is taking a major leap forward, and I anticipate it will, because there is a huge investment in it currently, many electric vehicle owners will face that dilemma.</p></speech>

In Ireland, we generally have a very good climate; it is never too hot or too cold and realistically the battery will last for life of the car.  I would not worry too much about that.  While my colleague said he had lost a small amount of capacity, realistically, the battery will last for the life of the car.  For people who are anxious about the battery capacity, some manufacturers, such as Nissan in the UK or Renault in Ireland, lease batteries and in such cases, the car owner does not own the battery.  One pays &euro;50, &euro;60 or &euro;70 per month for the facility and one has a lease on only the battery but one owns the car.  It lowers the price of the car when one goes to a dealership and it can provide reassurance for a person who has such an anxiety.</p></speech>

If I arrive in a town and I do not know whether there is a charger in it, I can press a button and it will search for chargers near the current location and they will all come up on the system.</p></speech>

ESB ecars send it to Nissan and other car manufacturers every so often.  I do not know how often.  I have an app on my phone and on pressing a button, it will bring up a map of Ireland with the location of all the chargers.  The ESB is working behind the scenes such that the technology in the charger is talking to a back office and that will happen every 15 minutes.  Therefore, the systems will communicate in terms of whether the charger is working and the map will be updated.  ESB is working on that technology to have the information available in real time.  Currently, if I arrive at a charger and the charger is not working, I ring the ESB ecars telephone number and it starts the ball rolling to get it fixed, but it is going to be able to detect that a charger is working.  That would be much better for me in that I would know that charger is not working and I would travel to the charger in the next town.</p></speech>

The meeting has been very enlightening for members.  The association laid out its wish list, which the joint committee will consider, and we will ascertain whether we can play a role in this area.  Given that the proceedings will be published in the Official Report, the mere presence of the witnesses will, I hope, lead to a spike in membership of the Irish EV Owners' Association.  As has been noted, the enthusiasm shown by the witnesses in pioneering and promoting electric vehicles is to be welcomed.</p></speech>
