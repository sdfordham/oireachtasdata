At today's meeting we will hear presentations from the Marine Institute, the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  From the Marine Institute we have Dr. Paul Connolly; from Bord Iascaigh Mhara we have Mr. Jason Whooley, chief executive, Mr. Michael Keatinge, fisheries development manager and Mr. Donal Maguire, aquaculture development manager; from the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority we have Mr. Miche&aacute;l O'Mahony, Mr. Andrew Kinneen and Ms Susan Steele; and from &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta we have Mr. Stiof&aacute;n &Oacute; C&uacute;l&aacute;in, chief executive, and Mr. S&eacute;amus Mac Eochaidh, enterprise and employment manager.  I thank them all for travelling here.  We look forward to hearing their views on the development of coastal and island communities.</p><p>  The sub-committee was established to focus on the socioeconomic situation of these communities and on promoting sustainable industries.  The main industries identified by the sub-committee are aquaculture, island and coastal fisheries, inshore fisheries, especially sea angling, and tourism.  We have departed from the norm.  Since the sub-committee tends to be a smaller group, we can fit all the witnesses across the front and this seems to be more conducive to better dialogue.</p><p>  Before we continue I draw the attention of the witnesses to the matter of privilege.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  We have no preference for who speaks first but we will proceed in the order that the witnesses are seated, if it is agreeable to everyone.  I call on Dr. Connolly from the Marine Institute to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-30a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Paul Connolly" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AG32013043000003#B00500"><p>I thank the committee for inviting me today.  I have prepared some slides to go with my opening statement from the Marine Institute.  The ocean economy is very important to island communities and it is broad and diverse.  I will focus on the work we do at the Marine Institute to provide scientific advice on the sustainable exploitation of the marine fisheries resource.</p><p>  The seafood sector in Europe is big business.  It employes 141,000 people and has a fleet of 85,000 vessels.  The catch sector is worth approximately &euro;7.7 billion.  One important point about this industry is that it is centred on the coastal communities of Europe.  We can get a picture of the importance of the industry if we consider its value.  It is up there between Coca-Cola and Google.  More important, it is focused on coastal communities.</p><p>  The science that supports this industry is important as well.  We have data collection in Europe that is worth &euro;57 million annually, and approximately &euro;190 million is spent annually on fisheries research throughout Europe.  There is a large research vessel fleet, and many scientists and laboratories work on the bedrock of the seafood industry, the fisheries resource.  Another important point about the seafood industry and the fisheries resource is the vast demand for seafood, and that demand is growing.</p> <p> The waters around Ireland are some of the most productive fishing grounds in the world.  Fleets from Ireland, France, Spain and the UK are fishing in the waters around Ireland.  The diagram shows the various fleets operating in the waters around Ireland.  I draw the committee's attention to the Irish Sea and the concentration of green spots near Dundalk Bay, the nephrops fishing grounds.  They are really important fishing grounds for the Irish fleet operating out of Howth, Skerries and right up to Clogherhead.  An analysis of the data from the vessels gives an indication of where the important fishing grounds are located.  It is important to manage these fishing grounds and to get a handle on the size of the stock and to give advice on what can be taken out of that stock if we are to exploit our stocks sustainably.</p><p> In terms of giving scientific advice on our resource, the Marine Institute produces two annual publications.  The first is the stock book, an annual review of fish stocks, which gives scientific advice on the resources taken from the waters around Ireland.  It is an international fishery and 1 million tonnes of fish are taken annually from that area, worth about &euro;1 billion.  Of that, Ireland takes about 246,000 tonnes worth &euro;209 million.  This is a very important part of the economies of coastal communities in Ireland.</p><p> The main species are the mackerel, worth &euro;72 million, horse mackerel, worth &euro;33 million, and prawns, worth &euro;33 million.  With our colleagues in BIM we also produce shellfish stocks and fisheries review which looks at more inshore stocks that are not party to the Common Fisheries Policy.  These are important resources.  Crab is worth &euro;12.8 million, scallop is worth &euro;11.6 million, and lobster is worth &euro;6.6 million.  Producing scientific advice on all these stocks is important to ensure their sustainable exploitation.  The policy landscape in which fisheries operate is very important.  Increasingly, the policy landscape is changing.  There is the EU maritime policy, the Atlantic strategy, Marine Knowledge 2020, Horizon 2020, the European Marine and Fisheries Fund, and Natura 2000.  There is no more environmental legislation that has impacted fisheries, particularly inshore fisheries, than Natura 2000.  Given the sensitive habitats around our coasts, it is important to protect them and develop fisheries management plans that recognise these sensitive areas.  Working with industry is important in developing these plans.</p><p> The marine strategy framework directive is new environmental legislation that will impact on fisheries.  The concept of maximum sustainable yield has come in recently.  This will ensure stocks are exploited while maintaining their sustainability.  Reform of the Common Fisheries Policy is taking place.  A new data collection framework is coming on stream and a new ecosystem approach is being enshrined in the Common Fisheries Policy, all of which are important in terms of framing inshore and CFP fisheries into the future.</p><p> The last slide deals with Ireland as an island nation.  Ireland has a sea to land ratio of 10:1.  In the past our island status, being on the periphery of Europe, was seen as negative.  In Harnessing our Ocean Wealth, an integrated marine plan for Ireland, it is seen as something positive.  Targets are set in the new maritime policy for Ireland to increase the turnover from the ocean economy to &euro;6.4 billion and to increase our GDP from the ocean economy to 2.4% by 2030.  There is great potential in the ocean for fishing, shipping, aquaculture, renewable energy, oil and gas, and tourism and leisure.  By developing this plan we can harness and optimise that potential.  If there is one thing I would pick out in terms of science and optimising the use of the ocean around Ireland, it is the concept of marine spatial planning; that is looking at the ocean as it is and its users and trying to manage them and minimise any conflict.</p></speech>

It is useful to present to the committee, particularly with our colleagues from our sister agencies, the Marine Institute, the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority and our colleagues from Udar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, with whom we have an excellent working relationship.</p><p>  We understand that the main focus on is the communities&rsquo; socioeconomic situation and on promoting sustainable industries.  I will present on aquaculture, island and coastal fisheries and inshore fisheries.  I have a brief opening introduction and my colleagues, Mr. Donal Maguire and Mr. Michael Keatinge, will be happy to take questions later.</p><p>  I believe that the Irish seafood sector represents a tremendous opportunity to create much needed jobs in our remote, coastal communities as well as adding more export value to the Irish economy.  In BIM&rsquo;s new five-year strategy for 2013-2017, which will be launched in the next few weeks, we have set out key targets for jobs and value growth in the sector, which on realisation will have a very positive impact on the communities socioeconomic situation and, most important, on promoting a natural resource based on sustainable industry.  The importance we are attributing to this is reflected in our vision which is &quot;A scaled Irish seafood industry capitalising on the growing opportunities for seafood in global markets and providing sustainable employment in our coastal communities&quot;.</p><p>  The opportunity for Irish seafood will come from expected growth in market demand.  The Food and Agriculture Organization, FAO, and the World Bank predict that the global population will reach 8 billion by 2025, and this will necessitate a substantial increase in food production to meet the demand that will be created by this population surge.  Coupled with the fact that the world&rsquo;s centre of economic gravity is moving towards the east, with more than half the world&rsquo;s middle classes living in the east by 2020, resulting in continuing income growth in Asia where there is a strong cultural preference for seafood, this means there will be a strong local demand for a product which previously had been exported.  Thus, it is our view that supplies into Europe, which is heavily dependent on imports from the east, will also be reduced.  Currently, Europe imports approximately 65% of all the seafood it consumes.  From a whitefish perspective, the volume is as high as 90%.</p><p>  I believe Ireland is strategically well placed, given its proximity to lucrative fishing grounds, to take advantage of this market opportunity.  The FAO estimates that an additional 42 million tonnes of seafood will be absorbed by the global market each year by 2030.  Given that world capture fisheries are at their maximum sustainable yield and will not, in all likelihood, alter significantly, the FAO suggests that additional supplies will be largely met by an increase in aquaculture production.</p><p>  While in the short term the continuing recessionary situation in key seafood markets such as Spain, Italy and to a lesser extent in France will make trading conditions more challenging, in the longer term the shifting of global seafood supply to the east will inevitably create shortages and thereby present opportunities for Irish producers in these important traditional markets.  Thus, either through developing new markets in the Far East or by finding niches in the traditional markets, there will be exciting opportunities for Irish seafood and Irish seafood producers to capture.</p><p>  The committee may be interested in some current facts on the state of the<b></b>Irish seafood sector.  The industry provides 11,000 full-time and part-time jobs in fishing, fish farming, processing and ancillary services including net making, fish distribution and a range of other activities.  As my colleague Dr. Connolly pointed out, the industry is predominantly located in coastal locations at some distance from other centres of economic activity, and the jobs are critical to maintaining viable communities in these regions.  By way of example, BIM has conducted studies on Killybegs and Castletownbere which illustrate the critical role and contribution of the seafood industry in both of those key coastal locations.</p> <p>In Castletownbere 81% of employment is related to fishing while in Killybegs the figure is 69%.  Similar economic studies on other fishing ports are under way.</p><p> At primary production level, sea fish landings to Irish ports in 2011 were 269,099 tonnes with a value of &euro;199 million.  Provisional data for 2012 show that output from the aquaculture sector amounted to 36,285 tonnes with a value of &euro;129 million.  The seafood export sector<b></b>has performed well over recent years.  In 2012, exports of Irish seafood increased 18% in value to &euro;517 million on an increased volume of 350,032 tonnes.  It is worth noting that the 18% increase in value in 2012 exports followed a 14% increase in value from 2011 exports which means that there was a strong double digit growth in exports.  The leading markets were: France - &euro;115 million, Great Britain - &euro;78 million, Spain - &euro;54 million, Germany - &euro;28 million, and Italy - &euro;27 million.  Outside of the EU the key export destinations are west Africa, Egypt, Russia and Asia, which had a combined value of &euro;155 million.  It is also worth noting that our seafood exports to China in 2012 was double the 2011 figure.</p><p> Sales on the domestic market reached &euro;310 million.  The retail sector is performing well but the food service business has been adversely impacted by the economic climate.  The total sales of seafood, both the export and home markets, amounted to &euro;827 million.  The seafood processing sector is characterised by a large number of companies.  At least 80% of sales is accounted for by 40 companies in which the turnover ranges from a high of &euro;50 million down to &euro;5 million.  A significant number of smaller companies have sales of less than &euro;1 million.</p><p> BIM believes that there is a need to realise that scale will be an important consideration for our sector over the coming years.  This realisation is necessary to engender greater competitiveness and take advantage of the global market opportunities for seafood.  It would enable us to deliver on the very ambitious Food Harvest 2020 strategy and secure a sustainable seafood industry providing sustainable jobs.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-30a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Miche&aacute;l O'Mahony" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AG32013043000005#D00300"><p>I thank the sub-committee for its invitation to attend along with our colleagues in aligned State agencies.  On behalf of my fellow authority members I wish to express our welcome for the initiative to focus on Ireland&rsquo;s inshore and aquaculture sectors.  The SFPA welcomes interest in the public services we provide.  We believe that our work is integral to the support and protection of a profitable future for these sectors.  In these, and all seafood sectors, SFPA&rsquo;s role involves the promotion, verification and, if necessary, enforcement of compliance with sea fisheries conservation and seafood safety legislation.</p><p>  The authority was established as Ireland&rsquo;s competent authority charged with ensuring compliance with both sea fisheries conservation and seafood safety legislation in Ireland.  This two-fold role sees us working with wild catchers and aquaculture producers and includes seafood processors up to, but not including, retail.  Key components of our work include inspection of fishing landings, co-operation with the Irish Naval Service regarding monitoring and inspection of vessels at sea, sampling of shellfish production areas, inspection of processing establishments, certification of exported seafood consignments, and representation of Ireland&rsquo;s approach to fishery protection and seafood safety at various EU and international fora.  The authority works with its sea fisheries protection consultative committee.  We are happy to report that the recent appointments made by the Minister to the committee included representatives of inshore fishing and the fin-fish and shellfish aquaculture sectors.</p><p>  With regard to the inshore wild catching sector, the vessels involved in the sector numerically constitute the largest component of the vessels in the Irish fishing fleet.  Approximately 75% of the 2,162 vessels in the Irish fleet are less than 10 m in length.  In general, these inshore vessels operate on a day-trip basis and target high value fish such as prawns, pollock, turbot, brill, mackerel, crustaceans such as lobsters, crayfish or crab, and shellfish such as razors clams, scallops or whelks.  The fishing gear used and fishing patterns of these inshore fishing vessels leave a generally light environmental footprint as their operating range and capacity is restricted by the size of the fishing vessels used and their vulnerability to bad weather and sea conditions.  The value of the harvest from these waters contributes significantly to the local economy of our coastal and island communities.</p><p>  There is generally a culture of compliance in inshore fisheries in Ireland.  For example, the v-notch and berried lobster schemes have proved successful initiatives in protecting and improving inshore lobster stocks.  In general terms, the SFPA has found a laudably strong sense of ownership and responsibility shown by inshore fishers in the conduct of their business.  That is not to say the sector is without compliance issues.  Fishing by unlicensed and unregistered fishing vessels continues to be something we detect.  It is unfair competition for legitimate fishers who have invested their money to operate their fishing vessels in a compliant manner.  Also, a small number of disreputable restaurants seek undersized lobsters from fishermen in an effort to maximise the profits they make from their gourmet clients.  Illegal commercial fishing for bass is also a problem in some parts of Ireland.</p><p>  The authority's role in verifying compliance with fishery conservation legislation is performed on a risk basis.  We tailor our inspection programme to ensure the best possible protection of Ireland&rsquo;s marine resources.  Inshore fishing vessels are generally viewed as being low risk given their catching ability relative to other fishing vessels.  There is no sector that  receives zero official controls, but the frequency of inspections increases with vessel size.  Collated 2011 figures of inspections of Irish vessels by the SFPA at port, or the Irish Naval Service at sea, indicate an average of 0.3 inspections per under-10 m Irish vessel per year.  The analogous figure for over-24 m Irish vessels is 6.8 inspections per vessel per year.</p><p>  To ensure an appropriate platform from which to base a meaningful regulatory support to inshore fishermen, the SFPA has procured its own rigid inflatable boats, RIBs.  The boats were purchased following a previous appearance by the SFPA before the Oireachtas joint committee where a committee member observed that we should have sea-going capacity for this work.  The authority works closely with Inland Fisheries Ireland and the Naval Service to maximise efficiency in promoting compliance with the management rules for the inshore sector.  While we cannot be at every landing point every day of the week, the often close-knit nature of the inshore sector ensures a useful flow of information to our confidential line which we follow up.</p><p>  Our legislative mandate includes an explicit role in promoting compliance.  The authority has identified particular challenges faced by the inshore wild catching sector when it comes to an awareness and understanding of its legal obligations.  The intricacy of the regulations, the frequency with which they change, coupled with the part-time seasonal nature of this work and absence of a representative organisation with whom we can discuss these issues can hamper overall compliance levels.  Therefore, the authority took the initiative to engage with representatives of the inshore sector in the south east to develop a comprehensive, user-friendly guidance document for use by the sector.  The outcome is a Guide to Compliance for the inshore sector that outlines in one document the key legal requirements for these fishers.  We printed the leaflet, including a leagan Gaeilge, and made it available free of charge through our regional port offices to these fishers.  It was printed on tear-resistant and moisture-resistant paper.  We have included the leaflet in the pack that we provided to the sub-committee today.  We have received reassuringly positive feedback from fishers.  I ask members to browse the leaflet and we are happy to receive feedback.</p><p>  The authority is committed to the minimal intrusion in the working lives of fishers and continues to put much effort into the  utilisation of remote sensing data to enable verification of compliance from a distance.  We have chosen to implement a derogation available to fishing vessels over 12 m for approximately 50% of the Irish 12 m to 15 m sector, exempting them from using electronic logbooks when their fishing patterns allow.  Recently, we made a submission to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform proposing that we fund from our budget a pilot scheme to trial the use of small-scale, user-friendly data logging devices for use in smaller vessels.  They would facilitate demonstration of compliance with both fishery and environmental legislation.</p><p>  Within the context of the mandate of the sub-committee, and our competence in sea fisheries and food safety regulation, we can see some opportunities.  We see potential in harnessing the authority's vessel positioning to support particular marketing claims such as labelling fish as caught off the coast of west Cork.  We believe that the fish caught by the inshore sector have many unique selling points, particularly for the Irish consumer.  They range from its low food miles to its freshness due to short trip to its artisan attention to detail in primary handling to its direct contribution to coastal economies.</p> <p>We are currently working with our colleagues in BIM and the fishing industry on a project designed to ensure regulatory compliance with obligations around traceability and provision of information to consumers, and we see benefits in differentiation of inshore seafood.</p><p> A key challenge already mentioned facing some traditional inshore fisheries has been the implementation of EU directives designed to ensure the protection of environmental habitats.  Following ministerial direction in 2009, the SFPA has been active in demonstrating Ireland's compliance with these obligations.  SFPA-devised control plans have provided assurance that inshore fishing vessels can operate within areas under special protection without damaging the habitat being protected.  The accurate recording of catches and the precise tracking of fishing operations are key features of these control plans, which are necessary for Ireland's opening of fisheries and aquaculture in inshore Natura-designated special areas of conservation.</p><p> The shellfish aquaculture sector is an important feature of Ireland's inshore coastal waters, with approximately 70 production areas classified and monitored by the SFPA in co-operation with the Irish Marine Institute.  Bottom-grown mussels, rope-grown mussels and trestle-grown oysters are key production systems, and Ireland's industry is primarily export-oriented, with particular reliance on European Union continental markets.</p><p> The production of these live bivalve molluscs is subject to a prescriptive regulatory regimen in EU legislation, designed to manage health risks associated with both algal toxins and micro-organisms.  The production and sale of these seafood products must be underpinned by robust official control and monitoring systems which classify production areas according to the bacterial conditions present and manage the weekly opening and closing according to changing algal blooms.  These official control sampling programmes require significant SFPA resource deployment, in the order of 20% to 25% of the resource available to us.  </p><p> We work with the shellfish aquaculture sector, particularly the Irish Shellfish Association, to try to achieve the best balance in protecting consumers and Ireland's market reputation while facilitating the practicalities of harvesting and trade in these food products.  We have been particularly active at an EU level in working to influence the legislative standards being developed with these objectives in mind.  At this time some of the regulatory changes being proposed are likely to prove challenging for the sector, especially in the area of standards for toxins and viruses of public health significance.</p><p> Regarding fin fish aquaculture, the SFPA's role centres around ensuring that the food safety obligations expected of producers are being met.  From our initial creation in 2007 we developed a programme of official controls to verify compliance with the European food safety, animal remedy and animal by-product regulations at these sites.  We worked with the Irish Salmon Growers' Association, hosting an information session to explain and orient producers within their legal obligations.  We received strong feedback from that sector concerning regulatory burdens arising from the involvement of various State agencies.  We have therefore collaborated with State colleagues to streamline our official controls into part of a single wide-ranging inspection, verifying a variety of matters, performed by a single official on a single visit.  We believe such a joined-up approach to discharging Ireland's obligations is good for everyone - industry, State agencies, taxpayers and consumers.</p><p> Ireland's seafood sector is export-oriented.  Market access for food outside Ireland depends on trust in the official control systems.  The food control authorities of importing countries depend on the assurances provided by the authorities of exporting countries.  In the case of Irish seafood exported outside the EU, SFPA officers are responsible for attesting to the safety of the product and the legitimacy of the catching vessel, with catch certificates and health certificates.  Without this SFPA work, Irish exporting of seafood would not exist.</p><p> Since our creation in 2007, the SFPA has been a key interlocutor in negotiating market access for Irish seafood in Japan, Russia and China, as well as achieving a significant reduction in the regulatory burden required for Irish seafood exports to the United States.  A substantial component of our available resource is devoted to this work, both at a central level through the Department of Foreign Affairs, working with the resource-intensive expectations of importing country authorities, and through our officers on the ground, working with Irish exporters to provide the necessary certification for every individual consignment leaving Ireland going to a third country.</p><p> Seafood - particularly high-value products, notably including live molluscs, live crab and smoked salmon - tends to have perishability characteristics which result in a large number of low-volume consignments, with challenging transport logistics.  This is a demanding and increasing part of our work.  In 2011 our officers issued health certificates for 932 consignments comprising 26,000 tonnes of Irish seafood going to 39 different countries.  In 2012 that had risen to 1,437 consignments, 63,000 tonnes and 44 third countries outside the EU.  While that is a clear manifestation of the benefits of industry compliance, we struggle to service industry expectations and support Government policy to increase the volume and value of output and exports of seafood as envisaged in Food Harvest 2020.  We believe our resourcing must acknowledge this regulatory output so that we can provide the necessary industry support.</p><p> I hope the SFPA's commitment to supporting the continued success of the inshore and aquaculture sectors is evident in our brief presentation.  While we sit here, SFPA staff are working hard to implement Government policy, dealing with real people who are working hard to try to make their livelihoods in these sectors.  We strongly believe that fit-for-purpose regulations are an integral pillar of the successful future of these sectors.  Our work supports the ongoing viability of compliant operators.  These industries are clearly the backbone of the coastal and island communities and we look forward to being part of their future.  We would welcome any questions committee members might have for us.</p></speech>

We believe the licence system should be reviewed and simplified.  It is critical that sufficient resources are made available to the appeals board to support its ongoing work programme.  We would also suggest a three-year development scheme for commercial aquaculture.  If that is done, we believe there are many opportunities in seaweed, mariculture, food and tourism development, especially cultural tourism.</p><p>  Traditionally, the coastal Gaeltacht communities have been dependent on the marine resource.  This resource has been integral to the overall economic, social and cultural development of the Gaeltacht.  It is imperative that every support and development opportunity is provided to these vulnerable marginal coastal communities to ensure their ongoing viability.  Such supports can be delivered in an integrated fashion through financial and development measures, which will create employment and local added value.  We believe &Uacute;dar&aacute;s possesses the required expertise and experience in local economic regeneration, enterprise development and the delivery of community-based and sectoral initiatives that support such communities.  My colleague Jim Keogh and I would be happy to expand on any aspect of this presentation and respond to any questions members wish to submit to us.</p></speech>

They attended the joint sub-committee and spoke to us.  This is about the vulnerability of coastal communities, which has come to the fore in the context of the challenge of up-siding in other people's interests.  Deputy Pringle is from the constituency in question.  The fishermen's position is that the sea is full of fish, which they do not have the wherewithal to get at.  They do not have piers to go out to the deep sea, they are not allowed to fish salmon and they are ill-equipped to fish year-round for other species.</p><p>  We must consider this on a cross-agency basis.  It is a pity there are no representatives in attendance from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, as one of the most significant deficiencies is the lack of infrastructure.  The chief executive of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta raised a fundamental point when he referred to licences but I raised an even more fundamental one in a previous incarnation, which was that, with the exception of Inishmore, there are few significant fishing licences in the islands.  That is for the simple reason that piers were not built on the various islands in time for them to acquire the licences in the first instance.  When I was Minister, we were trying to build a pier on Arranmore and got as far as the design stage.  I think the project has run into the sand.  Tory Island had no significant pier until approximately ten years ago.  Inishmaan had nothing that one could reasonably call a pier - it had a slipway.  Inisheer had a very poor pier at which boats could not be left during the winter.  Despite the fact that these islands are sitting in the middle of the Atlantic, many of their communities do not have the wherewithal to fish.  They lack either the necessary quotas or licences.</p><p>  As I have only five minutes, I will focus on a few issues.  What is the potential to increase the output of shellfish by semi-farming it?  I use the term "semi-farming" to refer, for example, to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and its ownership of the oysters in Kilkieran Bay where, since it took over from Gael Linn, there has been good co-operation with the local co-operative.  Mussel farming in Killary Harbour uses absolutely natural mussels which attach themselves to ropes and is not done in the traditional way.  What is the potential for inshore fishermen to increase their income through the various aquacultural processes, including V-notching, which do not rely purely on nature but are developed in a natural way using nature's own tendencies?</p><p>  Seaweed has been mentioned only in passing today.  What is the potential for inshore communities to develop low-volume, high-quality products from seaweed?  What do we need to do on seaweed rights?  There is a saying in Connemara about "spite feamainne" and neighbours who are having a dispute.  In the lore, an argument over seaweed rights is more bitter than any other argument.  Is there anything we can do through the Marine Institute to create further natural products, exploit different types of seaweed and move up the market chain?  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta knows my view that seaweed was a high-volume, low-value product for years, which I was anxious about.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is now seeking to move up the chain to a higher-value product.  Is there more we can do with seaweed?</p><p>  Given the constraints on fishing, is there more we can do on marine leisure?  Where does that fit into the picture?  Given that the sea is not privately owned, will coastal communities have a role in renewable energy?  If tidal or wave energy production develops, will it be the preserve of large multinationals while local communities have a purely employee role in the sector?  Is there significant potential to use the sea to create renewable energy?</p><p>  Can Mr. Whooley clarify something?  He referred to an upsizing of companies.  There are many small processors operating in small, isolated communities that employ people here and there.  Does he envisage a consolidation of the processing industry or is he talking about all of these small companies growing while a few large ones emerge in parallel?  I would be very surprised if someone were to suggest that we should get rid of highly successful niche companies which have established high-value, low-volume markets for their products.  It would fly in the face of what is happening in the land-based food industry, where we have Kerrygold and Glanbia operating alongside a hugely expanded artisan food industry.  Where does BIM see us going in that context?</p><p>  They say a picture is worth a thousand words, and a graph has been circulated which refers to 1,614 boats under ten metres in length.  We are here to discuss the owners of those boats today, not the owners of the large boats.  This whole issue is about the small boats.  How do we sustain those people and their communities?</p><p>  I have one question for the Marine Institute involving special areas of conservation.  From memory, I believe a bay must be surveyed before an aquaculture licence can be issued.  As a result, there are significant delays in issuing licences.  What is BIM's role in issuing licences and preparing bays, particularly bays which are special areas of conservation, for licensing?  There was a reference in another context to a competent authority.  Regarding compliance and special areas of conservation, including Cuain Chill Ch&iacute;ar&aacute;in and other bays, what is the competent authority?  Is it the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority?  Does it depend on the species?</p> <p>My understanding is that there is one agency appointed by the State which has the competent authority to rule on whether a person is in compliance with SAC legislation-Natura 2000, which appears to be always a huge barrier.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-30a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AG32013043000008#G00200"><p>I thank the delegates for their presentations.  I welcome the commencement of this engagement which if utilised properly can be hugely beneficial in terms of meeting all of our hopes and expectations.</p><p>  I come from a fishing community.  As such, I am conscious of the marked decline over the past number of decades in this sector, particularly in inshore fishing.  Like Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, for me, the 1,614 vessels are the most important given their connection with our respective communities.  The people involved come from, live in and spend their money in the communities.  One of the biggest disasters in this area of the fishing sector was the abolition of drift netting.  It has done huge damage, the knock-on effect of which has been felt by the crab, lobster, crayfish and gill netting sectors.  Pressure on these areas has increased as a result of that measure.</p><p>  I am acutely aware, having played a central role in it, of the oyster fishery in Tralee Bay.  Management of that fishery and sustainability of the crop has, despite all the pressures, continued to be a source of income to the 78 permit holders there.  It is down to management that it has survived.  Previously all involved in the sector, because we were fishing based on greed rather than quota and benefit, were exploiting it.  Despite this effort, I am concerned about pressure on the lobster and crayfish sectors in particular.  In this regard, I fully support the v-notch.  Some very close friends of mine are involved in the industry.  When fishing previously we fished approximately 100 to 150 round barrel pots, but currently these people are fishing 600 to 800 pots.  I understand people in other areas are fishing up to 1,000 pots.  They are doing this in order to make a living.  That is the reality.  The cost of diesel, insurance, boat maintenance and so on is high.  These fishermen are under extraordinary pressure.  While it is to their credit that they remain involved, it is a huge investment for a small return.  I know of people who have been hauling 600 pots a day for approximately &euro;50 or &euro;60.  </p><p>  My first question is to Mr. Whooley and is based on the current debate around aquaculture, salmon farming and so on.  Has consideration been given to on-shore facilities for aquaculture, in particular in relation to salmon?  I am told it is feasible.  I acknowledge there are differing scientific views on this issue and that it is often difficult to ensure the right decision is made when there are so many differing views to be taken into account.  For example, the IFI is totally opposed to what is proposed for Galway and is prepared to take the matter further if it goes ahead.  All of us have to make up our own minds.  We all want to see more people involved in the sector and the continued viability of coastal communities.  Currently, our coastal communities are not viable; they have been decimated.  The escape valve has been emigration.  A number of our inshore fisherman are dependent on non-Irish nationals for a crew.  The level of emigration is also causing a problem in this sector.</p><p>  On the restoration of the sea bass quota, I have received representations from various different groups, in particular the IFO, who believe the sea bass quota should be reinstated and could provide an income.  Has any consideration been given to this issue?  I would welcome the views of other delegates on that matter.  On aquaculture and other projects, those of us involved in putting together the presentation on natural resources consulted with many people.  Central to this process is local consultation.  The imposition of a particular measure on people without consultation can cause serious resentment and can be detrimental to the good will that may exist in that regard.</p><p>  Reference was made earlier to the labelling of inshore fishing.  That is a marketing issue.  Proper labelling and marketing of this fish could provide a great return for local communities.  It may also result in additional income for related industries within communities.  As far as I am concerned the elephant in the room is the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, the impact of which, in terms of quota, has been detrimental.  It has resulted in competition in Irish waters between Irish fishermen and fishermen from countries whose quota far exceeds ours, which, in turn, is having a knock-on effect for people in coastal communities.  We all know what happened in 1972-73.  This issue has never been properly addressed.  If we had an adequate quota we could develop an infrastructure and industry that would be of great benefit to Ireland as a whole and, in particular, to coastal communities.  </p><p>  On the SFPA, we have had our difficulties with it in the past.  I am taking the delegates at their word that matters have improved greatly.  It was stated that there is a great deal of consultation with the south-east, which I welcome.  As a public representative from a coastal community I am regularly contacted by people about the operations of the SFPA.  I am happy to take the delegates at their word that a lot has changed.</p></speech>

The example of how oyster fishing in Tralee Bay is managed, as mentioned by Deputy Ferris, is an excellent one.  The operation is professionally managed and there is a good working relationship among the individual fishermen.  It also has an onshore facility, from a hatchery perspective.  It is a good example of what can be done in terms of inshore fishermen moving from what is traditionally seen as wild fisheries to managed fisheries.  Similarly, the mussel farming operation in Roaring Water Bay mentioned by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is an excellent example of inshore fishermen, side by side with in-shore fishing, successfully growing mussels and supplementing their incomes.  There are other examples of this around the coast.  The difficulty for an inshore fisherman or small group of fishermen is our onerous, and rightly so in some respects, licensing system through which they must navigate in order to obtain a licence to farm.  I am sure Dr. Connolly will have more to say on the SACs, Natura 2000 and their implications.</p> <p> Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v raised the issue of seaweed.  I agree absolutely that seaweed offers significant potential.  As I mentioned earlier, the BIM strategy to be launched in a number of weeks will have a specific emphasis on seaweed.  We successfully managed to farm seaweed in Dingle and Castletownbere in the past couple of years, through local inshore fishermen growing it.  That has proved very successful.  My colleague, Mr. Donal Maguire, might deal with that issue specifically.</p><p> I will now address another question raised by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v on scaling and upsizing and how that sits with the traditional businesses around our coast.  The Deputy is absolutely correct, the traditional small businesses which have developed niches in the marketplace for their products and employ low numbers of people are critically important not only to the coastal communities but also to the future of the Irish seafood sector.  We have an absence of the larger companies that operate in other sectors.  We do not have companies on the scale of Glanbia or the Kerry Group.  There is no seafood company in Ireland with a turnover in excess of &euro;50 million.  That lack of scale impacts negatively on our ability to deal on the global market.  Many of our competitors have companies of that scale and in simple terms they are able to out-muscle us in the marketplace.  That is a real challenge in the market day-in, day-out which we need to address.  We need to develop companies of scale in parallel with our existing niche companies.  Last year we were fortunately able to get four companies to collaborate together and go to the Chinese market as one rather than compete against each other in that market.  Companies from Kilmore Quay, Castletownbere, Donegal and Mallow in County Cork came together as a group to access the Chinese market.  That has been very effective.  </p><p> I will now respond to Deputy Ferris's question on the onshore growing of salmon.  We have successfully grown onshore species such as turbot.  We also grow onshore species such as perch in Tipperary and Monaghan.  The challenge with salmon is that the world production of salmon is 2 million tonnes per annum.  Of that 2 million tonnes, approximately 10,000 tonnes to 15,000 tonnes is produced on land.  The reason is simple, while it is technically feasible, it does not make sense financially.  The added difficulty for a country like Ireland is finding large sites proximate to the coast in which one could situate these cages.  Another factor is the cost of energy and recent statistics show we have the third highest electricity costs in the OECD.  The cost of electricity for the pumping machines would make it even more difficult for an Irish operation to succeed.  That is not to say we are not looking at this possibility or that further down the line it has potential.  In my opinion it will be five to ten years, at best, before such a project would be financially viable. </p><p> My colleague, Donal Maguire, will deal with seaweed and will comment further on salmon. </p></speech>

The most recent project funded by the Marine Institute under its research programme was administered by BIM on its behalf.  We have perfected the technique for hatching and growing seaweed so that one can seed lines, a bit like mussel lines, and put them out in the sea to produce special individual species of high value seaweed, such as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned.  There is considerable potential in this field.  As it is regarded as an aquaculture process it will require aquaculture licensing.  The first licences of this sort will be applied for shortly in west Cork.  We have done a great deal of work in the past with our colleagues in &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta on using the existing seaweed resource and finding higher value niches in the nutraceutical area for it as an additive to various cosmetics.  Of course, some of the finest golf greens and some of the best racehorses run on seaweed by-products.  There is much work being done to try to maximise the value of the existing resource and to develop a new farmed resource.  The farming of seaweed is very big business around the world.  The Chinese farm millions of tonnes of seaweed every year and use it for a multiplicity of purposes, including shipping it to Japan, where it is used to wrap around sushi products.  It is an emerging technology.</p><p>  Finding sheltered areas on the Irish coastline may be a challenge but we have no doubt that it will be a significant industry in the future.  The important thing to note is that in the medium term - ten to 20 years time - there will be no single species fish farms.  We will be looking inevitably at multi-trophic aquaculture.  Ideally there will be a fed farm, which is a fin fish type farm, perhaps a salmon farm and a seaweed farm in the stream of that to make the best use of any enrichment coming from it and the seaweed will probably be used in turn to feed valuable shellfish or become an ingredient in animal feeds of one kind or another, including fin fish feeds.  There is no doubt that farming up and down through the trophic levels of the sea, starting with seaweed and then moving through shellfish and up to fin fish and integrating these into unified systems, will be the way forward for fish farming.</p></speech>

The competent authority for Natura 2000 is the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  This is part of EU legislation, which Ireland as a member of the EU must comply with.</p><p>  The role of the Marine Institute is to work with our colleagues in different Departments and semi-State agencies and look at the risks associated with fishing activity in relation to special areas of conservation, SACs.  The best way of defining our role would be to give members an example.  The cockle fishery in Dundalk Bay is in a special area of conservation.  The Marine Institute surveys the cockles to determine the biomass of the cockles.  We define a management plan with the local stakeholders on the quantity of cockles to be taken out.  We must not just consider human consumption, but the food for the very important bird populations.  We need to define the quantity of the cockles to set aside, not alone for the fishermen but also for the birds that live there.</p><p>  In a sense we develop a management plan for the cockles in that SAC.  We want to ensure the sustainable exploitation of the cockles and that the birds have enough food to live on because they are intrinsic to the SAC.  We define a closed season and open sea and the best time to fish for these cockles.  Working with the different players, we come up with a management plan.  Our role would be to assess the resource, determine its size and work with the stakeholders to try to quantify how much we can sustainbly take out of the resource.  Between SACs and SPAs, there are 29 bays on which we are working at present.  To set up management plans and give the advice to the stakeholders requires a great deal of background data.  We must establish the benthos of the bay, the bird population and one needs all this information to develop management plans.</p><p>  I would now like to respond to the two questions from Deputy Ferris.  We cannot land seabass in Ireland.  It is a very frustrating part of daily life for fishermen when their colleagues from France and the United Kingdom can land bass and they cannot.  The bass population was in a serious state of decline and this triggered the stop on the exploitation of bass.  It was an Irish regulation.  The EU will establish quotas for bass across the EU, and the talk is that they will be introduced next year.</p> <p>Allied to that, there is now international scientific advice on the quantity of bass that can be caught at sea.  It is the first time we have had such advice.</p><p> Another element which comes into the complex equation is the forthcoming discard ban in the CFP.  It is illegal for Irish fishermen to land seabass, but when they catch them, it will be illegal to discard them.  We have a dilemma and the way out is to develop a management plan.  All stakeholders in the seabass fishery, including anglers, must consider what their objectives are and attempt to reach a consensus on a management plan.  Such a plan might involve closed seasons and a mechanism whereby fishermen may not target seabass, but any seabass they catch, they may land and sell.  Given the policy changes which are about to happen in the CFP and the idea of a total allowable catch coming in, there must be a coming together of the anglers who want to retain the ban on landings and the industry which is intensely frustrated by the ban.</p></speech>

If the quota is determined by historic landings, the fact that Ireland has closed the fishery raises the possibility that we will get no quota.  It will be an area of significant debate in the process of defining and allocating quotas.  We must sit around the table.  A management plan for seabass in an Irish context within the TACs from the EU is the only way out.  Otherwise, we will get ourselves into an impossible position.</p></speech>

My colleague, Dr. Connolly, has spoken about the Marine Institute's role in special areas of conservation whereas the role of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority is relatively circumscribed.  When the Marine Institute has issued a recommendation on what is an appropriate outtake, it is the authority's job to ensure fishers comply and take only what is allowed.  We can show that Ireland has a meaningful approach to special areas of conservation and the compliance of fishers within them.  There are logistical challenges in monitoring the outtake, including technological difficulties in transmitting information to a central authority in real time.  If Dundalk cockles, for example, is managed on a weekly outtake basis, to get the information collated on a Friday to be in a position to distribute quotas for the following week for individual vessels is logistically challenging.  We are looking at fit-for-purpose, small-footprint data loggers which might be appropriate for use in this area.</p><p>  The Deputy's question was really about who does what and where does it all stop.  I will walk the committee through the environmental obligations.  The two relevant EU directives - one on birds and the other on flora and fauna more generally - require member states to designate as special areas of conservation places with specific environmental characteristics which it is sought to protect.  That has been done by the competent authority for the purpose, which is currently the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, under Natura 2000.  There are various marine areas which have been designated, some of which are inshore and some of which are offshore.  Currently, the competent authority with responsibility for co-ordinating Ireland's overall approach in this area is the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which co-ordinates the inputs of the Marine Institute, BIM and the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority to produce a coherent approach to pre-designated special areas of conservation to allow activities including aquaculture.  In Deputy Ferris's part of the world, the Cromane Bay fishery was the first area to be opened under the process in 2009-10.  Dundalk cockles has been opened and Mr. Whooley mentioned Roaring Water Bay, which is another output of the process.</p><p>  I encourage Deputies to consider special areas of conservation from the widest possible perspective, which is what we try to encourage in our interface with the industry.  I will explain what I mean by that.  For example, an aquaculture producer whose production area had been designated as a special area of conservation saw that as a significant challenge and communicated that view evocatively to the authority.  He has turned that around, however, and now markets his shellfish across the EU as grown in pristine special area of conservation waters, designated as environmentally protected.  I will not say he commands a market premium, but he is certainly maximising the benefits of the designation.  Rather than to view designation as a challenge, it can be looked at as an opportunity.  Protecting a marine environment is a good thing.  The very fact that there is a lucrative, rich, traditional fishery in an area means it contains a unique ecosystem.  Protecting it is a good thing.</p></speech>

There are also possibilities off Achill and the Clare coast.  We are in constant contact with the people who are involved in these projects.  ESBI's WestWave project off Achill is one.</p><p>  To reply to Deputy Ferris, small vessels are most important, including to us.  They are often the only vessels people in small coastal communities have.  We support fisheries, including shellfish fisheries -  I am aware of the one near Tralee - and developed some in Waterford and Donegal in the 1980s which are still in existence.  In respect of the two projects Deputy Ferris mentioned, we agree with local consultation 100%.  It is in my submission that there is no possibility of properly implementing any project without local consent.  Fish labelling and marketing to increase value are things to which we should all aspire.<br /><b></b>Maidir le feamainn, b'fh&eacute;idir go nd&eacute;arfaidh an tUasal Mac Eochaidh rud beag faoi sin.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-30a.34" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. S&eacute;amus Mac Eochaidh" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AG32013043000010#J00600"><p>Ba mhaith liom c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; faoi cheist na feamainne.  Mar at&aacute; r&aacute;ite ag an tUasal &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, t&aacute; neart f&eacute;idireachta&iacute; ann don earn&aacute;il sin.  As my colleague, Mr. Maguire, mentioned, the principal issue in seaweed processing is the regulation of the supply.  T&aacute; a fhios agam go dt&eacute;ann s&eacute; siar &oacute; thaobh na feamainne de.  A survey carried out approximately 13 years ago suggested that there was approximately 70,000 tonnes of ascophyllum nodosum, which is the most commonly-processed seaweed.  The main processor is a company we own outright, Arramara Teoranta, which harvests 25,000 tonnes per annum.  The problem is that while the Office of the Attorney General confirms that, as it sits below the high water mark, 98% of all seaweed belongs to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, it would be a brave Minister who would try to claim it.  It is a traditional issue.  To move to higher-value seaweed processing in the absence of establishing the claim requires substantial investment.</p> <p>We have two companies in our remit, one of which we own 100%, which dries and mills 25,000 tonnes of <i>Ascophyllum nodosum</i>.  Another company in our remit, in Donegal, extracts liquid from seaweed and the remaining by-product is used for soil enhancement.  The drying extraction plant gets three times the value for liquid extraction compared to the drying and milling plant.  Therefore, the drying and milling plant is almost like beef on the hoof in comparison.</p><p> To build a sophisticated liquid extraction plant would probably cost approximately &euro;10 million, but we will not get anybody to put &euro;10 million into an industry when they do not know where the supply will come from.  This is a difficult issue, probably akin to turf-cutting in terms of people's perception of who owns or does not own the seaweed.  We have seen the issue dealt with properly in places such as Halifax, where the state leases out an area and the company that gets the lease is responsible for sustainable harvesting of the seaweed.  <i>Ascophyllum nodosum</i>, for example, can be cut back to four inches from the rock and it will grow again in four years.  </p><p> I am not a scientist, but I am advised that seaweed, like other crops, benefits from being harvested and cut properly and sustainably.  In Canada, the practice is to cut one foot per annum, which is done from boats.  Currently there is nobody here responsible for the sustainable harvesting of seaweed. People can go to the shore and take all the seaweed.  They can take the seaweed off the rock and then the plant is gone.  The State has an obligation to regulate this resource for everybody's benefit.</p><p> Harvest 2020, an official Government report, states that 38,000 tonnes of seaweed is harvested annually.  We can see how that is made up.  Aramara harvests 25,000 tonnes, another company harvests approximately 12,000 tonnes of maerl and the balance is harvested by small suppliers.  However, if one goes to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and inquires as to who has a licence to harvest seaweed, only the maerl harvester and one other harvester, which harvests laminaria in Kenmare Bay, have licences.  Although the laminaria harvester has a licence, which took two years to obtain, he is not harvesting.  Therefore, how is it that 38,000 tonnes are being harvested if there are no licences?  </p><p> This seaweed is being harvested on a very simple basis.  It is being done by individuals through a hand-cut process and is deemed to be for personal use.  That is fine as far as it goes, but what if we want to expand the industry?  In Japan, approximately 43,000 people make their livelihood from seaweed processing.  This would probably equate to a livelihood for 3,000 people in Ireland.  I reckon that no more than 100 people in Ireland are making a living from seaweed currently and there are no more than 50 million sales.  There is no reason we should not have 1,000 people involved and 500 million sales, but we must regulate and sustainably harvest the crop.</p><p> In response to an cheist a d'ardaigh an Teachta &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v faoi c&eacute; mh&eacute;id species at&aacute; ann, Dr. Paul Connolly will know a lot more than me about that.  In the last report I saw, approximately 13 species were mentioned as being possible to harvest commercially.</p><p> Mar focal scor, we have similar problems in general industry where the &uacute;dar&aacute;s operates as in the seaweed industry.  For many years, significant amounts of money were spent on academic research, but the industry was not commercialised and the commercial companies had not caught up with the research.  I am glad to say this is beginning to happen, particularly in NUIG, where the science is really beginning to unlock the benefits of seaweed.  I have seen French products that cost &euro;100 per gramme because of the use of a little extract from a seaweed plant.  That is where we need to be, rather than drying and milling stuff and sending it all over the world as a commodity product.  The potential is enormous, but if we do not have regulation, we will not have investment to unlock that potential.</p></speech>

I also look after the training division.  A number of points have been raised and I will deal with them in no particular order.</p><p>  Deputies Ferris and &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned V-notching.  This is one of the few success stories we have and is to be commended.  Members will all be aware it is a co-operative arrangement whereby berried female lobsters are returned live to the sea and the State pays half the cost and the fishermen the other half.  There is a considerable monitoring input of this from fishermen.  This year, we will probably spend approximately &euro;80,000 on the arrangement.  This is not a plea for more money, but we are accommodating everybody who comes to us with regard to that programme.  With regard to our lobster stock, I echo a point made already in the context of seaweed as to whether we could get more from our lobster stock and other inshore fishery stocks.  I will defer to Dr. Connolly on this, but I think we all agree the chances are we could.  It is down to management.  </p><p>  Natura will provide a significant input into the management process.  Dundalk Bay was mentioned; the cockle harvesting in that bay is extremely well managed.  As Deputy Ferris said, management involves local input.  The surprising thing is that the fishery management plan under which Natura operates comes from the fishermen.  The State agency's role - certainly BIM's role - is to assist the fishermen in producing their plan.  That plan is then assessed by the Marine Institute to ensure it is compliant with the requirements of Natura.  The development of the plans has been a tortuously slow process.  We have looked at Roaring Water Bay and we are looking at Kilkieran Bay, Clew Bay, Lough Swilly and a number of other areas.  There is an ongoing process with the European Commission to clarify precisely how the whole programme will operate.  Other member states have laboured slightly and have lacked a deep understanding of the situation, but that is not necessarily our fault.  Some of the delay is due to the legislation itself.  It is a matter of interpretation.  Developing the plans has taken longer than it should have, but down the line they may prove successful.</p><p>  The question was raised as to whether we envisage enhanced income and benefit for local communities through more local ownership.  My personal view is that this offers an avenue for exploration.  A number of fisheries have traditionally been vested in local ownership.  Tralee oyster fishery and Kilkieran Bay have been mentioned.  Local ownership poses some problems.  It is like the old adage of the chicken and the egg.  The question is who will have first ownership and how will the process be managed.  It would be wrong to raise those intellectual barriers because that type of well-managed locally owned fishery can prove extremely beneficial to communities.</p><p>  Mention was made of the drift net ban.  There was never a drift net ban.  The ban was on weak stock fishing of salmon.  When and if those stocks return, fishermen will be able to use drift or draft nets.  It will not matter then if they catch them with harpoons.  The committee that looks at this problem year on year is the standing scientific committee, which was originally attached to the now abandoned national salmon commission.  The standing scientific committee carries out an assessment annually of the rivers, the conservation limit and where we stand in respect of the conservation limit.  I do not want to get into specific details, but I am aware that the committee had Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, before it previously in connection with Arranmore, and that the point would have been made that Arranmore seems to be at a crossroads, with fish passing by that are destined for a multiplicity of rivers, not just in Ireland but also on the continent.  A net put in the water there will not only take fish destined for a river that is in surplus but will also take fish destined for rivers that are, perhaps, not in surplus.</p><p>  There is an important point to be made.  In some of our rivers, where we are beginning to see strong numbers of returning salmon, it is vital that the new distribution is fully utilised.  Traditional wild-catch fishermen, along with their angling colleagues, must be able to enjoy the surplus.  We should not lose sight of this.  I do not wish to be unduly specific, but I will mention the Moy.  There are 26,000 surplus fish in the Moy this year.  This begs the question of who can access those fish.  We could have a valuable export market in wild salmon, which attract huge prices on the continent.  This is an issue we should look at.  Questions must be asked as to how the surplus can be managed and utilised.  We must ask whether there are new opportunities for traditional fishermen to devolve into managing an upstream trap with a smoking or processing ancillary business attached to it.</p> <p>We see rivers such as those in Waterford beginning to recover.  The Nore and the Suir have both recovered.  Unfortunately, the Barrow has been a problem and has not fully recovered.  This raises the question of whether the conservation limit has been set too high because there has been human intervention on that river.  As on Arranmore, there are fishermen in Passage East and Cheekpoint who did not take the buy-out and are waiting for the day when they will be allowed to begin fishing again.  It is important that those involved in that particular process recognise that not everyone took the compensation.  There was never a ban on drift-net fishing; there was a ban on mixed stock fishing.  If a river is below the surplus but then gets back to that level, fishing should reopen.  Scientifically, that is possible.</p><p> The issue of labelling was raised and the point has been well made by my colleague in the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority.  We are involved in a good project with the SFPA and the fishing industry in this regard.  We are all well aware of what has happened in the meat sector.  To say there is no substitution in the fishing industry would be perhaps to tell a lie.  Everyone is aware that at times one could happily eat a haddock and it is every bit as good as cod.  Why not?  Some of the lies that may be told are not necessarily as black as others.  That being said, it is important that we build credible labelling, traceability and assurance around our seafood.  It is essential to exploit what is a natural product in the fashion we can and the example of using a special area of conservation, SAC, to our advantage is a good one.</p><p> There has been a consistent policy within Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, in the past 15 years to devolve our staff along the coastline.  I hope the Deputies and Senators here are more familiar with their local BIM officers, whether in Galway, Kerry or wherever, than with us.  There is a strong sense of participation at an agency level.  For example, one of the initiatives we are currently working on, which the committee may wish to come back to, is the roll-out of the European Fisheries Fund Axis 4, which is similar to the Leader programme and works in conjunction with Leader, but is a new source of funding to underwrite the types of initiative I believe the committee is focusing on, including how we create new and devolved opportunities in areas that are otherwise going through a change and how we create an interface between the fishing of the past, the marine skill-set and marine tourism.  There are many opportunities in these areas.  Those who are familiar with many parts of the country, not least Dunmore East, Kilmore Quay or parts of Galway or Donegal, see that process taking place.  The coastline is not all made up of Killybegs and Castletownberes; far from it.  Axis 4 is something that will re-emerge during the next round of funding from Brussels and something that could be used in future to complement, not compete with, the work that has already been done by Leader, but with a much stronger focus on maritime and marine-related activities.  That is something we would see as a positive outcome.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-30a.39" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrew Kinneen" time="15:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AG32013043000012#L00200"><p>I will make some general comments in response to questions put forward by the committee.  It is important that inshore fisheries are recognised as having special characteristics.  We have referred to their economic importance to coastal communities.  The environment on board an inshore fishing vessel is entirely different from that on a larger fishing vessel.  It is not the place to be weighing fishermen down with paperwork, electronic gadgets and the devil and all to monitor fishing.  We need to keep it simple, low cost and as practical as possible.  From that point of view we are looking at low-cost systems which we believe would be good for and well suited to inshore vessels.  Larger vessels have vessel position monitoring systems that operate using satellites.  We believe a low-cost equivalent could be achieved by using shore-based mobile phone networks, data loggers and so on.  This is far more practical and it is an easier option for fishermen.</p><p>  We need to emphasise the particular management of these vessels in terms of their fishing within special areas of conservation and Natura sites.  There is some work to be done in order that people understand that the fishing gear these inshore fishing boats use is not destructive.  Some people come to the argument with the view that the use of a small-scale dredge, a string of lobster pots or a small passive fishing net is destructive because they take a protectionist view of special areas of conservation.  It is important that the special characteristics of inshore fishing vessels are recognised.  It is an entirely different ball game to larger-scale fishing vessels using larger-scale heavyweight fishing gear.  There is something of a lack of understanding and it is important that this is dealt with as time goes by.</p><p>  Dr. Connolly from the Marine Institute commented on scientific assessments and management of out-takes.  There is also a need to manage the protection of identified marine organisms, whether a seaweed or a benthic species.  For this reason the SFPA is of the view that low-cost, appropriate monitoring systems are valuable because one can mark off a patch to protect a particular species while leaving the fishery active and exploitable.</p><p>  Another key point to emphasise is the role of marine spatial planning in the future protection of livelihoods of inshore fisheries.  We need to ensure that one marine activity does not impinge unnecessarily on another marine activity.  Inshore fisheries are particularly vulnerable in this regard.  They are also vulnerable to the misbehaviour of larger vessels operating in deep sea areas and we need to pay attention to that aspect of it as well.</p><p>  The issue of bass was raised, as was the challenge of getting a just quota for Ireland because of the catch-22 situation - no pun intended - and because we have a ban.  There may be some value in considering the recorded catches of recreational fishers that have been going on for years and have demonstrated the recovery of the stock.  Inland Fisheries Ireland has a long record of reporting catches from recreational fishermen and this may be something that could be extrapolated by scientists.  However, it is a tricky question to be worked through.</p><p>  There are some difficulties from the SFPA perspective in trying to work with the inshore sector.  Local consultation is fantastic and is the way forward, but we miss not having a representative body.  There are representative bodies for fin-fish aquaculture, shellfish aquaculture and various sectors involving larger fishing boats along the coast.  We can exchange messages and understand each other better by being able to talk to individuals.  However, we do not have that in the inshore fisheries sector and that is something we may seek to develop.</p></speech>

I have some specific questions, particularly for the SFPA.  The Common Fisheries Policy has six- and 12-mile limits.  What flexibility, if any, exists for member states within the six- and 12-mile limits to end variations?  I have in mind specifically inshore fisheries and sustaining inshore fishing communities.  The SFPA presentation referred to the benefits of differentiation of inshore seafood.  What are the potential benefits and how should policy be developed to deliver that?  What would that policy look like?</p><p>  The presentation from &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta referred to a requirement for a <i>de minimis</i> scheme for small-scale fishermen.  Will the deputation expand on that?</p><p>  The next question is for Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  Some of the issues relating to seaweed, shellfish and aquaculture have been referred to already.  How should policy be developed to assist and encourage inshore fishermen to diversify in these areas?  What must be done to ensure that we specifically target people who want to move out of inshore fishing?</p><p>  I have a general question on policy for coastal communities.  What policies should we be considering to assist and incentivise fishermen in communities to diversify?  It is important to ensure that people who wish to stay in fishing are assisted and that policy can be developed to ensure that can be done in a sustainable way.  Everybody referred to tourism in their presentations and that is important, but a vital part of the tourism product is seeing traditional fishermen at work in coastal communities.</p> <p> I will make a brief comment which is not really relevant to the work of the committee but it was raised in connection with the seabass fishery.  Could the witnesses comment on the futility of Ireland's unilaterally introducing a ban when our own waters are fished by up to nine other countries?  We will probably see that working itself out with the introduction of the quotas over the coming years.</p></speech>

We are not talking about the fishing industry but only about the inshore sector, the islands, the coast and a specific issue concerning aquaculture.  The organisations have given some very useful information.  It gives an optimistic view of the potential that lies off our shores, which many living on the coast have known for decades.  Some may not recognise it, but managed well, it has the potential to create a lot of economic activity in areas which the IDA and Enterprise Ireland largely ignore.  That is why it is important that we get accurate information and that the projections are sustainable and will lead to achievable policies for those communities.</p><p>  Many of our inshore fisheries aim at non-TAC species, for which there is no quota.  Can Dr. Connolly see any way for his organisation, the Marine Institute, to support further an inshore sector that would not be affected by TACs?  He might also outline some of the issues that have arisen.  Where I come from I often hear that the science does not match the experience or the perception.  There is a lag.  I know the present Minister is serious in saying that where the science supports it he will look for an increase in quotas, but not where the science does not support it.  We are dealing then with the precautionary principle.  Will Dr. Connolly outline for us how long it takes, typically, from the point at which the Marine Institute identifies an issue for it to go to ISIS-Fish, or through the Commission, the Council and the whole EU structure, before coming back to the Irish legislature through an instrument that can be used on the ground?  Our perception is that the process takes up to four years.  That is a pinch point on which coastal communities need some clarification.  It is interesting that Dr. Connolly identified two of the most valuable stocks, and there are many, maybe 30 or 40.  Historically, mackerel sustained inshore communities, but now it is in the offshore sector.  Does Dr. Connolly see any potential, using the science he has studied, to allow the development of an inshore fishery that is not covered by TAC?</p><p>  I have some questions for Mr. Whooley of BIM.  Fisheries are quite limited.  By and large there is no great potential for increased quotas or stocks.  It will remain static.  The potential to increase our activity in these sectors is very limited but aquaculture has potential for coastal communities.  We are coming from a very low base.  The Norwegians and the Scots have been dealing with the same EU legislation as we have since 1973, the same issues with Natura sites and the same natural environment, the eastern Atlantic.  The same people are involved, they have come from the same base but they have done ten times more work.  They are years ahead of us.</p><p>  I reserve the right to raise this again if there is a second round of questions, but the big issue is licences.  Could we get some idea of the number of licences that have been applied for on Natura and other sites, if that data is available?  I am aware that there is a significant project off the Aran Islands, but we could spread this around.  It is becoming a serious issue around the coast.</p><p>  I was particularly interested in the presentation by the SFPA.  As the watchdog for the fisheries it has had a difficult job in creating a dialogue and mutual respect between the industry and the regulators.  I am particularly pleased that it has identified areas where the inshore fleet in particular would benefit from appropriate interpretation of directives or measures that the offshore fleet deals with every day.  I welcome an expansion of those programmes, particularly when one sees the number of vessels in the fleet.  There is no correlation between the number of vessels and the value of the landings.  Many have low overheads.  There is a living to be made, more or less, if they want to be left alone as long as they are licensed to do what they are doing and they are compliant and not having an impact on other people.  I welcome the SFPA's approach to this.  It might be useful to examine areas where this could be expanded to promote sustainable fishing.</p><p>  I am not as familiar as some members of the committee with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s and would like to know if it supports projects in onshore processing that would tie in with the inshore fisheries and add value to the work of the local guys who are landing there.  Would they have ownership or could they invest in their own processing facilities in those areas?  That would be very helpful.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Mahony talked about turning a potential disadvantage into an advantage.  A large proportion of Irish fishing vessels are under 10 metres.  We have 1,614.  Mr. O'Mahony said that there is generally a culture of compliance in the inshore fishing sector.  People land their fish, they go out for no more than 24 hours and they go after high-value stocks.  As a result the fish is fresh, unlike the fish frozen on factory ships.  Does that not present an opportunity to the State to market that in Ireland and internationally and to develop strategies to get those fish to international markets in Europe, where there is a demand for it?  What is BIM doing at the moment?  If anyone else wishes to provide answers I would welcome those too.  What are State agencies doing to market that product?</p> <p>SFPA mentioned it had inspection points to certify our exports.  Where are they located?  Who is certifying shellfish, in particular live shellfish, which are imported?  Where are they being certified?</p><p> We learned from Mr. Whooley's presentation that sea fish landings at Irish ports were valued at &euro;199 million and output from the aquaculture sector was valued at &euro;129 million.  What proportion of the budget is geared towards the marketing and development of sea fish versus the marketing and development of aquaculture?</p><p> I have some specific questions.  I thank the delegates for providing a chart on the minimum fish sizes fishermen can bring on board.  I understand they are legislated for by way of statutory instrument on the recommendation of BIM.  If that is not the case, which body is involved?  They are obviously done with a view to protecting fisheries and ensuring sustainability.  Is velvet crab fishing protected or minimum sizes applicable?  If not, why not?</p><p> Mr. Keatinge had information on salmon stocks in rivers.  Is there a trend?  If so, what is the trend in regard to the upstream Parteen weir on the Shannon? </p><p> Mr. Whooley mentioned the need to realise scale is an important consideration for the sector.  A proposal, which we will not discuss, will go to the Department.  I understand BIM has a strategy of developing large offshore fish farms.  Would that policy displace existing fisheries?  I refer to the general policy of displacement.  Could it be counterproductive?  Irish beef is marketed as a top-end product.  If we seek to market fish, in particular the types to which I referred, namely, from inshore fisheries, is that at odds with developing and marketing a mass produced product from large sea farms?  Are there any health repercussions for humans?  Has that been considered as part of the process?</p></speech>

I said it is currently critically important to maintain employment and the fishery policy would be flexible and innovative.  In many cases EU state aid rules will preclude countries from grant aiding anything that will distort competition.  In most other industries there is a <i>de minimis</i> get out clause and one is allowed to use up to &euro;200,000.  The maximum allowed in the fisheries sector is &euro;30,000, which puts it at a major disadvantage.  I mentioned it as an example of something that could provide more flexibility.  A sum of &euro;200,000 per project would be substantial aid.</p><p>  Deputy Harrington referred to inshore processing.  There are up to 20 processors along the west coast such as O'Cathain Iasc in Dingle, O'Mahoney and Ted Browne.  There are quite a few in Rossaveal; at one stage up to 400 people worked in Rossaveal, but the figure has reduced to 40, mainly because of a lack of raw material for processing.  The same applies elsewhere, such as Teelin in Donegal.  </p></speech>

I will try to answer the direct questions that have been put to us and refer to my colleagues to pick up the pieces of what I do not answer.</p><p>  Deputy Pringle asked about the CFP and its provisions for protecting traditional inshore fisheries.  This is a fairly complex area.  To step back from the big picture, one of the guiding principles of the current CFP is that EU waters can be accessed by all EU fishers.  There are some exceptions.  Another guiding principle is that outtakes are defined per member state, regardless of from where they take them.  The CFP defines the outtake the member state can take from EU waters and, in general terms, allows access by all EU vessels to most EU waters.  The exception to which the Deputy referred is the protection of what would generally be regarded as the exclusive economic zone of the member state.  There are two sections measuring from the baseline, which is the high tide line.  There are divisions of six and 12 nautical miles.  In general terms, the CFP provides for a member state to protect everything up to its 12 nautical mile limit from, in our case, non-Irish fishers.  There is protection within the CFP for access.  Notwithstanding that access protection, the maximum TAC for member states remains.  It is just a matter of where it is caught.  </p><p>  We are getting into the complex area of Ireland's relationship with the UK, but I am happy to discuss them.  There are particular access rights for UK fishing vessels entering the six to 12 and the zero to six mile zones.  In general terms, they protect traditional fishery rights for people on the island of Ireland which they enjoyed prior to the inception of the State.  </p></speech>

It should be noted that the outtakes of TAC species, whether taken inshore or offshore, all have to come from our national TAC.  BIM operates a select representative group of, I understand, approximately 100 vessels.  We take statistics from them and extrapolate them to model the outtakes of inshore fisheries, which we then model into the statistical returns given to the Commission and, in turn, to ICES.</p><p>  The good news is that a lot of the high value species are not TAC species, such as lobster and crayfish, and are not subject to such limitations.  There is great fishing effort limitation and the trend to use more fishing gear for fewer returns is a notable feature of what is currently happening.  It points to the need for good marine spatial planning.</p><p>  On the protection of velvet crab, the Deputy has caught me offside.  I am not in a position to answer his question but I will research it and revert to him.  I cannot quote him a minimum size for the species.  We regulate all the landings of fishermen, go through all their catches with them and determine whether clawing or whatever else might apply.</p></speech>

Deputy Thomas Pringle asked about inshore seafood products and differential labelling.  He also asked what needed to be put included in legislation to make this happen.  There are various reasons, but it is not for the want of legislation.  Deputy Noel Harrington referred to the fact that, in general, fishermen wanted to fish.  Inshore fishermen are not marketing experts; they just want to go out, catch the fish, sell them today and do the same tomorrow.  In general terms, that has resulted in it being a world market rather than a niche market.  </p><p>  Deputy Michael McNamara referred to the market for Irish beef.  Rather than legislation, we might instead need awareness and an appetite.</p><p>  It is fair to say local is the new organic with reference to produce.  There is an increasing consumer desire for low carbon mile figures.  The proximity of Ireland to the rich natural fishing resources and the lower volume of diesel used by Irish fishermen in the search for fish are marketing points that might have benefits.  We are in the middle of a recession, but the high-end food market seems to be relatively recession-proof and perhaps this should be considered.</p><p>  There is a need to improve the awareness of consumers.  For example, what does the term "line-caught mackerel" mean to the average consumer?  Are consumers aware of the benefits of it not being towed in a trawl?  Are they aware that larger fish, rather than the smaller fish, will bite the bigger hook?  This is an example to simplify a very complex issue.</p><p>  The question of freezing fish was raised.  The Common Fisheries Policy is extending the fishery control regulation to the retail sector.  The descriptive labelling of fish as not previously frozen will become obligatory at retail level.  This will give an advantage to this type of fish product.  I have observed marketing ploys in use in some member states for terrestrial food, whereby the food is labelled to indicate that 30% of the retail price is returned to the primary producer.  There are ways available that do not require legislation.  However, as a regulator, I have to express the view that we need the courts to take seriously any non-conformance with labelling regulations.  It must be taken on board.  I acknowledge that it is not the end of the world, but any non-conformance with regulations misleads the consumer and needs to be taken seriously.</p><p>  Will I deal with the other direct questions?</p></speech>

Aquaculture products are labelled to indicate that they are farmed or non-farmed produce.  The legislation we regulate does not allow for inshore fisheries products to be labelled, nor does it provide for how it is labelled.  However, inshore fishermen can work with local companies, restaurants and hotels.  BIM will work with them to develop products for sale locally.  It is not really a legislative issue as much as a product development and marketing issue.</p></speech>

He asked about our role in the official control of exports of seafoods.  That is done at the processing plants located in Ireland.  This is a significant logistical challenge for the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority as it involves visiting each processing plant to inspect each consignment.  We have a legal obligation to inspect and certify consignments.  We have to drive to each processing plant each time a plant has a consignment going to another country.</p><p>  Imports of food into the European Union is a matter attracting particular EU scrutiny because once food comes into one member state such as Ireland, it has entry into the entire European Union.  Rotterdam is the largest importing port in the Union.  We have two designated border inspection ports in Ireland - Dublin Port and Shannon Airport.  Ireland is a net exporter of food rather than a net importer, while the European Union is a net importer of food, being the largest importing block for seafood in the world.  In round terms, seafood makes up approximately one in five consignments of food arriving in Dublin Port.  I do not have exact figures, but I can forward them to the Deputy.  We do not work at the border inspection ports; we provide technical support for the staff of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine who man the ports.  </p><p>  On the question of who inspects seafood imports such as shellfish into Ireland, live shellfish is not imported.  I note there is a representative present from the Irish health food association.  Ireland is a net exporter of shellfish, of which very little is consumed here.  Dead shellfish which have been processed such as Bangladeshi tiger prawns and Canadian frozen lobster are being imported.  These products are inspected at the border ports under a reciprocal relationship.  The onus is on the exporting country to provide the attestations which are then verified at the border inspection port by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We provide direct support for the inspection staff.</p></speech>

It can then come into Ireland through Rosslare, Cork Airport or any Irish entry port.  It does not have to be through a border inspection port.  As the border inspection port is known as the BIP, it is "bipped", so to speak, in Rotterdam and it is then subject to free trade within the European Union.  That is the basic principle of the Common Market.</p></speech>

It is important to understand Ireland's position on seafood.  Unfortunately, the vast majority of our seafood is sold in a commodity format.  Unquestionably, we need to move away from that system.  The future for the majority of Irish seafood must be in niche, high value production.</p><p>  I referred in my opening statement to the 35,000 tonnes of aquaculture product produced in 2012.  The European market for seafood is worth about &euro;55 billion per annum, totalling 15 million tonnes.  On a slow day the European market can take everything produced in Ireland.  That is the scale of the opportunity offered in Europe alone.  Even if we were to double our organic salmon production which is going to a niche market, the impact on the overall market would be minimal.  There are absolutely no health issues of any description to do with aquaculture or farmed salmon.</p><p>  On the marketing and development of sea fish versus aquaculture products, the marketing and promotion of Irish seafood are within the remit of our colleagues in Bord Bia.  From a business development perspective, BIM actively engages with the seafood sector.</p> <p>We are involved in areas such as value-added processing and assisting our processors to scale up and create more value-added products for the international and domestic markets.  In addition, we have a dedicated seafood development centre, the only one in Ireland, dedicated to the delivery of value-added products for Irish seafood companies ranging from small to very large companies.  The centre in Clonakilty has proved very successful in adapting a traditionally commodity-type focused product to a more value-added niche that is proving lucrative for many Irish companies.</p><p> Deputy McNamara asked about the budget split.  From a BIM perspective, with regard to fisheries and aquaculture, the fisheries and training budget for 2013, including capital and current spending, amounted to a total of &euro;2.32 million versus an aquaculture budget of &euro;1.4 million.</p><p> My colleague, Mr. Keatinge, will deal with the issue raised by Deputy Pringle regarding inshore fishermen and how we can provide a structure for them to take advantage of aquaculture.  My colleague, Mr. Maguire, will deal with the issue raised by Deputy Harrington regarding the potential for the development of the aquaculture industry.</p></speech>

Allied to that is the route to market as in the vehicle - not a physical vehicle but the business model - that takes the product to market.  We would focus very much on the physical infrastructure at the processing site.  For example, we assist companies financially to introduce new machinery that would add to the shelf life of some of that raw material.  Rather than trying to ship live raw material out of the country, we can develop value-added products with these companies to ensure such raw material has a longer shelf life and to help those companies access greater and more distant markets.</p><p>  Second, regarding the commercial vehicle or the route to market, we have a very successful route to market scheme available to all Irish seafood companies and collectives.  I gave the example earlier of where we had four companies throughout this country dealing with shellfish, specifically live crabs, which now export as one block to a Chinese market of 1.3 billion consumers, which they would not have had a hope of doing as individual companies.  We also have two companies dealing with live inshore products doing something similar.  That is the type of commercial vehicle we can help facilitate through our schemes and through the expert advice from our staff in Bord Iascaigh Mhara.</p></speech>

The figures are from a report of a standing scientific committee and are not BIM figures <i>per se</i>.  Unfortunately, there is no figure for the Shannon above Parteen.  It would not be a matter for me to discuss that with this committee, rather I would direct the Deputy towards the standing scientific committee who should make its full report available to him.  The point I was trying to extract is that there are a considerable number of wild salmon that are now available beyond the conservation limit, many of which are correctly exploited by the sea angling sector.  However, there remains an opportunity for the previous wild salmon catching sector, in particular those who did not avail of the buy-out, to access some of these fish.  That is an important point.  I recognise the specific difficulty that attaches to Arranmore because of its geographical location, but the wider point is more important, that there are scientifically assessed surplus fish.  We should be in a position to ensure, whether through diversification projects or otherwise, access to those fish for wild salmon fishermen.</p><p>  Moving on to the point about wider diversification opportunities in the context of training, the members of the committee will be aware that BIM maintains the National Fisheries College.  We have a campus in Greencastle and it has been established since the late 1960s.  We have a school in Castletownbere and we have two active mobile training units - we used to have three - which bring our training facilities right around the coast, in particular to those places that are far removed from Greencastle or Castletownbere.  Those dedicated professional staff have done a tremendous job over the years.  We do not simply provide training for fishermen.  We also provide it for aquaculturalists and work boat handlers.  We do passenger boat licensing for recreational fisherman.  The sea angling fraternity would do licences with us.  We are embarking on a new programme of extending that training deeper into the fishing industry at the deckhand level and on the day boat level.</p><p>  Specifically in terms of diversification, if the aquaculture sector develops, there is a need for more trained skilled persons to operate within that sector, whether it be to operate small boats, work on the farms and so on, and there is a range of training in which we would engage.  We look to colleagues to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta to work with us, and they have done so successfully for many years.  We also have a programme with local schools at transition year level in Connemara.  It is a wonderful programme that we have run for many years.  We normally run a training course on Inishmaan each summer with the local transition year students.</p><p>  One of the analyses I did recently for a report for our parent Department involved examining the annual economic returns for the past three years.  These are provisional reports.  I sound a note of caution to the committee regarding the numbers.  It appears, as we might have expected, that during recent years we have seen a drift back towards the fishing sector on the part of people who previously may have had jobs in the construction sector.  Some 150,000 jobs were lost in that sector.  In excess of 500 people have come back into the fishing industry in the past two to three years.  That is an important and perhaps overlooked fact.  Those people need training.  We will never perhaps reach a point where we are entirely accident free in any industry.  If we have learned one thing from Iceland, it is that managing the stocks is not about bringing in rafts of new legislation.  We can bring in legislation that states &quot;thou shalt wear a life jacket and thou shalt do X, Y and Z&quot;.  Managing the stocks is more about education rather than simple enforcement.  We did not come here today with a plea for additional legislation.  We need to create a culture of compliance, which is a term the SFPA has used very successfully, to generate an ethos of training.  That is something in which we strongly believe.</p><p>  In regard to inshore mackerel, we have developed, as part of our inshore initiative over the years, a small but highly successful line of caught mackerel fishery, and we assisted the inshore fishermen with hand gurneys to catch fish by line.  We have become a victim of our own success.  Even a small boat might take 20 tonnes or 30 tonnes in a season but if we have 1,000 people doing that, that amounts to 30,000 tonnes, which is half the apparently huge quota of 60,000 tonnes.   At times one can become a victim of one's own success.  We should not limit this solely to mackerel; we have done it with pollock.</p><p>  In terms of the work of the committee, if we consider brown crab, shrimp, lobster, crayfish, whelk, razorfish and a myriad of these stocks that are not subject to total allowable catch and quota, I reiterate my earlier point that managing these stocks is not about bringing in rafts of new legislation.  Managing them into the future is about co-operation and creating consensus within the fishing community.  I believe, but I will defer to Dr. Connolly, that all those stocks, almost without exception, could produce a higher yield.</p></speech>

We still maintain a number of very high-quality product certification standards, 2 ISO 65, to ensure quality, traceability, environmental sustainability and organic status.  It is hoped the bottom-grown mussels sector will gain Marine Stewardship Council certification.  We are constantly working on ways of finding market niches and supporting the industry through doing that.</p><p> With regard to the potential from aquaculture, in the immediate to medium term the targets for that are set out in Food Harvest 2020.  Those targets are ambitious but we believe they are achievable.  There is a difficulty with licensing and it is that issue with licensing that is the difference between Scotland and Ireland.  The Scots got off to a roaring start with salmon farming and in many ways it is because the ownership of the foreshore in Scotland is vested in the Crown Estate Commissioners, a rather ancient body but one with a strong commercial imperative, which took a decision that it wanted to push this industry hard.  Also, in the hinterland of the highlands of Scotland the land ownership is very different from Ireland.  In general, it is owned by a small number of people in very large estates.  At the time they also were enjoying income from this particular industry.  It got up to a critical mass very quickly, with little local opposition.  It also had a rapid licensing system in place.  As a result of confusion and difficulties, the industry in Ireland became embroiled in confusion over the sea lice issue and the famous rod licence debate.  It got snarled up at that stage and never got past the starting point because of difficulties with perception around the industry.</p><p> Unfortunately, in the interim, there was the 2007 judgment of the European Court of Justice against Ireland, which found that our aquaculture licensing system was essentially delinquent in so far as it did not properly take account of the birds and habitats directives.  There was a flaw in our system and as colleagues from the other agencies have described, the State side of things, including BIM and all the agencies here, have been playing catch-up to try to bring our system back into full compliance.</p><p> To answer Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's question about the identity of the competent authority, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is the consenting authority and as the consenting authority the onus falls on it to then satisfy the requirements of the directives.  Satisfying the requirements of the directives requires us to be able to carry out appropriate assessments in accordance with the directives.  The difficulty then was that when we went to do that we found that the necessary information and structures were not in place to allow us do it.  </p><p> There has been a grave difficulty in bringing the State into compliance with these issues.  Progress is being made but it is very slow.  We are all frustrated by that.  Even the officials in the Department suffer the same frustration, but there is no way around it.  We must deal with this matter and get it out of the way, and it will be crucial to get it out of the way if we are to achieve the targets set out in Food Harvest 2020.</p></speech>

The only currency in terms of getting the aquaculture industry to increase the outcomes from the industry is licensing.  It is the only game in town as far as I am concerned.  There is the willingness, the people are in place and the expertise is becoming available.  The international comparisons are frustrating, and Mr. Maguire explained the historical issues that have built up in that regard, but we still have a problem.  The baseline data are being compiled.  Roaring Water Bay, Castlemaine, Dundalk and other such areas are getting their baseline data in place but an issue remains.  For example, someone making an application for a licence in a bay that has already been dealt with such as Roaring Water Bay, and I do not know if licences apply there, will have to get somebody to interpret the environmental impact statement with respect to that baseline data, and that is not happening.  It is taking too long to get over that hump.  Mr. Maguire might give me some idea of the issue that arises in that regard.</p><p>  Another issue is that in some areas there are not any Natura sites.  The process on a site in western Scotland, from concept to harvest, takes two years.  In a non-Natura site here I am aware of applications that have been in since 2007.  That is very frustrating for those willing to make the investment, those looking for employment here and those who have concerns about the environment.  It is even frustrating for the opposition groups that are looking at this process for six years.  The perception is that one might engage with a process in the second year, even if one is objecting to it, and five years down the road it still has not been decided.  Many operators here just want to know if it is a "Yes" or a "No" in terms of the application.  I do not know how many licences it leads on to.  Mr. Maguire might indicate how long it takes to evaluate an environment impact statement, EIS, as part of a new licence.  How many licences are in the system that require that evaluation to take place?  That will give us some idea of how far we have moved on.  If we park the history and look forward, what is ahead of us?</p></speech>

The competent authority in these situations is always the consenting authority.  For a marine salmon farming licence, the competent authority must be the issuer of that licence, which is the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  There are a number of statutory consultation bodies which will be consulted when an application is made, including IFI.  It will be a statutory consultee in the process but the competent authority is the licensing issuing authority.</p></speech>

We narrowly avoided having daily fines imposed because of this delinquency on the part of the system.  To avoid that the State has had to get involved in a long series of negotiations with the Directorate-General for the Environment bringing colleagues from the National Parks and Wildlife Service and other agencies, along with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, to seek their agreement on the way forward.  That has resulted in this complex plan to try to bring the system back into compliance with the directives.</p><p>  Another problem that arose along with the difficulty with appropriate assessment was that our system did not have a formal way of declaring whether an individual project, apart from a salmon farming project, needed an EIS.  Shellfish projects also have to be vetted for EIS as well as dealing with the Natura 2000 issue.</p><p>  The short answer to the Deputy's question as to how long it will take is that we do not know because as yet nothing has come through fully from the new system from one end to the other.  We hope that is just about to happen in Castlemaine Harbour where the very first aquaculture licences that are in full compliance with all the directives are about to issue.</p> <p>Thereafter, it is hoped that as the system gains momentum and as custom and practice build up, the entire system will speed up.  However, nobody could give a straight answer in that regard at present.</p></speech>

If it concerns an application pertaining to an area designated under Natura 2000, it could take quite a long time.  Otherwise, an EIS could be assessed very quickly, that is, in a matter of weeks.  EISs for priority projects such as water treatment units may be assessed in less than a month.  They are very small documents.</p></speech>

We have got so much conflicting information on the effects of aquaculture.  Sea lice and escapees comprise a major issue.  The IFI has a view, to which it is entitled, and the industry has a view.  Does the delegation agree that the Marine Institute is the competent authority to adjudicate on and publish the scientific data on aquaculture, particularly in respect of sea lice and the effects of escapees on wild stocks and the environment?  Does Dr. Connolly have an opinion on how the current regulations or regime operates with regard to these issues?  The IFI, a State organisation, has a view that I believe is contrary to that suggested by the scientific data.  What is Dr. Connolly's view on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-30a.85" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Paul Connolly" time="16:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AG32013043000018#R00800"><p>There were three questions directed to me.  Deputy Pringle asked about seabass and whether the stopping of landings was a good idea.  At the time in question, the seabass stock was in a state of decline and people were worried about its vulnerability but that did not stop the trawlers out on the Celtic Sea from catching seabass.  One wonders, therefore, about the measure's effectiveness.</p><p>  This matter represents the classic dilemma associated with how one should maximise a resource.  Does one want to use the seabass resource exclusively for angling, with tourists coming to coastal areas exclusively for the fishing of seabass, with a view to protecting the stock?  On the other side of the argument, one must remember there are fishing vessels in the Celtic Sea fishing for whiting and haddock that catch seabass.  There will be a discard ban and this will force the issue as to how one wants to treat the resource of seabass and maximise its impact for coastal communities.</p><p>  Deputy Harrington asked about the perception about science.  There were two parts to his question, one on the scheduling of science and the other on the effectiveness of the science.  I will first talk about the schedule, making reference to the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES, and the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP.  The council deals with the provision of scientific advice to the European Union for the TAC species.  All the scientific analysis has been done for next year's quotas.  All the information has been gathered and we are carrying out the assessments of the stocks.  The advice will be issued in July for stocks such as cod, whiting and haddock and the remainder of the advice, on fish such as mackerel, will emerge in September.  The advice emerging in July and September gives the industry, which will be affected by it, a chance to examine it, determine its flaws and decide whether it agrees with it.  Ultimately, the European Union sets out its proposals for the next year in terms of quotas and TACs.  There is plenty of time for discussion.  The decisions are made at a meeting of the Council.  That is the position on the schedule.</p><p>  The Deputy commented on perception and asked whether the science is lagging behind.  A way to deal with the question is to give an example of what happened last year.  We work very closely with the industry.  In days gone by, science was viewed as coming down from the mountain with the tablets.  However, those days are gone because we work very closely with the industry.  If I had to show an example from last year, it would concern the prawn fishery in area VII, which includes the Irish Sea, the Celtic Sea and the sea off the west coast of Ireland.  It is worth &euro;33 million and is our most important fishery.  We envisaged problems with the way in which the European Union was going to cut the TAC.  We said the stock was not in bad shape and that there was no justification for the cut.  With the industry, we received funding to carry out additional surveys.  The surveys were carried out last June and July in co-operation with the industry; in fact, the industry funded some of them.  We did the science but there were no guarantees with it.  We said we would give credible, timely and relevant science.  We were able to use the scientific data obtained in July at the TAC negotiations in December and this resulted in an increase in the TACs for Ireland.  Therefore, the perception that science is lagging behind and not relevant is no longer pertinent.  That we are working closely with the industry forces science to be relevant, to see the problems within the industry and address them.</p><p>  Deputy Harrington's third question was on aquaculture, research and the sea lice issue.  The Marine Institute publishes scientific information on various aspects of sea lice interactions.  It publishes in peer-reviewed scientific journals.  The IFI does so also.  There has been a lot of what I would call "my science and your science" trying to justify certain cases.  However, I would be very reluctant to comment further on that because, at present, the Marine Institute is reviewing the EIS for Galway Bay aquaculture.  Since it involves a statutory process I would prefer not to comment further on that. </p></speech>

We have sat down with the individuals at numerous meetings on this specific application at our offices in Galway.  We embarked on a comprehensive scoping exercise before we conducted an environmental impact statement.  The purpose of that exercise, and of the meetings we held with the inshore fishermen before we conducted the environmental impact statement, was to identify the issues they felt should be considered in the environmental impact assessment that was to accompany our subsequent application.  Having discussed with the scientific experts in the Marine Institute the issues raised by the fishermen, including issues relating to the spawning grounds for shrimp, herring and whiting in the vicinity, we are comfortable that this farm will not have a significant impact on inshore fishing activities.  In fact, the custom and practice is that very little of the grounds of inshore fishermen is taken up by other fish farms around the coast.  They can shoot their pots right up to the anchors of these cages.  That can be seen around the coast, for example, in the case of the salmon cages on Clare Island.  We are very comfortable that there will not be any displacement.</p><p>  It is important to understand that a project of this nature and scale is not without impact.  We are comfortable that we have done everything possible to try to minimise the impact on inshore fishermen.  If we are lucky and successful in our application, we will continue to work with them to ensure any minimal impact that might occur is alleviated by other measures.  We have discussed those measures and the potential mitigating factors with them.  We will seek to implement them as part of the model we envisage as we move forward with this project.</p></speech>

Obviously, we are starting from a very disadvantaged position compared to our international competitors such as Scotland, which produces 160,000 tonnes; Norway, which produces 1.2 million tonnes; Chile, which produces 150,000 tonnes; and the Faroe Islands, which produce 50,000 tonnes.  We are at a considerable disadvantage.  We recently attended a major international seafood conference in Norway.  We presented our case and explained what we are doing as a country from an offshore aquaculture perspective.  Over 600 delegates from more than 40 countries attended the international conference.  The organisers announced that a session of next year's event will be dedicated to our plans for offshore aquaculture because Ireland is seen as a world leader in this regard.  They believe that many other nations are going to try to copy what we are trying to achieve.  Some of our competitors from Scotland have been in contact with us to see if they can access our plans.  They are very excited by what is happening here.  They think our ambitious vision for this sector is groundbreaking and they want to copy us.</p></speech>

I am conscious the overhead screen for most of the presentation has been on the final slide from Dr. Connolly which states an integrated marine plan should incorporate all other aspects, such as the marine leisure sector.  The Natura sites are managed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, the foreshore is the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government while the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is the competent authority in signing off on an aquaculture licence.  Therein lies the problem that is fixable from an Irish perspective, regardless of any other regulations and rules to which we have to adhere.</p><p>  When those of us who are not so fluent as Gaeilge see the full Official Report of today&rsquo;s proceedings, we will have a broader perspective.

I welcome from the Department Mr. Pat Macken, principal officer, Environment, International and Sustainable Development; Mr. Brendan O'Neill, senior adviser; and Mr. Fintan O'Connell, Presidency team.  I thank the gentlemen for attending.</p><p>  I draw the witnesses' attention to the fact that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l </i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  However, if you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, you are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise or make charges against a person, persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  Before commencing with the presentation I wish to make some brief remarks.  The environment action programmes have guided the development of EU environmental policy since 1971.  They provided a systematic approach in terms of tackling environmental issues.  They identified priorities, set targets and highlighted the need to integrate environmental policies with other policies.  </p><p>  The 6th Environmental Action Programme, which ended in 2012, worked towards establishing a framework for environmental policy within which a wide range of environmental legislation was consolidated and completed.  That covered a wide number of areas with the exception of one important issue, namely, soil.</p><p>  The question remains as to how committed are individual member states in terms of implementing the provisions of the environmental action programmes.  That is an area that must be addressed in the context of the 7th Environmental Action Programme being considered.</p><p>  I have been advised that the 7th Environmental Action Programme is more strategic in nature than the sixth.  I have been advised also that it sets out different priority objectives to be attained.  It is a very welcome development and I am interested in hearing today the way the Minister and the Department intend to meet those challenges and attain the priority objectives set within it.  It is also an interesting time given that we hold the Presidency for the first six months of this year.  It would be a nice legacy, in terms of Ireland's footprint on future European environmental policy, to have that issue dealt with constructively and, hopefully, before the Presidency concludes.  I call Mr. Macken to address the committee.</p></speech>

I may call on them occasionally during the presentation.</p><p>  I thank the Chairman for the invitation to address the committee this afternoon on the 7th Environment Action Programme.  As members will recall from previous discussions with this committee, the Irish Presidency has an ambitious environment agenda in terms of strategic policy, a very heavy international agenda, and a significant number of challenging legislative dossiers.  With just over eight weeks to go before the curtain falls on the seventh Irish Presidency, intensive efforts are being made to achieve the targets set for it.</p><p>  Thus far, good progress has been made across the range of priority dossiers identified in the Irish Presidency programme and we are still on course to achieve First Reading Agreement on our key priorities.  Already, First Reading Agreement has been achieved on two dossiers - the amendment to the emissions trading scheme in so far as aviation is concerned and the priority substances in water file - while work is continuing on securing agreement on other dossiers.</p> <p>These include two dossiers on CO<sub>2</sub>in cars and vans, a proposal on ship recycling, which is designed to ensure old ships are recycled in a way that does not damage the environment, a dossier on batteries, which will extend the scope of the ban on batteries using certain levels of cadmium and, of course, the seventh EAP itself.  Progress made is largely attributable to the intensive pre-Presidency planning in the 18 months leading up to the end of last year, about which we have previously spoken to the committee.  This involved active engagement at ministerial and official level with the EU Commission, Council secretariat and European Parliament on the putting together of the Irish Presidency programme.  Pre-planning has laid a solid foundation for the Presidency itself and, I am happy to say, we are well placed to achieve our key objectives.  Success in any area, however, is always dependent on the degree to which consensus can be achieved within the Council itself and with the Commission and Parliament.</p><p> The seventh environment action programme, or EAP, is a flagship priority for the Irish Presidency in the environment field.  As stated in the information note on the programme which has been circulated to members, environment action programmes have operated since the early 1970s to guide and drive policy and advance the environmental agenda in the European Union.  Despite failures to fully achieve desired outcomes in some areas, the programmes have provided strategic policy focus and direction and the actions identified have served to significantly advance the environmental and sustainable-development agendas.  The seventh EAP was developed against the background of Europe 2020, which was adopted by the European Council in 2010 and provides the overarching policy framework aimed at making Europe a smart, sustainable and inclusive economy and society.  As a flagship initiative on resource efficiency under Europe 2020, it sets out a path for advancing the transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient and resource-efficient future.  The seventh EAP seeks to operationalise the objectives of the resource-efficiency roadmap through a series of agreed actions.  The new EAP proposal, &quot;Living well, within the limits of our planet&quot;, was published by the European Commission on 29 November 2012<i>.</i> The proposal, when adopted, will succeed the sixth EAP, which expired in July 2012.  Currently, there is no EAP in place.</p><p> The path towards the formulation of the seventh EAP has been the subject of important guidance through three sets of Environment Council conclusions, most recently in June 2012, while the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling for a seventh programme in April 2012.  Ireland has been active in this development process since 2011 and made a submission as part of a consultation process undertaken by the Commission.  The priorities listed in the Irish submission focused on areas such as greater integration of environmental principles across all policy areas, better implementation of EU legislation, a focus on innovation, international issues and the urban environment, all of which were well reflected in the proposal that was ultimately published by the Commission.  We are now in a good position through our Presidency role to develop the necessary consensus across all of the main actors and, hopefully, bring this flagship dossier across the line.</p><p> The proposal for the seventh EAP is in the form of a decision to be adopted through co-decision by the European Parliament and the Council.  The seventh-EAP European Parliament rapporteur, Mr. Gaston Franco, was appointed in December 2012 and, at an early engagement, indicated his intention to work with the Irish Presidency to achieve a first reading agreement by June.  Mr. Franco and the chairman of the environment committee of the European Parliament attended the informal Council in Dublin last week.  As the briefing note circulated to the committee sets out the main elements covered by the EAP, I will not go into too much detail on them.  The seventh EAP sets out a strategic agenda for environmental policy with nine priority objectives to guide EU environment policy up to 2020.  For each priority objective, the rationale is set out in ten to 12 paragraphs, with actions and requirements specified to deliver the priority objectives by 2020.  These actions and requirements could be described as the operational side of the draft proposal and are the main focus of the negotiations.  The programme sets out a framework to support the achievement of the nine priority objectives through better implementation of EU environment law, state-of-the-art science, securing necessary investments in support of environment and climate change policy and improving the way environmental concerns and requirements are reflected in other policies.  The programme aims to boost efforts to help EU cities become more sustainable and improve the EU's capacity to meet regional and global environment and climate challenges.</p><p> The Irish Presidency has thus far held ten meetings<b></b>on the seventh EAP in the Council working party, the latest of which was held in Brussels yesterday.  An additional two meetings are planned for Thursday of this week and next Tuesday, respectively, to prepare for trilogues which involve the Presidency, on behalf of the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission.  This process has involved the Presidency seeking to build compromise and amend the text where required, while at the same time being conscious of the obligation to uphold the level of ambition in the seventh EAP.  We are not just seeking agreement for the sake of securing agreement but must ensure the final document is credible, environmentally ambitious and capable of achieving desired outcomes across the environmental agenda to 2020.  Inevitably, there is a distance to go to achieve consensus in a number of areas under discussion.  That said, we are pleased with the progress being made in what has been a very intensive process.  The areas where significant issues remain are narrowing.</p><p> The following main issues of concern for member states have been clarified in the Presidency redrafts of the seventh EAP and form part of the ongoing negotiations.  First, the proposed legislation on soil protection is still opposed by the same blocking minority that has rejected the outstanding Commission proposal since 2006.  The Presidency is trying to ensure that the seventh EAP includes action on soils in the period to 2020 and is striving to forge a compromise text that might gain a broad measure of support.  Second, the low-carbon roadmap to 2050 and references to mandatory targets for the climate and energy framework beyond 2020 pose difficulties for a number of member states.  Third, there are issues about the inclusion of references to the development of indicators and targets for resource efficiency and sustainable consumption and production.  Fourth, references to the treatment-of<b>-</b>chemicals legislation is proving to be contentious.  These discussions are complex and technical.  The fifth issue of concern is the proposal to fully implement the EU biodiversity strategy, which is priority objective 1.  Sixth, the issue of an environmental inspection support capacity at EU level raises questions and reluctance in a number of member states, although this issue has been clarified in the Presidency redrafts as an inspection support capacity to respond <i>inter alia</i>to member states' requests for assistance.<b></b>EU legislation in this area has been always an important issue for Ireland itself.  Seventh, the implementation of landfill proposals were initially problematic for some member states.  However, the revised wording on which we have been working to take account of postponements of targets under the landfill directive and provide clarity on the provisions under the waste framework directive have addressed these concerns.</p><p> More than 500 amendments to the Commission proposal were tabled for consideration in the European Parliament's environment committee.  Following the committee's vote on the amendments, the overall number was reduced to just over 200.  The committee also voted to give the rapporteur a mandate to enter into trilogues, which means the Presidency will be moving into a process of direct engagement with the Commission and the European Parliament in a series of trilogue meetings in the May-to-June period.  We look forward to engaging with the European Parliament in an open and constructive manner to rapidly achieve agreement on an ambitious and realistic seventh EAP which will help us all to &quot;live well, within the limits of our planet&quot;.  While success will be dependent on securing agreement between Council and Parliament, we are cautiously optimistic that we can get the flagship dossier over the line by the end of our Presidency.</p><p> I am happy to go into more detail on any issue and to answer any questions members of the joint committee may have.</p></speech>

I find it difficult to tie the two of those together.  I am trying to think of what will be the practical application of the seventh programme.  To get a sense of where people fit into this, I have been looking at some of the practical things that have been done elsewhere.  The Haringey carbon commission report was a positive initiative which involved a whole community.  It included measures such as low-carbon districts and steps to make people understand the practical issues.</p> <p>For example, the fall-off in the number of people insulating their homes - the environment issue straddles a number of Departments - is an indication that people do not completely buy into the process.  It appears that a lot of what is being done is from a top-down perspective.  I would like to hear what outcomes are expected as a consequence of our adopting this measure which would have a bottom-up element to them.  I believe buy-in by individual citizens and communities is incredibly important.  Can there be included in this measure a component such as the local government community initiative, which has been piloted in certain areas?  Is this likely to be an operational consequence of the strategic headings that will be developed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-30a.155" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Macken" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013043000005#E00200"><p>The thematic strategy of the sixth environment action programme was waste prevention and recycling.  As a result of a commitment in that programme, a new waste framework directive on recycling policies and so on was introduced, which drilled down to member state level through directives and policies.  Member states also took their own initiatives.  The action across Europe must be broad in nature.  As I said in my opening statement, the Europe 2020 strategy sets the broad canvass, as does the European sustainable development strategy.  We published our sustainable development strategy last year.  The aim is to set a narrative that will appeal across all sectors.  As such, the programme is broad in scope and contains nine separate priority objectives.  It tries to draw together all of these strands in a way that will be meaningful to Governments and civil society.  The Commission set out to do it in that particular way and it has worked quite well.  We are trying to maintain a narrative that will mobilise and drive action.</p><p>  In our experience, one of the problems with the previous environment action programme was that it became too prescriptive in terms of the inclusion of many different actions, some of which went nowhere in the end.  It became something of a Christmas tree and took a long time to negotiate.  We believe the Commission, guided by political debate at European Council level, did a good job in coming up with a coherent framework that would drive and focus action up to 2020.  It sets the broad policy strategy.  It also, as the Deputy stated, identifies priority areas in which there is currently a lack of progress.  This is based partly on an analysis of the previous environment action programme, in which gaps not properly addressed were identified.  For example, in terms of consumption and production, we still consume too many natural resources.  The aim is to break the link between economic growth and the consumption of natural resources through, for example, the green public procurement action plan, which is a practical measure we introduced and which features again in the current programme.  It is a strategy that seeks to bring together all of the different strands to integrate environmental principles across all areas, be they financial or economic areas.  It is seen as a type of platform for driving the environmental side up to 2020 and to ensure that environmental action is taken and integrated in areas such as the European semester.</p></speech>

Having read the background information to the action programme and listened to Mr. Macken's presentation, I have a couple of questions for him.  Perhaps Mr. Macken would give a brief explanation of the dossier on cars and vans.  We are currently experiencing problems with cars and vans, although they are regulatory rather than environmental problems.  It is an area that requires monitoring, particularly in terms of small businesses and what may be planned in that area.</p><p>  The main issue on which I wish to focus is that of climate change.  Mr. Macken's presentation states on page 3, "As a flagship initiative on resource efficiency under Europe 2020, it sets out a path for advancing the transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient and resource-efficient future".  Obviously, climate change legislation will have a huge impact in this regard.  Further down that page it states: "The priorities listed in the Irish submission focused on areas such a greater integration of environmental principles".  While there are only eight weeks remaining of our Presidency of the Council of the European Union, I would like to see a greater emphasis on climate change and the enactment here of the relevant legislation in this regard, which would make a statement to other European countries.  I believe we should use the remaining eight weeks of our Presidency of the European Council to try to accelerate that process.  I would welcome a comment from Mr. Macken on that matter.</p><p>  Climate change is front and centre of the nine priorities listed by Mr. Macken, particularly priorities Nos. 2 and 9.  On farming, forestry and our carbon footprint, it has been stated that up to one third of carbon emissions comes from the agriculture sector.  However, a mitigating factor in this regard is that feedstuff is not being hauled long distances, although that may not be true now owing to the fodder crisis.  Another mitigating factor is that farming takes place on open grassland and we have an extensive hedgerow system.  In terms of the action programme, how much work is being done by the Department in trying to assess this?  It is important we have an accurate picture in this regard.  I would welcome the enactment here of climate change legislation and for Ireland to be seen to be leading the way on this issue.  However, it is important we have an accurate and true assessment of where we are at in terms of carbon emissions and agriculture, taking into account the mitigating factors that may benefit the agri-food sector.  We do not want to have a negative impact on that sector if there is no need.  I would welcome a comment from Mr. Macken on that matter.</p><p>  What struck me about the priorities - Mr. Macken's response may be that what I am concerned about is already provided for in the detail of the priorities - is that there is no reference to the need to improve the efficiency of buildings, particularly homes.  Most people will be aware that many of the buildings and homes constructed here during the past 15 to 20 years do not contain wall insulation.  People are now having to have their homes insulated because developers and builders who made a fortune during that time did not put even cheap insulation in the cavities.  As such, we are playing catch-up in this area.  Also, our energy bill is huge and we are using an enormous amount of fossil fuel, much of which is imported, and this is affecting our economy, environment, household budgets and so on.  I believe this issue should be highlighted and included as a priority at European level.  We should also do our bit in terms of catching up in this area.  While I do not have detailed data on this, in my view, other European countries are way ahead of us.  As a northern European country, we have an obligation to catch up.</p></speech>

It is a question of embedding it in all policy areas.  The resource-efficiency benefits are substantial in terms of achieving greening of the economy.  There is much potential for jobs.  It is not just the environment sector that is saying this.  The OECD has produced a lot of work on this subject.  It has a publication called Towards Green Growth which states that, on a global basis and certainly on a European basis, it will not be possible to achieve previous levels of growth until we successfully address this issue.  We must take into account the environmental impact of whatever we do as part of the economic equation.  The cost must be factored in.  It is only when one does so that one can make real progress.  This is at the heart of the matter.</p><p>  Energy efficiency in housing is part of the equation.  We have done a lot in Ireland through the building regulations to improve energy efficiency.  There are grants and supports available for people who want to carry out energy-efficiency projects in their homes and buildings.  Buildings have been identified as comprising an area in which we can make significant progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective manner.  This has been central to policy for some time.</p><p>  We are not trying to put actions into the EAP.  This is an EU policy.  It spreads out and brings together all the various strands under which the detailed initiatives will be brought forward, be it through legislating on climate change, energy efficiency, eco-labelling or the Common Agricultural Policy.  These are matters for detailed discussion.  The mechanism does not in itself set targets; it seeks to identify broad areas and some specific areas in which we need to make progress.  Under member states' separate corpora of legislation, it will be a matter of making progress in these areas.  There are responsibilities placed on the European Union but there are also responsibilities placed on member states.  Housing, for example, is not a competence of the European Union, nor is spatial planning.  It is by working together and individually that member states can achieve progress.</p><p>  With regard to the climate change Bill, the outline heads and final climate policy report by the NESC secretariat are to be considered by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht and various stakeholders.  The Oireachtas will facilitate the debate on national policy and legislation in response to the outline heads of the Bill.  The Oireachtas committee has requested submissions from interested individuals and groups.  The closing date is 30 April.  The committee will be forwarding a report to the Minister by mid-2013.  The joint committee's report on the policy analysis by the NESC secretariat will be the key input for consideration by the Government in adopting a national policy position on the transition to a low-carbon future and finalising the introduction of climate legislation in the second half of 2013.  It is a matter of moving away from what is called the brown economy, which is based on fossil fuels, to a greener economy that has a lower impact on natural resources.  That is what we are trying to do under the new EAP and under Europe 2020 itself.</p></speech>

However, on the energy-efficiency issue and the amount of energy used in Northern Europe, never mind Ireland, which fares very badly by comparison with other countries, we need to catch up.  Mr. Macken referred to a brown economy.  Ours is purple; that is the fact of the matter.  While some progress has been made through Sustainable Energy Ireland and while there have been some improvements in energy efficiency, there are very many households and buildings, including public buildings, that are anything but energy-efficient.  Some of the county councils are trying to catch up but, unfortunately, we did not try to build energy-efficient homes during the building boom.  A considerable number of buildings are totally inefficient and we must now try to retrofit them.  As a State, we should do this.  In the medium term we could save money, and the project could pay for itself.  While we hold the Presidency of the European Union, we need to make a statement in this regard to other member states.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions.  Could the delegates tell me a little more on the legislation on soil protection?  They said there is a blocking minority.  What is the thinking on that?  I would have thought it would not be a difficulty.  What is the difficulty?  Do the delegates believe there will be a positive outcome in the negotiations on this?</p></speech>

If there is to be a programme to 2020 and there is no action in it on soils, it becomes an inaction plan rather than an action plan.  A substantial number of countries have blocked legislation that the Commission introduced in 2006.  A blocking minority is made up of some very large countries, including the Netherlands, Germany, the United Kingdom and France.  These are some of the key countries.  The Commission is still very much committed to the legislation, so there are two irreconcilable positions.  In the course of the negotiations, we have been trying to find a language that allows us to try to move the agenda along and unblock the blocking minority.  This issue will continue to arise until the end of the process.</p><p>  Much of the debate has focused on the fact that many member states comprising the blocking minority maintain that the competence in question is not an EU competence but a matter for member states themselves.  Some of the member states argue that they have many programmes in place to deal with contaminated lands and the issues of soil sealing and erosion, which are all major environmental problems.  We are trying to tackle this and come up with a language that we believe might work.  We cannot say with confidence yet how it will work.  As I stated in my presentation, the issues are narrowing down.  If we could narrow them down to this and perhaps one or two other issues in the final stages, we would be happy enough.</p><p>  My colleague Mr. Brendan O'Neill may have something technical to add.</p></speech>

There was a chapter on contaminated land.  The European Commission was proposing that the very systematic assessment of contaminated land would be such that the land would be checked bearing in mind its former use and chemical analysis would be done to determine the level of contamination.  Afterwards, one would put in place a remediation programme for all sites.  A number of member states felt this would be very expensive and difficult and that it was not a case of good prioritisation.  Many of the major member states felt it was a question of going to the sites that they knew presented serious risks and which would pose a danger to the population if they were used for schools, for example.  They are very much against checking everything more or less in the same way and they question the expense of remediation at the sites.  That is the main reason for the blockage.  The member states are seeking a more risk-based approach such that they would assess the risk associated with the activities that took place on the sites and then determine what needs to be done based on the proposed new use.  This is the main difficulty.  The Commission is insisting that there be a systematic approach.</p></speech>

There is a lack of public engagement on climate change, renewable energy, targets and all the challenges that face us nationally and globally.</p> <p>As part of this process, is there any Europe-wide public information plan or engagement, rather than leaving it to advocacy groups, to ensure there will be a more united approach taken by all member states to engage with communities?</p></speech>

The level of engagement with the citizen as part of the efficiency process is a concern.  We were concerned about it and had a discussion at the informal Environment Council last week which was attended by 21 environment Ministers.  We had a discussion on the issue of resource efficiency in terms of how to have greater engagement with the public and ensure greater trust in labelling, including eco-labelling.  We facilitated a discussion by a senior OECD person and it turned out to be an interesting debate in terms of how we could secure a buy-in.  It is all very well to say we want to promote a greener economy, the allocation of more resources and lower carbon emissions, but how do we mobilise public support in that regard?  There was a general discussion on that issue, which is indicative of the priority being given to it.  Citizen engagement is a live issue in the context of this proposal as it is being implemented.  We made a submission during the development phase of the EAP and stressed the importance of communicating with civil society.  That was one of the reasons we did not want the document to be written in officialese or legalese but as a coherent narrative that would mean something to people, whether it be groups or individuals in member states when it came to implement it.</p></speech>

That took a long time to enter people's consciousness and the use of primary schools to get the message across was effective.  We are now moving to a different level in having to focus on the 2020 targets, the level of energy to be sourced from renewables and how we will achieve this.  The general public needs to be informed that globally - never mind here - we have moved away from the use of fossil fuels.  How will we have an energy source to enable us to turn on the switch that we are so used to turning on, be it for cooking or heating?  There needs to be a big discussion in order that people will engage.  One can read specialised periodicals and watch the odd television programme, but at Government level there is a need for a programme of citizen engagement, starting at primary school level.  I hope that is something that will come from this.</p></speech>

It is interesting when we are in negotiations to listen to the problems other member states have.  Some of the eastern European states that recently acceded to the European Union have very high landfill rates, similar to what we had 20 years ago, and it is a question of them trying to come up to what is required.  It was a long road for us in that we had to put the necessary infrastructure in place and we had to have awareness campaigns, but one cannot have such campaigns unless there is progress on the ground.  Through the environment fund, landfill levies and the plastic bag levy, we were able to provide recycling centres around the country which enable the producers of responsibility schemes such as Repak to have very high recycling rates.  We have high recycling rates for packaging, about 70%, and level of WEEE recycling is more than twice the EU target.  With good awareness levels allied to institutional changes, infrastructure provision and development, one can move along and also create many jobs in the process.  There will be an opportunity for accession countries to create jobs in this area also.  Often low-skilled jobs in labour-intensive sectors such as recycling can be beneficial.</p><p>  The Deputy referred to moving to the next level.  We established a market development programme because we were reaching very high recycling levels.  It was aimed at trying to achieve added value for recovered waste resources and ensuring it would not all be shipped to the Far East and that processing would be undertaken here.  One of the products on which we concentrated was compost, for which we set a national standard in order that it would do what it said on the tin.  Farmers can have confidence in it and know that if it is used on their land, it complies with animal by-product regulations, veterinary regulations and so on.  We reach a certain level and to get above it one has to invest again in such a process.</p></speech>

There were recommendations not to do with where a recycling facility should be located but with a buy-in in terms of changing people's attitudes, which is a driver in its own right.  That is the point I was trying to make.  Is it possible to move towards a co-responsibility model that would involve more than imposing limits and would instead try to involve people in developing a low carbon, sustainable community in which they could live?  It is not only about involving schools; it involves everything from industry to the difficult issues such as public transport and so on.</p></speech>

When we were devising our sustainable development strategy, Our Sustainable Future, we were conscious that it was not just about a top-down approach; it has to be a bottom-up approach.  We have to have engagement at local level through various initiatives.  I was struck by a few aspects when we were developing the green economy document.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation brought out a document, Developing our Green Potential, but in compiling it it consulted other Departments, as we normally do.  We met many of the non-governmental organisations involved and asked them how we might create jobs.  People are actively engaged on the ground on the issue of how to create opportunities locally, whether it be in the area of biodiversity or natural habitats, to talk about our own sectors - I am sure the same applies to others - through engagement.  The local authorities' reform structures are meant to facilitate and pull all of this together.  Some interesting things were in done in Fingal, for example.  Interesting work was also done in Roscommon.  We see it as people being able to make a contribution.  The idea of sustainable development is about ensuring well-being, in other words, ensuring people are in a clean environment that meets good standards and that they have a decent life and engage and reach their potential.  It is a broad concept in that respect and, therefore, requires actions across every sector of society.  It is a dynamic scene.  We have met many of the people and communities involved and try to support them.  We also provide some funding for them.</p></speech>

We are in a different space in that regard, but the underlying challenge remains.  Has the divide between, say, Poland and its interest in the coal industry and the wider European agenda narrowed?  What is the status of the negotiations on the post-2020 targets?</p></speech>

There was a failure to reach agreement on the Council conclusions because of opposition in the Council.  However, the debate has moved on somewhat.  Discussions are taking place on a Green Paper which was before the informal Council last week not only the 2020 but on the 2030 vision.  Many businesses plan long term and the debate is moving on.  The process of political debate started in Dublin where we had a joint meeting of environment and energy Ministers to discuss the 2030 pathway document.</p> <p>There is a distance to travel in that regard.  As I outlined, in terms of our national strategy, the NESC report and so on, we will be moving to develop our own national strategies to make sure we meet the 2020 targets.  There are divisions and people are aware of them, but at the same time the challenge is not getting any easier.  We still have to try to meet the 2o plus 2o C target by 2050.  That issue was also discussed in Dublin as part of the international agenda.  </p><p> The Commission brought out a communication on the international climate change negotiations and it was the subject of discussions.  The Minister has made it the central focus of the Irish Presidency to try to have an early debate at political level on these issues.  That is always important in an EU context because these Council conclusions might sound somewhat official, but they provide political guidance which then guides the Commission in the way it shapes and writes policies.</p><p> Members can see from the environmental action programme, EAP, document that it takes on board the conclusions reached by Ministers and strives to strike a balance between being realistic in what it can achieve and at the same time having a good level of environmental ambition.  That is what we are trying to do in the negotiations.  Obviously, in the negotiations on the EAP, for example, there is always a push-back in respect of areas such as soil, but we have to try to counteract this and make sure there is a good balance struck in the document.  The document can achieve agreement but it might do more damage in the long run were it to lack credibility and not to be seen as a substantive contribution to the process of improving environmental standards in Europe.</p></speech>

It is not sufficient to turn them to silent mode.</p><p>  The first item on the agenda today is economic and monetary union and I am delighted to welcome our three guests from the Central Bank of Ireland, Professor Patrick Honohan, Mr. Patrick Brady and Mr. Colm Larkin.</p><p>  Today's meeting is the sixth in a series of meeting during the term of the Irish Presidency in which we are discussing Ireland and the European Union.  Today's session will focus on the implications for Ireland of an evolving European Union in terms of the proposed completion of EMU and the necessary steps to bolster democratic accountability and legitimacy across the Union.  Important steps have already been taken towards achieving a banking union during the first half of the six-month Irish Presidency.  We have seen the emergence at EU level of varying degrees of ambition by the European Council, the four Presidents and the European Commission, all in regard to the completion of economic and monetary union.</p><p>  Today, we will hear the views of the Governor of the Central Bank on the creation of a complete banking union.  We would also like to explore the outline plans for more integrated economic policy and fiscal frameworks, the so-called fiscal union, and whether Professor Honohan thinks they are realistic and in Ireland's interest.</p><p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

It is important work for a number of reasons, namely, the scale of the challenge to restore stability and create sustainable growth and jobs, and also because of the role of the joint committee in ensuring democratic participation and accountability on EU issues.</p> <p> The euro area in particular has been battered by the fallout from the great financial crisis that broke out in 2007.  When the flood of financial globalisation receded it exposed interrelated banking, fiscal and competitiveness weaknesses in many euro area countries.  Cross-border banking claims threatened to transmit weakness from stressed countries such as Greece, Portugal and ourselves to banks elsewhere in the monetary union.  The high indebtedness of some countries no longer seemed as easily supportable as had previously appeared, and even the stronger countries experienced sizable banking losses.</p><p> As we come out of that, accelerated balance sheet repair, associated with aggregate macroeconomic demand weakness, has meant that recovery has been slow and tentative.  This combination of pressures, primarily related to banking and wider financial sectors, as well as to macroeconomic and fiscal imbalances and divergences in competitiveness, has represented a significant challenge to the cohesion of the union.  Both borrowing countries and lenders became apprehensive and protective of their interests.  At certain moments in 2011-12 the combination of problems seemed to market participants to threaten the very sustainability of the institutional arrangements supporting the common currency.</p><p> While such fears have been allayed by the credibility of subsequent action, most notably the announcement of the outright monetary transactions, OMT, programme of the ECB, the wider need to rebuild trust and to strengthen the institutional architecture of the system is evident and confirmed in a general recognition that progress needs to be made on four dimensions, namely, banking, fiscal, economic, and political, as has been adumbrated in the report of the four Presidents of the European Council, the European Commission, the Eurogroup and the ECB last June.</p><p> I could range far and wide but it would be most appropriate for me to focus my remarks today chiefly on the banking pillar, a banking union.  We need banking union to transform the financial system from a source of risk and instability to a source of growth and support to the real economy.   We have made considerable progress in the euro area in recent months, especially under the Irish Presidency, in the construction of a banking union, but much remains to be done.</p><p> Announcement of action to build a banking union combined with the firm commitment of the ECB has contributed greatly over the past several months to the gradual but clear restoration of confidence in euro area financial markets.  I should stress that while it is not appropriate for me to touch on monetary policy issues today ahead of the ECB governing council meeting which will be held on Thursday, as this is a closed period for those immediate monetary policy issues, it is evident that, with some exceptions, sovereign spreads have generally declined in the stressed economies, not least in Ireland, and this trend has held even through the Cyprus situation.  The financial markets are counting on the completion of a banking union.  We must avoid any easing of tensions in the markets leading to a slackening in the pace of reform.</p><p> Banking Union, which involves shifting supervision of banks to the European level, combined with a single resolution regime and a common system for deposit protection, will reassure citizens and markets that a common, high level of prudential regulation is being consistently applied.  Together with greater fiscal and economic co-ordination, it will help build the necessary trust between member states which is a pre-condition for the introduction of common financial arrangements.</p><p> The Irish Presidency has given top priority to the banking union files.  At the Central Bank we have been heavily involved and a large number of my colleagues in the bank have been assisting in the discussions and the technical negotiations that have been happening around the large body of legislative reform that is required for banking union.  I should first mention that the Irish Presidency brokered final agreement on the capital requirements directive and regulation, CRDIV as it is called.  It is very complex and comprehensive legislation that is intended to strengthen capital and liquidity provisioning of Europe's banks and to improve governance and remuneration practices.  Because of this achievement it is expected to apply from January 2014.  Agreement has been also reached, following the informal ECOFIN held in Dublin a few weeks ago, on the single supervisory mechanism for banks in the euro area.  This will transfer bank supervisory tasks to the European level and will provide strong and consistent supervision.  Preparations are well advanced within the ECB to take on this task; it is one that will be performed by the ECB, for which active preparations are already under way, and this could happen as early as July 2014, depending on the formal implementation date.   It has been a remarkable success to obtain agreement on this proposal, for which credit is due to all concerned, within just seven months of its publication.</p><p> Attention is now focused on negotiations to agree a bank recovery and resolution directive.  This would ensure that authorities throughout Europe would have the means to intervene decisively when problems occur and that the costs of dealing with failing banks fall in a clearly defined rank order on the owners and creditors.  If we had only had some of that in the past, we would have been in a better position to handle the problems that hit us several years ago.  Ministers will discuss this text on 14 May and there is a target to reach agreement by the end of the Irish Presidency.  </p><p> Considerable progress has been also made on other items of legislation in the financial area and I will highlight those that are key to the banking union.  Linked to this is the need to get agreement on a common scheme of deposit guarantee funds throughout Europe, and it is also an objective of the Presidency.  However, the combination of a European supervisor of banks with responsibility for the resolution of bank failures remaining at the national level might not be a stable equilibrium.  We have got agreement so far on a common supervisor and we have very nearly got agreement on a recovery and resolution directive but it is a directive for national resolution authorities.  Having that imbalance between a European supervisor and a national resolving agency might not be a stable equilibrium in political economy terms, as individual member state governments might question and resent the imposition from the single supervisor of bank resolution requirements potentially including recapitalisation costs.  Clearly, supervision and resolution should be placed at the same level.  The need for this has been acknowledged at successive European Councils which affirmed that it is imperative to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns.  Now that there is agreement on a single supervisory mechanism it is especially important to press ahead with establishing a single resolution mechanism authority and a single deposit guarantee scheme.  I could continue at length about that, but I have laid out some of the elements and I would be pleased to hear members' questions.</p></speech>

I have a few questions for him.  At the time of the Heads of Government and State agreement last June a statement was made on Ireland's legacy investment - or legacy debt in the first instance - in our pillar  banks.  What is Professor Honohan's understanding of that decision?  Much of the talk since then has indicated that until a final agreement has been reached on banking union, Ireland will not be in a position to get an investment from the ESM in return for the investment that was made at that time.  What is Professor Honohan's view on that?</p><p>  On the bank recovery and resolution directive, obviously in the case of Cyprus depositors found themselves being bailed in.  Professor Honohan said that a European supervisor of banks with responsibility for the resolution of bank failures remaining at the national level may not be a equilibrium in political and economic terms.  How could the Irish State make direct guarantees, as it has done, that a bail-in situation for depositors would never be countenanced in Ireland if, as Professor Honohan has said, no agreement has been reached on banking resolution under the banking union programme that is under way?  Could we still find ourselves at the end of this process agreeing to a set of measures on a banking resolution that would countenance depositors bailing-in in the event of a catastrophic failure of a financial institution in this State?</p></speech>

Last month President Higgins visited the European Parliament and urged us to challenge the dominance of the mainstream neoclassical economics and our response to the crisis and many of its unproven hypotheses.  They are unproven but we wish we could call them untested.  Unfortunately they have been continuously and most thoroughly tested in this half decade of the austerity experiment.  I do not share the beliefs and assumptions that underpin the austerity experiment and the case for it has been continuously undermined from within.  Last year and again in early 2013 the IMF did concede to growth forecasts.  Its underestimation of the forecasts which seemed to be flawed was certainly problematic in terms of outcomes.  Has Professor Patrick Honohan any particular comments to make on that issue?</p></speech>

In regard to the mortgage directive, how will it benefit Irish consumers who have unsustainable mortgages?  By allowing greater competition in the mortgage market is the EU repeating the mistakes of the past by encouraging reckless lending as the only way of gaining competitive edge?  Following on from what has been said earlier in terms of the European Council meetings and the need to break the link between the banks and the sovereign, many of the ratings agencies have said that while mortgage arrears continue to rise there is a risk that bank losses will exceed the PCAR assumptions and hinder the recovery of the banking sector.  The chief economist at Davy Stockbrokers said he expects the main Irish banks' mortgage losses to exceed the &euro;9 billion envisaged in the 2011 stress tests.</p><p>  Last week, as part of the discussion on EMU and strengthening our economic integration, Dr. Alan Ahearne and Professor John McHale appeared before the committee.  Dr. Ahearne mentioned breaking the link between the banks and the sovereign.  When I asked how we could go about doing this he mentioned the single banking resolution and said the stress test should happen sooner rather than later to show if the banks are under-capitalised as investors are worried about the uncertainly around the banks as opposed to the fiscal situation in Ireland.  When I asked from where more capital would come, he mentioned that, perhaps, some European fund could be linked to the single resolution mechanism.  In terms of bailing-in he said it was not clear if policymakers would choose such action in the absence of a general lender of last resort to the banking system.  Perhaps I could have an opinion on the bailing-in, the lender of last resort, from where potential funding to capitalise banks would come, and the stress test.</p></speech>

I welcome Professor Patrick Honohan and his team from the Central Bank of Ireland.  Today is an important day as the Central Bank returns profits of &euro;1.4 billion to the State.  That is a successful outcome.</p><p>  The Central Bank is discussing the deposit guarantee fund at present.  Like Deputy Dooley I was taken aback that Professor Honohan in his position at the Central Bank, as a member of the European Central Bank, and, indeed, the Government would encourage, contemplate or support the Cypriot Government in taking a 10% cut or more from depositors.  That is something the Central Bank and the late Brian Lenihan protected here in the very critical period.  Were it not for that there would have been a flight of capital from this country and there would have been an enormous collapse of the banking system.  I compliment the Central Bank and the late Brian Lenihan on a very wise decision.  From a historical point of view as far as Cyprus is concerned, it has caused concern throughout the whole European Union.  That is the reason the deposit guarantee fund and a guarantee for deposits is vital.  There should be no doubt in the future that any of the 17 members of the European monetary union would be affected.</p><p>  The funding provided to the pillar banks and its release to small enterprises is a cause of grave concern.  What level of monitoring is being conducted by the Central Bank on AIB and Bank of Ireland?  I have experience of them doing extremely good work in releasing funds to small new start-up businesses.  However, some other companies are very concerned about the issue.  What level of monitoring is being conducted by the Central Bank in this regard?     </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-30a.188" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Patrick Honohan" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013043000004#C01300"><p>Those were interesting questions, some of which overlapped.  Let us start with the whole question of breaking the link between the sovereign and the banks.  When we were discussing and negotiating with the troika in November-December 2010 that was precisely the problem, namely, the international markets felt they did not know how bad the Irish banking situation would get.  That is what it thought three years ago.  It did not know the scale of the losses.  The Irish authorities were trying to pin it down but nobody could be sure.  That was the tail risk.  We thought we might be at a certain level.  That was the picture.</p><p>  We constantly said to the troika that this was the problem and asked if we could find a mechanism whereby the tail risk would be absorbed by some larger entity that had the capacity to absorb it.  We were prepared to pay for that but these were risks which were difficult for us to absorb.  The answer was "No, forget about it."  The troika said they were simple people and would only give loans.  There was no mechanism whereby it could take a direct capital stake in the banks or provide some insurance mechanism.  We did argue and take it up at all levels but all we got was "Forget about it, this is not part of the portfolio."</p><p>  That was the reason we were pleased to hear last summer that the Heads of State landed on the recognition that European funds could be used in that way, not just to lend a block of money to, for example, Spain to allow the Spanish Government to inject capital into its banks but to provide the money directly into Spanish banks as an investment.  They get their money back, perhaps, at a higher return but it reduced the indebtedness and the leverage in Spain.  The Spanish Government did not decide to follow that route.  It did not ask for that.  It borrowed money directly as the Spanish Government and used it to recapitalise its banks.  It did not go our route because its problem was that, relative to the size of the economy, it was smaller.  It could say it did not need to do that and, in any event, there was still an uphill struggle to negotiate that.  It was an agreement in principle with the Heads of State that this could be envisaged.</p><p>  If one wanted the money fast, presumably one would have had to go down the old route.  That has not really been activated yet.  I admit that in public statements from different parts of Europe there has been push back from other important policymakers who say there is no need to do this in practice.  I regret that.  It has meant that the Irish Government has, as we are all aware, put a very large sum of money into banks.  Some of that is lost forever but some of it is there just to keep the capital of the banks.</p> <p>When I last looked at it, there was over &euro;20 billion of accounting capital in the banks.  The Government had to put that in.  I would like to have seen more progress on that.  I do not want to argue the other person's side.  I tend to look at the other person's position.  When one is negotiating, one should know where the other person is coming from.  It is clear that strong countries are nervous that they will somehow end up doing something that looks like or can be presented as an investment, but is actually lost money.  That is still a work in progress.</p><p> Senator Reilly asked about the 2011 PCAR.  She wanted to know whether the losses are going to be greater than expected in that review.  This is something we are studying now.  We are preparing and doing a great deal of background work for our next PCAR, which is scheduled to take place in the latter part of the year.  That is still the timetable.  We are talking about the timetable.  We are considering whether we should do it a little later.  It will probably take place at the end of the year.  That is what we are going on now.  We have not landed on a number.  We are trying to do a great deal of detailed background work which would give us a bit more precision than we had the last time.  It is very hard to be precise on this.</p><p> There are some things that we know have worked out better than was expected in the spring of 2011.  For example, banks that decided to sell off assets in order to shrink their size have been able to sell those assets for prices that are better than those envisaged in the stress case.  That is a plus.  On the other hand, there are minuses.  Mortgage arrears have grown more rapidly than we expected or provided for.  They are just arrears - they are not losses.  We all know about the whole programme of getting the banks and their customers back on track.  It involves getting those who can afford to pay back onto their original schedules and designing some kind of sustainable solution for those who cannot afford to pay back.  The price of houses was another dimension in the PCAR calculations.  Immediately after the PCAR, house prices continued to fall faster than was provided for.  At a certain point, they were falling a little faster than was provided for in the stress case.  They stopped falling and are now above the stress case.  That is a plus.</p><p> There are many moving parts in this regard.  We have not landed on a number.  It is really not going to be a number.  I need to point out to people that bank capital needs in Ireland and elsewhere are increasing all the time.  This will lead me to another part of the question asked by Senator Leyden.  They are increasing because Europe and the world international regulators have decided that banks should hold more capital.  In other words, they should be funded more by risk-taking equity investors and less by depositors.  There is a target that says the banks will have to have more capital by 2019.  One can tell that the Irish banks will need more capital by 2019.  That does not necessarily mean we have to start putting money aside for that now.  We are hoping, planning and making every effort to get the banks into a situation where there is sufficient confidence on the part of investors that they will want to go and buy equity stakes in Irish banks again.</p><p> Last year or the year before last, Bank of Ireland sold equity stakes to US investors at what one might consider to be a pretty cheap price.  We want to get to a situation where all of the banks can sell equity stakes - there is sufficient confidence around them because their mortgage situation is under control.  To the extent that that works, all of the capital they need will be provided by the private sector.  That is the ideal situation.  When we announce the results of the PCAR, they will be in terms of a projection of likely further losses because we know there will be further losses, in terms of the period of time over which the additional capital that we know will be required will have to be provided and in terms of how much will be required.  We are also working on how that can be achieved.</p></speech>

We are actually talking about that right now while the troika is here.  We are considering whether to stick to that, adjust it a little or align it with what is being done elsewhere.  One of the things that has been in our minds all along in the European context is whether we need to align our capital assessment exercise with that of the European Banking Authority.  It is kind of messy to do them at different times.  One ends up using different assumptions and slightly different presentations.  There can be confusion.  Another factor, in addition to the European Banking Authority, has arisen since we announced our intention to do a PCAR.  The single supervisory mechanism will also do a stress test in two phases - an asset quality review and the stress test itself.  I can go into the details if the committee wants them.  It will be a two-phase thing.  It should be completed before the single supervisory mechanism is actually operational.  Therefore, it should be completed by the summer of 2014.  The European Banking Authority will line up with that in terms of timing and methodology.  For good order, it would be great to align them all together.  However, that would leave it a bit long.  People are interested in the Irish banks.  The market is interested.  The lenders are interested.  Maybe we cannot really leave it that long.  We are going to land on that pretty soon.  At the moment, plan A is to stick to September or October.</p><p>  I think that covers the first group of questions, which related to bank capital.  I was also asked a number of questions about Cyprus.  It is a bit delicate to talk about what has happened in respect of another country.  I do not want to go into chapter and verse.  Nobody is very pleased with the whole way the Cyprus situation has been worked out.  Some elements of it are good and move in the right direction.  Some elements were very bad.  Some elements were just medium bad.  On the whole, I do not think it was the best day's work.  I was also asked what it means for us.  I do not think it means an awful lot for us, to be perfectly honest.  There are many different contextual issues for us.  We have done the job, basically, for our banks.  One might ask &quot;what about the PCAR?&quot;.  Basically, <i>grosso modo</i>, we have done the job.  As Senator Leyden said, it protected everybody.  It protected everybody except the taxpayer.  It protected bank depositors and creditors here and in Europe.  We have had many discussions about whether it could have been done more cheaply.  It probably could have, on the night.  They were protected.  It is not on, politically, to be thinking in terms of a Cyprus solution.  First of all, there is no Cyprus problem.  It is not on, politically or domestically.  It is not needed.  It is not desirable.  I see no read-across.</p></speech>

Alternatively, will we have to adhere to a toolbox of measures that may be agreed as a universal standard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-30a.195" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Patrick Honohan" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013043000005#D00700"><p>The whole design of where we are going involves putting in a much larger buffer of capital.  I would actually go a lot higher than the level proposed in Basel III and CRD IV, which are lifting the capital buffers much higher than they were.  Between 3% and 5% of the liabilities of our main banks were in the form of equity.  As soon as that was wiped out, they were in trouble.  There would be a whole layer of different types of instruments - not just equity - that would be easier to bail into.</p> <p>When buying one of these instruments, it will be possible to know that one will get a bit more, that this bank can be trusted.  The cushion will be so high and also the quality of the regulation and supervision.  That is the mechanism.  In theory then after that, there will be creditors who would have to suffer losses before the taxpayer does.  However, nobody envisages it will get to the point of the small depositor or even the medium depositor.  I do not think this resolution directive should be a matter for investors to worry about.  In fact they get better clarity and, more important, they get better management of the banks because the old system with so little equity meant that banks which had started to get into trouble had an incentive to behave in a more reckless manner.  Now with so much equity at stake, they will be managed more prudently and cautiously - more like a public utility than some kind of high risk speculative activity.</p><p> Ms Phil Prendergast, MEP, asked about the position taken by President Higgins on the dominance of neoclassical economists.  I was amused at his recent remark about untested theories.  Since then, we have had a very high profile case in which some scholars discovered that they made mistakes and they had somewhat overstated their conclusions in this area.  In fact, the conclusions are still in the same direction but not as dramatic nor as convincing as they seemed to be.  One thing I like is that there is not so much labelling of neoclassical economists.  If somebody talks about neoclassical economists, it means they are anti-neoclassical economists.  Nobody who is a neoclassical economist will label themselves as such.  President Higgins also talks about radical individualism which is a wider context.  I would emphasise that side of his vision of where we should be and where we are not.</p><p> A lot has been learned about the strengths and weaknesses of different views of economics.  I would not agree that there is something called the austerity experiment where this is something we could choose - either the austerity experiment or some other experiment - and that we have backed this losing horse.  I do not think that is correct.  It is a concept of balance.  We know that governments all around have become very heavily indebted and that this has costs for the borrowing they want to make.  It creates uncertainty and it defers investment decisions.  In itself it produces these negative consequences which may not be as evident as the potential benefits of spending a little bit more on this high profile expenditure need or a decision to lower this politically sensitive tax rate.  That is a very direct and obvious apparent benefit but the consequence is the pressure on the indebtedness.  It is a question of balance.  As a result of what happened and because of the indebtedness - a lot of which came from the banking system and the imbalances in public expenditure after the revenue just vanished - it means that the correction has tilted over to a need to cut back.  There can be argy-bargy about by how much - perhaps the last billion or perhaps &euro;500 million more spending.</p><p> In the case of Ireland, we have discussed this in the Central Bank.  It may be different for big countries which have more ability to make judgment calls.  We are much more constrained here.  What was agreed with the troika was not beyond what we would have been recommending in terms of the need to get the house in order.  In fact, it might have been better to do it a little bit faster so that we would have it all done by now.  I am not saying we should go further; I am just saying that we should get it over with.  We would all probably be happier now if we thought we did not have to do any more but that is a matter of judgment.  It does not matter now because we are doing it according to the schedule and we are on track.</p></speech>

The question is whether one trades suffering now for suffering later.  It is not just a question of coming down on the lowest paid but rather it is a question of when.  Is it better early rather than later?  Can we get away with any less?  The answer is we cannot.  It is not just because of the troika.  If it had not been the troika, it would have been the markets.  In fact, it was the markets; the markets told us it was a case of no more, that we could not borrow any more.  We said we needed to borrow because the Government has expenditure needs.  Basically, the troika said that the market would not allow us to borrow, that it would loan us a bit more but we would need to get expenditure under control.  The troika members are our friends in this respect, even though I have fights with them over details.</p></speech>

One of the problems is the strict conditionality imposed by the ECB.  We do not have equally forceful measures to force investment or lending by the private banking sector to small and medium enterprises.  It seems the seesaw is skewed very much to one side and there is an imbalance or a disproportionate response for particular lending to SMEs.</p></speech>

We are very concerned with ensuring that while we repair the banks or while they are being repaired, that they can still provide the credit and services that are needed.  One may complain about the ECB as much as one likes.  For better or for worse, it has lent our banks enormous sums of money so that no bank comes to me and says, "We would lend more if only you could find us a bit more liquidity".  No bank says that because that is not their problem.  They do not lend probably because at all sorts of levels in a bank, decision-makers have become more risk-averse.  They have seen what has happened to their bank and their colleagues for making loans that went sour.  It is sort of easier to say "No" than to say "Yes".</p><p>  Everyone complains about not getting money from banks both in good times and in bad times.  On the question as to what extent the Irish banks are out of line now or if there is a danger that we are trying to push them into something more reckless as suggested by Senator Reilly, in so far as we can judge the Irish banks are still less prepared to make loans to small enterprises than banks in other parts of Europe.  The survey evidence still shows Ireland as being not as bad as Greece but over towards that end of the extreme.  However, we are not hearing so many anecdotal complaints.

I have three questions following on from Professor Honohan's contribution.  He made the point that supervision and resolution need to be placed at the same level and that if this does not happen, there will be a question of lack of equilibrium from a political economy point of view.</p> <p>My question is whether supervision and resolution at non-national level raise issues of equilibrium and democratic accountability.  A central pillar of how financial regulators have done their work to date has been the fact that they are politically independent.  They are not elected but appointed and are independent of the Government.  If there was a rerun of what happened from 2007 to 2010 and the decisions to deal with bank costs and bondholders were all made outside the country by people who were not elected by the Irish people or accountable to them, it would raise major questions about accountability, a central theme of what we are doing.  It does not just concern monetary union but also political union.  If major decisions on bank regulation and resolution are being made by authorities independent of national governments, as opposed to being independent within their jurisdiction, how do we square the circle and the expectations of people living in the countries affected?  It appears that a large part lies in the answers in which reference was made to equity buffers and the role of other mechanisms.  It appears we are heading towards other tensions that we should discuss.  I am interested in the contribution of the delegates on that point.</p><p> Whither the deposit guarantee scheme post what happened in Cyprus?  Questions will be raised about how we bolster the credibility of a new scheme, given what happened there.  Ms Phil Prendergast, MEP, put the question on the austerity experiment in Ireland.  In the case of a country that does not have its own currency and has massive borrowing requirements, if no one will lend, what is the choice except to close the gap, which is what we are trying to do?  I am interested in the perspective of the delegates on whether there are other options that were not apparent when these decisions were made.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-30a.206" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1030" speakername="Eric Byrne" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013043000007#F00200"><p>The topic is economic and monetary union, but I will play it by ear.  </p><p>  I apologise for interjecting, but I asked Professor John McHale and Dr. Alan Ahearne last week whether economists lived in a different world from politicians.  We do, but we are co-dependent.  From an economic point of view, I can see the argument that we should have inflicted more pain more quickly, but I ask the delegates to look at it from a political point of view.  We can overdose the patient to such a degree that there is a negative response such as social upheaval.</p><p>  I am more relaxed after two and a half years in government.  Neighbours were talking to each other and asking whether they should open bank accounts in England or Northern Ireland in the sterling area.  Others were talking about getting out of the eurozone and investing in dollars.  Others opted for silver and gold, but we have overcome that sense of insecurity.  The price of gold means it is not as sound an investment as it was supposed to be.</p><p>  In the banking sector, the delegates last week and this week touched on the investment in the Bank of Ireland by American investors.  Others are buying property all over the country and expecting to make a killing.  They are delighted to be investing here.  There is, therefore, some hope we are moving in the right direction.</p><p>  I thank the delegates for their presentation, which was illuminating.  We smiled collectively at the notion of the State picking up the tab for the bank.  As a nation, we are subject to criteria imposed by the troika.  Then we look at Cyprus and ask whether it is experimenting with the currency and on the stability issue.  It is applying different methodology to the banking crisis in different countries.  We would have wished that our day had come later in order that there would have been a separation of the sovereign from the banks.</p><p>  Unfortunately, last week the division bells rang and I could not hear his answer, but Dr. Alan Ahearne mentioned that it was the Government's position to get out of the programme in November or at the end of the year.  Professor John McHale mentioned our indebtedness, at 123% of GDP, which was very high.  Dr. Alan Ahearne said we should be careful as we might be jumping too soon.  Will the delegates give us an opinion on whether it will be appropriate to move at the end of the year?  Are we ready to move, given the GDP ratio of 123%?</p></speech>

This is the second or third time Professor Honohan and I have met, having met in a different context a couple of years ago at events in the constituency I represent.</p><p>  Do the delegates believe we will achieve banking union?  It appears we are on course to do so.  To what degree will it contribute to an opportunity to create a further stimulus for job creation?  There is some &euro;6 billion in the multi-annual financial framework for the purpose of job creation.  Can more money be allocated or will &euro;6 billion suffice?  Will banking union create a regulatory framework, whereby it will be easier and prudent to invest in job creation measures?  Nothing supersedes the need to create jobs across Europe, as the statistics from Spain and other countries demonstrate.  When can we move and to what degree will banking union enable us to do this?</p><p>  How confident are the delegates that we will receive help in dealing with the issue of legacy debt in the banking sector?  Will we break it?  If we do, I presume it will have major implications for our recovery.  I am interested in their prognosis and knowing how optimistic they are, despite the negative soundings in some parts of Europe.</p><p>  Professor Honohan has referred to the banks as being risk averse.  Depositors are equally risk averse in terms of investing in local initiatives or employment creation.  Am I correct in saying there is &euro;100 billion in savings in the country?  Will the delegates comment on how we can change people's lack of willingness to take risks?  If there was an overall context, it would make them more confident and would help.</p> <p>If we progress economic and monetary union with banking union to ensure the fitness of the economy and so on, we will have to face up to the issue of a debt write-off in a number of cases.  I appreciate this is a difficult issue.  However, from practical experience gained in listening to and meeting people, I assume a debt write-off will be necessary as part of the resolution of a considerable number of individual cases as the year progresses.  This would apply to debts of up to &euro;20,000.  Will Professor Honohan comment on the need for a debt write-off in individual cases?  Will he also comment on how workable the American model of printing more money would be in a European context?  These points are put to us as we go about our daily work and it will be interesting to hear his response to them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-30a.209" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1076" speakername="Dominic Hannigan" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013043000008#G00200"><p>I have a few questions of my own for Professor Honohan.  We have seen major developments in economic and fiscal policy during the past few years.  We had the introduction of the six-pack legislation at European level.  We also had a referendum on the fiscal compact treaty.  The two-pack legislation is coming down the line, but we still do not have the capacity to access any kind of shock absorption fund to help countries in financial difficulty.  Does Professor Honohan have a view on whether such a fund would be useful and, if so, does he have thoughts on how it could be paid for?</p><p>  My second question relates to something Professor Honohan said and I may have cut him off a little early.  I ask him to address this question first, as it would allow him to finish the point he was making.  He referred to people involved in the bank lending sector as being risk averse and to the fact that might be one of the reasons the amount in loans being approved was lower than it should be.  When we were at school, if a teacher failed too many students, there would be a mark-up.  Surely there is a role in this instance for the authorities and the Central Bank to examine how the marking system is working and if it is clear too many businesses are failing to receive credit compared to the position in other European banks, perhaps we need to do something about it.  From speaking to business people in my county of Meath, including a businessman from Ashbourne who is trying to obtain funding for a business expansion scheme, they find it very difficult to gain access to credit, which they find strange bearing in mind all of the money that has been put into the banks and having heard all politicians talk about how much the money there is available for banks to lend.  They do not see this as the reality on the ground.  Professor Honohan might address this question first as he had half addressed it before I interrupted him.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-30a.210" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Patrick Honohan" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013043000008#G00300"><p>A wide range of questions have been asked.  I will start with the Chairman's question because we were dealing with that point.  It is not an easy one with which to deal.  He gave the analogy of a teacher and a headmaster or headmistress who would say a teacher was being too hard on the students and ask the teacher to lift their scores and to score them on a curve.  Our role is not exactly like that because in the Central Bank we do not claim to be super duper bankers.  We are trying to ensure the banks are run properly, that they are not moving towards a situation where they will cause losses for everybody and that they deal fairly with their customers.  We have all of the consumer protection mechanisms in place.  However, if a bank does not have the capacity to make good lending decisions, it will fall back in its profit performance and lose out on other customers, which would not be good for it either.  We do not pretend to check everything they do, but we do monitor how they go about their business.  Their big business in SME financing is to work with the customers who are exposed through over-indebtedness.  Members may ask what about new people, but the customers who are over-indebted are also the potential phoenixes and many of them have a variety of businesses.  One or two or perhaps a core business could move forward but it is being dragged down by a property development on the side and the borrower as a whole is not creditworthy.  What the bank has to do and wants to do in such a case - it takes many resources and a long time to do it - is to get a picture of the borrower's situation as a whole and decide that it cannot pay that amount.  It could have a good business in terms of the rest of it and sort it out in that way.</p><p>  Deputy Joe O'Reilly spoke about write-downs and write-offs, but more broadly what is required is a restructuring of relationships.  Borrowers may be able to pay off the debt over a longer period of time, but it needs to be structured in such a way that the viable elements can move forward.  We are so long into the crisis that one would think the banks would have done this by now.  They are getting on top of it and some banks are better than others.  However, some are very behind to this issue, while some are motoring ahead, but it is complex.  That is the area about which probably many of the complaints may have been heard.  People said they were not getting money from the banks.  The reason was they were deeply under water and their situations were complicated to work out.  We have been monitoring and pressing the banks to improve the position and get their hands around this aspect.  Very often it involves indebtedness to different banks or lenders, which is also true of the household sector.  There is unsecured and secured lending.  As members will know, in such cases we have been facilitating dialogue between the secured and unsecured parties to get them to agree to deal with the matter in a way that they will not be blocked and to avoid them saying they will not do anything until the other party does something first.  We have been getting them together.  We are working on the matter, but it is not a question of saying to the banks they have to ratchet up their approvals ratio.  If we do this, they will say the Central Bank told them to lend and then when things go bad, they will say the bank told them to do it and that it should bail them out.  They have to make the credit decisions.  That is not a great answer, but it is the best I can do.  </p><p>  I note Senator Terry Leyden has left.  The establishment of the Credit Review Office was an innovation introduced by the late Brian Lenihan.  It was innovative.  Some inspirations from operations in other countries fed into it, but it was a home grown idea.  It is a small office, but Mr. Trethowan has done a great job to sensitise the banks that the nation will be dissatisfied if they keep on turning down viable credit customers.  When an applicant refers what he or she considers to be a proposal that was turned down by the banks to the Credit Review Office, Mr. Trethowan will examine it and say it was not such a good proposal and that the applicant should go away or, in many cases, he will say it is a good proposal and that he will contact the banks and often they will say they will have another look at it.  It involves a surprisingly small number of cases.  SME lending forms a small part of the business of the banks, as they were into property and other things.  I do not know if I can say much more on the issue.</p><p>   Deputy Joe O'Reilly asked about European funds being used to augment measures.  The European Investment Bank is assisting.  There were blockages up until now because suddenly the ratings of Ireland and other countries were lower and started to block some of the programmes of the European Investment Bank because these programmes required a co-guarantee from the national government.  Some of these blockages have been removed and that lending is going ahead.  That is a wider initiative.  I do not expect banking union <i>per se</i> to lead to turning on a flow of resources in that way.</p> <p> I will come back to Deputy Paschal Donohoe's question about democratic accountability and removing all of these items - bank supervision and resolution - from national control.  That is one way of thinking about it.  Another way is that we all use the products from Microsoft Corporation, Apple and so on, but we do not expect to have national control over software, although there is some.  We buy in these services and, to some extent, should get away from the re-nationalisation of banking which has tended to come with the crisis and use banking services as if they were a Europe-wide service.  In the 1980s the first banking directives envisaged a pan-European banking system, such that if one received a licence in France or Ireland, one could bank anywhere in Europe.  The designers of that system imagined that eventually there would be a lot of cross-border banking activity, even at the retail level, and that we would move to a state where we would buy our computers from Dell, Microsoft, Apple and so forth and our banking services from whoever else was strong in the marketplace and that it would not be a national but a European system.  I do not see any problem with this.  However, we did not reach this for market structure reasons.  It was not the way banking went.  If it had been all foreign banks which had lent to us for the purchase of residential property and so on, we would be laughing.  We had a number of foreign banks lending, including Ulster Bank, Bank of Scotland Ireland and so on.  What happened to them?  The Government did not bail them out.  They were bailed out by their shareholders and the British Government had to put its hand in its pocket also.</p><p> I refer to getting to a situation where banking union is not just centrally controlled in terms of supervision and resolution.  I am not against a degree of local banking.  International banking concerns have been no less anonymous than the large banks we now have.  Of course, one has community banking also, but for the big ticket items, if it is seen as mechanical rather than something tied in with national political pressures, banking works best.</p></speech>

I think somebody said banks lived globally but died locally.  Let us say we reach this point again, that by that stage the ESM is able to directly recapitalise banks and that the people running it make the decision that before it can directly capitalise banks, the Irish taxpayer has to make a contribution to it, all of these decisions would be made by people not part of any national body or not accountable to the Government, let alone the Oireachtas.  Does that then not throw up another question of accountability that is as big as anything we have dealt with to date?</p></speech>

I heard on the news today that he had given back a fair chunk of his salary, for which I thank him.  It is a very important gesture of goodwill and solidarity with families and working people who are finding it difficult and at the coalface of the austerity experiment.</p><p>  A couple of weeks ago we heard the former chief of the IMF, Ashoka Mody, say with great clarity and the benefit of hindsight that perhaps we had done and expected too much.  There is an argument that we should have laid it all out on the line, made the more difficult cuts and difficult decisions early on and got them out of the way, instead of stringing it out.  Where does that leave us in tackling the legacy debt?  Does it strengthen the Government's hand that we have people like Ashoka Mody on our side in acknowledging that perhaps we expected too much too soon?</p></speech>

I welcome Professor Honohan's exhortation to banks to continue with restructuring.  I know he is being proactive in arranging this and that there are targets in that respect.  A colleague of mine puts it to me regularly at our party meetings that we should adopt the Japanese model, expand the length of mortgages from 30 to 40 years and let mortgages be inter-generational and that that is how we should deal with a number of the mortgages in distress.  I would be interested in hearing Professor Honohan's response to this as a solution to an Irish difficulty.  If our clinic work is any indicator, there are large numbers and perhaps that might be the solution.</p></speech>

One of the questions he asked was about exiting from the programme.  One year ago a couple of seemingly well informed people from abroad came to me and said we would not get out of this programme at the end of 2013 and that it was a joke.  I said to wait and see.  Now the mood is completely different.  Why does mood matter?  It matters because it is about the NTMA and Mr. John Corrigan and his colleagues selling Irish Government bonds to people who know they will be repaid.  That is what has been happening because the Government has chosen a programme - one might not like it - to which it is sticking.  That is what is giving credibility.  At this point, it seems that exit on schedule is perfectly feasible; therefore, let us hope no great disturbances hit us from outer space.  That is plan A.  Of course, we can see how things go.  There are more gradual ways of doing it, but for now that is the plan and it looks feasible.</p><p>  The point Deputy Eric Byrne made about Cyprus is not coming to me.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-30a.219" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1030" speakername="Eric Byrne" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013043000010#J00100"><p>What about the ratio of 123% of GDP?  Does Professor Honohan have an opinion on whether we can exit the programme with a debt ratio that high?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-30a.220" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Patrick Honohan" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013043000010#J00200"><p>I do not hold a strong view one way or the other.  There is no doubt that 123% is a high debt ratio but some countries have higher figures.  We got it down remarkably quickly before in the 1980s, if the Deputy can remember what happened then.  It reached a peak in 1987 or early 1988 and within 20 years we were down to a figure of 27% or thereabouts.  It will not be as easy the second time, but we can get away from 123%.  By the way, this figure includes a large cash balance which has built up and we are in a comfortable position to move forward and fund ourselves on the basis of our own credibility.</p><p>  With regard to the question of whether the Europeans help us, we are always talking about them helping us, but that is a little like the b&eacute;al bocht.  One must be sparing and careful in dealing with this matter.  When we entered into the programme, things were not as we would have liked.  I have already talked about insurance against tail risk, but we did not like the interest rate because to us it seemed very high.  We knew that it was what was available but that it could be negotiated downwards.  A lot has been negotiated and the term has been pushed out - Deputy Joe O'Reilly talked about intergenerational mortgages - both for the explicit loans and the promissory notes.  This represents a very considerable easing.  The lowering of the interest rate means that our worries about interest rate levels on the European loans have gone away and we are in a much better position than we were.  Should we be looking for more?  I am sure that it is the Government's business to look for as much as it can in as shrewd a way as possible.  Disciplined behaviour is the key in order that the other parties do not think that these are people who will never stop asking them.  </p><p>  One of the issues raised was whether should there be a fund or a way to mutualise debt in Europe.  This is forward looking rather than backward looking.  It is much harder to negotiate about bygones.  Part of the vision of the European Union, the fiscal dimension, is that there be a greater degree of common decision-making and, therefore, common responsibility and perhaps common mutualisation of indebtedness in the long run.  That is where this is bringing us, but at what speed I do not know.  It requires not just a greater move towards fiscal union but also the democratic legitimacy that goes with it, as otherwise it will not happen.  Borrowers and lenders must be satisfied about its democratic legitimacy.  This is one of the things, as I attend a European affairs committee, that concerns me most - that and what I used to experience in meetings 20 or 30 years ago.  The crisis has eroded trust in the European Union.  Those of us involved in European affairs, like members of the committee, feel this.  Therefore, we need to rebuild it, particularly along the fault line of borrowing and lending.  It can be done.  It is a challenging political process and presents a challenge to institutional design in order that not only do people trust each other as good people with whom to deal, but also that they deal within a system of rules and understandings that works fairly for both sides.  That is a big challenge.  The decision-making structures in Europe must also be improved because so many decisions have had to be taken in a rush late at night.</p><p>  One of the questions was related to a deposit guarantee scheme.  Let us take a look at the situation in Cyprus.  A lot of damage was done by the first decision to be taken.  The attitude was whatever about a deposit guarantee scheme, money could be taken from deposits.  On consideration, nobody thought it was a good idea.  People looked around and asked from where had the idea come.  I think it came from an inadequate process and the decision-making process was under pressure in unsuitable circumstances.  It will take time to restore confidence.  I do not know whether it has had that much of an impact, but people are talking about the matter.  I have often spoken to people about the components of banking union, supervision, resolution and deposit guarantee.  They chose to leave the deposit guarantee and did not view the matter as being urgent.  Now, because of what happened in Cyprus, there is no way the issue of a deposit guarantee can be taken off the table.  Of course, when it is at European level, people stop worrying about it.</p></speech>

The subject matter of the meeting is the European semester process which aims to secure lasting stability through a new system of economic policy co-ordination among member states.  It is designed to ensure member states align their budgetary and economic policies with their obligations.  Its ultimate purpose is to underpin sustainable economic growth to facilitate job creation and renew social cohesion across Europe in line with the Europe 2020 strategy.  The format of the meeting involves opening remarks from the Minister which will be followed by a question and answer session.</p><p>  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.

I look forward to a constructive discussion.  The stability programme was approved by the Government at today's Cabinet meeting which concluded at approximately 2.30 p.m.  The statement on the programme was circulated to the members of the joint committee at approximately 3 p.m.  They were the first to receive an update on the programme.  I will open by providing the committee with an overview of the process involved in the programme and a synopsis of the outlook for the economy in the short and medium term before moving to a discussion of the public finances and an overview of our obligations under the fiscal compact.</p> <p>I intend to open by giving an overview of the process involved and a synopsis of the outlook for the economy over the short and medium term before moving on to the public finances and an overview of our obligations under the fiscal compact.  I will then respond briefly to the most recent report of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, following which I will be happy to take questions and comments from committee members.</p><p> A number of important improvements were made recently to the budgetary system both at a national level and, in response to the changing fiscal architecture, at a European level.  As part of the new European semester process, each EU member state submits a stability or convergence programme to the European Commission in April of every year.  The stability programme sets out the official macroeconomic and fiscal policies for the following years.  The policies are subject to peer review and recommendations are made for each member state to ensure that the policies set out have a euro area and EU dimension.  The document has been laid before the Houses and I intend to submit it to the European Commission following this discussion.  The Stability and Growth Pact requires us to set out our economic and fiscal projections for the current year and the following three years.  Therefore, the current stability programme sets out the economic and fiscal position to 2016.  At a national level, these forecasts set the scene for discussions that will take place over the summer in advance of budget 2014.  The recent agreement on the two-pack of European regulations means the budget will be delivered in mid-October, earlier than in previous years.</p><p> I will now focus on the Irish economy and the outlook over the short and medium term.  Having returned to growth in 2011, Ireland had a second successive year of growth in 2012.  Preliminary figures show that real GDP increased by 0.9% in 2012.  As is typical in small open economies such as Ireland's, the traded sector is leading the recovery, with exports growing by approximately 3% in 2012.  This owes much to the significant price and cost adjustments that have taken place in recent years.  However, within exports we are seeing some divergences.  Goods exports are falling for the first time since 2009 in response to the general slowdown in our trading partners and product-specific developments, most notably in the pharma-chem sector - the often-mentioned pharmaceutical "patent cliff".  By comparison, services performed strongly in 2012 and saw close to double-digit growth, driven by increased exports of business and IT services.  In difficult international circumstances, the performance of the services sector is particularly impressive.</p><p> There has been a significant improvement in economy-wide cost competitiveness.  The European Commission estimates that Ireland's nominal unit labour costs relative to those in the euro area have improved by 23% over the period 2008-2014.  This is a result of the wage restraint shown by the private sector, pay reductions in the private sector and productivity improvements achieved across the economy.  High-frequency data on the domestic economy provide a tentatively positive picture, with private consumption and investment increasing in the second half of last year.  Disposable household income rose over the course of last year while the household savings rate declined from the second quarter onwards.  Despite the recent dip in March, core retail sales were in consistent positive territory in the seven months to February and underpin the stabilisation in domestic demand.</p><p> Employment growth resumed in the second half of last year.  The unemployment rate is now falling.  Although it remained at the still too-high level of 14% in March, it has decreased from a peak of 15% in February 2012.  I want to stress that the Government does not see the employment and unemployment forecasts contained within the SPU as targets.  They are independent forecasts prepared by Department officials.  I expect these forecasts will improve as the job creation measures in the budget, the Action Plan for Jobs and the infrastructure investment plans take hold.</p><p> On the economic outlook, my Department has made a modest downward revision to the macroeconomic forecasts for 2013-2015 compared to those which underpinned budget 2013.  My Department expects GDP to grow by 1.3% this year, with a return to growth in employment and a fall in unemployment.  This revision incorporates compositional changes to growth.  Domestic demand has been revised slightly upwards on the back of recent high-frequency data, to which I referred already.  This revision to domestic demand has led to a slightly more positive revision to employment growth in 2013.  The contribution from exports has been revised downwards as the global economy remains weak and the impact of the patent cliff is weighing on pharma exports.  We expect this process of GDP and employment growth to continue in 2014 and beyond, although a key risk to the forecast is, of course, economic developments in trading partners.  Inflation is set to remain low, contributing further to the improvement in competitiveness that has been evident in Ireland since 2008.</p><p> As is always the case with forecasting, the baseline scenario hinges on a number of crucial assumptions.  The stability programme contains a quantitative assessment of the impact on the economy of a number of different scenarios.  Risks to the forecasts come from internal and external sources.  Externally, a more prolonged downturn in key trading partners as a result of a more protracted period of deleveraging in advanced economies or any reignition of the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area would have a negative impact on these forecasts.  Domestically, any unexpected increase in interest rates or acceleration in the pace of debt reduction could have a negative impact on domestic demand.  Upside risks may present themselves if there is a stronger than assumed global recovery, while domestically, a return to more normal levels of investment from the current low base could boost growth once business confidence and credit conditions are supportive.  Increased certainty regarding future prospects could reduce the level of precautionary savings by households, potentially boosting domestic demand.</p><p> On the fiscal front, a deficit of 7.6% has recently been estimated for 2012 by the CSO.  This represents a significant improvement on the underlying position in 2011, when a deficit of 9.1% was recorded, and is well within the ceiling of 8.6% set by the ECOFIN Council, which sets out a path to achieving a correction of the excessive deficit by 2015.</p><p> Turning to this year, a number of developments since budget time have had an impact on the deficit for this year, but in aggregate terms they broadly off-set each other.  These developments include a better than expected fiscal position at the end of 2012, the replacement of the promissory notes with long-term Government bonds, the sales of interest-bearing stakes in the financial sector and, of course, the on-target quarter-one 2013 Exchequer outturn, as well as first quarter economic data.  This is the first articulation of fiscal policy in the aftermath of February's promissory note deal.  As is standard budgetary procedure, the Government will make decisions in light of these developments and policy priorities at budget time.  Therefore, the SPU makes a necessary but purely technical assumption that the proceeds of the promissory note savings are allocated to deficit reduction and that the consolidation amounts I outlined at budget time remain unchanged.  The utilisation of these savings will be determined as part of the budgetary process.</p><p> Looking at this year, the revised forecast is for the deficit to improve to 7.4%, which is within the 7.5% ceiling set as part of the excessive deficit procedure.  Importantly, the primary balance, which excludes interest payments, is set to turn positive in 2014 and move into a significant surplus in later years.  In turn, gross debt is set to peak this year at 123% of GDP and return to a downward path afterwards.  While this represents a small deterioration relative to budget time, it is important to note that the increase is reflective of the NTMA's successful engagement with the market in the first months of this year.  It is not because of any deterioration in the underlying fiscal position.  Indeed, the 2013 net debt position has improved marginally from budget time and is estimated at 98% of GDP.</p> <p>In line with European guidelines, the SPU sets out updates on long-term fiscal sustainability, institutional reform of the public finances and quantitative risk analysis for macroeconomic and public finances.</p><p> The European fiscal rule book has changed considerably in recent years with the adoption of the six-pack in 2011, the fiscal compact in 2012 and the recent breakthrough on the two-pack under the Irish Presidency.  In a nutshell, member states are required to be at their medium-term budget objective, the so-called MTO, or, if not, they should be on an adjustment path towards it.  The MTO is defined as a budgetary position that safeguards against the risk of reaching the 3% of GDP threshold, ensuring the long-term sustainability of public finances.</p><p> For Ireland, this is a balanced budget in structural terms.  More specifically, this involves a budgetary position where general Government revenues and expenditure are equal in a given year once the correction for the position in the economic cycle has been made.  For illustrative purposes, today's stability programme sets out the adjustment path between 2016 and 2019, which takes us towards our MTO.  It allows for revenues to grow in line with nominal GDP and for modest increases in expenditure over the period.  With revenue growth greater than expenditure growth, the deficit will close sufficiently by 2019.  </p><p> The path we have outlined is not simply for compliance with the European rule book.  As we all know, Ireland's debt burden has increased substantially in recent years.  Agreements reached over the past two years on the reduced interest rate on the European loans, the promissory note deal and the extension of maturities go a substantial way towards safeguarding our debt sustainability.  However, long-term economic growth and job creation can only occur where the debt burden is set on a downward path so as to reduce the long-term drag on the economy and interest rate payments.</p><p> As I committed to before and as the chairman of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council noted when appearing before this committee last week, the stability programme contains a response to the council's most recent report, published earlier this month.  The council is largely supportive of the Government's policy of fiscal adjustment and considers that the deficit targets will be met.  In light of the tax performance last year and further developments this year, the council is no longer calling for additional consolidation beyond that already specified.  Instead, it endorses the consolidation path that I set out at budget time.  It is also worth noting that the council considers the Government's fiscal stance conducive to prudent economic and budgetary management.  The Government is committed to continuing on the path to sustainable public finances.  The council report noted that, given the deterioration in the external environment since budget day, including weaker than expected activity among some major trading partners, and exchange-rate appreciation, achieving the 1.5% GDP growth forecast for this year will be challenging, although growth is expected to be in positive territory.  My Department has reached the same conclusions and the forecast for GDP growth in 2013 has been revised downwards to 1.3% in the stability programme.</p><p> In the context of discussions about the Department's forecasting methodology, I note the report assesses the approach to macroeconomic forecasting in the Department and finds it is in line with the approach used by the ESRI and the Central Bank.  This provides a level of confidence that the Department's approach is in line with best practice nationally.  The Government's primary objective is to put the economy back on a sustainable growth path and return to a sustainable level of job creation.</p><p> With regard to the public finances, our primary aim remains the correction of the excessive general Government deficit by 2015.  We have met all the interim deficit targets and the Government remains committed to bringing the deficit below 3% of GDP within the stated time horizon.  Once this is achieved, we must remember that sustainable public finances are essential for balanced economic growth.  Once the excessive deficit is corrected, fiscal policy in Ireland will be framed in line with the requirement to make sufficient progress towards the medium-term budgetary objective and to put public debt on a downward path.</p><p> I thank the members for their attention.  I will be happy to respond to any questions they raise.</p></speech>

Opposition spokespersons Deputies Michael McGrath and Doherty will have ten minutes each.

This is far from ideal but I understand the document was just approved by the Cabinet today.  I have gone through it as best I can and have identified some questions that I would like the Minister to answer.</p><p>  Overall, there are positive and negative aspects to the SPU.  It represents the first shot in the preparation of budget 2014.  The key issue is the assumptions that are made.  The whole budget will stand or fall based on the assumptions of export growth and general economic growth.  Some sensitivity analysis has been done.  Page 30 of the document concerns the impact of changes in world output, the savings rate and the interest rate.  If the economy remains relatively stagnant over the next two or three years and if the rate of growth remains between 0% and 1%, which is a distinct possibility, what will be the impact on our deficit and our debt-to-GDP ratio, given that the latter is to rise to 123% this year despite advance funding by the NTMA?  What will be our position if the economy remains relatively stagnant?  I hope it will not remain so.  However, we must entertain that distinct possibility, given all that has emerged in recent years.</p></speech>

Ours is a small, open economy and our assumptions can be turned askew by events elsewhere.  However, the forecasting record of the Department in the past couple of years has been better than that of the private-sector forecasters.  We do adjust and we are making a slight downward adjustment now because of new information released since I introduced the budget.  One can speculate pessimistically or optimistically but we are standing by our forecasts.  We predict a growth rate of approximately 1.3% this year and 2.4% next year.  I understand the consensus table on forecasting was issued today.  It makes exactly the same assumptions as the Department.  It identifies a growth rate of 1.3% for 2013 and 2.4% for next year.  If we are put off-kilter we will have to think again, but we are pretty confident about our forecasts.  The record of the Department of Finance has been very good.</p><p>  An aspect of the two-pack arrangement is that we will need to have independent verification of our forecasts.  The Government, after considering this, has asked the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council to carry out this function.  We will probably have to make a minor amendment in legislation to give it statutory power in this regard.  In the future, while much of the churning of data and the raw numbers will be done in the Department of Finance, verification will be carried out by the fiscal advisory council.  This is in line with one of the requirements under the provisions of the two-pack.</p></speech>

I will move on to the next major challenge for the Minister, which will be the preparation of the budget for 2014.  I realise he will not deal with that today, but my question is about the framework within which the budget will be prepared.  Under the assumptions that have been made, if the Minister goes ahead with the &euro;5.1 billion adjustment over the next two years, we will reach a deficit of 2.2% by the end of 2015.  That is considerably better than the limit of 3%.  Under the ECOFIN recommendations the deficit limit next year was to be 5.1%, but the Minister is now projecting that it will be 4.3%.  Must the Minister achieve the figure of 5.1% or is he stuck with the nominal adjustment that is specified in the MOU of &euro;3.1 billion for next year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-30a.242" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="17:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2013043000006#E00500"><p>That is a matter that must be discussed with the troika.  For the purposes of this exercise, somewhat in excess of &euro;1 billion annual savings arising from the promissory notes new arrangement is inputted here as if all of it will be dedicated to reducing the deficit.  On that basis one gets the 2.2% figure.  Obviously, however, if there are additional savings or if there are costs elsewhere as the year goes by it would be a matter for Government decision.  We have not decided yet.  There are no savings this year because the cost of the liquidation cancels the savings, but there are savings of approximately &euro;1 billion each year from 2014.</p><p>  There is, however, something very simple to which the Deputy and colleagues might not have averted.  Let us suppose I were to use all of those savings on social welfare or tax, for example, by cutting income tax by &euro;1 billion.  I would need the &euro;1 billion savings the following year to sustain the tax at the new level to which I had cut it.  On the other hand, if I were to use it for capital spending, I can keep spending it every year.  If I use the &euro;1 billion to build schools, health centres or whatever else one regards as necessary social and economic infrastructure, after the first building project is completed and the children are out of the prefabs and in the school, I can spend the following year's savings again in that area.  It is much smarter to use this, if we are going to use it, on capital rather than current expenditure.</p><p> There are some things in current expenditure which would also have a jobs and growth impact.  An example is something we discussed in the committee recently and in which Deputy Boyd Barrett had a strong interest, eco-friendly homes, the insulation of homes and so forth.  Any type of grant aid for that comes from current expenditure.  If one did something about repairing country roads, which probably need extra money now, that also comes from current expenditure.  It would not have to be all capital expenditure.  However, I am sure colleagues in the Government will be looking for a slice of it.  I am not sure whether next year is the year for that or whether we should press on with the adjustment next year and perhaps do something later.  It will depend on how the year develops and how we can use it best to restore and grow the economy.  Those are the considerations with which I will work as the year passes and we get more information.</p></speech>

However, when the Minister is considering the use of any spare capacity I urge him to focus on employment creation and jobs, because of the additional benefits that brings with reducing the social welfare bill and improving disposable income.  That is a key objective.</p></speech>

The distinction is that if the Government continues to take a series of initiatives under the jobs programme that are job friendly, the forecasts change and improve.  The targets are in advance of the forecast.</p><p>  I have made no secret of what I think should happen if there is spare capacity in the economy.  I believe we should invest in growing the economy and creating jobs.  That should be the priority.  However, there will be different views in Cabinet.  The Deputy knows how it works.  There are different demands.  If there is a very pressing social need, for example, one will apply funds to that as well.  As a general principle, the thrust of policy from my position would be towards restoring the economy to growth and getting the benefit in job creation consequent to that.</p></speech>

At this stage, as we go into May of the final year, does the Minister confidently believe we are on course to exit the programme in all material respects and that we will be in a position to sustain funding in the markets into the future?</p></speech>

Before I came here this evening I looked at the spreads.  I do not have them with me.  The ten year bond is down to the level where the five year bond was a couple of months ago.  It is down to approximately 3.5% this evening, while the five year bond is approximately 2.3%.  We are moving towards historically low rates of interest.  On the present trajectory, it appears it would be possible to fund all our requirements on the open market if we wish to do that.  However, there are other considerations.  We are looking at a deficit of approximately &euro;1 billion per month, and we need &euro;12 billion to make our expenditure match our tax take.  That is the gap.  There are also bonds maturing and we must roll those over.  The raw figure for what we need this year is approximately &euro;17 billion.  We still have &euro;7 billion to draw down from the European funds and the IMF.  There would not be a big advantage in drawing down those funds in terms of the interest rate applying, but the maturities on the European funds are approximately 20 years.  In terms of maturities, there is a significant advantage in accessing the European money rather than market money, even though there is not a lot in the interest rate.  I rely a great deal on the NTMA to make the calls on this.  We will see how it progresses as the year goes by.  However, we are in a good position at present, and there are cash reserves above &euro;25 billion in the NTMA .  That is prudence.  We saw what happened in Cyprus and the resulting shock wave.  What if Italy had not formed a government?  There can be a shock wave, particularly from a big country, so we must over-provision in the interests of prudence.</p></speech>

Most people are concerned about the fiscal adjustment the Government plans in the October budgets this year and next year.  The updated document the Minister has provided basically says to stay on course.  Some of that is technical assumptions.  According to the figures the Minister provided, the Government will overshoot the target of 3% in 2015 by &euro;1.4 billion or &euro;1.5 billion of adjustments.</p> <p>The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council projected that the Government would overshoot and come in at 2.1%, and the Minister is projecting that the Government will come in at 2.2%.  The council stated that this would equate to &euro;1.6 billion.  The Government is overshooting by &euro;1.4 billion or &euro;1.5 billion.  Can the Minister give any comfort to people at home that there will be substantial relief in respect of the adjustment targets that the Government is planning in the budgets for this year and next year?  Let us consider these figures.  Given the scale of the adjustment - approximately &euro;1.5 billion - it would be necessary to phase it in at least over a two-year period and not back-end it.</p><p> Is the Minister concerned about the valuation of the IBRC assets and the potential for the State to make up that revenue shortfall for NAMA?  Is the Government holding back until those valuations are clear about what the shortfall will be, if indeed there is a shortfall, before it makes any commitments in respect of this matter?</p></speech>

We are projecting out to 2015 and in this case, for the first time, we are having a punt at what the thing will be like from 2016 to 2019 on the best figures available.  It is an inexact science and it moves.  That being said, we are in a good position at the moment.  It looks as though there may be some flexibility and as though we will beat our targets if we do nothing else between now and 2015.  However, it is too early in the year to give any commitment on what way the budget will work out, because things can happen to knock us off course.</p><p>  Let us recall the time, two years ago, when I first took over this job.  Many learned people, including those attached to the major business faculties in the universities, were saying the country was bunched and bankrupt, that there was no solution except default, that the debt was not sustainable, that the Government could not fulfil the programme and that it could not do what it said it was going to do.  If the Deputy goes over the record he will find very credible people making such predictions.  We have got to a point at which, in shorthand terms, we are approximately one year ahead of where I envisaged we would be coming into the summer of 2013.  Certainly we have made a good deal of progress, but we must sustain that now.</p><p>  There are always choices to be made.  Should we say now that because we are doing well we should give away the benefits of our success, or should we stick to the task at hand, finish the job and ensure we have a solid sustainable economy in which there is no fear for our children's future and a growing, modern economy in which there is work for our people?  Deputy Doherty will be involved in that as well.  I will discuss it openly with him but he must measure it.  It is a question of judgment.  I am not prepared to call it coming into May because I do not have enough information yet.  Deputy Doherty might be right: the right thing to do might be to ease up somewhat and use money elsewhere.  My priority will be to see whether we have extra resources for growth and job creation.  We have made good progress in the past 48 hours with the European Investment Bank.  The roads programme is going ahead, the Newlands Cross project is going ahead and bundles of schools projects are going ahead.  The health centres and such-----</p></speech>

We are not giving away anything.  The figures show the Government is overshooting its targets and, as the Minister remarked earlier, bond rates are substantially lower.  However, that is a result of the austerity and the pressure that ordinary people in this State have had to endure.  That is what has resulted in these positives.  While the markets may be pleased and while Merkel and others may be pleased, many people are at the pin of their collar and cannot take any more.  When they see that we are overshooting they are hoping there will be some reprieve.</p><p>  I wish to crystallise the matter.  I asked the fiscal advisory council the same question and its representatives suggested we should try to hit the 3% target but no further.  Is it the opinion of the Minister that by 2015 we will hit 3% and go no further?  Is the Minister willing to make whatever adjustment can be made or whatever let-up can be introduced before then to reach the 3% target?  The target is 3% and not 2.8%, 2.7% or 2.2%, as the Minister has presented.  Is that the position of the Government?</p></speech>

The target when the programme was designed was to have a deficit of less than 3% by 2014.  In May 2011 we renegotiated and got an extra year, so we must get under 3% by 2015.  The Government position is that we must get to that target, but that is not the point I am making.  I am suggesting that forecasts by their nature are inexact and there can be a plus or a minus.</p></speech>

Apart from fiscal reasons and conditions in Europe, the reason I am happy to project a set of figures for 2016 and to trace it out to 2019 is that I am keen to see if an extra adjustment is required, below the 3%, to get to a sustainable position.  According to the figures we ran, it looks as though as long as we keep our expenditure below the growth rate in the economy, it leaves a little headroom for additional expenditure.  Then, the growing economy between 2016 and 2019 should take us to our medium-term objective.</p></speech>

It might be the opposite.  If we do not keep to the fiscal targets we may blow the economy.  We may have an extra 50,000 people out of work and an economy going down the hill.  Deputy Doherty's argument is that it will benefit the people if we ease up.  That is not proven; it is simply a Sinn F&eacute;in theory.  There is not a shred of evidence to suggest that it is correct.  If we had eased up last year, would it have worked?  Of course not.  We would be in a worse position now.  What we have done is working.  The reason we are in a good position is that we have pursued those policies.</p></speech>

The Minister's last update, with which we must compare this, was in 2012.  This time last year, the Minister estimated unemployment would be 11.7% in 2015.  In this update, the Minister estimates it will be 12.8%.  Given that the Government is suggesting that the action plan for jobs has been so successful, why does the Minister estimate that unemployment will rise compared to the figures presented last year?  Is the Minister satisfied that over the lifetime of the Government his projections will see unemployment decrease by 2% and that, stretching right out to 2019, we will see an unemployment level of 11%?</p></speech>

On the employment figure, it goes back to Deputy Michael McGrath's point.  We are making a distinction between targets and forecasts, and what we have in here is a series of forecasts based on what is happening at present.  An enormous amount of work is going on across Departments, particularly in Deputy Bruton's Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</p></speech>

He is forecasting that it will be 12.8%, compared to the 11.7% he forecast last year.</p><p>  The other issue I have is with regard to the growth forecasts from 2013 to 2015.  Last year the Minister forecast growth of 2.2% for 2013, but this has now been revised downwards to 1.3%.  For 2014 the forecast was 3%, which is now down to 2.4%, and for 2015 it was 3%, which is now down to 2%.  If one takes these in combination, over those three years we would have seen a cumulative growth rate of 8.2%, but now the Minister has revised that down to 6.5%.  Does the Minister not believe there is a need for a stimulus in the economy?  One can see that in terms of exports.  The value of exports in 2002 was the same as the value of exports today, yet we have an unemployment level that is three times what we had then.  We need an injection into the domestic economy and that is where the Minister's policy is failing.  The fact that he is projecting a higher rate of unemployment in 2015 than he did this time last year, despite all the work he claims the Government has done, is adequate evidence of that.</p></speech>

To base arguments on the value of exports is to base it on something that can move around depending on demand in our international trading partners, the exchange rate with the US or the UK as the dollar or sterling goes up or down, and price adjustments.  I said in my introductory remarks that exports have decreased this year and I have given reasons for it, but it has nothing to do with the domestic economy.  How Deputy Doherty thinks that stimulating the domestic economy would improve exports I do not know.</p></speech>

Will the Minister answer the question?  This is my third time to ask it.  Why is he projecting a rise in unemployment in 2015, giving a level of 12.8%, compared to the projection of 11.7% that was made last year, despite all the work the Government claims it has done on this?</p></speech>

The sale of State assets is not included in the Minister's update.  How does the commitment to the troika to sell off &euro;3 billion worth of State assets, some of which is to be used to pay down debts, figure in this arithmetic?  Does it figure in this arithmetic?  If so, when does the Minister have to sell these State assets?  What is the timescale?  Is it required this year?  Is structural reform required, or is it simply a balance sheet amount of &euro;3 billion, which the Minister can, if he wishes, get elsewhere?  I tried to get a straight answer from the troika on this and could not get one, so I hope the Minister might go one better and tell us whether it is required under the stability programme that we sell these assets, or if it is simply required that we come up with &euro;3 billion.  In fact, it is &euro;1.5 billion, given that the Minister says half the proceeds of the sale of State assets can be used for something else.  Can we just come up with &euro;1.5 billion elsewhere - for example, from the savings the Minister claims we have made as a result of the restructuring of the promissory note and the other debt deals - and therefore not sell State assets such as our forests?  Could the Minister answer those questions and explain how the sale of State assets, the proceeds from them and so on fit into this arithmetic?</p></speech>

His position is that in the course of this year, probably towards the back end of this year, the sale of that portion of Bord G&aacute;is which he announced will be under way and completed, and two power stations abroad will also be sold.  One is in Spain and the other is in the UK.  We have also taken the legislation through the Government and the heads of a Bill have been sent to the draftsman.

One can balance books by making people suffer.  To take an extreme example, if we wiped out whole sections of the population you could probably balance the books, but it would be on the basis of extreme suffering, so it is rather perverse.  Surely the only criteria for success would be what the Minister is going to do to deal with the unemployment situation or to ease the level of suffering people are feeling.  Examining the tables for unemployment, we are looking at the continuation of mass unemployment for the foreseeable future, with only very small reductions in the best case scenario.  Is that not a pretty bleak outlook?  Is the best case scenario not hopelessly optimistic?  For example, the Minister says the baseline assumption is one in which a modest international recovery takes hold in the second half of this year.</p></speech>

If we adopted his policies now, we could reverse what is a good trajectory and fall back into that position.  What is my basis for projecting modest growth?  The IMF has done an evaluation and says emerging economies are growing, the US is growing strongly and Europe is the back marker.  It projects world growth of approximately 3.5% for this year and stronger growth next year.  The European Commission projects that growth will be restored in Europe in the second half of this year.  It will be modest but positive growth and it will be stronger next year.</p> <p>That is the basis of the projections.  On the unemployment side, one forgets so quickly.  Matters are relatively normal now but the Deputy should think back to the day he was elected.  Then many people believed we would not survive.  The great and the good were predicting it was mission impossible for the incoming Government.  By pursuing our policies, we have made significant progress.  This time last year unemployment stood at 15%.  Now, it is 14%, so we are moving in the right direction, downwards.</p><p> I would like if it were moving faster.  That is why I am drawing the distinction between forecasting and targeting.  We have given the forecasts but we hope to do better with our targets.  As late as today, we made arrangements with the European Investment Bank to provide some stimulus to the economy.  We are tied into deficit controls, spending ceilings, so we cannot have additional investment unless we get it off balance sheet by using the European Investment Bank.  It is on board now and is committed to giving us significant funding.  The bundle of health centres announced by the Minister for Health will be up and running in August while the next bundle of schools will be run out in the autumn.  All these initiatives are very important.</p></speech>

I now have to read it in conjunction with last year&rsquo;s SPU and other documents.</p><p>  Germany submitted its fiscal statement and annual budget on 17 April and many other member states have followed suit.  I know this year for Ireland is a bit of a dry run because we are still in a country programme and country-specific recommendations will not be issued by the Commission based on this SPU.  However, next year this important document will go to the Commission and it will issue country-specific recommendations.  These, in turn, will be debated by the European Parliament and then go back to the Commission.  The recommendations are binding.  If we miss them, there are sanctions which can be brought against us.  Is it the Minister&rsquo;s intention next year to provide sufficient time to the Oireachtas and this committee to get its teeth into this SPU?</p></speech>

We will send it then either tonight or tomorrow morning.  We deliberately held it back from the Commission so we could have this debate.  The committee is getting the first cut of this.  I could not bring it to the committee until I cleared it with the Government.  As the Deputy knows, the troika is in town and, obviously, it had an interest in this too.  I brought it to the committee at the first available opportunity.</p><p>  There was nothing to stop the Deputy studying the raft of documents he referred to earlier for the past month because he knew we were having this debate anyway.  He did not have to wait for my speech before he started to examine the documents.  The Deputy was not inhibited in any way whatsoever.  Germany has the right to publish on 17 April but it is our right to publish any time in April.</p><p>  It is correct this will be sent to the Commission and circulated to other European parliaments.  I said in my statement that there would be peer review.  There is a whole raft of new fiscal rules coming in for Europe which will not apply directly to us immediately because we have firmer rules in our programme.  As soon as we are out of the programme, the new fiscal rules will apply.  That is what a fiscal union is about and that is the way Europe is moving.</p></speech>

This is really important stuff.  The Minister talks about a new budgetary process.  All I am asking for is comfort that next year we will have sufficient time to look at the SPU.  Of course, I have been looking at the other documents for the past 12 months.  As the Minister will appreciate, what is important for us to understand is the differences between the various documents so we know what policy changes are being made.  I find it extraordinary that the Minister does not believe this committee and the Oireachtas should have sufficient time to debate this before he sends it to the Commission.  By the way, he is not even giving us time to debate it.  He is showing it to us in fact.  This entire committee could say the SPU is terrible but it will be sent to the Commission anyway.  There is no meaningful input from the committee because the Minister will not change a single sentence.  There is plenty of detail I want to get into but if we do not get the process right, we will not get the time to do the review.  I am genuinely surprised at the Minister&rsquo;s response.</p></speech>

If we have limited time, I would have thought the best approach was to use that limited time to the best effect possible.  I do not know what the timetabling arrangements will be for next year.  However, this is an initial look at the SPU.  There is nothing to stop the Deputy from putting down a Private Members Bill on it or requesting a debate on the economy in the D&aacute;il.</p><p>  I did my best to give the committee an opportunity to examine this before it is sent to the Commission.  There is another constraint on us.  When we send this to the Commission, it goes out to national parliaments.  It is then leaked, as it always is, and there is great offence here that other parliaments had it circulated before the D&aacute;il had time to discuss it.  This is why there is an urgency about it.  I appreciate the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns but he should use the time available to the best effect.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-30a.303" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/985" speakername="Dara Murphy" time="18:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2013043000010#J00200"><p>I thank the Minister for attending.  It must be welcomed that, given the difficult path the country and its citizens have had to take, the targets are being achieved and that the cliche that there is light at the end of the tunnel is proving to be true.  I have some questions for the Minister.  I know that, linked with the European semester, business groups and others have long since been asking that the budget be brought forward from Christmas and it is welcome that is to happen.  Our fiscal targets were debated last summer following the fiscal stability treaty referendum.  How do the figures the Minister has produced today impact on these targets?</p><p> On debt reduction, the target for which we have overshot, I note that the forecast for this year is a reduction of only 0.2%, while for next year it will be 3%.  I am aware that the Minister has said projections and forecasts are not always accurate, but is there potential for a similar overshoot next year?  Why is the target reduction only 0.2% for 2013.  </p><p>  On the debt rule, I understand the target is that three years after we exit our programme, we will commence with a reduction of one-twentieth per annum of the excess over 60% of the debt-to-GDP ratio.  The figures show an increase.  Last year the ceiling was expected to be 119% of GDP, yet the figures now show a rate of 121% of GDP.  Therefore, there is a 2% increase.  How will this impact on our ability to achieve the 5% reduction year on year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-30a.304" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="18:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2013043000010#J00300"><p>On the information Deputy Dara Murphy is seeking, the answer is complicated.  If the Deputy looks at page 21 of the document, he will see the bar graphs and if he looks at the footnotes, they explain them.  Effectively, our position was so good this year because once-off events contributed largely to our getting from the target of 8.6% imposed by the troika to 7.6%.  These events will not be repeated in 2013.  The interest rate issue also comes into play.  Whether we will be at the figure of 7.5% this year will depend on whether expenditure will be below profile and taxes above profile.  However, it is too early in the year to say.  We are within the targets of our overall programme.  It is a surprise to see that such little progress is being projected on the deficit figure for 2013.  Our position is good this year because of once-off events last year, some on the savings side and some on the expenditure side.  There is a full explanation in the document.  The heading is 3.3 which deals with the transition from the deficit figure for 2012 to the deficit figure for 2013.  I will let the Deputy go through it himself because it is complex.</p><p>  What was the Deputy's second question?</p></speech>

What impact will this have?  Does the Minister perceive it will have a negative impact on our achieving the 0.5% reduction over the 20 year period?</p></speech>

The debt ratio must fall.  We believe, based on the figures we have included, that GDP growth will do the heavy lifting.  The strategy must be to keep expenditure below the growth rate in the economy.  There will be a little head room for extra expenditure but not a lot, based on current growth projections.  Obviously, if growth increases, we will have more head room.  Based on this set of figures, we should get from 2016 to 2019 without further correction, other than keeping expenditure down.  After that, we should get to a position where we will have an ongoing debt correction, in line with our obligations under the treaty.  However, the forecasts, obviously, carry upside and downside risks.  Looking at it from 2013 onwards, this is the best set of forecasts we have.</p></speech>

On the domestic economy, I welcome the 1,000 jobs in road construction projects announced today.  However, there is an unsustainably low output in house construction.  If this does not change quickly, there will be a shortage of housing units from mid-2016 onwards, particularly given the projected growth in population and the return of immigrants.  On the capital budget, will we see some investment in house building?</p></speech>

However, I introduced a number of initiatives in two Finance Bills to try to restore the fortunes of the construction industry.</p> <p>It has become a kind of scapegoat sector of the economy.</p></speech>

It is about 5% and 6% of GDP now whereas it should be 9% or 10%, and it was more than 20%, which was unsustainable.  It seems that as the property market in Dublin, in particular, begins to sort itself out and there is some demand for houses again, construction is also beginning in Dublin.  In the greater Castleknock area, for example, I understand three sites have opened up in the past six weeks or so, and there is the big site in Dun Laoghaire which is being finished out by the Cosgrave company, and there might be another phase to it.  I also understand a big site has been opened in Clontarf for house building.</p><p>  NAMA is helping as well.  It is providing funds to developers and providing vendor funds, which are beginning to come on stream.  It is very slow down the country so we will be depending on funds from the European Investment Bank for the bundles of schools and health centres to give a bit of construction activity in rural Ireland.  The normal sequence is that what begins in Dublin moves into the rest of the economy.  For the first time in a number of years, there is some activity in the construction industry in the capital city.</p></speech>

With regard to the table on page 22, the increase in taxation over the period was from &euro;36.6 billion to &euro;44.9 billion, which is &euro;8.3 billion.  The reduction in current expenditure is hardly anything - I believe it is about 4%.  I know the media presents Deputy Noonan as a cutting Minister for Finance but in fact he is a tax increasing Minister for Finance.  That is what has led to a lot of demoralisation outside.  I calculate that the Minister tackled the deficit on a ratio of 96:4 in that period.  What is the thinking behind that very strong emphasis on extra taxation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-30a.324" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="18:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2013043000011#K00600"><p>The policy was 2:1, namely, for every &euro;2 of adjustment by way of expenditure cuts there would be &euro;1 adjustment by way of tax.  However, while the expenditure side is more difficult to manage, tax goes up with the economic cycle.  In the first three months of this year, income tax was up 8%, but I did not increase income tax in either of the budgets I brought in.  While we get the added benefit, the taxes I brought in were not on personal taxation.</p><p>  It is a fair point.  It is harder to do expenditure cuts.  If we go back to the two budgets, even though there were tax increases, the big political rows were about small amounts of money around expenditure.  On the Social Welfare Bill, Senator Barrett and all his colleagues in the Seanad, including the Taoiseach's nominees, voted against an amount of &euro;26 million, and brought the Social Welfare Bill down to a majority of one vote.  If the Senator reflects on that, he will see the difficulties of controlling expenditure.</p></speech>

Could the Minister for Finance issue an edict to all managers of public expenditure to cut 0.6% rather than have to fall out with all his trade union friends, the social partners, garda&iacute;, teachers and so on?</p></speech>

I do not have the role of controlling expenditure.  Normally, what happens when edicts like that are issued is we might get the adjustment for one year but it does not change the base.  It is like elastic - it goes back again the following year.  What we need are base changes so the permanent base of expenditure is reduced.  That is why the Minister is adopting the approach he is adopting.  While it is &euro;300 million this year, over the three-year cycle it is &euro;1 billion, which is a significant base change.</p></speech>

I believe he is right to save that in order to look at the possibilities for capital programmes and capital expenditures.  As they are non-recurring, it is easier to keep the tiller steady on the current account.</p><p>  On the debt levels and debt maturities, the financial press talks about skyscraper roll-overs and that sort of thing.  The fact we got an extra seven years on the maturities of the programme debt plus the rolling out over 40 years of the promissory note profile takes away some of the dangers on the skyscraper re-financing that will be occurring in two or three years' time.  I ask the Minister to extend rather than pull the punches with people at the ECB and EU over the necessity to get some retrospective creditor financing for the banks so the banks can actually be further capitalised.  My estimates are that they need a good deal more financing capital to absorb the losses that Ms Fiona Muldoon, for example, has flagged in SMEs on top of the mortgage losses, which need to be surgically dealt with.</p><p>  I would love to hear from the Minister what is his definition of "exiting the programme".  People throw out that phrase and, to my mind, exiting a programme is when all the available facilities have been used up, they are disbursed and one has then to keep in line with the conditionality of the ongoing commitments under the loan agreements.  Is that what the Minister understands by it?</p></speech>

Exiting the programme and full sustainable market access are the two sides of the same coin.  That is one way of explaining it.  The other way is that the troika has gone home and is not coming in every three months to review what we are doing, and the conditionality of the programme has been completed.  We have 200 separate conditions fulfilled to date-----</p></speech>

When one gets a package of loans made available from creditors, there are disbursement programmes.  As one gets the money on the terms and conditions advanced, the terms and conditions normally keep obtaining after the loans are fully disbursed.  That is the programme of disbursement.  Then, there is the continuing operation of the State, which is different.  We owe it to the people to explain what we mean by exiting a programme when disbursements are complete.  The Minister says there is &euro;7 billion to draw down.</p></speech>
