    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-05a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Tara Buckley" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2013030500003#C00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for giving RGDATA the opportunity to make a presentation to the committee on a number of areas that are of critical importance to the retail, grocery and food industry.  The Chairman has introduced my colleagues who are representative of the 4,000 owners of local shops, convenience stores and supermarkets throughout the country.  I will ask them to briefly outline their own position, the people they employ in their stores and some of the issues facing them.</p><p>  RGDATA is the representative body for the independent retail grocery sector.  Collectively, our members own and operate more than 4,000 shops.  They are present in every community and, collectively, hold more than one third of the retail grocery market.  It is an extremely competitive and highly dynamic sector.  What sets Ireland apart from many of our European neighbours is that, despite high levels of market concentration and the arrival of large international multiples, it continues to have a strong, vibrant and dynamic indigenous retail grocery sector.  In most towns, villages and suburban communities one will find a locally owned and operated store offering great quality and standards not seen in other European countries.  The continued resilience of the independent retail grocery sector is extremely important for the national economy.</p><p>  Our members play a significant role in their local communities.  They provide 90,000 jobs and, collectively, contribute an estimated &euro;3.6 billion to the economy, according to the economist Mr. Jim Power who conducted a study for RGDATA in 2011 entitled, Local Heroes - A study of the economic, financial and social significance of the independent retail grocery sector".</p><p>  The independent retail grocery sector is also a key supporter of Irish suppliers and producers.  Without a vibrant independent sector and local family owned shops, many Irish suppliers would not have been able to bring their goods to the market as we are the ones who give them their first break, which will come as no surprise to members of the committee.  We believe it makes sense for local retailers operating within the community to show support for suppliers in their locality.  This is extremely important.  </p><p>  My colleagues will briefly outline some details of their operations, the extent to which they support local suppliers and some of the key challenges they face in the sourcing and supply of local food and in operating in what is a competitive marketplace.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-05a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Foy" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2013030500003#C00400"><p>I have been involved in the retail sector from the age of 15 years.  I am the store owner of a SuperValu supermarket in a small rural town, Cootehill, County Cavan, which has a population of 1,500.  I employ 55 people and we aim to provide 100% support, where possible, for local suppliers and producers.  The SuperValu chain is part of the Musgrave Group and 100% of our beef, chicken and pork is sourced in Ireland.  From being involved on the ground and dealing with local suppliers, I am aware that some of the difficulties they encounter in running small businesses relate to the cost and bureaucracy involved in being listed in some of the larger chains.  On a local basis, because I adopt a hands-on approach as a retailer, I can make that decision.</p><p>  I will mention what I would want to see happen in the future.  Because of what has happened in recent weeks on the issue of the traceability of meat products, I have lost confidence.  We trace the beef used in our products from the backdoor to the consumer, but I lack confidence because of what has been happening in the case of other products.  I suggest there is a need for greater transparency for consumers in order that they will have confidence about from where products are coming.  Some of our chicken products are deemed to be Irish, but once products are imported and processed here, they can be called Irish.  For example, a large percentage of some key Irish branded cheeses with good Irish names are produced outside the country.  As a retailer, what I need is confidence that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will be held accountable and that it will ensure the reputation of Irish produce is protected across the world.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-05a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richard Nolan" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2013030500003#C00600"><p>Nolan's Supermarket has been trading successfully in Clontarf since 1955.  It is a family run business and an independent operator, with no affiliation to any of the major symbol groups.  It is one of a very small group of retailers of this type left in the country.  The neighbourhood shopping centre in Clontarf includes a supermarket, an off-licence, a newsagent, a coffee shop, a hardware and garden centre all run by the Nolan family.  It also includes a hairdressing salon and a dry cleaners which are operated on a lease basis.  It provides some 30,000 sq. ft. of retail and storage space.  We currently employ 125 full-time and part-time staff.  Because of the type of business and the service Nolan's hopes to provide per square foot and per euro of turnover, we employ more people than any Tesco, Dunnes, Aldi or Lidl store of similar size.</p><p>  I have been directing the company for the past 30 years, during which time there has been considerable expansion of the neighbourhood shopping complex.  I have always valued the independence of the family business and strongly believe a hands-on approach and flexibility are the key to our ongoing business success.  We are very proud of our superb staff and the level of service we provide for our customers.  In this regard we are not just about providing a retail experience; it is not unusual for people visiting Dublin from overseas to comment and say to me they have no access to a similar local facility and that they have to travel miles to do their shopping.  </p><p>  We are very much part of the fabric of the local community in Clontarf.  We place considerable emphasis on the quality of our fresh food offering and the range of products stocked.  We are ardent and active supporters of all things Irish.  We provide exceptional support, with a no strings attached attitude towards Irish artisan producers.  This is the simple ethos of the company to excel in customer service and quality.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-05a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Doyle" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2013030500003#C00800"><p>I operate the family run business Donnybrook Fair.  Our business is based mainly on fresh food retailing.  We produce fresh food on a daily basis.  We also support small Irish companies and start-up companies in working actively with Bord Bia and the many small producers which supply to our stores.  Between the retail and manufacturing parts of our business, we employ 240 people, 65 of whom are employed directly on the fresh food manufacturing side.</p><p>  Because of the business we run, we are not eligible for support in the form of grants because we are a producer for the home market.  One of the challenges we face relates to the volume of prepared meals and foods brought into the Irish marketplace in trucks.</p> <p>Every day of the week, they are supplying to the retail business and can avail of grants and everything else.  One often wonders if there is a better way of managing the playing field.  Our direct contribution to the Exchequer, including through our staff, is approximately &euro;1 million per year.  That is a sizeable contribution for a small company.  I cannot get into aspects of legislation and licensing law managed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  There seems to be one target for everyone and if members want me to explain it later, I will do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-05a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Tara Buckley" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2013030500004#D00200"><p>I will briefly talk through the four issues we were asked to address.  The first concerns the proposed code of conduct for the grocery goods sector.  RGDATA is supportive of a statutory code of conduct for the grocery goods sector and rejects the contention by some of the larger retailers operating in Ireland that no code can be introduced to the retail grocery sector in Ireland before any EU wide initiatives.  This is an open market that has seen significant penetration from international retailers in recent years and we believe there is no legal or practical reason a code should not be introduced to specifically govern relations between international retailers and Irish-based suppliers with regard to the supply of grocery goods for sale in the Irish market.  We note the United Kingdom has appointed an adjudicator of its grocery code.  We could examine that model here.</p><p>  The relationship between suppliers and the large multiples in Ireland is unbalanced and there is a need for some independent, enforceable code around which sustainable, respectful and commercial relations can be built.  In a sector where the largest players impose unreasonable and unfair terms on suppliers, all too often the suppliers seek to recoup the losses or the cost of promotions by changing the terms of those least able to resist change.  This is one of our issues of contention.  Many of our smaller members are paying the cost for some of the ways the larger players in the market operate.  This has perverse consequences, with the independent sector effectively subsidising or indirectly funding unreasonable terms of supply extracted by the largest multiples.  This is not sustainable.  We would like to clarify that independent, family-owned shops do not engage in practices such as demanding hello money, shelf space payments, promotional budgets or other <i>ad hoc</i> payments from suppliers.  However, the large players in the market do engage in these practices.</p><p>  We are also aware that larger suppliers have behaved unreasonably towards independent retailers and smaller players.  This includes larger suppliers that have delisted independent retailers or issued legal threats to shopkeepers who have sought to source identical products from other markets in circumstances where they can be secured on more favourable terms.  In a number of instances, retailers have been delisted by suppliers as a mechanism to ensure they purchase the entire stock of a branded product from a supplier or distributor, rather than sourcing the product on more advantageous terms from third parties.  This has a knock-on impact on the price offering that independent retailers can provide to customers for certain branded products.</p><p>  Five objectives should be adhered to regarding any regulatory or legislative measure that touches on the relationships between suppliers, distributors and retailers in the retail grocery trade.  The regulatory system should be effective, responsive and respected.  The regulatory structure should attack practices that should be illegal and that distort the competitive landscape for retailing food in Ireland.  It should ensure an indigenous Irish supply base is maintained and encouraged and not subject to the <i>ad hoc</i> vagaries of large retail concerns.  Any code of practice should facilitate retailers that are independent of the multiple chains to compete on a fair and equal basis with larger retail competitors.  The independent sector should not have to carry the can for excesses practised by large multiples in their trading relationships with suppliers or wholesalers.  A code of practice should prevent discriminatory practices by brand holders that are large monopoly or duopoly suppliers and that prevent independent retailers from getting goods on competitive terms for their customers.</p><p>  The committee asked us to address the impact of pricing on primary and secondary suppliers.  Members of the committee are aware that significant price pressure is put on primary and secondary suppliers by the large multiples which try to justify this by claiming they are doing it in the interests of consumers.  They fly themselves as the consumer champion to excuse what could be unacceptable behaviour.  The problem with all the major retail multiples operating in Ireland is caused by the veil of secrecy under which they operate.  We strongly advocate the committee pursues the issue as a matter of importance.  The large multiple retailers go to inordinate lengths to conceal details of turnover and profits generated by their activities in Ireland.  They have a complex web of unlimited companies, subsidiaries of foreign-based companies and other structures designed to conceal financial information about their activities.  This should be addressed and we should seek to lift the veil and make them reveal their profits and turnover in Ireland.  Successive Governments have failed to tackle the issue and, in the public interest, learning about the profitability of these companies should outweigh the desire to keep these operations secret.  Until we have visibility on the level of profits generated by major retailers operating in the Irish market, the committee, producers, retailers and ultimately consumers will be in the dark about whether the efforts of retailers to squeeze suppliers is genuinely in consumers' interests or more concerned with squeezing higher profits.</p><p>  The committee also asked about support for local producers.  The independent retail grocery sector in Ireland is the biggest supporter of local Irish producers.  Significant efforts are made by the independent retail sector to source goods from new and emerging producers to give them a foothold in the market.  It makes sense, as a local retailer based within the community will always try to source locally made products from the community if the price and quality are at least comparable with imported products.  They will also support local producers where the quality is clearly higher than imported products even if the price is higher.  International retailers operating in Ireland go to great lengths to highlight their commitment to Irish producers and suppliers.  Independent retailers are the biggest supporters of local Irish suppliers but we do not have the resources of the global giants to make the same song and dance about it.</p><p>  We want to highlight one key difference.  When consumers purchase Irish goods in an Irish-owned shop, they are making a far more significant contribution to their local economy.  The key difference is that they are supporting the independent retail grocery sector and local suppliers.  When they spend the money in our members' shops it is worth four times more to the local community than when they spend that money on Irish goods in a global retailer.  A study done by Jim Power shows that &euro;100 spent in the locally-owned shop is worth &euro;250 to the local economy.  This is significant for local economies when we need to be investing in our local communities.  Supporting local shops that support local suppliers provides the optimum benefit for Irish consumers and society in general.</p><p>  Food labelling is a significant issue and an area of contention for RGDATA members and their customers.  Irish people like to buy Irish sourced and supplied foodstuffs.  Sadly, the labelling regulations have facilitated the creation of confusion for consumers as to whether the food they are buying is actually sourced from Irish ingredients and produced in Ireland.  We are constantly informed the Government has limited options to change the way food is labelled given EU regulations but we believe that, with a bit of imagination, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine could support the creation of some mark that helps to provide consumers with clear information about the source of genuinely Irish produced foodstuffs.  We acknowledge the good work done by Bord Bia, Guaranteed Irish, Love Irish Food and Think Irish but it must be a priority that any Irish consumer genuinely seeking to buy Irish produced food should not be misled by clever labelling tactics on the part of some producers.  It is also critical that existing penalties for mislabelling of foodstuffs are reviewed to ensure the deterrents that exist for negligently or wrongfully describing food are sufficiently severe to act as a deterrent.  However, we also appeal to the committee to ensure the responsibility for mislabelling should be directed at the source of the problem and not visited on the independent retailer.</p> <p>The independent retail grocery sector is a strong supporter of the Irish food industry.  We may not be able to afford the big advertising fanfare or the glossy newspaper inserts but RGDATA, the Retail Grocery Dairy and Allied Trades Association, members are dedicated to Irish food and demonstrate this daily in their shops.  We support a regulatory environment for the supply and sale of food to consumers that will assist independent retailers to be competitive and sustainable.  Lifting the veil on the profits made by the largest players in the market will provide much-needed transparency and will allow suppliers, the Government and consumers to test claims by large retailers that their actions in squeezing suppliers and producers are always driven by a constant focus on the well-being and betterment of consumers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-05a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2013030500005#E00200"><p>I welcome RGDATA to today's meeting.  I read and listened with interest to what the delegation had to say.  There are two issues here, namely, the local supplier providing locally to a retailer and winter liquid milk producers supplying the multiples and the small shops who claim they are doing so at an ever decreasing margin.  The latter claim that it will come to a point where there will not be enough winter milk and people will have to buy UHT, ultra-heat treatment, milk.  Most Irish consumers would be stunned to think that they would ever have to buy UHT milk to put on their Cornflakes rather than fresh milk.</p><p>  We are also talking about major sectors of the economy that supply retailers of all types.  We want to ensure that it continues to be profitable for Irish farmers to produce high-quality food for sale.  As RGDATA pointed out in its submission, there are many challenges on the way.  Is it correct that the wholesaler for SuperValu is Musgraves?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-05a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Foy" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2013030500005#E00300"><p>That is correct.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-05a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2013030500005#E00400"><p>How much of what a RGDATA retailer stocks is determined by the wholesaler and how much is supplied by a food processor?  Can an independent retailer make a deal with the wholesaler?  We are concerned not just with price of foodstuffs but the conditions for sourcing products.  My understanding with liquid milk is that if there is a surplus in the North, it comes to the South and southern farmers get displaced and <i>vice versa</i>.</p><p>  I am told food prices in Ireland are higher compared with most other EU member states.  I am also told the multiples will charge more in the South rather than in Northern Ireland and that there is quite a considerable price differential.  I would be interested in any light that RGDATA could throw on this issue and how it comes about.  We are all on the one island and one would imagine there are the same transport costs to bring in food products to the island.</p><p>  We need a code of practice with teeth.  The points made by RGDATA are very salient to the way this plays out, particularly if the multiples are imposing huge conditions which the supplier has to claw back.  When we refer to the supplier, are we referring to the farmer, the processor or the wholesaler?  The committee is trying to gather information to get an understanding of the dynamics at play here.</p><p>  We all agree that there needs to be much greater emphasis on labelling, making it easy to read and understand.  If a product is declared to be Irish, it should be Irish.  I understand there are many challenges in this area because of country of origin rules.  There are more problems with processed foods because inevitably they are imported products.  This is an area that needs to be examined and RGDATA's views on this are important.</p><p>  There is an effort in America to establish who is getting what out of food products.  Is it the primary producer, the transporter, the processor or the retailer?  I know this process has been flawed but a flawed system is better than no system.  As RGDATA rightly pointed out, we simply do not know who is getting what out of the final consumer price for the food.  Without that information, we are at a loss.  We need to gather a whole lot of information on what is going on with this sector.  We need to get an understanding of the dynamics of the trade and see its various parts.  We then need to propose actions which would come under four headings.  First, the public should know the truth of what actually happens in this sector.  Second, we should create public awareness about the importance of quality products and labelling.  Third, we should take legal action in Ireland, rather than wait for the EU train, to bring in a statutory code of practice.  I understand the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is proposing a Bill in this regard.</p> <p> We should also consider whether there are other legal issues that would result in a change here.  The figures for some of the multiples are bigger than those for countries and states.  At an EU level there is considerable interest, but the problem is getting the juggernaut to actually do something.  This issue should be tackled and if various states do not tackle it at state level, it will not be put on the EU agenda.  Ultimately, we are interested in two aspects.  Clearly, the committee is interested in primary food producers.  However, it is fair to say we are interested in the consumer also and the consumer needs to be given a guarantee.  If there is not a decent margin, the consumer cannot be guaranteed high quality safe food that we can and will continue to produce on this island into the distant future.  We should take a long-term perspective and recognise that the processes of the wholesalers and retailers are important and legitimate links in the chain.  We have to strike the optimum balance between the various sectors; it is not a case of one against the other, rather we need a balance to get everyone to take a long-term view, which suggests that if we could achieve such a balance, it would be best for Irish society.</p><p> I referred to the milk issue.  Life, politics and the media are funny.  I issued a press release on the matter and someone raised the issue with me of ugly fruit and vegetables; in other words, the question of supermarkets being unwilling to sell irregular sized vegetables and so on.  I remember giving prominence in the press release to the challenges being faced by liquid milk producers.  However, in the public mind and most of the media the ugly fruit story is far easier to sell than the idea of liquid milk producers being under significant pressure.  That will only become a story when there is no liquid milk in the shop one day in January.</p><p> There is a subset.  We are dealing with the issue of major commodities being placed on the shelves by the various suppliers.  We are also interested in micro artisan food producers, with whom I was involved in a previous life as a Minister.  I am aware of the important part they can play in selling to high quality food shops such as those the delegation represents.  It is a matter of getting a toe-hold in the market and setting up a small niche artisan food business offering high quality produce.  We used to work with such businesses in terms of the HACCP and so on.  The delegation represents those involved in a particular niche market which has a reputation and in which I am interested.</p><p> There is an issue with fruit and vegetables and so on because there is a need to be able to say where they have been grown.  Certain issues arise for the delegation in terms of seasonality, standards and so on.  Is there something we could do to make it easier for local shops such as those the delegation represents to buy local produce?  What challenges do RGDATA members face, especially those tied to large wholesalers?  What is the extent of the challenges they face in terms of their discretion to buy local produce such as fruit and vegetables?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-05a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1001" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2013030500006#F00200"><p>I thank the RGDATA delegation for its presentation.  There is no doubt that Irish people appear to be wedded to local shops.  There was a meeting last night in Donegal to address the issue of the threatened closure of a local shop in Creeslough.  The meeting was attended by over 500 people to express their concerns about the issue and the 40 or 50 jobs at risk.  It is important that we maintain, as much as possible, a vital independent sector.</p><p>  In its presentation RGDATA refers to the code of practice and outlines five points that it is keen to see included.  As always, running through this issue is the theme of the competitive landscape and competition.  Does RGDATA have any view on the Competition Authority and its role in ensuring there are competitive practices within the retail sector?  Does it have any view on how effective or otherwise it may be in policing competition in the sector?</p><p>  The delegation has outlined the impact of the veil of secrecy on pricing.  This is something that should be included in any code of practice.  Legislation should be introduced by the Government to ensure all multiples operating in Ireland will be obliged to reveal their turnover and profit levels in order that we can make a fair and equal comparison.</p></speech>

In Ireland we all like to support our own industries and shops, but we are our own worst enemies in this regard.  How many of the 500 people referred to go down the road to one of the large multiples under discussion?  We need to be able to turn our speeches into actions, rather than remain negative all the time.  We need to support the local shop at the same time.</p><p>  A topical issue in recent times is that of beef product.  It is a significant issue in terms of transparency in labelling.  What effect will the developments have in the rest of the year?  Unfortunately, day by day we learn of new parts to the story of beef and horsemeat.  The issue must come to a conclusion reasonably soon.  Where does RGDATA see this issue going with regard to the industry and sector it represents?  From where does its affiliates source their beef products?  Are they sure they know exactly what they are getting?</p><p>  The cost of groceries in Ireland is 18% higher than in any other country in Europe.  I am open to contradiction, but I am reasonably certain that this is the figure for 2011.  It represents a substantial price difference between the cost here and in our nearest neighbour.  Why does the delegation believe that is the case?  Does it believe it is possible to bring the figures closer together?  Is it possible to close the gap, or is it the case that RGDATA affiliates are under pressure from the large multiples to try to keep in line with them all the time?</p><p>  I welcome the comments of the delegation, hard-hitting and all as they are, on the large multiples and the need to display the facts and figures on a yearly basis.  It is important that there be transparency in that regard.  It would be welcome if that occurred in the near future.</p><p>  I welcome RGDATA's code of conduct which is something that should be put in place.  How effective will it be?  How can it be implemented in an efficient manner such that everyone will be on the same wavelength in a given period?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-05a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1049" speakername="Michael Healy-Rae" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2013030500006#F00400"><p>I apologise for not being present at the beginning of the meeting and I am sorry that I will have to leave again soon.  However, I am rather keen to make a contribution.  </p><p>  I have read RGDATA's submission quickly and declare a vested interest.  I am one of the small shopkeepers RGDATA represents.  On a day-to-day basis for many years I have dealt with the issues on which the RGDATA delegation adequately represents its members.  I applaud the work RGDATA has done during the years.</p><p>  We are at a crossroads.  I realise that we cannot stand up and be openly critical of the multinationals.  At the same time, however, when they come here, they are like large banks which come in and take over.  They refer to the jobs they create when they open in a town or city.  They claim that they create 100 jobs, but there is nothing about the 150 jobs knocked out as a consequence.  </p><p>  Let us consider what has taken place in England, Scotland and elsewhere throughout Europe where certain large shops have entered the petrol trade, for example.  I will cite one example.  When a large retailer opened in Killarney town, a total of 12 petrol stations closed.</p> <p>When they had them closed, this retailer continued to bring down the price of petrol to rock bottom.  These were family businesses that had been run by highly respectable people and their fathers before them, who reared their families by selling petrol and doing repairs prior to the advent of convenience shops.  When those 12 petrol stations and forecourts were closed, the retailer realised it would not be able to knock out the few that remained, and Killarney is now one of the most expensive places in Ireland to buy petrol because the price is artificially inflated.  Now that such retailers know they are at rock bottom and that nobody else can be knocked out, they are keeping the price of petrol and diesel up.  This is what big companies do.  The ordinary respectable small shopkeepers and supermarket or convenience store owners are put to the pin of their collars to keep their businesses going.  It is difficult.  Those people are coming into this country and sucking their profits out to Europe.  They do not give a damn about Ireland, the fabric of our society or the small shops that have been the backbone of our villages and small towns.  I agree this will have the perverse consequence of leading to the independent sector effectively subsidising the unreasonable terms of supply extracted by the largest multiples.  This is not sustainable for the grocery sector.</p><p> The witnesses spoke about glossy advertisements in our newspapers.  How many of us are sick when we open our newspapers on Sundays?  Of course, they do not give a damn as long as they sell their newspapers and make money.  Last Sunday one national newspaper contained 12 pages telling us about how cheap bacon, beef, turnips and cabbages were in certain large shops.  This is not good for the consumer because when all the small shops are gone the big players will be able to control the market in the same way they do with petrol.  They did it in England and Scotland.  When small shops and service stations are gone they will not be able to pull themselves up and open again in several years' time.  It simply will not happen.</p><p> I am glad we have an excellent committee, with an excellent Chairman and members who will listen to what the witnesses have to say.  They are speaking for the people who provide employment and who are not fly-by-nights who come in here like multinational mobile banks to take whatever chunk of the market they can find and zap their profits out of this country.  The latter companies do not care about reinvesting here or what they are doing to the small shopkeepers.  If I was here until tomorrow morning I could not compliment the witnesses and the people they represent enough.  I appreciate the work they do in representing the backbone of Ireland.  These are the people who create genuine employment and I hope they can survive.  It will be extremely difficult given the number of shops and service stations that are closing, but I am sure this committee will do what it can to help.  I thank the witnesses for coming before the committee today and I hope they will return to represent the smaller business people of Ireland.</p></speech>

As the witnesses will be aware, a new Bill proposes to merge the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency.  Down the years there have been differences of opinion between these two bodies.  Ironically, the Competition Authority seems to believe that unimpeded pricing or marketing is in the best interests of the consumer, whereas the Consumer Agency takes the view that if the sector becomes too consolidated, the absence of diversity will not be in the long-term interest of consumers.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-05a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Tara Buckley" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2013030500007#G00300"><p>I thank members for their comments and questions.  The uniqueness in the independent retail grocery sector is worth fighting for because, regardless of what happens in the market, we bring an element of competition that will not be present if a few global multiple retailers are allowed to take over.  What we bring to the market is valuable to Irish consumers in the long term.  If the small Irish businesses that produce high-quality products do not have a route to the market through the likes of Donnybrook Fair, Nolan's or SuperValu they will not be able to get a foothold.  That is why it is worth fighting for independent shops.  When RGDATA was established more than 70 years ago, there were approximately 13,000 small groceries in Ireland.  That market has changed significantly since then, but one of the changes that allows our 4,000 to survive is the way in which independent wholesalers have joined together in groups and symbols to form part of a bigger purchasing group.  The independent trade still has a market share of approximately one third, which is much more significant than the market share enjoyed by the independent sector in our nearest neighbours, Northern Ireland and the UK.  The quality and standard of shops run by independent retailers is testament to the hard work and investment these local entrepreneurs carry out in their communities.  Through our market share of one third we create two thirds of the jobs provided in retail grocery.  This is why we should be allowed to compete.  We ask the committee to ensure that what whatever codes and regulations are introduced allow smaller independent players to compete.  When others are rolling down the shutters and giving up, the independent grocers are rolling up their sleeves and getting on with it.  They are also reinvesting in their businesses.  In the next week or so we will be publishing research conducted by Am&aacute;rach Consulting which shows that even though our members' turnover was lower in 2012 than in 2011 and they are struggling in some of the most difficult of circumstances, more than half of them are thinking about investing in their businesses.  They want to invest in their staff and training.  These are optimistic and hard-working people who need a break to make sure they can continue through very tough times.</p><p>  I will ask Mr. Foy to address the specific questions from Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and others regarding sourcing products, supporting Irish goods and relationships with wholesalers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-05a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Foy" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2013030500007#G00400"><p>Going back to the coalface, my aim is to look after the consumer, but we have to make sure consumers are looked after in terms of what they are looking for.  Value has become a big word in the marketplace.  I am part of the Musgrave wholesale group and approximately 90% of our goods are purchased from within the group.  We have an allowance which permits us to purchase from local suppliers but if we were not part of the group I do not believe, as an operator in the retail industry for the last 19 years, that we would be able to compete against the global multiples such as Tesco, Lidl and Aldi, which are among the top eight retailers worldwide.  Tesco will turn over more than &euro;40 billion this year and Lidl and Aldi will turn over more than &euro;45 billion each.  That is what I am competing against as an independent retailer in Cootehill in County Cavan.</p><p>  In regard to the supply chain, I am happy to be transparent about the margin I make in milk.  It is not particularly significant.  Sometimes I scratch my head and ask myself where the rest has gone.  That question is sometimes unanswerable in the retail sector, but the group I am with is very supportive of Irish producers and has done a lot of work between the Centra, Daybreak and SuperValu brands.</p> <p>There are more than 700 shopkeepers within those three groups and they are also the largest wholesale provider to other independent shopkeepers.</p><p> On the beef issue, it saddens me that I do not have confidence any more in regard to what happens to produce before it comes into my store.  I believed, with all of the bureaucratic checks I do in the context of the HACCP system and traceability in my store, that I was giving my customers the best product.  To be fair to Musgraves, it has not got caught up in the horsemeat issue.  However, it concerns me, as president of RGDATA, that somewhere along the way there has been a failure in the system and the consumer could suffer in the longer term.</p><p> On the issue of costs, I will give an example from my store.  I use more than 1,100 hours per week in my store.  About four years ago I did a survey on the costs for that and found that in comparison to an identical store in the UK, it costs me &euro;1,400 a week extra in labour costs.  My son works in a UK chain at the moment and at 22 years of age he is on &pound;6.10 per hour.  If a person of 22 years was working in John Foy's shop in Cootehill, the minimum he would receive would be &euro;9.75.  If I had that &euro;1,400 extra per week to return more value to my consumers, I would be delighted to do that.  These extra labour costs are added on to the other costs involved in the day-to-day running of our businesses, such as rates.  Last week I raised the issue of rates at a meeting.  If, for example, businesses were thriving, rates might increase because the retailer had the ability to pay.  However, the opposite should occur if a retailer is struggling and there should be some mechanism in place to help that retailer compete in the market place.</p><p> As independent retailers, we want the ability to compete so as to ensure we give the consumers what they want.  I would like to see more transparency between me and my competition.  The competition does not have to put its results in the marketplace, but as an independent retailer I do.  More transparency in this regard would go a long way towards achieving an awareness of the difference in prices in regard to the products we sell.</p></speech>

However, he hit the nail on the head in his contribution.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v raised some interesting observations, to which I would like to reply.  Mr. Foy and I are at the opposite ends of the spectrum and, as I explained in my presentation, I am not affiliated to a group in any way.  Mine is a family business that has been trading now for 55 years.  Today, it would not be possible for my business to open as an independent retailer without being part of a symbol group here.</p><p>  I extend to the Chairman the same invitation I extended in this room a number of years ago. My independent business is unique and I would be more than happy for the committee to come out and see what we do and how we do it.  Although I come from farming stock in Sligo and Wexford, as a Dublin retailer I have no sympathy for the farming community whatsoever.  Meat and dairy issues have been a legacy issue between farmers and retailers for a long time.  We sell our potatoes either too cheaply or too expensively and in the meantime, most IFA housewives shop in the local Aldi or Lidl and complain about bacon, vegetable and cabbage prices in the Sunday papers.  There is a huge moral debate on the issues in this regard.</p><p>  With regard to making decisions, I do not have to make decisions with any wholesaler and our decisions are instant and final.  The issue of pricing in the Republic compared to that in the UK was raised.  If one compares prices on the Tesco UK website with prices on the Tesco Ireland website, one will sometimes find a price difference of up to 50% for the exact same product.  I cannot say why that is the case.  However, in 2009, as an independent operator we changed our source of supply.  We had been dealing with indigenous Irish wholesalers, which in most cases were simply agency people bringing products in from the UK and elsewhere and redistributing them here.  In 2009, we began to deal directly with a co-op in the UK called Nisa.  That decision is the reason I am still in business today.</p><p>  The difference in pricing between the UK and the Republic in some cases is criminal.  I put this down to a number of factors.  The question was asked as to why a product was a certain price in Northern Ireland.  Historically, in the UK there has been a certain attitude towards the Republic of Ireland.  It is seen as a different domain and on that basis it is of secondary importance to whatever is happening in the UK market.  I could go into great detail on that, but I do not think we have the time.</p><p>  Labelling is an issue with which I have a major problem.  I know for a fact that I can bring in Thai chicken and simply dust it in breadcrumbs, put it on a tray, wrap it in cellophane and stick a Bord Bia label on it.  That is wrong, but it is something that would be very simple to resolve.  I am not sure what efforts are being made in America to establish transparency, but I do not understand the fixation here on how much money retailers are making.  I am not a charity.  I am in the business to make money.  Walmart is the largest retailer in the world and it makes billions.  Tesco publishes its figures every year.  Ms Buckley made some important comments with regard to this in her submission.  The ethos of those companies is to make money.</p><p>  Reference was made to the liquid milk business, but I do not know much about it.  I put it to the committee that there is a close affinity between the cost of milk and share prices.  If one was a shareholder in Glanbia, one would have been very pleased with the performance of its shares over the past 18 months.  I am sure many farmers are shareholders in Glanbia.  However, if one wants to know why farmers are not getting paid enough for liquid milk, one should look at how much Glanbia pays them and how much money that company makes.</p><p>  A comment was made with regard to the irregular size of fruit and how difficult it was to make a comparison between that issue and that of liquid milk producers.  The situation is not funny.  In London's famous fruit and vegetable market, for example, a recent exercise found that some 500 tonnes of perfectly good food is thrown out every week because somebody in a multiple somewhere decides, for example, that a lemon must be a certain shape, size and colour before it is suitable for sale.  The amount of waste involved in this is scandalous in this day and age.</p><p>  The issue of artisan producers is important.  We were one of the first retailers to involve ourselves with artisan food producers, and west Cork farmers were one of the first artisan groups we dealt with.  It was quite a funny situation, because we had to move from a beards and sandals, Dinny and Miley from Glenroe, type of arrangement, where they bought half a dozen eggs in the local supermarket, brought them back to the farm, covered them in dung and feathers and sold them as free-range eggs.  At the other extreme, we had people who were totally passionate about their food product to the extent that they became transfixed by the importance of the beauty of the piece of cheese they were making and as a result were unable to get it to the store on time.  I am happy to say that since then, 99.99% of Irish artisan producers have become <i>&uuml;ber</i>-efficient and <i>&uuml;ber</i>-professional in the manner in which they do business.  We are delighted to be able to support them.</p> <p> To answer Deputy Pringle's question, as far as I am concerned Ms Buckley can give him all of the information he likes on the Competition Authority.  An enormous amount of research has been done in the UK, France, Sweden and other European countries.  The big four in the UK have been investigated more than once by the Office of Fair Trading.  I do not think there are any issues and as far as I am concerned it is quite clear and one can read between the lines.</p><p> With regard to the effect of the beef issue, we are a traditional supermarket and butcher and we do not sell pre-packed products as such.  The recent meat debacle has had a wonderful and excellent impact on me personally.  The overriding issue is still the same and it has been mentioned by a number of people, namely, that cheap food means cheap quality.  It is very simple.  With regard to the 18% price difference between the UK and the Republic of Ireland, I am available for a week if committee members wish to speak about this and they are welcome to come to my store.</p></speech>

As Deputy Deering stated, consumers should be made aware.  What amazes me is that the bigger companies outside of Ireland involved in this chain of events do not have inspectors to ensure a system is in place to protect consumers' interests.  This is what I am concerned about and, touch wood, Musgrave Group has not been affected so I am a bit more confident.  I question that these big multinational companies do not have chemists or others in place to ensure the problem has not occurred.  Do committee members honestly believe this has just happened in the past six to eight weeks?  It could have been happening for years but this is not the debate today.  If consumers are looking for value we must try to get the best quality product to deliver this value.  There is a limit and if pressure is put on suppliers somewhere along the way they might cut corners in this regard.</p></speech>

I again ask members to ensure their phones are off.  To get this subject on the agenda we need to use every available opportunity we have.</p></speech>

This information would give us a sense of where the sector is surviving.  I mentioned ugly fruit, and food wastage is a serious issue.  The point I was trying to make is that certain stories are more media friendly than others and not that one issue is more important than another.  Where two stories are of equal importance sometimes one is picked up because it contains a word which captures the public mind.</p><p>  I accept that because the sector represented by the witnesses is independent its cost base is higher which means higher prices.  Perhaps the witnesses do not have the answer, but we are puzzled because a big multinational trading on both islands can charge one price on one part of this island and a significantly different price in another.  They do not have huge cost differences.</p><p>    We want to make it clear that anybody who is in business is doing so to make money and this is fair and we have no argument with it.  We are concerned that if there is a perpetual squeeze, and we know producer margins have decreased, then for a producer to get a fair price the consumer will have to pay.  This is not so much the case in the witnesses' sector because I accept none of them is making huge profits.  We are considering the entire sector and the witnesses are the first to come before us.  A total of 70% of the sector is not represented by the witnesses and it is fair to ask if a supplier is being squeezed to make products cheaper for consumers how much is the retail sector making and to what extent is the consumer the ultimate beneficiary of the squeeze.  As the witnesses articulately put it, how much of this is caused by quality.  We will not know until the entire beefburger fiasco is fully and independently investigated how much was ultimately caused by the price squeeze on processors.  I cannot prove it, but there seems to be much talk that the big multiples and wholesalers are putting a huge price squeeze on processors, who are always looking for cheaper inputs to try to meet the demands of the wholesalers and the big multiples.  It is fine if the witnesses do not have views on these issues, but we are trying to delve into these matters to find out about these relationships and their end results.  The witnesses represent 30% of the sector, which is more fragmented, and we fully accept they are not the big force in the market.</p><p>  I was very interested to hear what the witnesses said about small food producers and the lack of quality and consistency.  In a previous life through the Leader programme we paid a full-time small food co-ordinator to help small food producers reach the standards mentioned by the witnesses such as delivering on time and quality standards.  Has there been an improvement in the ten years for which it has existed?  West Cork was mentioned.  The Fuchsia brand was a Leader brand, and the Department I used to head had a big role in encouraging it.  We saw it as a blue ribbon approach, with a Leader company creating standards and a brand one could stand over and guaranteeing to retailers they would have consistent quality.  What are the views of the witnesses on how producers can increase penetration of these high-quality niche brands being produced throughout the country?</p> <p>We have moved some of the way in the past ten years, but, while that is certainly what I am hearing from the sector, there is still a long way to go.  I can remember huge arguments taking place with the producers in regard to the HACCP and we worked with them by pointing out that the HACCP was their protection and that, if they did it right, they would be covered in terms of food scares and so on.  We all know of the dangers associated with a food scare.  I would be interested to know that they have got their act together as a sector in which there is a disproportionate level of employment for the amount produced because it is a niche product.</p></speech>

With regard to the big multiples, it is my understanding that if a supplier is producing milk, that supplier provides the fridge, stacks the milk in it and all the retailer has to do is to check it out and so on.  Is there a difference between the sector and the big multiples in getting the supplier or processor to do all of the hard work?  Do RGDATA members have to stack their own shelves and is there a qualitative difference in that work?</p></speech>

I also declare an interest in that I am a Glanbia shareholder.  Therefore, I could spend a week discussing the matter with the delegates.  It never ceases to amaze me that, no matter what supermarket one goes into, whether it is supplied by Musgrave or otherwise, one will never see the same price displayed for a carton of milk.  I will get the same price per litre day in, day out from the Glanbias of this world, yet I can go into my local Supervalu store in Tullow, County Carlow or else in Carlow town and there will be a difference of perhaps 10 cent a litre.</p></speech>

Mr. Frank Gleeson is coming to the meeting later and may have more specific numbers.  The vast majority of our members operate convenience stores or small supermarkets in town centres.  We have many members with larger supermarkets, as well as having members who are newsagents-tobacconists, but the largest sector of our membership encompasses the small convenience supermarket in town centres.  </p><p>  Mr. Foy may wish to respond to some of the questions about the price of milk.</p></speech>

I suggest we continue the Leader programme, thereby enabling companies to gain more grants.  For example, given the unemployment figures, there are people in, say, the Cavan region who are trying to do other things and, as a supermarket, we are trying to support and help.  Naturally, as not everyone has the same skills, we can help in providing some of the skills they lack.  There should be a continuation of some programme for local artisan producers.</p></speech>

Let me give an example.  An old codger in Rush used to bring two lorry loads of vegetables to Limerick city because there was nobody between Rush and Limerick growing vegetables.  It is a fundamental problem in the agriculture sector, although we do not have time to discuss it today.</p><p>  I am not lost on the question of ugly fruit, but I will not go back over it.  Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned the perpetual squeeze, which is all the more reason this protocol should be put in place.  I do not have anything else to say in that regard.</p><p>  I merchandise my own milk.  I do everything and receive no assistance from our milk suppliers in that regard.  We receive a financial contribution, but, while I am not into liquid milk company bashing, I have to say Glanbia, because of the manner in which it is set up, is not one of our favourite suppliers.  For my sins, we use milk from Northern Ireland, County Donegal and several suppliers; therefore, our friends in Glanbia do not enjoy exclusivity in our store.  There is a variety of reasons this is the case.</p><p>  On Deputy Pat Deering's comments on the price of milk, as I am not affiliated to Supervalu, I cannot explain its marketing techniques-----</p></speech>

It depends on the competitive environment in which one is operating, although there have been recommended selling prices for certain lines.  The Deputy referred to the price of milk.  I could be selling it at &euro;1.49 for 2 litres, while in another SuperValu store ten miles down the road, it could be selling at &euro;1.59.  That brings us back to the independent nature of the retailers within the SuperValu group.  We can still make the majority of decisions as to the price at which we sell products and where we will buy some of our produce.</p></speech>

While the committee will want to focus on the bigger picture, there are many smaller pictures also.  Members have no idea how fantastical and farcical is the environment in which retailers operate at times, given all of the legislation in place, the inspections that take place and the other regulations Ms Buckley can eloquently discuss.  I will give a very recent example.  Although the horsemeat issue is foremost at present, a Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine inspector came to my premises a number of weeks ago to check the residual toxins in fruit and vegetables and one of the items he wanted to check was a bottle of wine.  I have no idea why somebody from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine should have been checking the level of residual toxins on the grapes used in wine when somebody was mislabelling beef in a boning hall somewhere in the country.  It is both fantastical and farcical in some cases.</p></speech>

We have all talked about the price of wine and the below-cost selling of alcohol generally, as well as the amount of revenue lost to the Exchequer, although I do not agree with the solution proposed at the start of the year.  I am involved in food manufacturing, although I am also an independent retailer, like Mr. Nolan, and we provide a lot of employment within our business.  When one considers the volume of goods produced in this country versus the truckloads coming into the country every Monday morning, it is hard to understand from where it is all coming.</p></speech>

We raised many issues with them during the years in regard to the frustration of independent retailers who considered they were being bullied by large and monopoly suppliers, some of which were semi-State companies.  We found that we were not listened to very much and that we were being led down long, dark paths by the Competition Authority which took a long time to assess our complaints and which would eventually come back to us to state it was not really an issue for it.  We are talking about issues such as newspaper distribution and the availability of stamps to retailers.</p> <p>These are simple things which is why we are supportive of a grocery code of practice because we would like it to apply equally to the large suppliers who are supplying small independent retailers and those relationships in so far as they can be managed and be competitive and sustainable.  The National Consumer Agency consistently tells us that it does not deal with the business-to-business relationship and that it only deals with the relationship with the consumer.  We are often the small guy with a frustrating relationship with a very large supplier or monopoly provider and we need somebody to intervene in those situations.</p></speech>

I would like to acknowledge that because she is in the business of producing a particular product and avails of retailers large and small to market and sell it.  This is very important.  We went through part of this process during the last D&aacute;il, decided to produce a report on conclusion of our hearings and present it to the Government to lay before the Houses.  In the event that the consumer and competition Bill goes through the Houses and we have not finished, we aim to adequately contribute to the debate on Second Stage on the basis of the hearings we are having here.  Hopefully, due regard will be given to them by all sectors.</p><p>  The delegation has given us a very frank, robust and provocative contribution.  It is quite obvious that the three gentlemen with Ms Buckley are survivors, have competed in a very competitive environment and are successful in that regard.  Due to the fact that we received notice that there was concern about interference from mobile phones, this debate will be on the public record and to that end, it is important.  I also thank the members for putting the questions and drawing out the debate.  </p><p>  As a delegation from Retail Ireland will come before us, I must suspend the meeting for five minutes to allow the previous delegation to withdraw.  However, just as members from the delegation from Retail Ireland were welcome to attend this hearing so members of this delegation are welcome to attend the forthcoming session if they have time.  I thank Mr. Foy, Ms Buckley, Mr. Doyle and Mr. Nolan.  The sitting will be suspended for five minutes while the new witnesses take their places.  </p></speech>

I know both witnesses were in the public Gallery but I must go through the procedure regarding privilege again.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members have already been reminded of their responsibilities regarding privilege.  I now call on Mr. Lynam to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I am the director of Retail Ireland and am joined by Mr. Frank Gleeson, who is our chairman and retail director of Topaz Energy.  For the information of the members, Retail Ireland is the representative body for the entire retail sector in Ireland and is affiliated to IBEC.  Our members have 3,000 shops, including department stores, DIY stores, electrical retailers, fashion and footwear retailers, major supermarket groups, symbol groups and specialist and independent retailers.  As a representative organisation for the retail sector, rather than a retailer itself, Retail Ireland would like to take this opportunity to contextualise the debate on the sector that the committee will have in the coming weeks.</p><p>  This debate takes place against the background of depressed consumer demand and job losses in our sector.  Since 2008, over 50,000 people have lost their jobs in the Irish retail sector.  There has been a large fall in consumer demand and spending.  Retail sales generally are down by the order of 25% and many retail businesses around Ireland have closed.  Consumers, of course, are the lifeblood of the retail sector.  Members will no doubt be aware that consumer sentiment is very volatile but the KBC Ireland/ESRI Consumer Sentiment Index, which is the latest measure, is down 35 points on where it stood a few years' ago.  That said, retail is still the largest employer in the State, with over 250,000 people working in Irish retail.  We represent 14% of the total number of people employed in the economy and account for about 10% of GDP.  We are the most geographically diverse industry in the country, helping balanced regional development with about 44,000 active wholesale and retail enterprises located in every town, village and city in the country.  It may surprise members to learn that 86% of Irish retail businesses have fewer than ten employees and 86% are Irish-owned.</p><p>  I will hand over to Mr. Gleeson who will speak on a number of the issues pertinent to the discussion today and, hopefully, we can have an exchange.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-05a.60" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Gleeson" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2013030500011#L00700"><p>Despite the huge difficulties in our economy and the huge difficulties facing our customers, retailers remain committed to sourcing as many products as possible from Ireland.  I will let the supermarket groups themselves tell members about their own programmes and level of commitment to Irish suppliers but in the round, Irish retailers purchase around &euro;5 billion worth of Irish food and drink every year.</p> <p>This compares to total exports of Irish food and drink of &euro;9 billion.  This commitment is not altruistic.  Retailers exist only because they sell things that consumers actually want to buy.  Irish retailers are very aware that consumers wish to purchase Irish products, without sacrificing the quality or value mentioned.  Retailers respond to that desire whenever they can.</p><p> As a trade association, Retail Ireland is not allowed to discuss prices or facilitate discussions among its members on the issue.  However, it is worth noting a number of facts already in the public domain.  The first relates to the trends in grocery prices in recent years.  Grocery prices paid by consumers have fallen significantly in recent years.  This is supported by official data from the Central Statistics Office.  Every month the CSO compiles the consumer price index which collects nearly 20,000 prices of 170 food and non-alcoholic drink products.  These figures provide a robust sample size that can be relied upon to give an accurate picture of price trends.  They show that food and non-alcoholic drink prices have fallen by 6.3% since 2008.  The reason for these price falls is quite simple - consumers have less money.  Tens of thousands of us have lost our jobs and those of us lucky enough to have a job have seen cuts in wages.  Retailers have had to provide even greater value for money as a result.  If they do not, they will not survive and go bust.  Prices did increase last year but only by a very modest 0.6%, primarily on foot of higher commodity prices worldwide.  Even given this small rise, Irish grocery price inflation was the lowest in the European Union, where prices rose by an average of 3%, and much lower than in the United Kingdom, where prices rose by an average of 3.2%.  The rise was also significantly lower than the general Irish rate of inflation which stood at 2% last year.</p><p> I refer to supplier relations.  I am aware that the committee has in its mind the forthcoming consumer and competition Bill and the enabling provisions that may be contained within it on the issue of retailer-supplier relations.  In its submission to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on this subject in 2009 Retail Ireland stated it opposed the type of code of practice published by Mr. John Travers in his consultation document at the time.  We did so for several reasons.  The rationale for the code has not been demonstrated and the code is not justified by any identifiable consumer benefit.  More important, the Competition Authority has already stated that the retail sector is competitive.  The code, as presented, would have inhibited legitimate commercial behaviour that benefited the consumer.  In addition, the code would add an unnecessary regulatory and cost burden that would ultimately be borne by consumers and retailers.</p><p> To provide extra detail, I make the following points.  The retail sector is intensely competitive.  This is the view of the Competition Authority which in 2009 published its report on the retail related import and distribution sector.  On its publication, the chairperson, Mr. Bill Prasifka, stated falling retail prices were proof that competition worked.  That report is the most authoritative examination of the Irish grocery market by an impartial body that had full and confidential access to all the facts and all the market participants.  It is of note that the Competition Authority did not call in this report or at any other time for a code to govern the retailer-supplier relationship. The then T&aacute;naiste noted at the time of publication that &quot;no major systematic problems in the overall market were identified.&quot;  The relationship between retailers and suppliers is, without question, a robust, often tense, commercial relationship.  Retailers drive hard bargains - they do so because they have to.  Value for money for the consumer is vital.  However, there is a difference between legitimate commercial behaviour and sharp practice.  Retailers do not engage in unfair or illegal practices and if such practices take place, there is already in place a legislative framework to deal with them.  As the Competition Authority stated in its submission to the Department in 2009, the Competition Act 2002 already prohibits or prevents the compelling or coercing of payment or allowances for the advertising or display of goods and &quot;hello money&quot; in regard to new or extended retail outlets under new ownership.  Its submission goes on to state the provisions of the Act may be enforced by either private plaintiff or the authority.  To date, no cases have been brought before the courts under the Act.</p><p> I take the opportunity to refer to the ESRI's publication in 2009, &quot;How To Do A Lot of Harm by Trying To Do A Little Good&quot;.  In the document Mr. Paul Gorecki rightly pointed to the harm that would be caused by the draft code of practice for the grocery sector then being proposed and stated, &quot;The Code is likely to lead to a rise in prices for suppliers with no mechanisms or tests for considerations of consumer harm to be taken into account&quot;.</p><p> Members of the committee may be aware of developments at EU level in the area of retailer-supplier relations within the multi-stakeholder dialogue which reports to the high level forum on a better functioning food supply chain.  That process has seen retailers and suppliers sign up to a set of principles, good practice exemplars and a framework for implementation and enforcement agreed to by manufacturers, wholesalers and the retail trade.  The principles of the European code, in summary, are: all agreements should be in writing; unilateral change to contract terms shall not take place unless such a possibility has been agreed to in advance; all agreements should be complied with; information should be exchanged in strict compliance with competition law; all contracting parties in the supply chain should bear their own appropriate entrepreneurial risk; and that there shall be no application of threats in order to obtain an unjustified advantage or transfer an unjustified cost.</p><p> Retail Ireland and its members support these principles which provide a framework for doing business that respects contractual freedom and ensures competitiveness, trust and continuity.  These characteristics are essential for business development, innovation and economic, social and environmental sustainability and these principles will benefit consumers and wider society.  The framework aims to ensure signatories respect the principles and process commitments to integrate the principles with daily business practice.  It includes a disputes procedure with a choice of options and offers reassurance to the complainant that he or she will not be subject to commercial retaliation.  What is more, the principles are being applied this year.  The first tranche of signatories will come on stream in the coming weeks, with more coming on stream throughout the year.  At very least, the process should be given the time it deserves to bed down and succeed.  We believe the EU voluntary agreement, with the full support of suppliers and retailers, offers the best model for progress.  Crucially, it provides an even playing pitch for all retailers and suppliers across Europe.  No Irish retailer or supplier is placed at a competitive disadvantage <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>its counterparts or competitors elsewhere in the European Union.</p><p> The committee is obviously interested in the well-being of farmers.  A national code would benefit neither consumers - as costs would rise - nor farmers, as retailers generally have no direct relationship with farmers.  That is a key point for us.  Retailers never purchase product directly from farmers; rather, they source product from suppliers and processors.  It is these groups with which retailers have direct commercial relationships.  The only organisations that would benefit from a national code would be those suppliers and processors in the middle of the supply chain, not the consumers at one end or the farmers at the other.  It is vital that this fact is recognised; otherwise the unintended consequences of a code of practice would see large suppliers and processors benefit to the disadvantage of small independent retailers, with no advantage to farmers or consumers.  These disadvantages would be coupled with very high compliance costs which would include legal advice on compliance with the code; the appointment of a compliance officer, as well as training and operational costs; buyer training; the maintaining and supply of records as required under the code; and costs arising from responding to queries from any enforcement body.  These cost increases would not be sustainable, particularly in the current environment described by Mr. Lynam.  </p><p> I will now hand over to Mr. Lynam to conclude.</p></speech>

However, I talk to various people involved in the supply chain, particularly those in its weakest link, small processors or producers who, by their very nature, are small and diverse.  What they report is very far from the rosy picture painted today.  We are often told there are a few dominant players in the market, an issue I was trying to explore during the previous session.  Of course, there are many small independent grocers, but most of them deal with big wholesalers.</p> <p> It is fair to say that between prices and the actual terms and conditions which apply, there is a huge squeeze on suppliers, producers and processors to continually provide more for less.  I have been informed about specific examples of behaviour which show an abuse of dominant position by the biggest players in the market here.  One of the reasons I referred at our earlier session to the need for transparency with regard to where the money was being made was that we were constantly informed that all of this squeezing was being done by the biggest and most powerful players on an altruistic basis and in the interests of the consumer.  As the delegates from the retail trade who were present earlier pointed out, these players are not altruistic.  It is clear that they are particularly hard-nosed and out to make as much money as possible for their shareholders.</p><p> Are our guests stating the elements of the retail sector in Ireland which work with both primary and secondary producers operate on the basis that the relationships involved are equal?  Are they saying none of those in a fairly dominant position has succumbed to the temptation to refuse to buy goods from certain producers, thereby leaving the latter with nowhere to go?  Are they stating there has been no abuse of their very dominant position by some of the big processors, in particular?  Are they informing the committee that the position is good and that the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, does not need to introduce legislation to try to restore a balance among primary producers, small food producers, processors and retailers?</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions regarding the Competition Authority and the report it published in 2009.  Given that four years have passed, perhaps it is time to publish a new report on competition in the retail sector.  It is interesting to note the authority's statement to the effect that it cannot carry out investigations because of a lack of staff and resources.  This begs the question as to whether there is any point in the authority remaining in existence.  Our guests have indicated that because the authority stated this, there is no problem in the retail sector.  As Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v indicated, however, we have all been informed of instances where difficulties or problems have arisen, particularly in the context of the abuse of their dominant position by certain retailers.  The fact that prices have fallen does not necessarily mean anti-competitive practices are not being used, neither does the fact that there have not been convictions.  All this indicates is that these matters have probably not been investigated.</p><p>  Our guests have also referred to the EU voluntary agreement which is due to come into place later in the year and highlighted the disadvantages of a code of practice, namely, that issues relating to legal advice, training compliance officers, etc. would act as barriers to the introduction of such a code.  Surely these would also be required under the voluntary code.  If retailers are going to comply with such a code, they will be obliged to put in place systems to ensure compliance.  That which our guests have made is, therefore, not really not an argument against the putting in place of a code of practice.  If a voluntary code is such a good thing and it is going to work, a statutory code should not prove to be too great a burden for the retail sector to bear.</p><p>  I am suspicious of voluntary codes, particularly as such codes applied in the banking sector and elsewhere in the past.  Those codes did not work well.  A code of practice is necessary.  The cost of complying with such a code would also apply in respect of a voluntary code.  What are Retail Ireland's members doing to ensure they will be in a position to comply with such a code?  Which of those members would be expected to sign up to and implement the voluntary code in the coming months?</p></speech>

As previous speakers pointed out, there are numerous examples of instances which highlight the need for such a code.  Like Deputy Thomas Pringle, I am of the view that a statutory code would be better than a voluntary one.  A statutory code would have more teeth.  In the case of a voluntary code, opt-in and opt-out clauses might be included in respect of particular organisations.  This would mean certain entities would not be as forthcoming with information as would be the case if a statutory code applied.  The only way forward is to introduce a code of practice on a statutory rather than a voluntary basis because this will ensure it will have teeth.</p></speech>

We are informed that this is the case because the system involved is adversarial in nature and the complaint must come from the individual.  Our guests have also made the point that the Competition Authority can initiate proceedings.  However, the authority would have to become aware of a difficulty in the first instance.  Will our guests explain the position on implementation of the European code and the high compliance costs they have identified in the context of the draft code presented by Mr. Travers?</p></speech>

We have a real mixed bag in our group.  My company runs 120 stores and also supplies 220 independent retailers, with which I would have a very close working relationship on a day-to-day basis.  Broadly speaking, I am not hearing many complaints.  This is because the market operates in a free environment.  Multiples and independents can enter the market.  It is very easy to do so, but there is fierce competition.  The Irish retail market is considered to be one of the most competitive in the world.  At supermarket and convenience store level, one can certainly see this in terms of the quality of our retailers.  The prices charged reflect the cost of doing business.  The costs of doing business in this country are a great deal higher than those which obtain in other EU countries, particularly in the context of wages, utilities, etc.  It is difficult for us because we do not control any of these costs and they are costs which we must bear.  There are supply chain costs which are an issue for suppliers.</p><p>  I will work backwards through the points made by the Deputies.  In reply to Deputy Pat Deering and the Chairman, complaints can be made.  I do not understand why people do not make complaints if issues arise, but I have not heard of anything in the recent past.  It is an open door from that perspective.  The Competition Authority compiled a report in 2009 and if it needs to be updated, that is fine.  However, it contains the most recent data available to us which is factual and not anecdotal in nature.  I have heard anecdotal complaints, but I would like some facts to be presented that we could investigate and deal with in a proper fashion.</p><p>  I will ask Mr. Lynam to outline why we think the European code is a good idea, particularly from the perspective of our membership of the European Union.  Given that we hold the Presidency, this is a good initiative which we should, perhaps, embrace and bring forward.  We have encouraged retailers and suppliers to participate and are of the view that this is the right thing to do in terms of the market.</p></speech>

That is a simple premise and it is one we fully support.</p> <p>Frank Gleeson outlined many of the principles which are regarded as beneficial to a sustainable supply chain.  The difference is that retailers and suppliers have worked together to develop an implementation framework for those principles which will be significantly less costly than the proposals made at national level some years ago.  An independent adjudication group would be set up with options for dispute resolution, a procedure to deal with aggravated and anonymous complaints, a governance group to monitor the new system and also sanctions for breaches of the principles.</p><p> I refer to a question about actions being taken by Irish retailers to ensure they are ready. This is being facilitated by EuroCommerce, our European trade association.  A series of meetings will take place in March at which retailers will be briefed on the nitty-gritty of how the new voluntary approach will work.  Early adopters and signatories will come on stream in March and April.  This system is currently being introduced across the European Union by major retailers and suppliers.  It would be premature to introduce a national code that would supersede the system and put an unnecessary administrative and cost burden on the retail sector at a time when costs are being cut back to the bone and consumer spending is falling.  The retail sector across the European Union has said that if stakeholders at any level are of the view after a year or six months that this system is not working, it will be reconsidered.  The European Commission is involved in that process too.  We think we have developed a good system with suppliers that will protect consumers and also suppliers and retailers throughout the Union.</p></speech>

I remember an example of a service that was contracted to a Department of which I was a Minister at one stage.  It was a very poor service and I was anxious to bring the service provider to court.  The problem was that the people who used the service depended on it and had no other service.  The result was that nobody would give me, as Minister, the complaint so that I could bring the operator in question to court.  The people were afraid of retribution.  Anecdote would have it - I think it is more than anecdote, as we have all heard the same - that there are plenty of food suppliers of various types who believe impossible burdens are being put on them.  They have great difficulties with contracts and conditions, for example.  They are bearing all the risk but they cannot put their heads over the parapet because they will be the losers if they do so.  I have even heard people say they would not testify in front of this committee because they are afraid that the people who buy their produce might blackball them if they did so.  If all these people are wrong, there is a significant public relations job to be done.  They sincerely and honestly believe this to be the case.  In the normal course of events, anybody who is invited to appear before this committee is really eager to attend.  People like to attend this committee for all sorts of reasons, including the schoolchildren who are next door at the Irish language committee.  They like to be in the Houses of the Oireachtas and to have their points heard.  It would be fair to say that people on the supply side of the industry are afraid to come in here.  If Mr. Lynam is correct that there is nothing to fear and that it is all fair competition and no dominant position is being abused, then these people are labouring under a significant misapprehension.  It is very important for the retail industry to reassure them that this is not the situation.  However, if they are correct, then it is not working, and the Oireachtas will have to deal with the issue.</p><p>  On the issue of voluntary codes, in a previous life, I had plenty of examples of how a new body will sign up to anything in a voluntary code because there is no sanction in a voluntary code.  Give them half as many conditions in a statutory code - an enforceable code - or a statutory regulation or law and they will squeal because they know sanctions are attached.  Given the choice between fewer provisions with legal sanction or a voluntary code with more provisions, I would choose the fewer provisions with the legal back-up.  I do not believe a voluntary code is worth much, because it is only a voluntary code and there are no sanctions if it is breached.</p></speech>

Will it provide that payments to suppliers are made on time?  As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said, if the voluntary code is so acceptable, would Retail Ireland be satisfied if it were put on a statutory footing in this country?</p></speech>

However, I see no need for that if major Irish retailers sign up, not least because should Irish suppliers or retailers decide that the code needs tweaking this would then involve a legislative process at national level.  On the issue of listing, hello money is against the law.  It is covered by any code and by legislation.</p></speech>

However, I would favour the introduction of the EU voluntary code as a first measure.  It it does not work then it could be put on a statutory footing.  It is a European code of practice which has been debated at length.  It certainly looks like a modern piece of code writing that would be beneficial to European suppliers and businesses and to Irish businesses and suppliers.</p><p>  Perhaps a better public relations job is needed.  Some of the suppliers are very powerful in the market and as a representative of independent retailers we have little choice in some of the products carried by our members.  Some big retailers have a lot of power too.</p><p>  The consumer makes the decision on where to shop.  If consumers do not get the right products and the right prices, or if they believe they are not getting the Irish products they want, they will vote with their feet.  The consumer makes the decision, ultimately, as to whether a retailer stocks a product.  The consumer is the person who decides where the business goes.  This has been demonstrated many times.  Many of the independent retailers who spoke earlier have a point of difference from a big multiple because they carry local produce.  In my view that is a good policy.  They are able to do something different.  If Irish consumers want to shop there, they will do so.  Big multiples do their business their way.  As a practising retailer and a supplier into the retail trade, in my view, it is not a case of one shoe fits all.</p></speech>

The Competition Authority can itself act on any reports it receives of unfair or illegal practices.  It has also raised the point by stating "It is not clear why it is thought that the attitude of suppliers towards making complaints would change if a code of practice was introduced."  I have yet to hear how any code of practice would deal with that problem.  What would deal with that problem is the provision within our EU voluntary code on anonymous complaints.  I am happy to provide that information to the committee.  The introduction of a code of practice would not solve that problem.  Small suppliers or small retailers could still believe that the dominant supplier or retailer is abusing its position and a code of practice would not address that issue.  I think our voluntary approach at EU level would do so.</p></speech>

From my knowledge of that body, its concern is to stop businesses from forming cartels and overcharging the consumer.  It is not concerned about what the supplier gets, good, bad or indifferent.  In fact, the less money the supplier gets, the cheaper the product for the consumer.  It does not deal with the issue we are discussing, which is ensuring that we keep the suppliers of Ireland in business.</p></speech>

Large suppliers can hold a dominant position over small retailers, as can large retailers.  It is not true to say there is no dealing with and no direct purchasing from the primary producer.  In the one area in which there has been a significant decline - fruit and vegetables - there are and have been direct purchasing arrangements between the suppliers of potatoes and vegetables and the multiple retail outlets and purchasing groups.</p><p> The forthcoming consumer and competition Bill will have to include an enabling provision to allow the Minister, no matter what else happens, to move to a statutory position very quickly.  That has to be the basic minimum in the Bill.  Otherwise we would be simply closing the door and saying we had done our business.  We would then have to introduce new legislation to do it.  The legislation has to provide for the enactment of statutory codes under a statutory instrument, a regulation from a Minister, if the evidence is available.  I do not think anyone else should be afforded protection or allowed to take comfort from the idea that new legislation would not allow for this.  It would be a huge mistake.  That is a personal opinion and I will make that point on Second Stage of the Bill.</p><p> I thank the delegates and committee members for attending.  This is an ongoing issue.  The multiples will be meeting the committee and we have received requests from other representative organisations to come before us too.  All of the meetings will be held in public.  People are welcome to attend and be present in the Visitors' Gallery or read the Official Report afterwards.</p></speech>

Bh&iacute; gluaiseacht san Eoraip san am sin, a bh&iacute; i bhfabhar c&oacute;nascadh polaiti&uacute;il i measc t&iacute;ortha na hEorpa a thabhairt chun cr&iacute;che ach n&iacute; raibh &Eacute;ire s&aacute;sta a bheith p&aacute;irteach anseo.  N&iacute; d&oacute;igh liom f&eacute;in go mbeadh fonn ar mhuintir na h&Eacute;ireann ag an am iad f&eacute;in a cheangail le r&eacute;imeas nua polaiti&uacute;il tar &eacute;is an sracadh a rinneamar len&aacute;r neamhsple&aacute;chas &oacute;n R&iacute;ocht Aontaithe a bhaint amach agus seasamh ar &aacute;r gcosa f&eacute;in.</p><p>  Ach c&eacute;ard faoi &Eacute;ireannaigh an lae inniu.  Feicim go bhfuil an tAontas Eorpach ag druidim i dtreo aontas polaiti&uacute;il beag&aacute;n ar bheag&aacute;n agus deirim go bhfuil s&eacute; seo ag tarl&uacute; i ngan fhios do fhormh&oacute;r mhuintir na t&iacute;re seo.</p><p>  Thosaigh an tAontas Eorpach mar chomhphobal eacnama&iacute;och ina mbeadh deis tr&aacute;d&aacute;la gan constaic&iacute; idir na baill.  T&aacute; go leor athraithe d&eacute;anta &oacute; shin ar chonradh na R&oacute;imhe faoin a ghlac &Eacute;ire le ballra&iacute;ocht.  Mar shampla, t&oacute;gadh an focal eacnama&iacute;och as an teideal i gConradh Maastricht in 1993.  T&aacute; go leor cainte faoi l&aacute;thair i dtaobh c&uacute;rsa&iacute; c&aacute;nach agus c&uacute;rsa&iacute; bainc&eacute;ireachta a chur faoi smacht an Aontais Eorpaigh.  S&eacute;ard a fheicim-se ag tarl&uacute; sna blianta amach romhainn n&aacute; go m&eacute;ad&oacute;far an br&uacute; i dtreo an fheidear&aacute;lachais agus go laghd&oacute;far go m&oacute;r ar neamhsple&aacute;chas na mballst&aacute;t.  I mo thuairim-se beidh s&eacute; deacair ag polaiteoir&iacute; i roinnt de th&iacute;ortha an Aontais, &Eacute;ire san &aacute;ireamh, a chur ina lu&iacute; ar dhaoine gur rud fi&uacute;ntach &eacute; seo.  T&aacute; n&iacute;os m&oacute; agus n&iacute;os m&oacute; seineaf&oacute;ibe le tabhairt faoi deara san Aontas Eorpach le blianta beaga anuas.  Is d&oacute;cha go bhfuil baint aige seo leis an gc&uacute;l&uacute; eacnama&iacute;ochta agus an ganntanas poist ach t&aacute; an tuiscint i measc daoine go bhfuil an iomarca cumhachta &aacute; thabhairt suas do pharlaimint na hEorpa.  Cialla&iacute;onn s&eacute; seo, dar le daoine, nach bhfuil aon smacht ag an Rialtas ar inimirce mar shampla, agus d&aacute; bharr seo go bhfuil eachtrannaithe ag goid poist &oacute; dh&uacute;chasaigh na t&iacute;re.  Is de bharr tuairim&iacute; mar seo at&aacute; taca&iacute;ocht &aacute; fh&aacute;il ag p&aacute;irtithe polaiti&uacute;la ag a bhfuil claonadh faisisteach.</p><p>  T&aacute; s&eacute; beartaithe ag Rialtas na Breataine reifreann a re&aacute;cht&aacute;il a thabharfaidh rogha do mhuintir na t&iacute;re sin f&aacute;nacht san Aontas Eorpach n&oacute; &eacute; a fh&aacute;g&aacute;il.  T&aacute; an baol ann go leanfaidh t&iacute;ortha eile an sampla seo, go m&oacute;r mh&oacute;r m&aacute; leanann an g&eacute;arch&eacute;im eacnama&iacute;ochta i bhfad eile.  N&iacute;l s&eacute; i bhfad &oacute; chuala m&eacute; fear ag r&aacute; nach raibh s&eacute; ceart n&aacute; c&oacute;ir go mbeadh li&uacute;ntas leana&iacute; &aacute; &iacute;oc le p&aacute;ist&iacute; thar lear, mar gheall ar dhuine d&aacute; dtuismitheoir&iacute; a bheith ag obair anseo.  Chuala m&eacute; duine eile ag r&aacute; n&aacute;r cheart go mbeadh cead ag aon eachtrannach glacadh le post in &Eacute;irinn go dt&iacute; go mbeadh chuile &Eacute;ireannach  a bh&iacute; ag iarraidh poist fostaithe i dtosach.</p><p>  Is l&eacute;ir mar sin, go bhfuil g&eacute;ar gh&aacute; le eolas agus tuiscint a thabhairt don phobal ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; geilleagair, gn&oacute; agus polait&iacute;ocht agus an cheangail at&aacute; eatarthu.  Beidh s&eacute; riachtanach ag &aacute;r bpolaiteoir&iacute; a bheidh mac&aacute;nta cneasta leis an bpobal, bunt&aacute;ist&iacute; agus m&iacute;bhunt&aacute;iste chuile ghn&eacute; den Aontas Eorpach a chur os a gcomhair go m&oacute;r mh&oacute;r chomh fada is a bhaineann s&eacute; le aontas polaiti&uacute;il.  Is ceart freisin, i mo thuairim-se, go mbeadh reifreann &eacute;iginnteach i ngach mballst&aacute;t sula nglactar le haon leas&uacute; conartha n&oacute; le haon chonradh nua ballra&iacute;ochta.  M&aacute; mhotha&iacute;onn daoine go bhfuil Rialtas ag gn&iacute;omh&uacute; gan a gcead, t&aacute; an chont&uacute;irt ann go neart&oacute;idh an n&aacute;isi&uacute;nachas agus an faisisteachas agus go bhf&eacute;adfadh s&eacute; seo an tAontas a scrios.</p><p>  T&aacute; s&eacute; pr&aacute;inneach d&aacute; bhr&iacute; sin, go mbeadh f&iacute;s ag &aacute;r gceannair&iacute; i leith todhcha&iacute; an Aontais Eorpaigh agus go dtosa&iacute;d&iacute;s l&aacute;ithreach le daoine a oili&uacute;int le go mbeidh ar a gcumas cinneadh ciallmhar a dh&eacute;anamh.  Go raibh maith agat.</p></speech>

T&aacute;im chun an r&aacute;iteas &lsquo;A bhfuil roimh &Eacute;irinn san Aontas Eorpach&rsquo; a phl&eacute;.</p><p>  I nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re n&iacute; f&eacute;idir liom ach a bheith di&uacute;ltach faoi thodhcha&iacute; na t&iacute;re seo san Aontas Eorpach agus i mo thuairim t&aacute; s&eacute; deacair a thuiscint, c&eacute;n f&aacute;th nach bhfuilimid tar &eacute;is an tAontas a fh&aacute;g&aacute;il cheana f&eacute;in, i ndiaidh an phraiseach at&aacute; d&eacute;anta acu ar an t&iacute;r seo.  Cheap m&oacute;ramh muintir na t&iacute;re gur smaoineamh maith a bh&iacute; san AE sa bhliain 1973 agus caithfidh go bhfuilimid tar &eacute;is ceacht &eacute;igin a fhoghlaim &oacute;na gcuid bot&uacute;n.  Is t&iacute;r difri&uacute;il &iacute; &Eacute;ire anois, t&aacute; an t&iacute;r seo in umar na haiml&eacute;ise agus ceapaim nach g&aacute; ach sracfh&eacute;achaint a thabhairt ar 2008 agus ar aghaidh le todhcha&iacute; na t&iacute;re seo san AE a fheice&aacute;il.  N&iacute;l in ann d&uacute;inn ach tuilleadh ciorraithe agus d&eacute;ine, sin &eacute; todhcha&iacute; na t&iacute;re seo.  Ba ch&oacute;ir do na scol&aacute;ir&iacute; anseo dul i dtaith&iacute; ar na coinn&iacute;ollacha seo mar muidne a bheas ag &iacute;oc as.  Ag an bpointe seo d&eacute;arfainn go bhfuil c&uacute;pla duine den tuairim gur &oacute;r&aacute;id &iacute; seo at&aacute; cos&uacute;il le han-chuid &oacute;r&aacute;id&iacute; eile l&aacute;n le di&uacute;ltachais, beidh m&eacute; mac&aacute;nta, t&aacute; s&iacute;.</p><p>  N&iacute;l aon dea-thaith&iacute; agamsa ar an AE.  Nach raibh ruda&iacute; iontacha geallta d&uacute;inn i ndiaidh an reifrinn ar an ESNM?  N&iacute; fheicim aon tairbhe uaidh seo, g&eacute;arch&eacute;im idirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta bainc&eacute;ireachta a bh&iacute; againn in 2008 agus bh&iacute; sealbh&oacute;ir&iacute; b&aacute;in&iacute; ar fud na hEorpa bainteach le bainc lofa na h&Eacute;ireann.  N&iacute; raibh cead againn iad a dh&oacute; mar nach bhfuaireamar cead &oacute;n AE.  T&aacute; na saor&aacute;naigh ag &iacute;oc go daor as seo anois agus n&iacute;l aon dabht go mbeimid ag &iacute;oc as an bpleidhc&iacute;ocht seo i measc sealbh&oacute;ir&iacute; i mblianta le teacht nuair a tharla&iacute;onn an rud ceannann c&eacute;anna ar&iacute;s.  T&aacute; cuimhne agam ar Chonradh Liosp&oacute;in, t&aacute; cuimhne agam ar na mb&aacute;in&iacute;.  T&aacute; postanna ag gabh&aacute;il le Liosp&oacute;in, ach c&aacute; bhfuil na postanna seo?  C&aacute; bhfuil an tairbhe? Di&uacute;lta&iacute;odh le Liosp&oacute;in sa ch&eacute;ad reifreann agus di&uacute;lta&iacute;odh ansin le freagra muintir na h&Eacute;ireann.  Bh&iacute; orainn triail a bhaint as ar&iacute;s.  N&iacute;l ach focal amh&aacute;in ar seo, scannalach.  Cuireann s&eacute; seo ceist t&aacute;bhachtach os &aacute;r gcomhair amach, an bhfuil ballra&iacute;ocht na t&iacute;re seo san AE chun flaithis na t&iacute;re a laghd&uacute; sa todhcha&iacute;?  An bhfuil an Eoraip chun aont&uacute; agus a bheith mar th&iacute;r amh&aacute;in faoi cheannas Bheirl&iacute;n le thart ar 480 milli&uacute;n saor&aacute;naigh?</p><p>  T&aacute; an t-airgeadra lofa c&eacute;anna &aacute; &uacute;s&aacute;id agam, c&eacute;n f&aacute;th n&aacute;r ch&oacute;ir don AE Roinn Airgeadais na mballst&aacute;t ar fad a smacht&uacute;?  Ar bhain &Eacute;ire neamhsple&aacute;chas amach sa bhliain 1922 le go mbeimid in ann dul faoi bhr&aacute;id impireachta ollmh&oacute;r eile?  T&aacute; &iacute;omh&aacute; i mo cheann den AE i gc&uacute;pla bliain agus &iacute; cos&uacute;il le St&aacute;it Aontaithe Mheirice&aacute;, beidh &Eacute;ire mar  st&aacute;t feidear&aacute;lach laistigh de th&iacute;r ollmh&oacute;r agus faoin am sin n&iacute; bheimid in ann stop a chur leis.</p><p>  Caithfimid a bheith mac&aacute;nta linn f&eacute;in, is beag cumhachta at&aacute; ag &Eacute;irinn san AE.  T&aacute; dul am&uacute; ar &eacute;inne a cheapann go bhfuil lucht rialaithe an AE pioc buartha faoi Rialtas na h&Eacute;ireann.  N&iacute;l aon tionchar againn sa chomhphobal seo.  N&iacute; g&aacute; ach sracfh&eacute;achaint a thabhairt ar l&iacute;on na bhFeisir&iacute; i bParlaimint na hEorpa at&aacute; mar ionada&iacute; do &Eacute;irinn agus gheobhaimid tuiscint ar an saghas cumhachta at&aacute; againn.  T&aacute; beirt Fheisire d&eacute;ag ann do phoblacht na h&Eacute;ireann i gcompar&aacute;id le 99 don Ghearm&aacute;in agus 69 don R&iacute;ocht Aontaithe gan Tuaisceart &Eacute;ireann san &aacute;ireamh.  T&aacute; fhios agam gur ar bhonn daonra at&aacute; na su&iacute;och&aacute;in seo d&aacute;lta ach n&iacute;l dabht ar bith faoi gur t&aacute;bhacht a bhaineann le tuairim&iacute; lucht na t&iacute;re seo nuair nach bhfuil ach 0.83% den pharlaimint in&aacute;r seilbh ach t&aacute; thart ar 21% ag an nGearm&aacute;in.  T&aacute; post coimisin&eacute;ara ar f&aacute;il d&uacute;inn ach i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re n&iacute;l smacht ag M&aacute;ire Geoghan Quinn ar a leith&eacute;id de iascaireacht n&aacute; de fheirmeoireacht.  N&iacute; raibh aon saghas cumhachta aici i gc&aacute;s don ord&uacute; a tugadh don Rialtas in 2009 na bainc a th&oacute;g&aacute;il sl&aacute;n.</p><p>  S&iacute;lim f&eacute;in gurb &iacute; an euro an bot&uacute;n is m&oacute; a rinne an t&iacute;r seo.  Deirtear gur th&oacute;g s&eacute; chomh fada orainn ballra&iacute;ocht san AE a bhaint amach mar go rabhamar ar &aacute;r bp&aacute;irtn&eacute;ir&iacute; tr&aacute;cht&aacute;la ba th&aacute;bhachta&iacute; an Bhreatain.  C&eacute;n f&aacute;th n&aacute;r leanamar a sampla mar sin?  C&eacute;n f&aacute;th n&aacute;r fhanamar glan ar an euro? Bunt&aacute;iste at&aacute; ag an mBreatain agus ag an Danmhairg n&aacute; m&aacute; t&aacute; siad cr&aacute;ite ag g&eacute;arch&eacute;im eacnama&iacute;ochta is f&eacute;idir leo d&iacute;luach&aacute;il a dh&eacute;anamh ar an airgeadra.  N&iacute;l an rogha sin againn in &Eacute;irinn, gabhann ard&uacute; sna leibh&eacute;il easp&oacute;rt&aacute;lacha le d&iacute;luach&aacute;il an euro agus mar is eol d&uacute;inn is t&iacute;r sinn at&aacute; ag brath ar easp&oacute;rt&aacute;lacha.  C&eacute;n &eacute;ifeacht at&aacute; aige seo ar an todhcha&iacute;?  Nuair a tharl&oacute;idh g&eacute;arch&eacute;im eile cos&uacute;il seo, agus tarl&oacute;idh, beidh luach an euro dochreidte &iacute;seal agus tos&oacute;idh an fhulaingt at&aacute;imid ag dul i dtaith&iacute; uirthi ar&iacute;s eile.</p> <p>T&aacute; orm tagairt a dh&eacute;anamh freisin don mhargadh seo at&aacute; d&eacute;anta ag an Rialtas ar son mhuintir na t&iacute;re.  Sna me&aacute;in chumars&aacute;ide rinne an-cheili&uacute;radh ar seo, cheapf&aacute; nach raibh pingin rua le h&iacute;oc ar ais againn leis an ECB, n&iacute; h&eacute; ach go bhfuil tr&eacute;imhse na n-&iacute;oca&iacute;ochta&iacute; tar &eacute;is leathn&uacute;.  T&aacute; s&eacute; cos&uacute;il le leathn&uacute; ollmh&oacute;r a fh&aacute;il ar thr&eacute;imhse morg&aacute;iste, ach go deimhin morg&aacute;iste nach leat &eacute; i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re.  Beidh na h&iacute;oca&iacute;ochta&iacute; m&iacute;chothroma seo f&oacute;s &aacute; &iacute;oc ag &aacute;r ngarr-ph&aacute;ist&iacute; agus n&iacute;l dabht faoi ach go bhfuil siad m&iacute;chothrom.  D&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfainn &oacute;r&aacute;id ioml&aacute;n eile a thabhairt ar an topaic sin.</p><p> Sa todhcha&iacute; beidh tuilleadh c&aacute;ine maoine le h&iacute;ocadh agus tuilleadh t&aacute;ill&iacute; ollscoile.  M&aacute; cheapaimid go bhfuil ruda&iacute; costasach anois samhlaigh 20 bliain amach anseo agus muid f&oacute;s ag freastal ar chruinnithe leis an dream c&eacute;anna a chabhraigh an t&iacute;r seo a scriosadh, n&iacute; haon bhr&eacute;ag at&aacute; ansin.  Conas nach bhfuil an chomhphobal scartha cheana f&eacute;in?</p><p> Ar an bpointe sin, n&iacute;l dabht agam go mbrisfidh an tAE suas, ceann de na haidhmeanna at&aacute; ann n&aacute; tr&aacute;d&aacute;il n&iacute;os &eacute;asca a choth&uacute; i measc na mballst&aacute;t agus ioma&iacute;ocht a laghd&uacute;.  T&aacute; s&eacute; foghlamtha agam sa rang eacnama&iacute;ochta ar scoil gurbh &iacute; seo an aidhm c&eacute;anna a bh&iacute;onn i gceist le claon-ph&aacute;irteachas i measc gn&oacute;lachta&iacute; agus rud suntasach faoi claon-ph&aacute;irteachas n&aacute; go mb&iacute;onn gn&oacute;lacht amh&aacute;in ann i gc&oacute;na&iacute; at&aacute; n&iacute;os l&aacute;idre n&aacute; na gn&oacute;lachta&iacute; eile agus leagann siad na coinn&iacute;ollacha s&iacute;os.  N&iacute;l bealach ar bith gurbh &iacute; &Eacute;ire an ballst&aacute;t is l&aacute;idre a leagan coinn&iacute;ollacha s&iacute;os.  Rud eile faoi chlaon-ph&aacute;irteachas n&aacute; nach maireann siad go deo mar go mb&iacute;onn ball amh&aacute;in i gc&oacute;na&iacute; ag lorg sciar n&iacute;os m&oacute; den mhargadh agus titeann claon-p&aacute;irteachas as a ch&eacute;ile.</p><p> Ceapaim go bhfuil s&eacute; seo in ann don AE agus t&aacute; cr&iacute;och ag teacht le ballra&iacute;ocht na t&iacute;re seo sa ghr&uacute;pa gan dabht.  Caithfimid a bheith r&eacute;ala&iacute;och faoi seo ar fad.  N&iacute; hiad an Rialtas tofa at&aacute; ag d&eacute;anamh cinnt&iacute; sa t&iacute;r seo is ar &eacute;igin go bhfuil smacht ar bith acu ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute;.  Deireann an tAE c&eacute;ard le d&eacute;anamh &oacute; thaobh polasa&iacute; fisiceach srl. agus n&iacute;limid riamh chun rud a dh&eacute;anamh nach dtaitn&iacute;onn leis an tUasal Barroso agus a chomhghleacaithe.  N&iacute;l tuiscint acu ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; na t&iacute;re seo.  T&aacute; an easpa tuisceana sin ag d&eacute;anamh dochair ach sin at&aacute; romhainn mar bhall den AE, beidh tuilleadh c&aacute;nach m&iacute;chothrom &aacute; bhr&uacute; ar ghn&aacute;th mhuintir na h&Eacute;ireann.  N&iacute;or cheap m&eacute; gur euro sceipteach a bh&iacute; ionam riamh ach is l&eacute;ir go raibh m&eacute; m&iacute;cheart.</p><p> I ndiaidh taighde a dh&eacute;anamh thar na mbliana ar an &aacute;bhar seo feicim gur euro sceipteach amach is amach m&eacute;.  Ceapaim go bhfuil s&eacute; r&iacute;-shoil&eacute;ir anseo inniu nach bhfuil m&oacute;r&aacute;n c&uacute;ise a bheith dearfach faoi p&eacute; rud a bhfuil in ann do &Eacute;irinn mar bhall den AE.  S&iacute;lim go bhfuil na h&eacute;achta&iacute; at&aacute; tar &eacute;is tarl&uacute; agus muid mar bhaill an-t&aacute;bhachtach agus muid ag iarraidh d&eacute;anamh amach c&eacute;ard at&aacute; in ann d&uacute;inn.</p><p> Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il libh as ucht cluas na h&eacute;isteachta a thabhairt dom inniu.  D&eacute;arfainn nach n-athr&oacute;idh faic go luath ach t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go dtarl&oacute;idh rud &eacute;igin sul at&aacute; s&eacute; r&oacute;-dh&eacute;anach don t&iacute;r seo agus d&aacute; saor&aacute;naigh.

Sampla maith n&aacute; cail&iacute;n darbh ainm Georgina Hobday go raibh c&oacute;isir t&iacute; aici d&aacute; 16&uacute; breith l&aacute;.  Thug tuist&iacute; Georgina cead di cuireadh a thabhairt do 100 duine teacht chuig a breith l&aacute; ach ansin rinne Georgina bot&uacute;n ollmh&oacute;r, chuir s&iacute; an t-eolas go l&eacute;ir faoin ch&oacute;isir suas go poibl&iacute; ar Facebook an toradh th&aacute;inig 400 duine chuig an teach bh&iacute; ceathrar fostaithe ag an doras chun stop a chur le aon iompar m&iacute;-oiri&uacute;nach ach n&iacute; raibh s&eacute; de chumhacht acu stop a chur le 500 duine &oacute;g a bh&iacute; faoi thionchar an &oacute;il.  Thosaigh na daoine &oacute;ga ag dreapadh na mballa&iacute; ag briseadh fuinneoga agus sa deireadh bh&iacute; an teach go raibh luach milli&uacute;n euro air go hioml&aacute;n scriosta agus bh&iacute; buid&eacute;il agus canna&iacute; folmha caite thart timpeall na h&aacute;ite.  Is &eacute; sc&eacute;al Georgina ceann de na m&iacute;lte sc&eacute;alta uaf&aacute;sacha at&aacute; ag Facebook ach droch-sc&eacute;alta iad go l&eacute;ir.  T&aacute; taobh dearfach ag na me&aacute;in chomh maith agus is &eacute; seo an chaoi go bhfuil gach duine thart timpeall an domhain nasctha le ch&eacute;ile.  Is f&eacute;idir a sheoladh &oacute; thaobh amh&aacute;in den domhan chuig an taobh eile le br&uacute; cnaipe amh&aacute;in.  T&aacute; s&eacute; deacair do dh&eacute;ag&oacute;ir&iacute; a thuiscint c&eacute; chomh h&uacute;s&aacute;ideach go mb&iacute;onn na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; seo.</p><p>  Is oile&aacute;n f&iacute;or-beag muid, ach t&aacute;imid ceangailte leis an chuid eile den domhan leis na me&aacute;in sh&oacute;isialta.  M&aacute; t&aacute; cairde agat thar lear n&iacute; dh&eacute;anann s&eacute; difr&iacute;ocht c&eacute;n &aacute;it ina bhfuil siad is f&eacute;idir leat dul i dteagmh&aacute;il leo l&aacute;ithreach.  M&aacute; t&aacute; gaolta agat at&aacute; tar &eacute;is dul ar imirce thar lear le br&uacute; cnaipe amh&aacute;in, t&aacute; t&uacute; in ann dul i dteagmh&aacute;il leo ar&iacute;s de bharr na me&aacute;in sh&oacute;isialta t&aacute; ceithre milli&uacute;n duine ar an oile&aacute;n seo ceangailte le seacht mbilli&uacute;n duine ar fud an domhain.  Bunt&aacute;iste eile do na me&aacute;in sh&oacute;isialta na go bhfaigheann roinnt daoine &oacute;ga taca&iacute;ocht &oacute; phobal ar l&iacute;ne, seo f&iacute;or go h&aacute;irithe go bhfuil sp&eacute;is uath&uacute;il acu n&oacute; go mb&iacute;onn siad scoite amach &oacute; na daoine eile at&aacute; ag an aois ch&eacute;anna ach de bharr na me&aacute;in sh&oacute;isialta is f&eacute;idir leo teacht ar dhaoine a bh&iacute;onn an sp&eacute;is cheanna acu f&eacute;in.</p> <p>Is bealach nua-aimseartha iad na me&aacute;in sh&oacute;isialta chun cairde nua a dh&eacute;anamh agus de bharr earra&iacute; ar n&oacute;s an PlayStation agus an X Box fi&uacute;, n&iacute; g&aacute; do na cairde nua seo a bheith ina gc&oacute;na&iacute; in aice leat chun dul ag spraoi leo.  Is f&eacute;idir caidreamh l&aacute;idir a dh&eacute;anamh le daoine &oacute; aon &aacute;it ar domhan ar l&iacute;ne.  Agus de bharr na cairde nua seo at&aacute; d&eacute;anta ag na daoine &oacute;ga a mb&iacute;onn scoite amach de ghn&aacute;th feabhsa&iacute;onn a gcuid scileanna sh&oacute;isialta &oacute;n gcairdeas.  Motha&iacute;onn na daoine &oacute;ga n&iacute;os s&aacute;bh&aacute;ilte anois mar t&aacute; siad i su&iacute;omhanna nua ar n&oacute;s dul chuig an chol&aacute;iste n&oacute; ag dul chun a bheith ina mball de chlub ar leith.  Is &eacute; mo thuairim n&aacute; go bhfuil na bunt&aacute;ist&iacute; n&iacute;os t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; n&aacute; na m&iacute;bhunt&aacute;ist&iacute; maidir leis na me&aacute;in sh&oacute;isialta.  Cinnte t&aacute; c&uacute;pla sc&eacute;al uaf&aacute;is ann faoi na me&aacute;in sh&oacute;isialta ach ar an taobh eile den sc&eacute;al t&aacute; bunt&aacute;ist&iacute; iontacha ann don oile&aacute;n beag seo at&aacute;imid in&aacute;r gc&oacute;na&iacute; air.

Is mise Hazel N&iacute; Dhonnabh&aacute;in agus inniu pl&eacute;ifidh m&eacute; an t-&aacute;bhar na me&aacute;in sh&oacute;isialta agus an tionchar at&aacute; ag na me&aacute;in sh&oacute;isialta ar an saol in &Eacute;irinn sa l&aacute; at&aacute; inniu ann.</p><p>  Tr&aacute;th d&aacute; raibh, fuair daoine an t-eolas a bh&iacute; uathu faoin domhan m&oacute;r thimpeall orthu, &oacute; nuacht&aacute;in, &oacute;n teilif&iacute;s, &oacute;n raidi&oacute;, &oacute; leabhair agus &oacute; iris&iacute;.  Ach anois, sa l&aacute; at&aacute; inniu ann &aacute;fach, t&aacute; gl&uacute;in &uacute;r daoine &oacute;ga tagtha ar an saol nach mbacann leis na me&aacute;in thraidisi&uacute;nta, a bheag n&oacute; a mh&oacute;r.  D&aacute; bhr&iacute; s&iacute;n, th&aacute;inig athr&uacute; ar an sl&iacute; a dh&eacute;anaimid cumars&aacute;id le ch&eacute;ile mar anois caitheann muintir na h&Eacute;ireann a gcuid ama ar an Idirl&iacute;on chun teacht ar an eolas at&aacute; uathu n&oacute; d&iacute;reach chun teagmh&aacute;il agus cumars&aacute;id a bheith acu lena ch&eacute;ile agus nach bhfuil s&eacute; s&iacute;n go hiontach?  &Eacute; s&iacute;n r&aacute;ite, n&aacute; b&iacute;mis dall ar an seanfhocal "N&iacute; lia duine n&aacute; tuairim" agus b&iacute;onn an cheist seo pl&eacute;ite agus athphl&eacute;ite ag polaiteoir&iacute;, ag iriseoir&iacute; gach uile l&aacute;.  Ach inniu ba mhaith liom mo smaointe a chur in i&uacute;l daoibh agus c&eacute;n s&oacute;rt tionchar at&aacute; i gceist: dearfach n&oacute; di&uacute;ltach.</p><p>  Cialla&iacute;onn na me&aacute;in sh&oacute;isialta gach rud ar an Idirl&iacute;on go nd&eacute;anann an domhan n&iacute;os l&uacute;.  Agus t&aacute; s&eacute; i mb&eacute;al an phobail le fada an l&aacute; go bhfuil na me&aacute;in chumars&aacute;ide agus r&eacute; na nua-theicneola&iacute;ochta fite fuaite le ch&eacute;ile.  D&aacute; bhr&iacute; s&iacute;n, t&aacute; n&iacute;os m&oacute; daoine &aacute;balta cult&uacute;r difri&uacute;il a bhlaiseadh gach uile l&aacute;, taobh thiar de sc&aacute;ile&aacute;n r&iacute;omhaire.  Fi&uacute; mura mb&iacute;onn smaointe ag aon duine faoi aon &aacute;bhar, is sl&iacute; easca &iacute; Twitter chun sc&eacute;alta f&uacute;t f&eacute;in n&oacute; tuairim at&aacute; agat a nochtadh don domhan.  T&aacute; Twitter ag f&aacute;il an l&aacute;mh in uachtar ar na me&aacute;in thraidisi&uacute;nta mar faigheann daoine nuacht n&oacute; an eolas, tr&iacute; bheith ag caint lena ch&eacute;ile ar an Idirl&iacute;on.  Is borradh &eacute; r&eacute; an Idirl&iacute;n agus anois n&iacute; b&oacute;ithr&iacute;n pr&iacute;obh&aacute;ideach &eacute; an t-Idirl&iacute;on a thuilleadh ach m&oacute;tarbhealach leathan l&aacute;n-oscailte.  Tionchar dearfach is ea &eacute;.</p><p>  T&oacute;gaimis sracfh&eacute;achaint ar ghn&eacute;ithe eile den &aacute;bhar seo, YouTube.  N&iacute; nach ionadh, go bhfuil an t-Idirl&iacute;on &aacute;balta saol na ndaoine a athr&uacute; chomh maith.  T&aacute; go leor fil&iacute;, scr&iacute;bhneoir&iacute;, eala&iacute;ont&oacute;ir&iacute; agus amhr&aacute;naithe a bhaineann &uacute;s&aacute;id as blaganna YouTube agus as f&oacute;raim eile ar an Idirl&iacute;on chun a gcuid saothar a chur os comhair an phobail.  T&aacute; s&eacute; an-saor agus cinnt&iacute;tear lucht m&oacute;r &eacute;isteachta, l&eacute;ite agus f&eacute;achana d&oacute;ibh agus t&aacute; s&eacute; sin thar mholadh beirte agus taispe&aacute;nann sin d&uacute;inn nach bhfuil aon teorainn leis na f&eacute;idearthachta&iacute; a bhaineann leis an Idirl&iacute;on.  B&iacute;odh sin mar at&aacute;, ach feictear na m&iacute;lte is na m&iacute;lte f&oacute;gra&iacute; gach uile l&aacute; ar an YouTube agus m&aacute;s mian le do ghn&oacute; dul chun cinn a dh&eacute;anamh ba ch&oacute;ir duit p&aacute;irt a ghlacadh i r&eacute; na me&aacute;in sh&oacute;isialta ach bheadh s&eacute; amaideach a r&aacute; nach mb&iacute;onn tionchar ag na f&oacute;gra&iacute; seo orainn agus d&aacute; bhr&iacute; sin uaireanta b&iacute;onn daoine faoi bhois an chait ag f&oacute;gra&iacute;ocht at&aacute; ag dul &oacute; smacht.  De thairbhe sin, c&eacute;n s&oacute;rt tionchar at&aacute; i gceist anseo?</p><p>  Dhealr&oacute;dh an sc&eacute;al, gurb &eacute; an me&aacute;n s&oacute;isialta at&aacute; chun tosaigh ar na me&aacute;in eile n&aacute; Facebook.  Is &aacute;bhar an-chasta &eacute; Facebook mar t&aacute; dh&aacute; insint ar gach sc&eacute;al, ach inniu ba mhaith liom an fh&iacute;rinne lom a insint daoibh.  Labhra&iacute;m amach go neamhbhalbh i gcoinne na bula&iacute;ochta a tharla&iacute;onn do dh&eacute;ag&oacute;ir&iacute; n&oacute; do dhaoine &oacute;ga ar Facebook.  Ba ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn aire a thabhairt don bhfadhb seo.  T&aacute; an fhadhb seo ar leac &aacute;r ndorais f&eacute;in agus nach &eacute; aos &oacute;g na t&iacute;re an mhaoin is luachmhaire at&aacute; ag an t&iacute;r seo?  Arda&iacute;onn an fhadhb sin, ceist mh&oacute;r.  C&eacute;n f&aacute;th nach nd&eacute;anann muintir na h&Eacute;ireann faic, c&eacute; go bhfuil s&eacute; i mb&eacute;al an phobail go bhfuil daoine &oacute;ga in umar na haiml&eacute;ise, a bhu&iacute;ochas leis an gcos ar bolg a dh&eacute;antar ar dhaoine ar an Facebook.  T&aacute; faill&iacute; d&eacute;anta againn ar dhaoine &oacute;ga, c&eacute; go mbraitheann todhcha&iacute; na t&iacute;re ar an &oacute;ige.  Is iadsan polaiteoir&iacute;, ceannair&iacute; agus sti&uacute;rth&oacute;ir&iacute; an lae am&aacute;raigh.  Uaireanta d&eacute;anaimid dearmad ar an bhf&iacute;ric sin.  Agus um an dtaca seo, t&aacute; an fhadhb ag dul in olcas, mar sin caithfimid dul i ngleic leis an bhfadhb seo, d&aacute; luaithe is ea is fearr &eacute;.</p><p>  Pointe eile faoin &aacute;bhar seo n&aacute; m&aacute; chuirtear rud ar bith f&uacute;t f&eacute;in, ar an Idirl&iacute;on beidh s&eacute; ann go deo.  M&aacute; bh&iacute;onn grianghraf amaideach agat ar an Facebook t&aacute; s&eacute; cos&uacute;il le tat&uacute; doscriosta ar chraiceann do shaol.  C&eacute; go nd&eacute;anann a l&aacute;n daoine bot&uacute;in nuair a bh&iacute;onn siad &oacute;g, sa l&aacute; at&aacute; inniu ann d&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfadh na bot&uacute;in sin a bheith ar f&aacute;il do gach duine go deo, fost&oacute;ir&iacute; san &aacute;ireamh.  Tionchar di&uacute;ltach amach is amach is ea &eacute;, mar n&iacute;l aon duine &aacute;balta &eacute;al&uacute; &oacute;na stair.</p><p>  Faoi dheireadh, n&iacute; haon &aacute;ibh&eacute;il a r&aacute; gur athraigh na me&aacute;in sh&oacute;isialta an saol thart timpeall orainn agus t&aacute; go leor ruda&iacute; maithe deasa ag baint leis na me&aacute;in sh&oacute;isialta.  Ar nd&oacute;igh t&aacute; fadhbanna ann freisin ach is duine r&eacute;ad&uacute;il m&eacute; agus tuigim le tamall de bhlianta anuas go bhfuil an-chuid daoine ag eir&iacute; buartha faoin m&eacute;id eolais at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il ar an Idirl&iacute;on agus faoin tionchar a bhaineann leis.  Ach t&aacute; na fadhbanna sin i ngach t&iacute;r a bheag n&oacute; mh&oacute;r agus ar sc&aacute;la idirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta chomh maith.  Ach ar ais n&oacute; ar &eacute;igin, m&aacute; fhanaimid le ch&eacute;ile s&aacute;r&oacute;imid na deacrachta&iacute;, sula mbeidh s&eacute; r&oacute;-dh&eacute;anach.  Ach d&aacute; olcas &eacute; an gr&eacute;as&aacute;n s&oacute;isialta, d&eacute;anann s&eacute; pobal beag den domhan m&oacute;r agus cos&uacute;il le gach rud t&aacute; baol ag baint leis.  Ar an ioml&aacute;n, is m&oacute; i bhfad na bunt&aacute;ist&iacute; a bhaineann leis na me&aacute;in sh&oacute;isialta agus s&iacute;lim f&eacute;in gur ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn &eacute; a cheili&uacute;radh.</p><p>  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam gur bhain t&uacute; sult as a raibh le r&aacute; agam agus mar fhocal deiridh, is m&oacute;r idir inn&eacute; agus inniu.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaibh as &eacute;isteacht liom.</p></speech>

Bail &oacute; Dhia oraibh, is mise Lisa N&iacute; Laoghaire agus t&aacute; m&eacute; sa ch&uacute;igi&uacute; bliain i gCol&aacute;iste Phobail Mhuire Gan Sm&aacute;l i nD&uacute;n M&aacute;nmha&iacute; Co. Chorca&iacute;.  T&aacute; s&eacute; de phribhl&eacute;id agam caint libh inniu agus mo chuid tuairim&iacute; a nochtadh faoin &aacute;bhar seo.</p><p>  Sna blianta beaga anuas, t&aacute; tionchar m&oacute;r ag na me&aacute;in sh&oacute;isialta ar an saol in &Eacute;irinn.  N&iacute; g&aacute; a r&aacute; n&aacute; go bhfuil s&eacute; n&iacute;os &eacute;asca n&aacute; riamh &eacute; a &uacute;s&aacute;id.  Deirtear go gcaitheann daoine in &Eacute;irinn timpeall deich n-uair an chloig ar an Idirl&iacute;on gach seachtain.  L&aacute; i ndiaidh lae, cloistear na sc&eacute;alta c&eacute;anna faoi na ruda&iacute; di&uacute;ltacha a bhaineann leis, agus s&eacute; mo thuairim m&aacute; oibr&iacute;mid le ch&eacute;ile go bhfuil s&eacute; ar &aacute;r gcumas deireadh a chur le roinnt de na ruda&iacute; sin.  Mar a deir an seanfhocal, &ldquo;ar sc&aacute;th a ch&eacute;ile a mhaireann na daoine&rdquo;.</p><p>  Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, bheadh s&eacute; amaideach a r&aacute; nach mb&iacute;onn tionchar maith ag na me&aacute;in sh&oacute;isialta orainn.  Sa l&aacute; at&aacute; inniu ann, mar gheall ar an gc&uacute;l&uacute; eacnama&iacute;ochta, t&aacute; n&iacute;os m&oacute; daoine ag dul ar imirce.  N&iacute;l s&eacute; chomh deacair is a bh&iacute; s&eacute; fanacht i dteagmh&aacute;il leo.  An tionchar at&aacute; ag na me&aacute;in sh&oacute;isialta ar dhaoine sna t&iacute;ortha eile n&aacute; go bhfuil siad &aacute;balta caint lena muintir agus lena gcairde ar bhonn rialta.  Fad&oacute;, n&iacute; raibh siad &aacute;balta aon rud a dh&eacute;anamh ach glaoch a chur abhaile n&oacute; litir a sheoladh ach anois b&iacute;onn daoine &aacute;balta dul ar Skype agus a muintir a fheice&aacute;il.  Sna blianta seo, t&aacute; r&iacute;omhaire i mbeagnach gach teaghlach agus mar sin t&aacute; an t-Idirl&iacute;on ar f&aacute;il do gach duine.  Is bunt&aacute;iste m&oacute;r &eacute; Skype.</p><p>  Deir daoine &aacute;irithe go bhfuil s&eacute; n&iacute;os &aacute;isi&uacute;la a gchuid siopad&oacute;ireachta a dh&eacute;anamh ar an Idirl&iacute;on.  Caithfear an cheist a chur, m&aacute; dh&eacute;anaimid gach rud ar an Idirl&iacute;on, conas a bhuaileann t&uacute; le daoine?  C&eacute;n tionchar a bheadh ag na me&aacute;in sh&oacute;isialta orainn ansin?  Droch-thionchar a bheadh aige ar shaol daoine, bheadh gach duine s&aacute;ite istigh sa teach &oacute; mhaidin go ho&iacute;che.  Sna blianta beaga anuas, n&iacute;l gn&oacute; ann nach bhfuil ar Facebook.  Ar l&aacute;mh amh&aacute;in b&iacute;onn tionchar maith aige sin ar shaol in &Eacute;irinn mar cuireann duine f&oacute;gra&iacute; ann.  Ach, ar an l&aacute;mh eile, cad faoi na daoine nach bhfuil ar Facebook?  N&iacute; bheadh fhios acu cad a t&aacute; ar si&uacute;l.  Cad faoi na seandaoine?  Is annamh a bhuaileann t&uacute; le seanduine at&aacute; ar Facebook d&aacute;ir&iacute;re, agus mar sin ceapaim go mb&iacute;onn droch-thionchar ag na me&aacute;in sh&oacute;isialta ar na seandaoine uaireanta.</p><p>  An gcreidfe&aacute; go bhfuil timpeall 1.75 milli&uacute;n &Eacute;ireannaigh ar Facebook agus isteach is amach le 100,000 duine ar Twitter?  Is annamh a bhuaileann t&uacute; le d&eacute;ag&oacute;ir nach bhfuil ar Facebook n&aacute; Twitter, t&aacute;im cinnte dearfa de.  Is su&iacute;omhanna Idirl&iacute;n iontacha iad m&aacute; &uacute;s&aacute;idtear i gceart iad.  &Uacute;s&aacute;idtear iad chun fanacht &iacute; dteagmh&aacute;il le cairde agus le muintir agus b&iacute;onn t&uacute; &aacute;balta picti&uacute;ir a sheoladh. T&aacute; daoine &aacute;balta &quot;follow&quot; daoine c&aacute;ili&uacute;la ar Twitter agus a gcuid smaointe a fheice&aacute;il.  Cuireann daoine a gcuid smaointe f&eacute;in ar Twitter freisin agus b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir gur rud maith &eacute; sin.  Is seans &eacute; don duine ord agus eagar a chur ar a gcuid smaointe ach ar l&aacute;mh eile, is cur am&uacute; ama &eacute; d&aacute;ir&iacute;re.</p><p>  Tuigim go raibh bula&iacute;ocht ann roimh na me&aacute;in sh&oacute;isialta ach, is oth liom a r&aacute; gurb &eacute; seo an tionchar is uaf&aacute;sa&iacute; at&aacute; ag na me&aacute;in sh&oacute;isialta ar an saol in &Eacute;irinn, go h&aacute;irithe ar shaol na ndaoine &oacute;ga.  N&iacute;l insint b&eacute;il ar an mbr&oacute;n a bh&iacute;onn orm nuair a fheicim ruda&iacute; goilli&uacute;nacha.  T&aacute; na me&aacute;in sh&oacute;isialta millte ag an mbula&iacute;ocht.

N&iacute;l ach l&eacute;iri&uacute; uaf&aacute;sach gan ainm le feice&aacute;il ann.  Sin rud at&aacute; ag d&oacute; na geirbe orm.  An bhfuil fuascailt na faidhbe le f&aacute;il? Is d&oacute;cha go bhfuil.</p> <p>Is d&oacute;cha go bhfuil, caithfear deireadh a chur leis an su&iacute;omh seo gan dabht.  An m&oacute; eile trag&oacute;id a tharl&oacute;idh sula gcuirfear deireadh le <i>ask.fm</i>?  Buaileann spadhar m&eacute; nuair a smaoin&iacute;m ar a leith&eacute;id, is l&eacute;ir do ch&aacute;ch an baol at&aacute; ann.</p><p> Ar an Idirl&iacute;on, Facebook go h&aacute;irithe, cuireann daoine picti&uacute;ir ann.  De ghn&aacute;th, b&iacute;onn picti&uacute;ir deasa gan fadhb i gceist ach uaireanta, b&iacute;onn said goilli&uacute;nach do dhaoine eile.  N&iacute;l s&eacute; sin cothrom n&aacute; c&oacute;ir agus n&iacute; bh&iacute;onn tionchar maith aige ar shaol daoine.  Leis an fh&iacute;rinne a r&aacute;, m&aacute; chuireann t&uacute; picti&uacute;ir ar an Idirl&iacute;on, beidh siad ann go deo.  Fad&oacute;, nuair a chuaigh t&uacute; abhaile &oacute;n scoil, n&iacute; raibh t&uacute; i dteagach&aacute;il le daoine go dt&iacute; an l&aacute; d&aacute;r gcionn.  Ach anois, a bhu&iacute;ochas leis an Idirl&iacute;on agus leis an bhf&oacute;n p&oacute;ca, n&iacute; bh&iacute;onn sos ag daoine &oacute;n mbula&iacute;ocht.  Bheadh tionchar an-di&uacute;ltach aige sin ar na daoine &oacute;ga sa l&aacute; at&aacute; inniu ann.  Deirtear gur i dt&uacute;s na haic&iacute;de is fusa &iacute; a leigheas agus caithfear a r&aacute; gur f&iacute;or sin sa ch&aacute;s seo.</p><p> Uaireanta, ceapaim go bhfuil tionchar dains&eacute;arach ag na me&aacute;in sh&oacute;isialta ar an saol in &Eacute;irinn.  D&eacute;arfainn go gcuireann roinnt daoine an iomarca eolais f&uacute;thu f&eacute;in ar an Idirl&iacute;on.  B&iacute;onn aon duine ar domhan &aacute;balta dul ar do Facebook agus f&eacute;achaint ar gach rud ba mhaith leis, fi&uacute; mura bhfuil aithne agat air.  B&iacute;onn fhios aige c&aacute; bhfuil t&uacute; i do ch&oacute;na&iacute; n&oacute; c&aacute; bhfuil t&uacute; ag d&uacute;l ar scoil.  N&iacute; bh&iacute;onn d&oacute;thain eolais ag daoine faoi na me&aacute;in sh&oacute;isialta.</p><p> Rud eile a bhaineann leis na me&aacute;in sh&oacute;isialta, n&aacute; cluich&iacute; r&iacute;omhaire.  T&eacute;ann daoine ar l&iacute;ne chun na cluich&iacute; sin a imirt le daoine eile.  Uaireanta &eacute;ir&iacute;onn duine, go h&aacute;irithe buachaill&iacute;, tugtha d&oacute;ibh.

Is m&oacute;r an on&oacute;ir dom bheith anseo os bhur gcomhair ag caint faoin &aacute;bhar an pobal &aacute;iti&uacute;il.  Gan amhras ar bith, &aacute;bhar is ea an pobal &aacute;iti&uacute;il a bhfuil an-sp&eacute;is agam ann. N&iacute; g&aacute; go n-aont&oacute;idh sibh liom, ach ar aghaidh linn ar aon n&oacute;s.</p><p>  I mo thuairim, is &eacute; an pobal &aacute;iti&uacute;il ceann de na ruda&iacute; is t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; i saol beagnach gach duine ar domhan sa l&aacute; at&aacute; inniu ann.  N&iacute; thaitneodh s&eacute; le aon duine a fheice&aacute;il go bhfuil a gcuid ceantar ag dul in olcas toisc go bhfuil s&eacute; chomh t&aacute;bhachtach sin d&oacute;ibh, agus is &eacute; sin an f&aacute;th a bhfuil s&eacute; f&iacute;or-th&aacute;bhachtach iad go l&eacute;ir a fhorbairt.</p><p>  Creidim gurb iad na h&aacute;iseanna agus na clubanna cro&iacute;l&aacute;r an phobail &aacute;iti&uacute;il agus is ruda&iacute; m&oacute;ra, t&aacute;bhachtacha iad i saol an duine, go h&aacute;irithe na daoine &oacute;ga.  Is iad na ruda&iacute; seo lena bhf&aacute;sann daoine suas, na h&aacute;iteanna ina bhfoghlaim&iacute;onn t&uacute; na ceachtanna t&aacute;bhachtacha faoin saol agus den chuid is m&oacute;, na h&aacute;iteanna ina mbuaileann t&uacute; le do chairde.  Chomh maith leis sin, a bhu&iacute;ochas leis na h&aacute;iseanna agus leis na clubanna i do cheantar, b&iacute;onn tuiscint n&iacute;os fearr ag daoine orthu f&eacute;in mar dhuine agus ar an bpearsantacht at&aacute; acu.  Cur ceist ort f&eacute;in, c&aacute; mbeife&aacute; mura mbeadh na h&aacute;iseanna agus na clubanna agat i d&rsquo;&aacute;it dh&uacute;chais f&eacute;in, agus t&uacute; ag f&aacute;s an&iacute;os?  M&eacute; f&eacute;in, bheinn caillte.  Is rud m&oacute;r t&aacute;bhachtach &eacute; mo phobal &aacute;iti&uacute;il dom, go h&aacute;irithe mo chlub Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael.  Is &eacute; an club seo inar fhoghlaim m&eacute; ceachtanna faoin saol cos&uacute;il leis an t&aacute;bhacht a bhaineann le bheith cairdi&uacute;il le daoine agus a bheith ag cabhr&uacute; leo.  Mh&uacute;scail s&eacute; ionam gur duine sp&oacute;rt&uacute;il m&eacute; freisin agus mh&uacute;scail s&eacute; an muin&iacute;n at&aacute; agam ionam.  D&rsquo;fhoghlaim m&eacute; a l&aacute;n ruda&iacute; &oacute; mo phobal &aacute;iti&uacute;il agus ag deireadh an lae, beidh s&eacute; i gc&oacute;na&iacute; t&aacute;bhachtach dom.  Mar sin, t&aacute; orainn na h&aacute;iseanna agus na clubanna seo a fhorbairt ionas go mbeidh siad ann sa todhcha&iacute;, mar ba mhaith linn go mbeadh an taith&iacute; c&eacute;anna ag na daoine a bheidh ina gc&oacute;na&iacute; in &Eacute;irinn amach anseo.  Sin an ch&uacute;is, ceapaim, go bhfuil s&eacute; an-t&aacute;bhachtach na pobail &aacute;iti&uacute;la a fhorbairt in &Eacute;irinn.</p><p>  Cuireann s&eacute; m&uacute;isiam orm &eacute; a r&aacute;, ach t&aacute; &iacute;omh&aacute; na bpobal &aacute;iti&uacute;la ag dul in olcas sa l&aacute; at&aacute; inniu ann, de dheasca fadhbanna s&oacute;isialta, agus is m&oacute;r an trua &eacute; sin.  N&iacute;l m&oacute;r&aacute;n le d&eacute;anamh ag d&eacute;ag&oacute;ir&iacute; ina n-&aacute;it ch&oacute;naithe agus t&aacute; siad leamh.  Mar sin, glacann siad p&aacute;irt i ngn&iacute;omhartha frithsh&oacute;isialta cos&uacute;il le bheith ag &oacute;l faoi aois, ag baint trial as druga&iacute;, ag scriosadh ruda&iacute; timpeall an cheantair agus ag scr&iacute;obh graif&iacute;t&iacute; ar na balla&iacute;.  Scriosann na fadhbanna seo an ceantar &aacute;iti&uacute;il agus n&iacute; hamh&aacute;in sin, ach teaghlaigh na ndaoine seo.  B&iacute;onn na teaghlaigh ag troid agus ag arg&oacute;int faoi na h&aacute;bhair seo.  Crutha&iacute;onn na fadhbanna seo &iacute;omh&aacute; di&uacute;ltach den phobal.  Sin rud at&aacute; ag d&oacute; na geirbe orm.  D&eacute;anann s&eacute; olcas don cheantar agus do na teaghlaigh nuair nach bhfuil siad &aacute;balta d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis na fadhbanna seo.  Mar sin, t&aacute; g&aacute; ann na pobail &aacute;iti&uacute;la a fhorbairt ionas go mbeid&iacute;s &aacute;balta stop a chur leis na fadhbanna seo, a chrutha&iacute;onn &iacute;omh&aacute; uaf&aacute;sach de na ceantair.  T&aacute; orainn n&iacute;os m&oacute; &aacute;iseanna suimi&uacute;la a chur ar f&aacute;il do dhaoine &oacute;ga in &Eacute;irinn agus mar sin, stopfaid&iacute;s ag baint triail as na ruda&iacute; di&uacute;ltacha seo agus ansin, dh&eacute;anfadh s&eacute; sin maitheas do na pobail &aacute;iti&uacute;la timpeall na t&iacute;re.

Scriosann an fhadhb seo ceantracha mar muna bhfuil suim ag daoine fanacht sa t&iacute;r seo ag lorg postanna, f&aacute;gfaidh siad an &aacute;it.  Den chuid is m&oacute;, is iad na daoine &oacute;ga, na daoine a bh&iacute;onn ag dul ar imirce ag an am seo, agus mar sin n&iacute; bheidh ach na seandaoine agus na daoine an-&oacute;g f&aacute;gtha sna pobail &aacute;iti&uacute;la agus goilleann s&eacute; go m&oacute;r orm a leith&eacute;id a fheice&aacute;il.  M&aacute; fh&aacute;gann na daoine &oacute;ga go l&eacute;ir an &aacute;it, n&iacute; bheidh aon duine ann chun na fol&uacute;ntais oibre a l&iacute;onadh nuair a &eacute;ir&iacute;onn na daoine at&aacute; ag obair anois r&oacute;-shean.  Chomh maith leis sin, n&iacute; bheidh c&eacute;imithe nua-ch&aacute;ilithe ar f&aacute;il amach anseo a bheidh &aacute;balta dul i ngleic le forbairt nua-theicneola&iacute;ochta sa todhcha&iacute;, agus mar sin beidh &Eacute;ire th&iacute;os leis.  Mar sin, t&aacute; orainn na pobail &aacute;iti&uacute;la a fhorbairt chun stop a chur leis sin ag tarl&uacute;.  Conas is f&eacute;idir &eacute; a r&eacute;iteach?  Bhuel, n&iacute; f&eacute;idir an sc&eacute;al a leigheas gan athr&uacute; intinne i measc na bpobal &aacute;iti&uacute;la agus r&uacute;n daingean dul i ngleic leis an bhfadhb.  T&aacute; orainn n&iacute;os m&oacute; a chur ar f&aacute;il do na c&eacute;imithe is d&eacute;ana&iacute;, i gcomhair iad a spreagadh fanacht anseo.  N&iacute;l s&eacute; sin ag tarl&uacute; ag an am seo, &aacute;fach, agus t&aacute; na pobail &aacute;iti&uacute;la ag fulaingt d&aacute; dheasca sin.  T&aacute; t&aacute;bhacht m&oacute;r, mar sin, le pobail &aacute;iti&uacute;la a fhorbairt mar mura n-athra&iacute;tear an fhadhb seo go tapaidh, beidh gach duine &oacute;g imithe &oacute;n &aacute;it gan fhios d&uacute;inn agus n&iacute; theasta&iacute;onn sin &oacute; &eacute;inne.</p><p>  T&aacute; orainn na pobail &aacute;iti&uacute;la a fhorbairt, ach n&iacute;limid &aacute;balta &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh gan maoini&uacute; agus gan infheisti&uacute;.

T&aacute; orainn br&oacute;d agus spiorad an phobail a choth&uacute;.  T&aacute; orainn n&iacute;os m&oacute; &aacute;iseanna a chur ar f&aacute;il do na daoine &oacute;ga agus t&aacute; orainn postanna a chruth&uacute; do na c&eacute;imithe is d&eacute;ana&iacute;.  T&aacute; orainn an daonra a spreagadh chun gn&oacute;tha&iacute; nua a chur ar bun ina bpobail &aacute;iti&uacute;la.  T&aacute; orainn na pobail &aacute;iti&uacute;la a fhorbairt ach n&iacute; f&eacute;idir linn aon rud a dh&eacute;anamh gan airgead n&oacute; gan taca&iacute;ocht &oacute;n Rialtas.  D&aacute; mbeimis &aacute;balta na ruda&iacute; seo a fh&aacute;il, b&rsquo;ioma&iacute; rud gurbh fh&eacute;idir linn a dh&eacute;anamh.</p><p>  Ar an ioml&aacute;n, is l&eacute;ir go bhfuil t&aacute;bhacht m&oacute;r ann le pobail &aacute;iti&uacute;la a fhorbairt.  Is rud t&aacute;bhachtach &eacute; an pobal &aacute;iti&uacute;il i saol an duine i gcomhair ceachtanna an tsaoil a fhoghlaim agus pearsantacht a choth&uacute; sa duine.  Ar an l&aacute;mh eile &aacute;fach, muna bhfuil na pobail &aacute;iti&uacute;la forbartha, beidh a l&aacute;n fadhbanna ann, cos&uacute;il le fadhbanna s&oacute;isialta agus fadhb easpa daoine &oacute;ga, ach t&aacute; r&eacute;iteach ar na fadbhanna seo.  Is f&eacute;idir linn na fadhbanna seo a r&eacute;iteach thar am m&aacute; oibr&iacute;onn gach duine le ch&eacute;ile ach ag an am c&eacute;anna, beidh ar gach duine cabhr&uacute;.  Ar sc&aacute;th a ch&eacute;ile a mhaireann na daoine, mar a deir an seanfhocal.</p><p>  Mar fhocal scoir, ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a chur in i&uacute;l daoibh as &eacute;isteacht le mo chuid tuairim&iacute;.</p></speech>

Scaipeann daoine r&aacute;fla&iacute; mail&iacute;seacha faoi dhaoine eile agus fulaing&iacute;onn m&oacute;r&aacute;n daoine de dheasca cibir-bhula&iacute;ochta.

I am going to spoil the party and use the language of the invader.  Unfortunately my knowledge of the Irish language is fairly limited.  In order not to insult the delegation completely I have managed to put together a few words.  Ta &aacute;thas m&oacute;r orm nuair a chuala m&eacute; tuairim&iacute; Fh&eacute;lim, Chaoimh&iacute;n &Oacute; Ceallaigh agus na paist&iacute; eile faoi rialtais na hEorpach.  I do not need to listen to the translation.</p><p>  It is very refreshing to hear so much scepticism about our participation in the European Union because one does not hear too much about that in this environment.  On a number of occasions in the D&aacute;il I called on Members to leave the euro currency.  If I had let off a stink bomb I would not have got a better reaction because the chairs around me seemed to empty.  I hope the people listening today to the opinions expressed by the delegation will actually take stock of the fact that cynicism and scepticism toward the Europe Union project is building massively.  l can see that it is buried deeply in the psyche of people who are now at school.  I congratulate the delegation on that and I ask them to keep it going.  Whatever about Ireland disengaging from the European Union at least if one is proposing alternative ideas, one is challenging them at least to make it a better Europe so that the Commission can come back and suggest we stay in Europe.  The Commission might engage in a charm offensive so that it will not bully us as much in the future.  The attitude of the delegates is a great help.  They do not think that we would all be living in caves, if it were not for Europe.  This generation are confident enough to stand up for our nation and are smart enough to spot that they have a right to be confident, living in a nation that can afford to feed ten times its own population.  Why worry about the bond markets when one has a commodity in abundance that everybody on the planet want to buy?  They are right to be confident.</p><p>  The Internet is brilliant.  It is one of the best innovations the human race has ever made.  Let us remember when the telephone was invented, people were sceptical and were afraid.  The mothers and fathers of the bourgeoisie and the rich feared they could not control their sons and daughters any more.  They could not control the time or place in which their daughters met with men.  It changed the world.  It presented difficulties that even I, if I were a parent at that time and knew what my daughter was doing at all times, to a situation, where she could be on the telephone to a bloke, would be worried.  Obviously  that was a cause of worry but one would have to look at the mass of advantages as well.  There are worries and they need to be dealt with but ultimately the problem of bullying lies with the individual.  Whether it be the Internet or a telephone made with a piece of string and two bean cans, if somebody is abusing you down the bean can, it is just as hurtful as if it happening over the Internet.  </p><p>  I agree that technology needs to be tweaked.  I have never been on <i>ask.fm</i>.  From the account given by the delegates it sounds an awful website and I will take their word on it.</p> <p>However the Internet offers significant advantages.  I am not ancient but I am not that young anymore, when I was the same age of the delegates, we did not have a telephone in our house, although telephones had been invented.  In my day you never knew if a girl liked you or not, because you always had to ring her.  You had to do the chasing.</p><p> Young people have certain advantages, one being they have a telephone.  I think they live in a glorious time.  The debate on social media is driven by the media organisations whose biggest fear is not bullying but the threat to their big salaries and whether they will be the only people who will be able to form opinion in society, as they have from the time of Eamon de Valera who owned the <i>Irish Press</i>.  They are the driving force in creating fear in people about the Internet.  If the Internet keeps going the way it is, the major newspaper, such as <i>The Irish Times</i>and the <i>Irish Independent </i>will not be as popular in the future.  The opinion of the ordinary person will be more important.</p><p> The delegates raised the issue of change in the country, the way the country will change is that unfiltered opinions will be public on the Internet.  Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; asked the delegates if they would think of going into politics in the future.  Let me say that they must go into politics.  Do not rely on this generation to change things as our record has been diabolical so far.  Do it for yourselves<b>.</b> Do the delegates think we should bury ourselves deeper in Europe or should we kick into a reverse gear?</p><p> I thank the delegates for their excellent presentation.</p></speech>

This is the second General Affairs Council of Ireland's EU Presidency and I will again have the honour of chairing the meeting.  The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Creighton, will represent Ireland.  The agenda is still being finalised but discussion is expected to focus closely on preparations for the European Council on 14-15 March.  The European Council is expected to discuss the conclusion of the first phase of the European semester, the implementation of the compact for growth and jobs, economic and monetary policy and strategic partners.  President Van Rompuy will join Ministers for the final hour of the meeting.</p><p>  We are now one third of the way through Ireland's EU Presidency and I believe we can justifiably take some pride in our achievements to date.  The Presidency remains a whole-of-government effort and Ministers and Departments are pulling together.  We are making a contribution to taking Europe beyond the crisis.  Only last week, two landmark breakthroughs were brokered by the Irish Presidency.  First, the agreement on capital requirements, responding to the concerns of citizens and government about the unbridled bonus arrangements which impacted on the risk profile of the banking system.  Bonuses will now be regulated in a sensible way and this focus on reducing risk and preventing future crises is in line with the Irish Presidency priority on banking union.  Second, the agreement on the youth guarantee which, when implemented, will assure young people under the age of 25 years of a good quality offer of employment, continued education and an apprenticeship or a traineeship within four months of becoming unemployed.</p><p>  We have made important progress on the two pack on economic surveillance.  Washington and Brussels have given the green light to working towards an EU-US trade agreement.  There is agreement on the multiannual financial framework, MFF, for the period 2014-2020.  We supported President Van Rompuy in his work to achieve agreement at the European Council in February and we will now take forward the vital task of securing agreement with the European Parliament.  We have had productive meetings with the key players already.  The Taoiseach and I, together with the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, met Presidents Schultz and Barroso in Dublin last Thursday and we now have a clearer picture of where each of the players stand.  The challenge ahead will not be easy but I am confident that with goodwill on all sides we can reach agreement.  Timely implementation of the MFF is critical to underpin recovery throughout the EU and to facilitate implementation of vital programmes, including Horizon 2020, the programme for the competitiveness of enterprises and SMEs, COSME, and CAP, and the Cohesion Fund and regional funding.</p><p>  I thank committee members for their engagement in the Presidency.  In particular, I welcome the committee's launch of a national debate on the future of the European Union.  I hope this initiative will spark broader debate about what it means to be part of the EU and how we want it to evolve in coming years.  This ties in well with the European year of citizens, launched in Dublin in January.  I look forward to hearing about the views submitted and ultimately to hearing the committee's assessment of the challenges and opportunities facing us in future.</p><p>  The Taoiseach will co-chair the tripartite social summit immediately before the European Council.  This will provide an opportunity to discuss with the social partners the importance of addressing challenges to recovery and the renewal of the EU social dimension.</p><p>  Discussions at the General Affairs Council will focus on preparations for the March European Council, which is expected to be dominated by economic issues.  Our Presidency is committed to the effective implementation of the European semester, the EU system of economic and budgetary co-ordination, which we see as a key tool in restoring economic stability and creating conditions for sustainable growth.  The March council will conclude the first phase of European semester 2013.  The key output is guidance to member states on the preparation of their stability programme updates under the Stability and Growth Pact and their national reform programmes under the Europe 2020 strategy.  The semester is the basis for building a common understanding about the priorities for action at EU and national level as Europe seeks to return to sustainable growth and job creation.  The key EU-level focus is on supporting the development and implementation of jointly agreed priorities.  The key national-level focus is on bringing about a stronger alignment of budget priorities, employment policies and structural reforms.</p><p>  The effective management of the semester is an important focus for our Presidency, as committee members will be aware.  I will present to the General Affairs Council our Presidency synthesis report of discussions on the annual growth survey.  This will see a strong reinforcement of the five priorities identified by the Commission: pursuing differentiated, growth-friendly fiscal consolidation; restoring normal lending to the economy; promoting growth and competitiveness for today and tomorrow; tackling unemployment and the social consequences of the crisis; and modernising public administration.  It is crucial that we keep up the momentum behind national-level reforms in these areas as a basis for sustainable recovery.  Such reforms include integrating the green economy and resource efficiency agenda into economic decision-making; exploiting synergies between the transport, energy and communications sectors; reinforcing the digital agenda; and obtaining better outcomes from research and development investments.</p><p>  Discussion will also be informed by last week's agreement by Ministers at the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs, EPSCO, Council on the youth guarantee.  The success of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, in obtaining consensus in this area has delivered an important Presidency goal.  I acknowledge that the committee shares my concern on levels of youth unemployment throughout the EU.  Currently there are 7.5 million young people in Europe not in employment, education or training.  This amounts to 12.9% of those aged 15 to 24 years.  As the Minister, Deputy Burton, said last week, the economic and social costs of this are simply devastating.  Youth unemployment can have lifelong effects and the youth guarantee is a key vehicle for mobilising support.  As I have stated, once implemented, it will ensure young people receive a good quality offer of employment, continued education and an apprenticeship or a traineeship within four months of becoming unemployed.</p> <p>It will also contribute to three out of the five Europe 2020 targets, namely, increasing employment, reducing early school leaving and removing people from poverty and social exclusion.  Although each member state faces different implementation issues, progress should be supported by the &euro;6 billion youth employment initiative under the MFF agreement.  It was clear from last year's lessons learned exercise that the European semester should be an open and inclusive process which supports meaningful engagement with parliaments and all relevant stakeholders at European and national levels.  I therefore acknowledge the work done by this committee on enhancing parliamentary involvement in European semester processes and in particular the COSAC meetings of parliamentarians from across Europe.  Stronger economic governance has to be accompanied by stronger democratic legitimacy and I commend members for their work in this area.  It is a valued input to our Presidency programme and I expect it will provide a good basis for exploring others ways of involving national parliaments in the European semester.</p><p> The spring European Council will also take stock of progress in implementing the compact for growth and jobs.  This means EU level action and, in particular, backing up the more country-specific aspects of the semester process.  It is a close fit with our Presidency's emphasis on the Single Market and external trade agendas.  As members will be aware, we are prioritising agreement on the key Single Market Act I files that remain open, while aiming for as much progress as possible on Single Market Act II files as they are published over coming months.  For the first time the monitoring of Single Market governance will occur within the framework of the European semester.</p><p> We have also made a good start on the EU-US trade relationship and will be working hard to get a formal Council mandate for free trade negotiations in time for the June Foreign Affairs Council.  The financing needs of the real economy are another crucial issue in terms of EU level actions supporting growth and jobs.  This means restoring normal lending conditions and unlocking productive and growth enhancing investments.  The EIB will continue to play a crucial role in this regard.  The reality is that we will have recovered from the current crisis only when our economies are growing again and creating jobs.  That remains our most important test.</p><p> The European Council will look again at the process of strengthening EMU, although the next major discussion on this is scheduled for the June meeting when President Van Rompuy will present his roadmap following consultation with experts, member states and social partners.  A stronger and more robust EMU will help to underpin confidence and contribute to economic recovery.  While we have seen greater stability in the markets in recent months, there is no room for complacency and we must make the most of the period of relative calm to do what is necessary to ensure that we do not return to crisis.  While in the Presidency we are continuing to support President Van Rompuy's work, including facilitating discussion among Ministers in the relevant Council formations.  Although the March meeting may reflect on aspects of this work, the main focus will be on a range of ongoing and pending structural reforms to strengthen economic governance.</p><p> On banking union, a number of key decisions have already been taken and further progress remains a Presidency priority.  A significant volume of legislation is involved and we are working for successful discussions with the Parliament and Commission on the single supervisory mechanism.  Progress in this area will send a positive signal on subsequent reforms of economic policy.  The intention remains for the ECB to be in a position to take over supervision on 1 March 2014.  Crucially for Ireland, direct recapitalisation of banks by the ESM would then become possible.  The aim for the bank resolution framework is to secure agreement in the Council and the Parliament by June.  We also hope to reach agreement on deposit guarantee schemes by then.</p><p> I highlighted the capital requirements package earlier.  This landmark agreement was brokered last week by the Irish Presidency with the Parliament and Commission.  These were difficult negotiations and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has done well to balance many different and competing interests.  The new rules should provide greater stability and ensure that European banks hold sufficient capital to withstand future shocks.</p><p> The March European Council is also expected to welcome the agreement on the two pack economic governance legislation, which was brokered by our Presidency with the Parliament and the Commission.  This is designed to improve budgetary and economic co-ordination among euro area members and will contribute to greater stability and confidence.  Taken together, these reforms should lead to a more stable, robust and resilient economic and monetary union.  The European Council will also discuss its strategic relations with external partners.  The main focus is expected to be on relations with Russia but written conclusions are not anticipated.  I appreciate the attention of the committee and I look forward to hearing members' comments.  I will, of course, be very happy to respond to their points or queries.</p></speech>

We will be discussing the matter with our colleagues from 20 different states in Copenhagen next week.  We hope the outcome will be a set of recommendations that we can offer to President Van Rompuy with the intention of having them implemented across the Union.</p><p>  In regard to the compact for growth and jobs and the T&aacute;naiste's final point about relations with Russia I have a question about the EU association agreement with Ukraine.  I understand the former President of the European Parliament, Pat Cox, and the former President of Poland, Aleksander Kwasniewski, are currently in Ukraine dealing with the various outstanding issues in the agreement.  Following from last month's EU-Ukraine summit, what efforts are we making in the Presidency to build consensus across member states on finalising the association agreement?</p></speech>

The Presidency is going well and I commend him on that.  Agreement has been reached on the budget and progress is being made on other issues.  I will not comment in detail on these matters other than to wish him well at the meeting.  I commend our ambassador in Brussels, Rory Montgomery, and his team on the excellent job they are doing.  I visited Brussels with the Chairman and other members.  I found when representing Ireland in a past Presidency that ambassadors and their staff provide tremendous support for Ministers and officials.  We are renowned for the ability of our people on the ground in Brussels.</p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste is in a unique position with the Presidency in respect of other matters not mentioned in his opening statement.   He and I have been to Israel and Palestine.  He was there in his previous life as a member of the Labour Party.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-05a.183" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1140" speakername="Terry Leyden" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013030500003#B00700"><p>I have the photographs to prove it.  The point I mean to make is that he was not visiting in his current capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  He travelled as a Deputy and the leader of a party.  I know that he is concerned about the expansion of illegal settlements in Gaza and the West Bank and he commented previously on the matter.  There have also been developments regarding apartheid on buses.  Israelis are now insisting on Palestinian-only and Israeli-only buses.  The situation is tense and I ask him to raise the issue.</p><p>  I also ask him to encourage dialogue between the United Kingdom and Argentina regarding the Malvinas Islands, which are known as the Falklands in Britain.  It is a difficult issue and he may not wish to broach it but he has an opportunity to do so with the Presidency.  I attended a conference in London between 5 and 7 February which issued a communique calling for dialogue, bearing in mind the United Nations directives and what happened in 1982.</p> <p>We are all conscious of those things, but dialogue is the way to settle any dispute.  The dispute goes back to 1833.  The T&aacute;naiste has an interest in the area and perhaps he can have discussions with his colleague from Britain rather than at the full meeting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-05a.185" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/971" speakername="Joe O'Reilly" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013030500004#C00200"><p>I join in the welcome to the T&aacute;naiste and I congratulate him on a number of landmark successes at European level in recent weeks.  I warmly commend the T&aacute;naiste on the impact of these decisions on the lives of people here, which people may not fully recognise immediately.  The impact will be palpable and real over the coming years.</p><p>  I refer to some of the successes.  Nothing has caused more angst and annoyance among ordinary people than banking bonuses.  Nothing has been so irksome and it has alienated people from the Government and democracy.  It is great that the T&aacute;naiste achieved a breakthrough on banking bonuses and perhaps he can elaborate on how it translates to reality and the caps that apply.  People outside the room would like to hear it loud and clear.  Nothing has come up more often than that issue for the people I met over the past year.  People have a sense of annoyance and frustration that those who played a pivotal role in destroying the country received bonuses for doing so.  It is a real issue.</p><p>  While that issue resonates with many people, I believe the youth guarantee is more important.  Dealing with youth unemployment is a challenge for all of us.  Is the T&aacute;naiste optimistic that Ireland will secure an adequate amount of the roughly &euro;6 billion available?  Is the T&aacute;naiste optimistic that we can implement the youth guarantee here?  I know he is committed.  I was heartened to read an opinion piece in one of the newspapers yesterday, written by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, which mentioned that in Finland, where this was previously introduced, the output had been tremendous in terms of job creation.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to comment on that.  Is he optimistic that it can be implemented in Ireland and that it can create a permanent change in unemployment?</p><p>  We are told there is considerable opposition in the European Parliament to the budget as proposed.  The successful negotiation of the multi-annual financial framework agreement for the coming seven years is mega and the Common Agricultural Policy aspect of it is particularly important in my area.  How optimistic is the T&aacute;naiste that he will get it through the European Parliament in the face of considerable opposition?</p></speech>

I congratulate him on his work so far.  I have three questions on the Presidency.  The first concerns the situation in Syria, which I raised with him before.  The bloodshed and carnage in the country is apocalyptic.  The T&aacute;naiste has made strong statements on this and I would appreciate an update on what, if anything, the European Union and its agencies can do.</p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste touched on the overseas aid budget in the past and the budget he is taking over will include the development co-operation instrument as part of the multi-annual financial framework.  I would appreciate the view of the T&aacute;naiste on how it stands.  Will we be able to protect it?</p><p>  With regard to the statement on the possibility and ambition of the ECB to take over supervision of the banking system by 1 March and the question of direct recapitalisation of the banks, how does the T&aacute;naiste see that negotiation standing in the European Union and with the countries whose support we need to make it happen?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-05a.188" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/951" speakername="Eamon Gilmore" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013030500004#C00500"><p>I welcome the initiative of the Chairman and the committee in the production of a paper on the involvement of national parliaments in the European semester process.  It is a very important that national parliaments, which have traditionally had the primary function in regard to national budgets, should take an active role at the co-ordination level in respect of the first semester process and economic co-ordination.  I appreciate the initiative that has been taken.</p><p>  The Chairman asked about Ukraine.  I welcome the mission by Mr. Cox and Mr. Kwasniewski and I hope their efforts will be successful in creating the conditions to make progress possible.  Ukraine is not up for discussion at the General Affairs Council but it is regularly discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council.  In that case, the lead is taken by the High Representative, Catherine Ashton, and the European External Action Service.  I attended a meeting in conjunction with a recent meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council with Friends of Ukraine, where we had a good dialogue with the Ukrainian foreign Minister.  The EU summit with Ukraine was held last month.  The joint statement issued from the summit reaffirmed the three conditions set in December for progress on Ukraine's relations with the EU.  The three issues are the EU reform programme, the issue of selective justice and the implementation of the recommendations of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, ODIHR, on the conduct of elections.  It is a matter for Ukraine to make progress on these three areas in the coming months.  A meeting of the EU-Ukraine Cooperation Council will take place in June and Ireland will chair it as part of the Presidency.  That meeting will review the progress that has been made.  The intention is that, if sufficient progress is made, the association agreement could be signed at the eastern partnership summit in Vilnius in November.</p><p>  I thank Senator Leyden for his compliments in respect of H.E. Rory Montgomery and his team.  I take the opportunity of these kind remarks to pay tribute to the team at the Permanent Representation in Brussels.  In comparison with teams often in place for a Presidency, ours is relatively small.  That team and the officials in my Department and the Department of the Taoiseach, who have been working on the Presidency, deserve great credit.  The same applies to all Departments.  During the course of the Presidency, we will chair 1,600 meetings.  For obvious reasons, most are at official level.  When we are talking about progress being made on issues, great credit is due to the Irish civil servants and diplomats involved in that work.</p><p>  Senator Leyden mentioned the West Bank and Gaza, which is more a matter for the Foreign Affairs Council than the General Affairs Council.  However, it is an issue to which the Foreign Affairs Council has been giving much attention.</p> <p>There is also the danger of further illegal settlements being established which would make it physically impossible for the two-state solution to be put in place.  There is a window of opportunity in the aftermath of the American and Israeli elections for some progress to be made on this matter.  I met with the new US Secretary of State, John Kerry, in Rome last Wednesday, along with other European foreign affairs Ministers.  One of the issues we discussed was the prospect of a renewed effort being made by both the European Union and the United States to get the sides together and discussions under way on this long-protracted issue.  I know the US President, Mr. Obama, and the Secretary of State, Mr. Kerry, are due to visit Israel in the near future.  This is an item that is high on the European agenda.</p><p> Regarding dialogue between the UK and Argentina, there is a good European Union-Latin America-Caribbean partnership.  I attended the European Union-Latin America-Caribbean summit in Santiago, Chile, several weeks ago and I would see the issue being pursued in that context.</p><p> Deputy O'Reilly referred to the successes we have had and I thank him for his kind remarks.  What was agreed at trialogue level between the Presidency, the European Council, the European Parliament and the European Commission is known as the capital requirements directives, CRD, IV package.  This is an agreement that is about more than bankers' bonuses.  It is largely to do with the need for improved regulation in banking in Europe and to ensure the banks' capital requirements are adequate.  The issue of setting a ratio limit on the bonuses that can be paid as against salary was one of the issues included in this package.  It is before the ECOFIN meeting today but I am not sure what progress has been made because I did not get an up-to-date brief on this coming into the meeting.</p><p> It has been agreed that &euro;6 billion will be provided for the youth guarantee in the multi-annual financial framework, MFF.  The principles of the guarantee were agreed at the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council, EPSCO, chaired by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, last week.  The provision in the MFF is for those member states where the level of youth unemployment is higher than 25%.  Ireland, unfortunately, is one of those.  However, it means we will benefit from the moneys provided for in the MFF.  The exact detail of how the guarantee will operate has still to be worked out and will be pursued by the Minister for Social Protection and the EPSCO.</p><p> The MFF was agreed at Council level by the 27 member states.  It now needs to get the approval of the European Parliament.  There is a process that is under way.  The MFF will be considered by a plenary meeting of the European Parliament later this month.  Following that, I expect there will be a period of negotiation with the European Parliament, which will be led by the Irish Presidency.  I have already started these discussions, as I met with Alain Lamassoure, MEP, in Dublin last week when he was leading a contact group on behalf of the Parliament.  The Taoiseach and I, along with the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, also met with the President of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, and the Commission President, Jos&eacute; Manuel Barroso.  Following that meeting, I met with the Council President, Herman Van Rompuy, in London.  The process of engagement with the European Parliament is already under way.  Our objective, obviously, is to have the matter concluded and agreed by the end of our Presidency.  It will be a challenge because a majority of the Parliament, 378 Members, must be secured for the budget to be approved.  As in any parliamentary situation, if one is trying to get an overall majority one has to factor in absences and those who will vote against the budget for one reason or another.  This will be a significant challenge for us in the months ahead.</p><p> Deputy Donohoe raised the matter of the conflict in Syria.  Again, it was the top issue at the last meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council.  The bloodshed and carnage continues there.  One encouraging development is the indication from the leader of the Syrian opposition coalition, Ahmed Moaz al-Khatib, that he will engage in dialogue at some level with the Assad regime, and there is potential for building on that.  We have argued for the situation in Syria to be referenced to the International Criminal Court and for an investigation into it to be carried out by the court.  Ireland is among several European countries which have argued for this.  One of the issues agreed at the last Council was the extension of sanctions.  A question that arises is to what extent the continuation of the sanctions regime should apply to the arms embargo.  We have taken the view that the situation there should not be further militarised and increasing the amount of arms and military equipment is not the way to go.  However, there are some member states which are of the view that the arms embargo should be lifted or relaxed in some way.</p><p> The agreement in the MFF provided for &euro;87.648 billion in funding for external relations, an increase of &euro;2.31 billion on current funding.  At least 90% of EU spending on external relations must qualify as official development assistance.  The agreement ensures the European Union and its member states will remain the largest provider of official development assistance for the remainder of the decade.  Our aim in the negotiations was to ensure a fair proportion of the EU budget was allocated to development and humanitarian assistance.</p><p> The target date for the coming into effect of the single banking supervisory mechanism is 1 March 2014.  We are working on the legislative measures that have to be introduced to ensure this happens.  We are hopeful that a significant amount of progress will be made on that by the end of our Presidency.</p></speech>

Will he give us an update on his dealings with Bosnia?  The committee visited the region last year and considerable concern was expressed to us about the lack of constitutional reform there.  There is a significant level of inertia there and what looked like a country emerging now looks like a country regressing.</p><p>  Regarding the impact of the single supervisory mechanism for banking and the direct recapitalisation of banks by the ESM, European Stability Mechanism, the T&aacute;naiste stated it would be possible to deal with the legacy issue of Irish bank debt.  Have there been any direct discussions with the ESM or other member states as to how this might materialise?  Obviously, discussions to date have centred on the ESM investing in troubled banks from now on.</p> <p>There has not been much discussion about legacy investment.  Can the T&aacute;naiste update us about that?  I am not trying to back him into a corner.  I accept that much of this will be done through the finance Ministers but could he give us a flavour of what the thinking around that area is?</p></speech>

I have three questions.  I obviously welcome the youth guarantee but am ever mindful that we cannot see it as a panacea for all our ills in respect of youth unemployment.  The economist and Nobel Laureate Professor Christopher Pissarides was the person who made me think about this when he visited the Seanad some time ago.  I am a bit nervous because he did not see it as good value for money.  The T&aacute;naiste might clarify whether every person is offered an internship or a training place after four months or for four months.  If it is for four months, it is clear that it is not adequate.  I know we are not relying completely on it.  The compact for growth and jobs is bigger than that.  However, we need to make sure that given the sum of &euro;6 billion, we are getting good value for money and that it is not just something to appease people in the short term because it is too much money not to make good use of.</p></speech>

My second question concerns the European Investment Bank, which members of this committee recently visited.  To say I was impressed would be an understatement.  It is a really good social, not-for-profit bank.  I know we recently secured &euro;50 million towards school projects from that bank.  Are we doing enough to maximise the potential projects we could pursue at this time by presenting those projects to the European Investment Bank to be proofed?  It pursues very sound projects for economic and social good.  We need very sound job creation stimuli.  Other members of the committee who joined with me on that day would say that we need to pursue far more projects, including school projects and those relating to primary health care centres and transport infrastructure.  We should aggressively use the benefits of that.</p><p>  I was approached last evening by a group of Bangladeshi people living in Ireland seeking our support with respect to the recent riots that have occurred there.  I believe there are reports of between 30 to 300 people being killed in recent days.  Could the T&aacute;naiste tell us what is happening there and what our position is?  Are we supporting any action at international level to stop this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-05a.195" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013030500006#E00500"><p>Like other speakers, I congratulate the T&aacute;naiste and the Ministers on the progress to date on the Irish Presidency.  I have a few questions, in particular with regard to the breakthroughs on capital requirements and banking bonuses.  To what degree are non-eurozone member states likely to be affected by the cap on bankers' bonuses and to what extent are they likely to concur, albeit reluctantly in some cases?  Can the T&aacute;naiste give us some indication as to whether the principle has been established and will be accepted?</p><p>  In respect of the two-pack on economic surveillance and the EU-US trade agreement, are budgetary cutbacks in the US likely to impact on it and the potential for growth which we need to develop to a greater extent?  To what extent is it becoming more accepted that debt management, along with fiscal policy, is likely to be co-ordinated throughout the EU inside and outside the eurozone?  </p><p>  Energy costs are fundamental to economic recovery.  Brent crude is about the price it was four years ago yet oil prices for the consumer have relatively doubled.  To what extent can the EU during the Irish Presidency and thereafter use its influence to ensure that any savings are made available for economic recovery throughout the EU as opposed to going for other purposes such as oil company profits?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-05a.196" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013030500006#E00600"><p>I listened to what the T&aacute;naiste said about the situation in Syria.  I hope his optimism is justified because most of the information we get indicates that the situation is getting worse.  The fact that the opposition leaders are talking about potential dialogue is a positive development.  The significant worry relates to the arms embargo and the possibility of some EU or other countries doing their own thing in respect of that.  I am aware of the recent leaked EU heads of mission report on East Jerusalem.  Again, that report had fairly negative conclusions.  There is a window there and, hopefully, we will see some action soon because the possibility of a two-state solution is slowly ebbing away.  If the US will not broker talks, the only other option is the EU.  The difficulty there concerns consensus.</p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste spoke about youth employment.  There will be a &euro;6 billion investment in youth unemployment measures but the big question is when the youth unemployment initiative is likely to be finalised and operational.  I know the T&aacute;naiste spoke about the work of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on the details but people want to know when it will be introduced.  Will it be this year or the next?  When will we see something positive resulting from this money?  Is it the Government's intention to provide any matching funds in respect of the funds drawn from the &euro;6 billion?  How will that be allocated?  </p><p>  There was some positive news on the radio about the bank recapitalisation and extending the maturities for the EU portion of the bailout loans.  Again, the real issue is the use of the ESM to retrospectively recapitalise the pillar banks and the fact that we will get &euro;30 billion of Irish taxpayers' money back.  Again, the T&aacute;naiste spoke in terms of mood music coming from Germany, including from the Social Democrats.  This mood music suggests that a deal on this legacy debt will not be forthcoming.  I know it is difficult but can he give the committee his assessment of the likelihood of a deal on legacy debt and outline when he expects the separation of banking debt and sovereign debt to be realised?  </p> <p>Again, there is great optimism in this regard, but the mood music seems to be changing.  People want to hear news of a positive nature about their own lives.  I held an advice clinic on Friday last and spent the entire time dealing with people whose mortgages were in distress, young people who were seeking employment and, despite the fact that there is supposed to be a huge number of houses available, those who were in search of housing.  The mood among people is down-beat, as is my own because I am trying to assist them in dealing with their problems.  Announcements are being made in the media, but nothing is trickling down into ordinary people's lives.  In the context of employment creation, citizens want it to happen sooner rather than later.  When will the relevant funding become available and on whom will it be spent?</p></speech>

That matter is not on the agenda for next week's meeting.  It is true, however, that there has been a regrettable lack of momentum.  However, the European Union has, through the External Action Service, been working hard to encourage progress.  The most recent reports suggest there may be some positive movement, particularly in the area of constitutional reform.  I would certainly encourage progress in this regard.  As the Deputy is aware, the path to European Union membership is conditional.  The Union cannot impose the relevant conditions, they must be addressed by the countries concerned.  We will obviously continue to encourage those involved in this instance to make progress.</p><p>  Deputies Timmy Dooley, Se&aacute;n Crowe and Bernard J. Durkan referred to the single supervisory mechanism and the possibility of the ESM directly recapitalising banks.  The former must be put in place in order for that to happen.  That is the architecture which must be created.  There are also two other elements involved in the banking union, namely, deposit guarantees and bank resolution.  Matters in this regard are being progressed.  The intention is that the single supervisory mechanism will be in place by the target date of March 2014.  The issue of legacy or retrospective debt is being considered in the parallel discussions being pursued by the Minister for Finance and the hope is there will be some outcome from the process at the earliest possible date this year.  However, the discussions will, as was the case with those which preceded them, take time to complete.  All of the relevant issues must be worked through.  The direct recapitalisation of banks cannot happen until the single supervisory mechanism goes live.</p><p>  It is important to place this matter in context.  Two years or 12 months ago, the idea of there being a European instrument to directly recapitalise banks or the principle of separating banking and sovereign debt were not even on the radar.  There were many individuals who thought that neither would ever materialise.  The fact is that agreement on the separation of banking and sovereign debt was secured last June.  When that was done, there were those who sceptically stated it had just been agreed on paper and that, for various reasons, it would never become a reality.  In October and December progress was made in this matter and now it is being worked through.</p><p>  Senator Fidelma Healy Eames and Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe inquired about the youth guarantee.  The position is that under the youth guarantee, young people who are not working or not involved in education will receive offers of employment, continued education, apprenticeship or traineeship within four months of becoming unemployed.  There are a couple of matters which must be remembered in respect of the youth guarantee.  In the first instance, it is essentially a contract between the European Union and young people.  Obviously, it must be backed up with money.  That is where the significant sum of &euro;6 billion comes into play.  Some matching funds will be required, but the exact details in this regard have yet to be agreed.  As it happens, the youth guarantee fits with the reforms we are pursuing in respect of training, further education, Pathways to Work, etc.</p><p>  The guarantee is not a panacea.  Where there are very high levels of unemployment, what one needs to provide is real employment and career opportunities.  This is why the emphasis is on achieving stability - which we have now done - in respect of Europe's banks, its finances and the public finances of individual member states.  That is the platform on which one builds because it gives investors more confidence to put their money on the line and create jobs.  In the work we are doing to complete the Single Market and grow the digital Single Market, there is enormous potential for the creation of employment.  Again, I return to the advancement of the trade agreements.</p></speech>

The duration will be both country and scheme specific.  For example, people in this country can access JobBridge and avail of the various interventions relating to employment activation.  There are also various forms of education and training arrangements.  As the Senator is aware, the Departments of Social Protection and Education and Skills are expanding the range of education and training opportunities being provided.  I refer to the training opportunities being provided through SOLAS, the VECs, the private sector, etc.  The process in this regard will continue.</p><p>  The European Investment Bank is very much in the picture with regard to the stimulus package negotiated by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin.  Senator Fidelma Healy Eames referred to the &euro;50 million for school projects and also to the funding for primary health care centres.  Again, these form part of the package of measures to which I refer.  There is significant potential for involvement on the part of the European Investment Bank, particularly in the development of infrastructure which will generate employment.</p><p>  I will obtain for the Senator a direct reply on the issue relating to the situation in Bangladesh.

Durkan referred to an EU-US trade agreement.  The state of play in this regard is that the high-level working group has made a positive report to the effect that negotiations should take place on such an agreement.  In his State of the Union address President Obama committed to progressing a trade and investment partnership with Europe.  This was one of the issues we discussed at the transatlantic meeting with the Secretary of State, Mr. John Kerry, in Rome last Wednesday.  I expect to discuss the matter again with the Secretary of State when I meet him in the near future.</p> <p>We have made progress in this regard a priority for the Irish Presidency.  It is estimated that if we can conclude the various trade agreements with the United States, Canada, Japan and a number of other trade agreements, there is potential to add about 2% to the GDP of the European Union.  It is estimated there is potential for creating about 2 million jobs on this side of the Atlantic, with a corresponding win on the other side of the Atlantic.  It is a case of putting together a market with 500 million people on this side of the Atlantic with almost as many on the other side of the Atlantic, which will have huge purchasing power representing over half the GDP of the entire world.  However, there will be difficulties in getting that agreement.  The negotiation of a trade agreement inevitably must deal with sectoral interests on either side of the Atlantic that will have their points of view on the agreement.  None the less, it is a very big prize which would contribute very significantly to economic growth and job creation on both sides of the Atlantic.</p><p> I dealt with Deputy Crowe's points about Syria and East Jerusalem in my response to Senator Leyden.  I refer to the sense of despair, the downbeat mood and the worry which Deputy Crowe described.  I agree that this has been felt and expressed by many people, particularly in times when we have come through a terrible storm in this country.  The recession that befell this country has been truly horrific.  However, we have to solve it.  We cannot just bemoan it or wish it away.  We have to face into it and resolve it.  Our work in negotiating the bank deal, the promissory note, the reduction in the interest rate, the extension of the maturities, the separation of bank and sovereign debt, dealing with the issue of retrospective debt, is all to do with lifting and easing the debt burden on the Irish taxpayer.</p><p> Second, we also need to ensure the promotion of economic policies which will generate employment and promote trade and investment.  The stabilising of our finances and the banking situation are critical in order to encourage investment in the country.  Happily, we have seen much success in that area over the course of the past year.  IDA Ireland has done very well in attracting inward investment.  The employment figures published by the Central Statistics Office show the first increase since 2008 in the numbers of people at work.  We must not exaggerate those successes but they are indicators that we are on the way to recovery.</p><p> While people have been bearing a very great burden and have been feeling the pressure of that burden, there is also hope, in particular, for young people.  We said that one of the priorities for the Irish Presidency of the European Union would be to address the issue of youth unemployment.  So many young people right across Europe have no work and cannot get the jobs that match their qualifications.  The provision in the European Union budget for the funding for the youth guarantee is one of the initiatives.  This must be a priority in order to engender a sense of hope that we will come through the crisis and the recession and that there is life after the recession.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-05a.215" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Shirley Coulter" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013030500003#B00200"><p>Following our meeting of 20 October 2011 and interim correspondence from the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, to the joint committee, we welcome and thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss again the continued plight of non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, working in a system which shows an absolute disregard for their contract of employment, appropriate working conditions and future career prospects.  Since our previous meeting, very little has changed for non-consultant hospital doctors and little, if any, progress has been made on the Irish Medical Organisation's recommendations to ensure the health service can attract the best doctors and provide excellent training, defined career paths and the highest standard of patient care and safety.</p><p>  These recommendations, which were discussed in detail at our previous meeting, sought the following: the full implementation of the NCHD contract 2010; improved working conditions and the removal of inappropriate tasks; a reduction in onerous working hours and the appropriate application of the European working time directive; improved structured training in terms of access and funding, including the introduction of more flexible, family friendly training and restructuring of current non-training posts; a strategic planned approach to manpower planning to determine defined career paths for all grades and specialties, including addressing career progression of long service hospital doctors; an increase in the number of specialist and general practitioner posts; and the continued roll-out of clinical care programmes and expansion of primary care to contribute to a reduction in the reliance on NCHDs in staffing hospitals. </p><p>  Conditions for many non-consultant hospital doctors have deteriorated rather than improved, as ever increasing demands are placed on an overloaded health service, which in turn increases demands on NCHDs who are already working dangerous and illegal hours.  Many of these hours remain unpaid by hospitals which unfairly target NCHDs for cost savings, while making no attempt to ensure patient care by reducing unsafe NCHD working hours.</p><p>  There are a number of grounds for concern about what is taking place.  Without doubt, patient care is being jeopardised in a system which routinely expects doctors to work excessive hours without adequate breaks or rest.  Despite the best efforts of non-consultant hospital doctors, who take their responsibilities extremely seriously, it is clear that an accident will happen as a result of the current working regime and it will have serious, perhaps even fatal, consequences.</p><p>  The health of our members is also being jeopardised.  We have recounted previously before the joint committee stories of mental and physical health issues arising for non-consultant hospital doctors purely as a result of the excessive working time arrangements to which they are subject.  The future of our health services is being jeopardised as more and more of our best and brightest young doctors turn their backs on a system that is chaotic and shows little interest in their well-being.</p><p>  As I indicated, the position has not improved despite increased debate and attention on this crisis.  The unilateral introduction in September 2012 of the consultant pay cut and corresponding two tier work force as well as the recent Croke Park II agreement, which inequitably adversely impacts on non-consultant hospital doctors, are further retrograde steps that will only serve to exacerbate the problems of recruitment and retention of NCHDs in the health service.  While the Government appears to have seen the error of its way in establishing, <i>de facto</i>, a two tier public sector by seeking to address the new entrant pay cut introduced in January 2011 as part of the Croke Park II agreement, this does not address the issue for non-consultant hospital doctors as the new entrant consultant pay cut is to remain.  This is yet another anomaly that will drive NCHDs out of the health service.</p><p>  Doctors may choose not to complete lengthy training in a health service that disregards their contract, requires onerous illegal working hours under difficult working conditions and has limited career planning without the prospect of a consultant post remunerated at a level equivalent to the consultant they will work alongside.  Non-consultant hospital doctors may instead pursue shorter training overseas under superior conditions, with the aim of taking up a consultant post that provides an overall package of terms and conditions of employment, working conditions and salary levels that are more attractive than those available in Ireland.  This is best exemplified by the Irish Medical Organisation's &quot;Boarding Pass&quot; campaign of November 2012, which resulted in more than 800 non-consultant hospital doctors indicating their intention to leave the health service by signing a symbolic boarding pass to make the point that unless the position changes, there will be more NCHDs in our airports than in our hospitals.  The impact is already being felt, with the Health Service Executive having to re-advertise almost 20% of consultant positions last year. </p><p>  In addition to the foregoing detrimental developments since our previous meeting, the debate on the implementation of the European working time directive has been reignited.  As outlined in our previous submission, the non-consultant hospital doctors contract 2010 and High Court settlement agreement between the Irish Medical Organisation and Health Service Executive of January 2010 both allow for the flexible application of the directive to NCHDs, including a maximum on-site shift of 24 hours, on a 1:5 basis, and the recording of time separated into working and training time.  Due to the failure of the HSE to implement these provisions, the European Commission forwarded a reasoned opinion to Ireland on 30 September 2011, stating that  non-consultant hospital doctors work average hours which exceed the limit fixed by the directive and are not provided with minimum daily and weekly rest in accordance with the protections in the directive and requesting an explanation for this non-compliance.  In January 2012, Ireland submitted a .  This plan affirms Ireland's commitment to achieving compliance with the directive, sets out a timeframe for achieving compliance over the next three years, identifies the establishment of a national high level implementation group and commits to implementing other measures that will support compliance, including the implementation of new work patterns for medical staff, transfer of work undertaken by NCHDs to other grades and organisation of hospital services to support compliance with the working time directive.  It also makes a commitment to provide the Commission with an annual progress report.  </p><p>  This response is being considered by the European Commission and the Irish Medical Organisation understands a case may be taken against Ireland in the European Court of Justice.  The IMO has also written to the Commission to highlight inaccuracies in the HSE&rsquo;s report and we lodged an official complaint in March 2012 that national law and practice in Ireland does not comply with the working time directive.  Our complaint is registered with the Commission and is being considered. </p><p>  The Health Service Executive published a report on European working time directive compliance and related issues dated 30 January 2013.  It includes 15 national standards for European working time directive compliance on which hospitals were required to report by 1 March 2013.  These standards were drafted without any consultation or agreement with non-consultant hospital doctors or the Irish Medical Organisation, despite our repeated calls, including under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission, for the issue of the European working time directive to be properly addressed by the HSE.  The standards are largely impractical and non-implementable within the timelines set out, particularly without the direct involvement of non-consultant hospital doctors.  It is likely that the premature issuing into the system of these unilateral proposals with an unworkable deadline for the submission of an action plan will only produce responses that highlight the impossibility of implementation, rather than any coherent action plans.</p><p>  It is the stated position of the Health Service Executive that responsibility for improving European working time directive compliance remains at individual hospital and agency level.  While this is undoubtedly an unacceptable abdication of responsibility by the HSE nationally, to achieve compliance it will be essential to secure the buy-in of all stakeholders, including at local hospital level.  However, the lack of any sanctions for non-compliance, coupled with an overriding concern for budgets over patient and doctor health and safety, results in a total lack of accountability at both national and local level for the consistent and dangerous flouting of the law every day in hospitals.  The HSE hides behind inaccurate averages of working hours, stating that non-consultant hospital doctors are working on average 54 hours per week.  The IMO disputes this figure and from our own data, it is clear that the average is between 60 and 65 hours per week.  The HSE use of averages is totally inappropriate, however, given that the European working time directive applies to individual doctors, and serves only to mask the true extent of the dangerous working hours required of NCHDs, many of whom work in excess of 100 hours per week and complete continuous shifts of up to 72 hours on site, often without appropriate rest or sustenance. </p><p>  We are all well aware of what the problems are because they have been debated in detail in recent years and resulted in myriad reports and recommendations, all of which have been to no avail.  The focus now must be on solutions, not problems.  The key objectives of the current NCHD campaign, #24hoursisenough, which is borne out of non-consultant hospital doctors' absolute despair at the soul-destroying hours they are required to work to the detriment of patient care, are to limit the maximum shift length to 24 hours, limit the weekly average to 48 hours in compliance with the European working time directive, while protecting training time, and remove NCHD inappropriate tasks.  To this end, it is of utmost concern to the IMO that there is a complete absence of a proposal in the HSE's 15 national standards to address the key issue of the removal of NCHD inappropriate tasks, which would undoubtedly significantly reduce NCHD working hours and would be a major stepping stone on the road to compliance with the European working time directive.</p><p>  A recent survey of non-consultant hospital doctors found that more that 30% of their working time is spent on tasks which are not appropriate to an NCHD and should be undertaken by other grades of staff in order that non-consultant hospital doctors can focus on their medical work.  These include the administering of first dose intravenous medications, phlebotomy, cannulation and ECGs, none of which should require a doctor.  At weekends, NCHDs can spend in excess of four hours undertaking routine phlebotomy, which amounts to 208 hours or in excess of five working weeks per year. </p><p>  The national implementation group report on the European working time directive of December 2008 recommended the promotion of multidisciplinary health care collaboration between health care professionals, including the redesignation of existing roles.  It found that the delegation of non-medical duties to grades other than non-consultant hospital doctors can facilitate reductions in NCHD hours, allowing NCHDs to focus on other aspects of medical care and thereby improving the efficiency of service delivery. </p> <p>The pilot projects undertaken showed a willingness and flexibility by NCHDs and other health care staff to embrace change work practices, yet there has been no move by the HSE to implement these work practices in the intervening years.  While a number of hospitals already have local policies and custom and practices well established with regard to many of these tasks, it is clear that a national policy on NCHD inappropriate tasks and a redefinition of the duties and responsibilities of NCHDs must be agreed with the IMO as a matter of urgency, with a practical timeline for its implementation.  </p><p> With regard to the other key objectives of the "24 hours is Enough" campaign, national agreements are already in place and the HSE must facilitate formal national liaison with the IMO and local level engagement between NCHDs, hospital management and senior clinicians to agree the reorganisation of rosters.  The problems are evident and the solutions are clear.  The HSE must accept its responsibility to doctors and patients alike to ensure that safe work practices are implemented in all hospitals without delay.  The IMO, the representative body for NCHDs, is ready and willing to work with all stakeholders to ensure the essential changes to the day-to-day work, training and career paths of NCHDs are achieved in a timely fashion to safeguard the highest standards of patient care in the Irish health service into the future.</p></speech>

I have often thought it a curious thing that we describe a cohort of health professionals by what they are not, as against what they are.  In any event it has been known and widely recognised for many years that the hospital system is over-reliant on non-consultant hospital doctors and successive Governments have clearly failed to address this over-reliance.  It led to the crisis faced in 2011 which led to emergency legislation in order to address the significant shortfall in supply.  At that time, I recall the Bill facilitated the continuation, at least for the time being, of the current system and at least it prevented the collapse and the consequent loss of services.  One would have to ask how long we have to wait for real reform of the situation and when the ramshackle structure, which is how I described it at the time, will be replaced by a proper system of medical training and hospital staffing.</p><p>  The presentation goes to the core of the issue.  The witness pulled no punches, for which I say, "Well done".  It is very important that we have a wake-up call.  One would have to ask what is the Minister for Health's plan to end the reliance on non-consultant hospital doctors and to get better value for patients and whether he has such a plan.  This is critically important.  The system was flawed enough but has been compounded by the recruitment embargo and the widespread cutbacks which are being imposed making an already difficult situation infinitely worse.  In the context of all this, the IMO update today, which is an update on the last submission on 20 October 2011 which was the last time we engaged on the issue, makes what I have described in my notes as grim and alarming reading.  I wish to emphasise again what the witness has put on the record.  We are told that little, if any, progress has been made since the last time we engaged some 18 months ago.  This is March 2013 and conditions have clearly deteriorated.  We are told that NCHDs are working "dangerous and illegal hours".  Most significantly, I note the IMO says patient care is being jeopardised and that an accident will happen as a result of this working regime and it will have serious and, perhaps, fatal consequences.  The witness spoke of "consistent and dangerous flouting of the law" every day in hospitals around the country.  So far as patient safety and care is concerned, as well as the well-being of hospital staff, of its own professional involvement, I believe it is an indictment of the Minister that there has not been a substantive address in the period since we had a huge focus on the issue in mid-2011.  I wish to ask a couple of questions.  </p><p>  The IMO recommends removal of inappropriate tasks from NCHDs.  Is this compatible with the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation's proposals for expanding the role of nurses?  I do not have to go over the detail of the IMO proposals as the witnesses are already familiar with it.  What does the IMO see as the next essential step?  What would it recommend should be done immediately?  I hope we as a committee will set aside all our differences, whatever our views of the Minister, and I have expressed mine.  I believe we have to address the issue together and urge immediate action because this is not tenable and cannot be tolerated further.  </p></speech>

I warmly welcome my colleagues.  I remember my own days as a trainee doctor, as an NCHD, with a mixture of the odd sleepless night and what it was like to be on call for three or four consecutive nights.  I also recall it with a degree of nostalgia about the excitement of first being involved in our wonderful specialty.  A couple of weeks ago we had the vote on the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Bill.  This rare event occurred when Deputies and Senators had to stay up until about 2.30 a.m. in the case of the Deputies and the more hardy Senators were up until about 6.30 a.m.  The most complicated thing they had to do at the end was to push a green or red button and, in most cases, had been told what button to push.  There was nothing more complicated than that.  There was a certain amount of whingeing the next day when people had to do other aspects of their job as well.  This is just the every day and every night experience-----</p></speech>

They do something far more complicated than doing what a Whip tells them in terms of voting "Yes" or "No".  They actually have to make life and death decisions.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in correctly pointed out the oddity of referring to them as non-consultant hospital doctors.  Previously they were known as junior hospital doctors.  However, when it became apparent that the average age of a registrar in this country was the late 30s and the average junior hospital doctor had ten to 15 years of medical experience, following medical school under their belt, and that on average they waited until they were in their 40s for a consultant job, which in any normal country, with a normal health service, they would have had a decade earlier, it became apparent that calling then junior doctors was inappropriate.  This goes to the core of the problem.  Trainees should be trainees.  If I ran the system I would refer to them all as trainee specialists.  That is what they are.  Senior hospital doctors, interns, registrars, all with varying degrees of seniority, are there to learn and to train.  Instead of that, we have used them as a colossal band-aid to plug the fundamental gap in our health service which is the appalling shortage of career level jobs both within and without hospitals.  We have the smallest number of consultants in every specialty and the smallest number of GPs.  As a result if people are to get medical care, one has to inappropriately use trainee doctors.  As well as that there was a culture where our trainee doctors were encouraged to go to international centres of excellence to advance their careers and to bring skills back to our country.</p> <p>Instead, I believe what has happened is that the domestication of training in this country has been an attempt to institutionalise people, keeping them here for four, five, six or seven years after medical school to be service providers.  The royal colleges and, to an extent, the Medical Council, have been somewhat complicit in this.</p><p> I beg the committee's indulgence, but I may have to leave to deal with an issue in the Seanad.  The key solution to these problems would be to have appropriate reform of the health system.  People should know coming out of medical school that they will have to do this for five or six years, but that after that they will have a career level job.  They should know there will be no pressure on them to emigrate or no uncertainty about the outcome.  They would do their five or six years in that case.  It is because we keep them in endless abeyance, not knowing whether they will be "junior doctors" or "trainees" when they are already a decade past full training that they tend to regard themselves just as service providers.  </p><p> We urgently need to fix the safety issues relating to the non-compliance by the State with international guidelines and international and European directives.  However, to fix the bigger picture, we must fix the health system.  We must have a system where we have an approximate trebling or quadrupling of career level posts, a reduction in trainee posts, a match of career posts to trainee posts and a situation where, when a person finishes medical school and has done his or her training, he or she will have a job.</p></speech>

I thought it was important to be here to discuss this issue as I had called for it to be debated by the committee and I thank the Chair and the committee for accommodating me.</p><p>  Several issues arise in the context of junior doctors.  What level of consultation is taking place currently between managers and junior doctors in hospitals with regard to the difficulties junior doctors have in individual hospitals in the context of working time and conditions?  Is there any consultation taking place?  In 2011, we had a major crisis when a situation arose where the HSE had to go to India and Pakistan to recruit junior doctors and I understand that well over 200 of those doctors came and got jobs here.  Their two-year contracts will expire in July or December this year and I understand they will not be offered any job within the HSE once the two-year period is up, although they will have got used to the system here.  Is that correct?</p><p>  My office conducted a survey on the attitude of medical graduates graduating in June 2012 and some 65% of them indicated they would not be working in Irish hospitals after June 2013.  Can the witnesses give us any indication of the number of those now working as interns who intend to stay working in the Irish health system?  What percentage of them intend to stay?  In the case of existing junior doctors, will a larger number of these be leaving in June and December this year in comparison with other years?  Has the IMO any indication of whether the percentage of those who intend to leave has increased?</p><p>  I understand there are some discussions taking place with regard to the recruitment of junior doctors from Pakistan and that this process will be different from the supervised division that operated in 2011.  Has the HSE discussed that issue with the IMO and what rules will apply for these people?  I raise this because I am concerned that we are prepared to engage with a foreign country on recruitment - I have no difficulty with regard to people from Pakistan and India working here - but do not seem prepared to sit down with educational institutions here and do the same.  Does the same level of consultation take place with Irish educational institutions?</p><p>  I understand there are over 4,000 junior doctors working in the Irish hospital system.  Has the IMO any idea how many of these doctors are on six-month, 12-month, two-year or three-year contracts?  When I put this question to the HSE, I was unable to get an answer.  Does the IMO have that information?  It would be helpful to this committee.</p></speech>

Over 50% of non-consultant doctors working in Ireland now are not Irish graduates but come from abroad, yet we have the largest number of medical schools per head of population of any country in the world.  Why is this?  Recently, I heard of an extraordinarily well-trained colleague, with 18 years international experience, multiple publications and who is a true leader in his field, who has failed in every attempt to get a job in Ireland and has just been recruited by Harvard Medical School.</p></speech>

However, I know for a fact that junior doctors are working those hours.  My son works day and night; he never gets home and it is really tough.</p><p>  Professor Crown put the facts in his supplemental comment.  I do not get it.  We train doctors, but we do not give them jobs and export them.  The taxpayer forks out the money for this.</p></speech>

I am concerned that what is going on is a danger for patients, particularly when doctors must work 72 hours or so without sleep.  I am concerned about sleep deprivation and the dangers it brings.  I cannot understand why we are bringing in foreign doctors when we have our own doctors here.</p><p>  The IMO stated that we must match production to replacement value and that while there is no guarantee of the chosen career path of any non-consultant hospital doctor, we should, at the very least, be producing the required number of specialists in Ireland, rather than recruiting them from developing countries in contravention of the World Health Organization guidelines on ethical recruitment.  I do not understand how this is working.  Will the IMO explain it for the benefit of the committee?</p></speech>

I welcome the comments made by Senator Crown and Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, who have direct experience of the situation.  It seems we can defy every recommendation, rule and European directive in the book when it suits us.  I am aware the HSE will be coming before the committee later and I hope to question it in this regard.</p><p>  All over the country, including in my county, HIQA is looking at buildings and declaring them unfit for use, unsuitable and too old and Dickensian.  However, there is no organisation such as HIQA in place to look after staff who are being abused, professional staff who have had top-class training and who want to and are giving their all, but who have to work under these kinds of conditions.  When are we going to get it right?  In the case of buildings, standards are being enforced and places are being closed, but there is no body looking after the well-being of our willing, able and hard working junior doctors who are forced to work under these conditions.  This does not happen elsewhere.  It does not happen in industry, in agriculture or anywhere else.  In those areas health and safety rules are observed as are working time rules and employment regulations and legislation.</p><p>  Why is this allowed go on by the Department of Health and the HSE?  I fully support the witnesses and agree what they are being asked to do is outrageous.  How can going the length of time they do without sleep not be a danger to both them and patients.  No matter who we are, we cannot manage without rest.</p> <p>It is farcical that this can continue, in spite of what HIQA is doing in both private nursing homes and public hospitals.  It exposes huge disrespect for human beings,  both patients and doctors.</p></speech>

I will take the questions in order and group them together, where appropriate.  </p><p>  Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked about the next steps and the compatibility of our views on the next steps <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> appropriate tasking with reference to nursing staff and so forth.  We are not reinventing the wheel.  There is already significant custom and practice around the country, whereby other grades of staff, not just nursing staff, are undertaking these duties and it is a matter of looking at where it works and developing national guidelines.  These guidelines should be developed collectively.  It is important that the HSE, the IMO and doctors work together, with the representative bodies for the other groups.</p><p>  The committee may already be aware that the IMO works alongside the INMO, where appropriate.  Both organisations left the Croke Park II discussions recently and are collaborating closely on many issues.  We have had informal discussions about these issues.  I welcome Senator John Crown's comments and agree that appropriate reform of the health system is absolutely necessary, but it is probably a longer term goal, given the major patient and doctor safety implications.  We need quick win solutions and things to happen now.  Some of the key measures we are examining will achieve this.  One of them is the introduction of a maximum 24 hour on-site shift.  Another involves the removal of inappropriate tasks.  </p><p>  As some of the doctors might like to speak, I will hand over to Dr. Murphy.  Dr. O'Kane has been very involved in securing the local engagement required to effect real change in a number of hospitals and will speak about that issue after Dr. Murphy has contributed.</p></speech>

I also thank the committee for giving us the opportunity to speak today.  I will be very direct.  NCHDs have absolutely horrendous working conditions.  Hospitals are not what they used to be in the 1980s and 1990s.  There are chronic diseases, an aging population and treatments that were not available then such as for heart attacks.  Hospitals operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year and NCHDs provide care on that basis.  Hospitals are, wrongly, entirely reliant on NCHDs to provide that care.</p></speech>

That 80 hour week is a sleepless one, involving stress and multiple life and death decisions.  The average working week is approximately just over 60 hours, but we all know what averages mean.  The outliers are working absolutely horrendous hours that would not be inflicted on a dog.  Everyone in the State, however, including the Government and our employer, the HSE, is happy for us to do this, but enough is enough and NCHDs have spoken.  It harms our physical and mental health, harms patients and the future of the health service.  What are we going to do about it?  Are we going to have another Hanly report or another expert group report?  The HSE is our employer and I hope the committee will ask it for some accountability.</p><p>  Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked about the essential steps and Senator John Crown referred to the big picture, long-term issues such as the fact that we need more consultants and a reconfiguration of hospital services.  We can talk about the difficult changes that need to and should happen in the longer term, but we also need to address the issue of changes that can be made this year.  I hope the committee will press the HSE to make these changes.  In that context, I will reiterate what Ms Coulter said.  First, on the issue of NCHDs and appropriate tasks, the situation is ludicrous.  The Minister for Health has described us as "gofors".  Is that what the State is training us to be?  We have NCHDs who ensure already booked investigations happen.  Why?  That does not happen abroad.  It is not very difficult to sort out this issue.  One only has to look at the situation in Australia, New Zealand and other countries where there are six consultants for every two NCHDs.  Here, we have one consultant and myriad NCHDs running after him or her, carrying out inappropriate tasks.  Reform and change must happen and Dr. O'Kane can expand on how that can be done.  Ultimately, though, it is up to the HSE to make change happen.  The issue is one of accountability.  Those at the top end of the human resources section say they agree with us, but it is not trickling down.  Accountability and a change to the culture are vital.  </p><p>  The second issue is rosters which could be changed this year.  The IMO and NCHDs need to be involved with local management to make this happen.  It is within the gift of the HSE.  </p><p>  These two changes alone would dramatically reduce the hours worked by NCHDs, improve our health and that of our patients, as well as help in the retention of doctors in the system.  The health service would be better and the taxpayer would win because we would not be claiming un-rostered overtime that we do not want to work.  These two changes, namely, changing our roles and using clever rostering systems, must happen and we must be directly involved.  As Ms Coulter outlined, we were not even consulted about various changes that were supposed to take place by 1 March, none of which has actually happened.  We must be involved in the process because we have the expertise required to make positive changes.</p></speech>

There was a big controversy involving Cork University Hospital, detailed in various newspapers this week, about forms and payments.  Is it the case that doctors decided to stay, rather than go home, after they had worked their rostered hours?  I raised this issue at a meeting of the health forum in Cork yesterday.</p></speech>

It is entitled, Assessing Performance in Reducing NCHD Working Hours - National Standards.  Essentially, these are 15 national standards developed by the national working group on the European working time directive which was established last year.  The IMO requested that it be involved with the working group.  We had one meeting with the group in May last year and have not heard anything from it since, despite raising the matter on numerous occasions.  We are constantly engaged in discussions with the HSE under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission and raised the question of the working group a number of times.</p><p>  The document, with the 15 standards, was drafted by the aforementioned working group without consultation with the IMO, as the representative body for NCHDs.  Furthermore, it was drafted without local level engagement with doctors working on the ground.  It is my understanding that a number of site visits were conducted around the country as a data gathering exercise.  The working group saw, for example, that certain specialties with a certain number of doctors were working well and in near compliance with the directive, while others with similar numbers of doctors were nowhere near compliance.  It seems that the working group tried to come up with a sticking plaster solution by taking what worked in one area and trying to apply it across the board.</p> <p>It will never work without the proper and appropriate local-level engagement of doctors who are actually in place.  The HSE should bear in mind that buy-in from doctors will be required to work these new rostering arrangements.  For doctors to feel that they have ownership and some control over what they are doing, it is necessary that they are involved in the rostering process.</p><p> Dr. Murphy referred to standards and we referred to them in our statement as well.  It is concerning that a key recommendation of the Hanly report from 2003, which is Government policy, and a key recommendation of the HSE's report on European working time directive, EWTD, compliance relates to the removal of inappropriate tasks from non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs.  There are 15 standards for achieving the EWTD but the report mentions nothing about the tasks, duties, roles and responsibilities.  The HSE is following through on its stated policy when it comes to implementation.  This was issued throughout the system and hospitals had to report back by 1 March on how they would achieve compliance.  This occurred with no consultation with NCHDs.  We held a meeting with NCHDs and some HSE senior management attended.  After that I received an e-mail to stating that the HSE would now engage with NCHDs but it is a little late for that.  They had already drafted the standards.  We will be calling for the withdrawal of these standards, for everyone, including all the stakeholders, to get around the table to ensure that national standards are implementable and achievable and that they will effect real change.  These must be drafted and implemented with the required urgency.</p><p> Reference was made to clock-in systems.  The Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, and several hospitals have agreed to the introduction of clock-in systems and they are working well.  That is one of the objectives of the national standards and one we are willing to discuss with the HSE.  It is absolutely untrue and it is disappointing to hear that there is an indication that NCHDs might be claiming for hours that are not worked.</p></speech>

The suggestion is that they were staying longer than they should have.  The issue is what they should be doing.  They must stay as long as a service requirement exists.  As Dr. Murphy remarked, hospital services are provided on a 24 hour, seven day basis.  I cannot say that my roster ends at 5 p.m. and therefore I am simply going home at that stage.  The patient still needs to be seen and taken care of.  Often, this is why NCHDs stay beyond the roster.  There is an anomaly in NCHD working lives relating to unrostered hours and the Chairman referred to a relevant situation in Cork.  These hours are unrostered because the roster is not appropriate to the actual working day.  The roster is based on coming in at 9 a.m. and finishing at 5 p.m. but that is not how the service is delivered.  A ward round might start at 8 a.m. or there might be a team meeting starting at 7 a.m. or a clinic may be meant to finish at 5 p.m. but it may not finish until 6 p.m or 7 p.m.  These hours are classified as unrostered.  They are inevitably crossed off when people claim them but the NCHDs are absolutely required to be there.  They are there at the behest of the employer and they are there to provide a service.</p></speech>

I wish to put things into some context following what Ms Coulter has said.  Seven years ago as a student I was asked to shadow some of the interns in a particular hospital and document the inappropriate tasks on call.  The work was documented seven years ago but nothing has been done with those inappropriate tasks since then.</p><p>  Senator Burke commented on management and NCHDs.  I have come to realise in recent years that in Ireland there is a huge missing link between administration, allied health staff and NCHDs.  Undoubtedly, we are best placed to serve people because we can see the inefficiencies in the system since we work on the ground.  We are also well travelled and we have worked in various hospitals throughout the country.  For such a small country we have a rather variable health system and things are done differently in different hospitals.  As a result of these observations made over my five qualified years, two years ago I established an NCHD committee in one particular hospital for several reasons.  Following this, we held several meetings with nursing staff and we progressed several issues relating to inappropriate tasks.  We developed a collaborative document with nursing staff on a policy and we began to implement a pilot scheme on the administration of first-dose antibiotics by nursing staff.  I believe that has progressed although there have been several teething problems.</p><p>  We have another NCHD committee in my current hospital.  We are working on several issues including inappropriate tasks and rosters.  Also, we have NCHD representatives linking and infiltrating throughout the hospital.  We now have several representatives on the HSE clinical programmes within the hospitals.  We meet regularly with human resource and administrative staff to consider the issues involving NCHDs.  A good deal of work has been done.  In recent months, given the current climate we have advocated that NCHD local committees are potentially the way forward on a short-term basis.  Certainly, one size does not fit all situations.  I have worked in several hospitals throughout the country.  If one implements a given roster in one hospital, one can be guaranteed that it will not work in another hospital.</p><p>  This brings me to another point.  Workforce planning throughout the country is something we should work to improve.  Communication is vital but it is possible to improve things.  The culture of Ireland is such that decisions that involve NCHDs are unilaterally taken by administrative staff.  No one seems to consult the NCHDs.  I believe that we are best served to consider the inefficiencies and to improve the system.  Anyway, it can be done.</p></speech>

The issue of accountability is relevant.  The longer we continue to neglect to sort out fines or penalties for failing to implement the systems that have already been agreed upon, the longer the problem will continue.  Recently at a public meeting with us the HSE described itself as exploiting us as a workforce.  That is a direct quote.</p></speech>

I echo Deputy Mattie McGrath's words: we are forced to work these hours.  Colleagues from other fields often ask why I do not simply leave at the end of a day but as a doctor I have a duty of care to my patients.  If I have a patient who is unwell at 5 p.m., I do not leave.  I must ensure that my patient is appropriately looked after.  That is my priority and it will continue to be my priority.</p><p>  I welcome the clock-in and clock-out system.  I have worked in a hospital where it was implemented rather successfully.  However, it is clear that this system records hours but it does not necessarily ensure that these hours are within the documented limits as per our contracts and as per the recommendations of the European working time directive.  Anyway, it means those in the human resources department have an objective and clear record of exactly how many hours each doctor is working but they are completely ignoring these records in the vast majority of cases.</p></speech>

More engagement with local NCHD committees, as Dr. O'Kane described, and the various hospitals is needed.  We have seen such committees spring up in recent weeks as these issues have gained more traction and public airing.  In the past certain hospitals may not have had committees but they are now developing committees, meeting regularly, engaging with management and becoming involved in decision-making and planning.  That is a key change.</p></speech>

The HSE is deferring much of the responsibility for implementation of issues relating to the working time directive to consultants.  Naturally, consultants are important in this process and we are keen to engage with consultants in every hospital.</p></speech>

I apologise for being late; I was speaking in the D&aacute;il.  I welcome the doctors.  My last direct involvement in the hospital service was approximately 15 years ago.  It was an issue then and clearly it remains an issue.  It is a more serious issue now because as the doctors have said the complexity of the work and the workload is entirely different today from what it was ten or 15 years ago.  There is no comparison with the type of work, the level of work or the complexity of the work that is done at this stage.  I can confirm from my experience the veracity of the comments on rosters.  The fact is that in most hospitals the published rosters bear no resemblance to what junior doctors work at and the hours they put in.  As the doctors have said, in many cases they may start at 7.30 a.m. or 8 a.m. depending on the time the consultant starts his rounds, on how long the clinics last and how many additional patients are added to the clinics.</p> <p>There is no comparison between the published rosters and the actual work done and hours worked by junior doctors.  It is another indication of the head in the sand attitude of the HSE.  I am in agreement with the point raised by the doctors in their submission that the key difficulty with the HSE in this and quite a number of other areas concerns the lack of consultation.  It is appalling that in a whole range of issues the HSE simply refuses to consult stakeholders, people on the ground, staff and others who have a genuine interest and stake in the delivery of services.  That is a fundamental difficulty.  Until we solve that problem, there will be significant difficulties right across the health service, not just with regard to non-consultant hospital doctors.</p></speech>

Their contracts finish in June or December this year.  Is there any indication of how many, particularly interns, do not intend to reapply for jobs in the HSE?  Does the IMO have any indication whether the 200 doctors from India and Pakistan will be offered contracts once their two years are up?  I presume they are represented by the IMO and that they are working here under supervision.</p></speech>

A dangerous and illegal number of hours are being worked.  Not only does this affect the mental health and well-being of the doctors, but it could also affect the care of patients.  Health and safety are very important in all aspects of work.  However, they seem to be blatantly disregarded in the health service.  Should patients have confidence in doctors or the health service if they know doctors have just worked 72 hours without a break and are performing procedures on them?  I do not understand why rosters cannot be shorter.  I understand a person may be rostered for a certain period of time and that shifts may overrun.  In the manufacturing sector in which workers also do shift work, nobody has to work three days straight, but people's lives are at risk in the case of NCHDs.</p></speech>

The key point in our opening submission is that there is no sanction or accountability; therefore, it can happen, day after day.  One may ask whether things will change when there is an adverse outcome.  There probably have been hundreds of adverse outcomes which, directly or indirectly, may have resulted from doctors working long hours and having to make life or death decisions when extremely tired and exhausted.  "Prime Time" broadcast a good programme a number of weeks ago which featured a number of doctors who very bravely spoke out about their own personal experiences and the outcomes when they were fatigued.  In answer to the Deputies' questions, there is a lack of sanction or accountability.</p><p>  On the European Court of Justice case, this may be a question better asked of the HSE in the later session.  The IMO received written correspondence from the HSE enclosing the standards.  The information was contained in one line, that the European Court of Justice may be taking a case against Ireland.  That was the only detail provided of what was potentially a massive and extremely costly case for the country.  It was just one line in a lengthy document sent to us.</p><p>  I will address the questions from Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor and Senator Colm Burke which are related.  I thank Senator Colm Burke for his continued interest in NCHD issues.  We have been in regular contact in the intervening period since our last meeting and his support is much appreciated by NCHDs.  </p><p>  The questions about the position of doctors whose contracts are due to expire are possibly best asked of the HSE.  A new recruitment drive in Pakistan was mentioned.  It is my understanding from the HSE that a form of exchange process is being planned as part of which very senior specialist trainees from Pakistan will come to Ireland on a two year rotational basis and then return to their training schemes.  We do not have the details.  </p><p>  On the question about the numbers of doctors leaving after July, this will not be clear until the interview process is complete.  Interviews remain to be conducted for posts around the country and this process is in train.  The HSE will not have an indication until a little later as to the number of vacancies available from July.  The IMO has always called for contingency planning because it has become evident, unfortunately, for the past few years, that there have been significant NCHD vacancies.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-05a.283" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Shirley Coulter" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013030500008#G01400"><p>The Deputy concerned asked about the WHO guidelines and career progression.  The guidelines on ethical recruitment from developing countries have been adopted by the HSE.  They state medical staff recruited from developing countries must be provided with a certain level of training rather than simply being used to provide a service, which seems to be the case in Ireland.  They further state further medical training in the developing country should be supported by the recruiting country.  It is questionable whether the HSE is applying the guidelines in this case.</p><p>  On the issue of career progression, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor was referring to a piece in our previous submission about matching the numbers of NCHDs with specialist posts.  There needs to be an increase in the number of specialist consultant and general practitioner posts.  There is a disconnect between the number of NCHDs in training who will complete training and the number of specialist posts available for them.</p></speech>

In the view of many of my colleagues who work all over the country, the treatment of non-EU doctors was wholeheartedly unethical.  They were treated appallingly.  Even from the point of view of the optics, it is very bad treatment by an employer and symbolises what is wrong.  It is tied with the career plan.  I do not want to be too philosophical, but like all employees and others, NCHDs just want to have basic needs met, as per Maslow's hierarchy of needs.  We want security; to know whether we will have a job in July and whether we can stay in Ireland.  For example, we do not have access to water when working 72 hours, with the result that we do not pee.  Honestly, these are the things about which we think.  We face horrific things in our work.</p><p>  Career planning is another issue.  I refer to the UK or Australian system.  A doctor is trained for two years at basic level and then progresses to a specialist training programme for six to 12 months.  We want a training period of five years which would lead to consultant level in order that we could provide great care.  We do not want to be middle grade NCHDs who are a permanent feature of the Irish system.</p> <p>We want career planning in Ireland.  How can we ensure it is introduced?  We know what to do.  It is a longer-term issue and we need to focus on it.  We need more consultants.  It is disgraceful that current medical students are not guaranteed employment in Ireland.  We do not have enough consultants and we are having trouble recruiting NCHDs.  However, interns will be unemployed because we and the other stakeholders are not involved in career planning.  We need to tie up medical school graduates to a quick, expedient training course in order that they might become consultants and GPs.</p></speech>

It is not just the HSE.  The training bodies need to stand over quicker training programmes that deliver better training.  It must be stated that they have a responsibility to enforce appropriate training conditions for us.  They are not really doing so at present.</p></speech>

It is extremely unsettling to be facing into a huge commitment of time, money and dedication without any real guarantee that there will be anything for me at the end of the programme.  Efforts have been made to streamline training in Ireland.  Credit must be given to some of the training bodies such as the College of Anaesthetists of Ireland and the Faculty of Radiologists at the Royal College of Surgeons.  The Royal College of Surgeons has actually changed its training schemes in the current year so that they take the form of a run-through model.  It is also planning to align the number of trainees it takes on with the projected number of consultant posts and also with the specific specialties where they are needed.  Some credit is due for that but for the vast majority of us who are still in the system, or in all other specialties, there is a definite uncertainty as to where we will go at the end of our long training.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in suggested that adverse events may occur.  I suggest that such events happen every day.  What we often think of are errors lead to patient harm.  These things do happen.  I refer to medication errors, inappropriate prescribing and incorrect doses being given.  What we do not hear so much about are the adverse events which befall those who are delivering the care.  We do not hear about the doctors involved in car accidents when they are driving home following 24, 36 or 72 hour call periods.  We do not hear about those who receive needle-stick injuries following these long work periods.  We have only begun to hear about the mental health issues that arise, such as depression, anxiety and, in some cases suicide.  Obviously, all of those cannot wholly be attributed to our working conditions but those conditions certainly do not help.  Adverse events occur all the time and that is something of which we must be wary.</p></speech>

I have been qualified for five years and I have obtained entry to a specialist registrar programme.  However, I have also worked in Australia.  Some 15 of those with whom I qualified left Ireland and five are still in Australia.  Fundamentally, both the service and one's career pathway in that country are much better outlined.  To be blunt, working conditions are a great deal better and there is much more focus on training.  As doctors, we want to train and to provide the best possible care for our patients in the best possible conditions.  That is why, ultimately, Irish graduates are leaving the country.</p></speech>

I meant to refer to the next group of witnesses.</p><p>  I do not think there is anyone present who does not completely empathise with everything our guests have stated.  It cannot simply be the case that those in authority are treating our guests as badly as they do because they can and because there are no sanctions.  I could go into my office tomorrow and be mean to my staff just because I can do so.  There must be other fundamental reasons rosters have not been changed, why a fobbing system has not been introduced and why the negative environment in which our guests are obliged to work has not been addressed.  I will not even mention the complete lack of both progression and a defined career path.  All these are genuine issues and they must be addressed.  Whose fault is it that someone is obliged to work 72 hours and how can that be justified without those in authority having attempted to make changes - which perhaps did not work - in the past?  I find it difficult to believe that in the years since Senator Crown was a trainee doctor, the environment has not changed and that this is because no one has attempted to change it.</p></speech>

There are many at fault here.  Part of the problem is that this has been allowed to go on for 30 or 40 years.  I must inform Dr. Murphy that no one leaving college at present is guaranteed a job.  Whether they are studying in the areas of medicine, business, child care or whatever, no one is guaranteed a job.</p><p>  It all comes down to a duty of care.  Regardless of whether one is a politician, a doctor, a street sweeper or a bin collector, one has a duty of care in the context of one's profession.  The duty of care in this instance does not lie with the Minister, Deputy Reilly.  I seldom disagree with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in but I must do so in the context of what he said about the Minister.  The duty of care in this instance is with the HSE.  Those who represent that body must be question with regard to how this situation has been allowed to obtain for so long.</p><p>  I did not come here to be lectured by anybody.  I am not referring to our guests but rather to others at this table who can make accusations and then leave.  I take my job as a politician very seriously.  I work long hours and I am rearing a family in the meantime.  When I go home, I cook, do the washing and everything else.  Everyone present is a professional.  We all come from different backgrounds and we all chose different careers.</p><p>  I reiterate that the problem in respect of this matter relates to the HSE's duty of care.  The CEOs and others at the top who run our hospitals must also bear some responsibility.  The blame cannot just be laid at the feet of various Ministers.  I agree that the problem has not just arisen in the two years since Deputy Reilly became Minister.  It has been ignored by successive Governments.  However, the HSE has huge responsibility in respect of this matter and it needs to realise that fact.</p></speech>

It has been the way things are for so long.  However, this does not mean that it should continue to be the way.  It is certainly because of the lack of accountability or sanction that things are not changing.  At the end of the day, the interests of hospitals relate to throughput of patients and for patients to be looked after and discharged.  That is continuing to occur.  As long as this is the case and as long as hospitals remain within budget, those in authority in the hospitals have, in their view, realised their duty of care to patients.  They are, however, missing the point when it comes to their duty of care to their staff and to the doctors who deliver the care in question.  They are also missing the vital point that in the context of patient care, it is not safe to have tired doctors.  As Dr. Considine stated, these adverse events are happening but they are not being openly and publicly attributed to people's working hours.  They are happening and perhaps it is time to stand up.  This is not about pointing figures or blaming individuals but everyone must be made aware of the implications of long working hours in respect of patient care.  It is also time there was accountability for this at hospital level.</p></speech>

We all know that and we are in agreement with regard to what is the problem.  We also kind of agree with what are the solutions but no one is ensuring that these solutions are put in place.  It is the culture that exists and we need to change it.  We can do so.</p><p>  I do not wish to sound pious but I must inform Deputy Regina Doherty that NCHDs are very vulnerable.  I completely appreciate the point made by Deputy Catherine Byrne.  We see the impact of austerity and we also see the vulnerable, marginalised and those who are victims in society in our hospitals.</p> <p>We are in a wonderful profession and we appreciate that, but nevertheless there are wrongs in the system and they need to be dealt with.  Non-consultant hospital doctors are very vulnerable.  We often rotate every three to six months.  We find it difficult to rock the boat as we are looking after our careers.  If one can think back on one's previous employment and if one built up five or ten years of loyalty and relationships, one can change systems, but in our case we move around very often.  Dr. O'Kane has done fantastic work in two hospitals and that was achieved in only one year.  Imagine what could happen if NCHDs were in positions for longer.  We are vulnerable and that is part of the problem.</p><p> There are many long-term considerations, such as those provided in the Hanly report, that need to happen to make the health services better.  They would make us compliant with the European working time directive and reform the hospital services for the benefit of the patients.  This year we need to get some tangible solutions.  In focusing on working roles and the way we work, it is not a question of dumping our roles onto other professionals but about the clever application of what constitutes the best use of resources in terms of us, allied health professionals, phlebotomy, what we do, IT and other considerations.  In respect of the two issues of our roles and rostering, I hope the committee tries to instill some accountability for those with the HSE later.</p></speech>

The health service has been attempting to deal with this complex issue of the European working time directive, EWTD, for a number of years.  The health service is working closely with individual hospitals, the colleges, our quality and patient safety directorate and human resources directorate to implement the EWTD.  We have undertaken a range of actions to address this problem and have a range of further measures in place which I will refer to later.</p><p>  The HSE engages with non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, on two levels, first as employer and second as a trainer.  The HSE provides significant financial support towards NCHD training.  Taking this into account, I will focus on three areas in my opening statement, as follows: NCHD recruitment; the European working time directive; and medical education and training.  The current NCHD workforce comprises approximately 4,910 NCHDs, including 570 interns, 1,812 senior house officers, SHOs, 1,620 registrars and 908 specialist-senior registrars.  Of the 4,910, 80% hold structured training posts, while 20% of NCHDs hold service posts.  In recent years the HSE has increased the proportion of NCHDs in formal training schemes from less than 40% to approximately 80%, increased the number of specialist registrar posts by 60% and this year will further increase intern posts from 570 to 639.</p><p>  There are two types of NCHD posts &ndash; training posts and service posts.  A total of 81% of NCHDs are recruited by postgraduate training bodies for placement in training posts in hospitals or health agencies.  The HSE recruits approximately 15% of NCHDs &ndash; all of whom are recruited to service posts.  HSE-funded agencies recruit the remaining 4% of NCHDs to service posts.  Particular hospitals and specialties have experienced difficulties filling NCHD posts over the past number of years.  Addressing this issue has been a priority for the HSE and has included a number of recruitment programmes internationally, including the recent one to India.  NCHDs are recruited twice a year &ndash; in January and July &ndash; to accommodate training rotations.  To ensure the maximum number of posts are filled, a number of separate recruitment processes are currently under way in preparation for July 2013.  I have set them out in my statement.  They include recruitment in South Africa.</p><p>  The EWTD places strict requirements on the HSE.  I have set them out in my presentation.  A specific area on which we are not fully compliant is to work no more than 48 hours a week, on average.  I will address the issue later.  Full implementation of the European working time directive poses very significant challenges for the health service and has been the subject of a series of reports over the past decade.  I have set out the details of the various reports in my statement.  In essence, the reports identify six key measures that are required to support the implementation of the European working time directive.  They include: new work patterns for NCHDs to include 5/7 working and shorter shift periods; reduction of tiered on-call - where interns, senior house officers, registrars and senior or specialist registrars and consultants participate in a tiered on-call system; cross-cover arrangements at senior house officer and registrar levels; changes to delivery of medical education and training; the introduction of a consultant-provided service; and reconfiguration of acute hospital services.  These reports concluded that the key drivers of NCHD hours are service needs, how hospitals are configured internally and what services each hospital provides.</p> <p> While the draft Smaller Hospital Framework, which is currently in development and set for roll-out in the coming months, and the wider move to hospital groups will facilitate reconfiguration, it is important to note that in hospitals where the workload does not exist to support non-consultant hospital doctor, NCHD, training or increased numbers of consultants, European working time directive, EWTD, compliance can only be achieved by changing the type of services delivered and the times during which services are delivered.  The decision on the NCHD rosters that are put in place to maintain services is best made at local level by consultants, clinical directors and service and hospital managers. </p><p> Regarding compliance, the health service has almost complete compliance with weekly and fortnightly rest, and significant compliance with breaks.  However, there is limited compliance with daily rest and the 48 hour average working week.  In this regard, many doctors do not receive adequate daily rest and many more work in excess of the average 48 hour working week.</p><p> While substantial progress towards EWTD compliance has been made in some sites, including some of our large hospitals such as Galway University Hospital and St Vincent's University Hospital, our most significant challenges are in small to medium sized hospitals such as Portlaoise hospital or Tralee hospital, with low numbers of doctors on rotas in surgery, anaesthetics, paediatrics and obstetrics.  In larger sites, challenges arise in complex sub-specialty areas.</p><p> Regarding the implementation of the European working time directive, in 2009, agreement was reached on the introduction of new rostering arrangements.  Since then, significant progress has been made on EWTD implementation.  However, we still have much more to do, which I will address later.  The following has been delivered: the introduction of the new work patterns for NCHDs,  following agreement on a new NCHD contract in 2010; the reduction of tiered on-call; use of cross cover arrangements within general medicine and general surgery; changes to the delivery of medical education and training.  As of January 2013, 80% of NCHDs are in training posts as compared to 40% in 2007; the number of consultant posts has increased significantly by 33% since 2005.  We have gone from 1,947 in 2005 to 2,593 in 2013; since September 2012, employers can roster consultants over the full five out of seven period, which will help reduce NCHD hours; and in January of this year, the national EWTD working group adopted a set of national standards for reducing NCHD hours.  Implementation of these standards will ensure significant progress towards EWTD compliance.</p><p> This year, Ireland has indicated to the European Commission that it is committed to full implementation of the EWTD for NCHDs by the end of 2014.  To progress this, the Health Service Executive, HSE, has established a national implementation group<b></b>chaired by Mr. Ian Carter, who is present, to drive maximum possible EWTD compliance within each hospital.  Each hospital-agency is currently preparing an action plan which identifies the steps to be taken to implement the national standards, other actions that will reduce NCHD hours, and related timescales and accountability.  First drafts are currently being returned and collated. </p><p> There is a particular focus on ensuring that no NCHD has to work more than 24 continuous hours on site after 1<sup></sup>June 2013, and that no NCHD works more than 68 hours in a week by 31<sup></sup>March of this year.  </p><p> A key issue is the extent to which part of the current NCHD workload should be more appropriately delivered by other staff.  As part of that exercise the HSE is requiring hospitals to identify specific non-medical staff in each hospital to lead delivery of phlebotomy, cannulation and catheterisation services, and transport of files, clinical materials etc.</p><p> During the 2013-2014 period, the HSE is engaging with the Forum of Postgraduate Medical Training Bodies and the Irish Medical Organisation to ensure that NCHDs input into the implementation process at national level.</p><p> Medical education and training is a priority for the HSE.  To ensure it is delivered appropriately, the HSE has formal agreements in place with the recognised postgraduate medical training bodies in Ireland regarding the provision of specialist medical education and training to the junior doctor cohort in Ireland.  These agreements, <i>inter alia</i>, define the number of doctors to be trained by each training body both by year of training and by specialty.  These numbers are defined by the HSE following consultation with the training bodies and consideration of current and future workforce requirements for qualified specialists.  </p><p> The HSE invests approximately &euro;14 million in such programmes each year.  This means that, among others, the HSE directly funds the cost of basic specialist training and higher specialist training programmes; increased general practitioner training numbers from 120 to 157 per year in line with GP workforce requirements; in 2013, the HSE has increased the number of intern places from 570 to 639 within existing budgets and employment ceilings; and the HSE has implemented two scholarships programmes specifically targeting NCHDs in their latter stages of training.  That concludes my opening statement and my colleagues and I will take members' questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-05a.311" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/969" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="15:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013030500012#L00200"><p>I join in the welcome to all the representatives of the HSE.  This is the second part of a two-part meeting.  The opening session heard very strong representations from representatives of the non-consultant hospital doctors.  Some 18 months after the last time we met them in October 2011, what they had to record here before the committee today is hugely worrying.</p><p>  It is at least two years or perhaps longer since we adopted emergency legislation to facilitate the recruitment of NCHDs externally to meet a very serious crisis then presenting.  I would like the witness to indicate the position currently regarding the cohort of NCHDs within the system and if we are looking at a further period of difficulty leading into July of this year and the two year anniversary of that initial recruitment in India and Pakistan.</p><p>  Regarding the points made by the NCHD voices earlier, it is important to share those with the witnesses, if they have not already picked up on what they put on the record today.  They have indicated to us that since our last meeting with them in October 2011 little, if any, progress has been made across the list of areas of concern they shared with us at that time.  They have spoken of dangerous and illegal hours.  They have indicated that patient care is being jeopardised - I emphasise "is being jeopardised" - and that "an accident will happen as a result of this working regime and it will have serious and perhaps even fatal consequences".  The seriousness of what they have shared with us, and the way they have followed it through in their support of subsequent commentary, has left the members of this committee fairly certain that this is a serious problem, despite all that Ms McGuinness has put on the record in her contribution.  We cannot fail to ignore their further comment about "consistent and dangerous flouting of the law every day in hospitals around the country".</p><p>  I noted Ms McGuinness in her contribution spoke in statistical terms quoting averages in a number of instances, but the reality for many NCHDs is very different from the ostensible average position.  The reality is as grave as the voices we have already heard have indicated to us.  Ms McGuinness mentioned an average 48 hours.  They spoke earlier about a HSE claim in regard to 54 hours, but the truth is that we are talking about something of the order of 65 hours per week in many instances, and in some cases far exceeding that.</p><p>  They outlined what is required to address the situation immediately as against what we have all acknowledged previously was required in the medium to longer term, that is, a clearly defined career path opportunity with greater numbers of consultant posts to properly accommodate this number of committed young doctors, something which all of us in this committee support.</p> <p>They made two key proposals on what is required now, namely, to introduce a 24-hour on-site shift and to change the roles.  Many of us, from our respective experiences as patients, would know of incidents in which highly trained nursing staff would have been well capable of carrying out many of the functions that non-consultant hospital doctors currently carry out in a number of hospitals.  There is a neat fit with the case presented by the INMO regarding several of these responsibilities.  I refer to the removal of inappropriate tasks from the list of functions and responsibilities currently overburdening non-consultant hospital doctors in many hospitals.</p><p> We have explored further where the signal came from in respect of the EU working time directive.  It may have come from the HSE that the European Court of Justice may well be considering taking a case against Ireland for its failure to adhere to the directive.  Despite the progress being made and the signalled intent to cover much, if not all, of what is required by 2014, it strikes members of this committee that it is inexcusable in 2013 that circumstances remain as they are.  I am concerned not only about the interest of the doctors, their health and ability to carry out their tasks and make professional judgments but also about the interest of members of the public, who depend on a quality service that puts their safety first.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-05a.313" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1150" speakername="Colm Burke" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013030500013#M00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for attending.  It is a very difficult task to organise the entire hospital structure and ensure there is an adequate number of doctors.  Let me refer briefly to structured training.  On the last occasion on which we had a quarterly meeting, I asked for a breakdown of the number of doctors on six-month contracts, 12-month contracts, two-year contracts and three-year contracts but I could not get an answer.  If 80% are on structured training, what is the nature of that training?  Is it still a case of six-month or 12-month contracts?</p><p>  I accept that, with the reconfiguration and restructuring of hospital groups, we will be better off and able to do very much what is being done in the United Kingdom, where one might get a three-year contract, albeit a contract that might cover three or four hospitals.  I fully understand that.</p><p>  With regard to the doctors we brought in from Pakistan and India in 2011, I understand there are more than 230.  I understand these doctors will not be offered unemployment once their two-year contracts end.  I have been told about a case in a particular hospital where there are five or six registrars in anaesthetics.  One is an agency doctor, rather than a locum, and is therefore being paid at the top rate.  Although the doctor was offered a six-month contract, he would not take it because he came in under an agency.  A doctor from Pakistan on a two-year contract would be suited to taking up the registrar post but if one applies the rules the witnesses are talking about applying, that doctor cannot be offered the post.  The hospital has had difficulty filling posts in this particular area.  What do we do in the circumstances?  Do we still continue to pay double for the agency doctor as opposed to offering a job to someone who is, in the hospital's eyes, competent and who has two years' experience?</p><p>  The next issue I wish to raise in regard to recruitment from Pakistan is mentioned in the report.  I am a little concerned about it.  On the last occasion, under the supervised division people had to sit exams.  Under the new arrangement &ndash; this pertains to my question on doctors who have two years' experience &ndash; it is proposed to bring in people who will not be required to sit an exam before they start.  I am open to correction but need clarification on it.  Furthermore, the candidates will have no experience of having worked outside their own countries.  Therefore, we are starting an entirely new process.  Are we losing out as a consequence?</p><p>  The final issue I wish to raise is the major concern of a number of hospitals, smaller ones in particular.  In the past, they were able to carry out their own recruitment, and they were able to do so very well.  They did not have a problem because they were taking recommendations from colleagues and were able take on doctors to fill the vacancies as they arose.  Under the central recruitment system, the small hospitals find they are not necessarily getting doctors of the standard that they used to get.  The knock-on effect is that, where consultants are on a one-in-two or one-in-three rota, nursing staff lose confidence.  This is because the junior doctors are under a lot of pressure and are tired.  Nurses are contacting the consultants on the one-in-two and one-in three rotas and it is now proving very difficult to provide a safe system in the hospitals both in regard to junior doctors and those at consultant level.  While centralised recruitment is great in theory, has there been consultation with the smaller hospitals to try to surmount the difficulties they must deal with the present?</p><p>  In obstetrics and gynaecology in Cavan, there are five registrar posts but only two are filled.  Consequently, there are three vacancies.  There is a problem in Limerick with regard to filling vacancies, and Tralee also has a problem.  This was mentioned in the report.  Could this be clarified?</p></speech>

The presentations of the previous witnesses and Ms McGuinness are chalk and cheese.  One would swear we were talking about two completely different countries or two different topics.  I do not know how to say this without saying something inappropriate but it is obvious that one presentation is not right.  Both could not be right.  A group of young doctors and their representatives told us that conditions are absolutely appalling and that there is absolutely no engagement with the employer.  Obviously, there is engagement because some changes have been made over recent years.  I appreciate that not as many changes have been made as the employer would wish.  What is the nature of the gap that is causing a considerable difficulty with communications?  Is it just standard industrial relations such that both sides are fighting their corner and not willing to give an inch?  Could this be explained?  How could circumstances be improved?</p><p>  Given all the improvements that Ms McGuinness has just detailed, who is responsible for the person who earned &euro;150,000 in overtime last year?  How did this arise?  How could any employer be happy with that scenario?  As a potential patient, I query the position of the HSE, as employer, with regard to the very great concerns the doctors raised with us and mentioned in the media and on Twitter in recent weeks, not only with regard to their physical and mental well-being but also with regard to the patient they must treat at the end of a 24-hour, 48-hour or 72-hour shift?  How concerned is the HSE about that as an employer and provider of services to the patient?  What immediate plans will we see over the course of the next six to 12 months to alleviate the problem?</p></speech>

I welcome the delegates and thank them for their attendance.  However, as other members have noted, it is a different world from that described by the previous representatives and from what members know they are working in.  Anyone who visits hospitals, has relatives or been sick is aware of the real position.  I am a small employer - I had ten employees but now have six - and governed by legislation, as is every other employer.  Health and safety matters such as hazard analysis and critical control point, HAACP, systems, the working time directive and working hours take precedence in any workplace, but no issue is as serious as health.  I have to hand the HSE's report which differs completely from that of the previous delegates.  It contains jargon and nice-speak and makes good use of language and fancy acronyms.  At one time matrons ran hospitals, but the HSE now employs many people who were not there previously.  There are ward managers, bed managers, time managers and every other kind of manager.  That is the problem.</p></speech>

I had meetings with representatives of the HSE on Sunday and Monday.  There is a disconnect in the HSE between those who deliver front-line services and management.  Is there workforce planning because if there is, it is very poor?  Members heard earlier that the HSE had a national working group, but it has only had one meeting with the previous delegates.  We have heard that there has been no proper engagement or no medical engagement.  This happens all the time with the HSE and it dates back to the time of its establishment when this buffer was put in place by a Government of which I accept I was a supporter.  Members had fought for years because they were not getting replies from the Minister who had no responsibility for the HSE.  It is a fact that the HSE appears to be a law unto itself and that it operates outside the law in many areas with regard to health and safety issues.</p></speech>

I am challenging a system that has failed and is failing its employees.  As for the seriousness of this issue, this does not pertain to the position of ordinary employees but affects health care.  In the aforementioned huge system there is a huge disconnect.  Plans are unfurled and one must dig into them to find out the small items of concern to oneself.  They are delivered with huge volumes of paper and there is no consultation.  Clearly, as stated again at this meeting, there is no consultation with stakeholders or those on the front line.  There is no proper workforce planning, except for endless reports, while health and safety issues are being ignored.  It is criminal.</p></speech>

It appears, from members' beliefs or what they have heard in recent years, that a lot of non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, are working a highly dangerous and illegal number of hours.  While health and safety are very important in all aspects of life, they appear to be disregarded to a great extent within the health service.  I will repeat the question I asked earlier: if I was a patient and thought someone had worked for 48 or 72 hours without leaving the hospital, would I have confidence in him or her in carrying out a procedure on me?  I would not.  It appears as though rosters are a huge issue and could be improved a lot, even with a little consultation with non-consultant hospital doctors.  It also appears as though career paths are better laid out in other countries than the manner in which they are structured here.  Is it true there that are not enough medical places for interns this summer?</p></speech>

I apologise for being obliged to leave the meeting for a while.  </p><p>  While I did not hear Ms McGuinness's presentation, it states, "In 2009, agreement was reached on the introduction of new rostering arrangements.  Since then, significant progress has been made."  However, there still is much to do and Ms McGuinness indicated she would address this point later.  I cannot speak for anyone else in the room, but when I attend hospital, either personally or with family members, the first person I always meet is the receptionist, while the second is usually the nurse.  The third is usually a young man or girl in his or her early 20s.  I sometimes feel very sorry for them because they look as though they have been through the mill from the perspective of their own health, having been up all night or the night before because of work.  Earlier members were discussing duty of care in the workplace and its importance for persons being treated and, in particular, the person who is treating my family members or those of Ms McGuinness.  Can Ms McGuinness and the HSE stand over the appropriate care being given by young doctors in accident and emergency units?  If so, what is the reason for the statements from the previous delegates?  While I acknowledge I have only read Ms McGuinness's statement and did not hear her saying it, how can there be such a difference between her statement and those of the previous delegates?  I believe everyone has made the same point in this regard.  To revert to my first point, with whom was the agreement negotiated?  According to the statement, "In 2009, agreement was reached...".  With whom was it reached because obviously the preceding delegates do not agree with this line?  Can the HSE stand over the appropriate services being provided by young people who are in the line of fire in every accident and emergency unit nationwide?</p></speech>

Members heard a different viewpoint from the delegates who preceded the HSE representatives from that provided by Ms McGuinness.  Consequently, they will be interested to hear her responses.</p></speech>

I will collate some of the responses because some of the questions were similar.  </p><p>  As for the difference between the two presentations, I have not had the opportunity to review the Irish Medical Organisation's statement, but what I have presented is factually accurate.  I draw members' attention, because this issue is of significant interest, to the point made on page 4 of the statement that "In this regard, many doctors do not receive adequate daily rest and many more work in excess of the average 48 hour working week".  The aforementioned figure of 48 hours is the requirement under the European working time directive and I have stated the HSE has not delivered or achieved it.  Now that we have the standards which were only concluded in January, we have put together an implementation group to strive towards the 48 hour week</p></speech>

The standards have been submitted to the European Commission and are the standards against which we are measuring ourselves.  Consequently, we have acknowledged that the HSE is not in compliance with the European working time directive with regard to the figure of 48 hours.  We have set out a reason this is the case.  A number of measures must be taken to get there and a number of steps are in play that will help us.  One is the reconfiguration of the hospitals.  The smaller hospitals framework is due to be published in the coming weeks and it will allow us to ensure services will be provided in the appropriate hospital.  In turn, that will allow us to free up some of the time of doctors to work on other sites in order that we will not have the same requirement in respect of hours.  This pertains to hours of attendance, hours of opening, etc.</p><p>  As for the figure of 54 hours to which Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred but to which I did not make reference in my statement, that is an average.  I am conscious that it was based on manual returns and individual audits in the last study we carried out.  Based on the information provided for us by the hospitals, the figure is 54 hours, although many doctors work in excess of that figure.</p> <p>As part of what we are implementing, the first target is to ensure that by 31 March the weekly working hours for doctors are no more than 68, and this will be reduced.  It depends on the rota that is currently there, which is the one-in-three rota.  That is the target we have set.  Each hospital is currently preparing its plans and implementing them to be on track for that.  That is the group that Mr. Ian Carter is chairing for us.</p></speech>

That is what we have said has to be achieved by 31 March.  In order to put that in place there was some discussion about unrostered overtime.  Some of our hospitals have issued instructions that unrostered overtime must be completed on a separate form.  The reason is that it is not sufficient for a doctor to say that he or she did unrostered overtime because the hospital was busy.  More specifics are required.  In fact, clinical directors are engaging with non-consultant hospital doctors ensure that once their rostered work is finished they go home, unless an emergency requires them to be there, such as a cardiac arrest.</p></speech>

Let us say, for argument's sake, that 5 o'clock was the curfew time.  He said he could not leave at that time if a patient was in need of follow-up care.</p></speech>

The Deputy has mentioned that some doctors have received quite significant amounts of overtime payment, which is because they have been working.  In some places, we have small hospitals.  There are specific areas where the number of doctors that support rotas is quite small.  Therefore, this needs to take place together with a reconfiguration of services.  That is why one of the first issues were are addressing is number of hours worked per week.  At other hospital sites it depends on the rota, so by 1 May, if there is a one-in-five rota, a doctor cannot work 60 hours.  It goes right down by 1 June 2013, when the number of weekly working hours will be capped at 48.  We are working through a programme of reduction - it cannot all happen overnight - based on our current configuration of services and how we are delivering.  That is a programme of work that we have set out.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question on averages.</p><p>  The other question was about being on-site for more than 24 hours, which I have also referred to in page 5 of the statement.  I have included that for the committee.  No non-consultant hospital doctor will have to work more than 24 continuous hours on-site after 1 June 2013.  It is at the bottom of page 5.</p></speech>

Will we see this happening?</p></speech>

Mr. Ian Carter is the project manager who is heading up the group.  We also have Dr. Colum Henry, our national clinical lead on this matter, and Professor Eilis McGovern, because part of this concerns the training of more non-consultant hospital doctors, which we are already doing this year.  Mr. Andrew Condon is on the group also, as is Dr. Philip Crowley, who is our head of quality and risk.  That is the group we have put together.  Other stakeholders will also be brought in at various times.  They will be working with each of the hospitals and with regional directors of operations to ensure compliance with this trajectory that we have set out.</p></speech>

Those standards were completed in January 2013.  We are changing rosters and unrostered overtime.  We are doing exactly what one of the Deputies said, because some of the tasks that are currently carried out by junior doctors do not necessarily need to be, including cannulations and catheterisations, as set out in our statement.  Professor Eilis McGovern will speak about the training programme.  There is also an engagement with clinical directors and consultants.  Since 2005, the number of consultants has increased by 33%.  That is the programme, and there will be challenges.</p></speech>

While we have reduced the headcount by nearly 11,500 in the last five years, there have never been more doctors in training in the country.  There have never been more consultants employed in our public health system.  There has never been more money spent in that whole area.  We have had positive discrimination in recruiting consultants and maintaining the numbers of non-consultant hospital doctors.</p></speech>

We have maintained the number.</p><p>  A point was made about recruitment in local hospitals.  It is important to stress that the HSE directly recruits only 15% of all non-consultant hospital doctors.  We clearly told the committee that 60% are placed by colleges directly into training places.  We recruit 15%, which are service posts.  I can confirm for Senator Burke that 70% of that 15% are filled by local recruitment.  All we have is a central applications office, not a central recruitment process.  We get applicants and give them to the local hospitals which then interview them and proceed to make service-level appointments.  That is how it works in that area.  It is important to say that a significant manpower plan is in place with regard to giving effect to a consultant-delivered service.</p></speech>

He asked about the duration of training programmes for the 80% of doctors who are in structured training.  Interns get a one-year contract.  Basic specialty training is either two or three years, depending on the specialty.  Higher specialist training is between four and six years depending on the specialty.  Other than those posts, the other 20% of posts that are not in training - around 1,000 - are non-training by definition or are sometimes referred to as service-grade posts.  Those are invariably one-year contracts, often renewed.</p></speech>

He also gave an example of where there is a vacancy where someone who now has two years of experience could step into that post.  We are bound by the Medical Council regulation, the wording of which is that no doctor may spend more than two years of aggregate time on the supervised division.  There were approximately 290 doctors in total who came into the supervised division through the India-Pakistan initiative and the registration for the first group of those will be complete in September or October of this year.  As that is a statutory instrument, there is not a facility for those doctors to remain on the supervised division.  If they wish to remain in employment in the Irish health service, they must transfer to a different division.  The options are the other divisions, namely, the specialist division, the trainee division or the general division.  For most of them, the vast majority, the only option they have for various reasons is the general division.</p><p>  The third question Senator Burke asked was about the Pakistan initiative that we are introducing in July of this year.  This differs completely from the India-Pakistan recruitment initiative of two years ago.  We felt that we have a tradition in Ireland of training doctors from low and middle income countries - it is not fair even to restrict it to that.  We have a tradition of training doctors from overseas who come to Ireland.  Irish doctors go overseas and they are overseas doctors when they are in America, Canada or wherever.  It is a tradition within international health services.  In Ireland, up until now we have had no structured way of doing that.  Doctors come in a random way, usually singly, and they themselves are not happy with the experience that they get.  There has been a HRB study done of a cohort of these doctors and they come to Ireland for the same reasons that Irish doctors go abroad, to get structured training and career progression, and they are not getting that here in Ireland.  They tend to end up in the service grade posts where they are not getting structured training and they are not able to progress in their careers.  We felt that a better way of training doctors from other countries, what we call international medical graduates, would be to do that in a structured way by developing partnerships with other countries' governments or government agencies.  The HSE signed a memorandum of understanding with the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Pakistan in November 2011.  Under that memorandum, we are carrying out a pilot programme where in July we hope to bring 60 trainees from the training programmes in Pakistan here for two years of structured training.  At the end of that two years, they will return to Pakistan to complete their training and to add value to the health service there, which is analogous to our own doctors, who go abroad who, we hope, will come back to add value to the health system here in Ireland.</p></speech>

This is best exemplified by the IMO boarding pass campaign which saw over 800 NCHDs indicate their intention to leave the Irish health service by signing a symbolic boarding pass to make the point clearly that unless things change there will be more NCHDs in our airports than in our hospitals.  That is a fairly strong statement to make to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children.  Part of the frustration - we saw the "Prime Time" programme a couple of weeks ago, we read the newspaper and we listened here this afternoon - is we are caught between the shore and the sea.  Are there changes happening?  This afternoon the committee was told patient care is being jeopardised.  If that is the case, all of us are culpable because that should not happen in the health service.  I would hope that is not happening.</p></speech>

Patient care, risk to patient and the management of risk is the business of everybody in the hospital and across our entire services, be it the NCHD, the nurse, care assistant or consultant.  It is managed in that way.  We have clinical directors in all of our hospitals and at all times, not only on this issue, there is an assessment of risk and risk mitigation factors put in place.</p><p>  We have acknowledged we are not happy that we have not achieved the 48-hour compliance.  They set out here the significant challenges in dealing with it.  We are saying we have some work done on the rosters that are now there, the reduced on-tier call and the cost cover ranges.  We have those changes made.  We are making more changes in terms of ensuring that the NCHDs are not doing work that could be done by other staff in the hospital.  That, likewise, will free up more hours for the NCHDs so that they need not work extra hours.  Similarly, we are looking at the range of services being provided in our smaller hospitals.  That framework is just ready.  It will be published over the next number of months, as will be the configuration of hospitals.  All of those are on the platform of reducing risk to ensure the safety of services that are being provided.</p><p>  There is much more work to be done.  One of two major measures that we would see as risk reduction - one can never totally eliminate risk - is to ensure that by the end of March there is no doctor working over 68 hours where there are outliers because we have smaller hospitals in quite remote locations that would not have the number of junior doctors in place to support larger rotas than what are currently in place.  The other is, coterminous with that, by June that there would not be anybody working for a full 24 hours.  There is a full range of measures set out.  That is done in co-ordination and in consultation with our clinical directorate.</p><p>  Those are the steps.  Some progress has been made.  There has been quite significant progress in some areas.  There is a road more to travel.  We have committed to travelling that road to ensure that the maximum amount of care can be provided across the hospitals and that we can deliver on the full volume of services that we set out in our service plan, while at the same time balancing the issue of patient safety, which cannot be compromised, and the hours worked by the current cohort of junior doctors that we have in play.  Obviously, that is augmented by the training programme that is in place with our medical, education and training bodies and by the extra NCHDs who are being put in place.  Given the significant challenges of where we are, both financially and in our HR reduction count, we have been putting measures in place in order to protect the patients and we recognise the duty of care to our junior doctors, but there are outliers whom I acknowledged.  There are junior doctors who are working far in excess of 48 hours.</p><p>  Deputy Regina Doherty mentioned one doctor who got overtime to the tune of &euro;167,000 in the south east.  We have looked at that.  In fact, it is not something that should have happened.  What happened in that particular instance is that almost 50% of that was worked by the junior doctor when on leave and it was worked in a different hospital, which is why there was the extortionate amount of overtime.  That hospital, which is in the south east, has reduced its agency and rosters by approximately &euro;2 million.  It is taking the cost out of the system and it is being addressed.  It is an outlier.  It should not have happened.</p></speech>

I heard what Professor McGovern stated.  Is there sufficient confidence that there will be a full complement of NCHDs?  It would be a temporary solution at any time, but here we are, year on year, looking to it to fill the gap.  We will deal with the bigger issue on another day.  Today we merely want certainty that there will be sufficient in situ come July.</p><p>  On the second of the two points, Ms McGuinness made reference to the 24 hour on-site shift.  On the top of page 5, her opening statement states that a key issue is the extent - we were echoing what the NCHDs had stated - to which part of the current NCHD workload is more appropriately delivered by other staff.</p> <p>It then states that the HSE will be requiring hospitals to identify specific non-medical staff.  Why is that still being planned rather than already taking place?  Surely nursing staff should have already been asked to perform phlebotomy, canalisation, catheterisation and other services.  It is something for which the INMO and the NCHDs have argued and I believe they could also take on further responsibilities.  What timeframe is envisaged for this consultation, when will it conclude and when will we see action in this regard?</p><p> In regard to the indication that the European Court of Justice may rule against Ireland on our failure to adhere to the European working time directive, is this part of the stick that is driving some of what we are seeing in the HSE's statement?  How realistic is the fear that such a case may be taken?</p></speech>

They are confined in what they can do in this area.  I outlined the example of Cavan, which has three vacancies for registrars.  The smaller hospitals are not necessarily being given a choice in the CVs that are sent to them and standards have slipped as a result.  Where consultants are on one and two, there is significant pressure on everyone.  The system is not working for the smaller hospitals.</p><p>  I accept what the witnesses have to say in regard to legislation on the supervised division but I ask for clarity on the Medical Council's attitude towards individuals who want to transfer from the supervised division into the general division.  Will it be able to accommodate such individuals?  Previously when people applied to go into the general division they had to undergo a slow procedure with the Medical Council.  Have any arrangements been made with the council on that issue?</p></speech>

How much unrostered, unpaid overtime is being worked by NCHDs at present?  Who is responsible for monitoring what are clearly buckets of hours?  We have all heard anecdotal evidence about particular blackspots in terms of difficult employment conditions in certain areas of the country.  Who is responsible for maintaining the relationship with the human resources people at certain hospitals?  The stories we have been told suggest they have been manipulating circumstances to get more hours out of NCHDs by withholding study leave hours or days off.  Who is responsible for managing that?  There is a definite gap between the evidence given by those who deliver services and the people who are responsible for managing them.  There must be a reason.</p></speech>

As I noted earlier, we never had more consultants in posts and from a salary perspective we are certainly top of the scale in Europe in attractive remuneration packages.  We also offer the capacity for both public and private patients to be cared for in our public health system.  All of this is within the contractual arrangements for consultants, which has to be attractive from the point of view of career development.</p><p>  On the question of who is responsible for rosters, we have invested heavily in medical manpower managers over the past ten years and there is one such manager in every major hospital.  Together with the consultants, they are responsible for developing NCHD rosters.  Obviously, the consultant will sign off on the hours worked, be they rostered or unrostered, and on that basis we have sent out a circular to each hospital directing that hours worked must be paid for once they are appropriately approved by the relevant consultant.</p></speech>

They are a major resource in the hospital and it is appropriate that they be managed and paid correctly and that the hours they work are approved in that way.</p><p>  On the question of removing some of the tasks more appropriate to other grades, I draw the committee's attention to the public service agreement under which we are operating and, in particular, the commitments to skill mixes and having the right people with the right skills to the job.  If the public sector unions approve Croke Park II we will have a significant increase in working hours by the various categories, including NCHDs, consultants, nurses and support staff.  We will have capacity, therefore.</p><p>  I do not think there is a debate over whether nurses are aware of this.  We have invested heavily in medical and nursing education and we have significant numbers of advanced nurse practitioners who are ideally suited to be placed in emergency departments to work beside medical teams and act as decision makers at the same time.  The committee will be interested to note that our emergency departments are the departments that are most compliant with the working time directive.  We are almost completely compliant countrywide in emergency departments with all aspects of the directive.  From that perspective, we are investing in enhancing people's skill sets and we are committed to making tasks more appropriate.  However, one proposition continues to cost more money and more people, whereas the other proposition changes how people work by reforming what they do.  System wide reforms are needed if we are to implement the directive.  It is not simply a matter of telling the NCHD or the nurse to do something different.  NCHDs are integral to these reforms, as is everybody else, but they will have to be led by senior management, clinicians and clinical directors.</p><p>  I will ask Professor McGovern to address the question of retention because she is in a better position to comment.</p></speech>

Momentum began to gain in November 2011, when a workshop was held to specifically consider the issue.  The workshop was attended by all the major stakeholders, including a number of trainees and out of it grew an implementation plan and a steering group.  The trainees are very clear about their needs and these obviously include working conditions.</p> <p>However, they are also anxious, for example, about having clarity about the training journey and Senator Burke mentioned that earlier.  There is definitely progress there.  There is more clarity about the marking systems for entry into training programmes.  They are keen to know the duration of training programmes.  They think they are too long and, again, the training bodies are starting to respond.  The College of Anaesthetists of Ireland introduced a new training programme in July of last year, which is a year shorter and which is what we call seamless, where there is a single entry point and there is not a requirement to do a second interview to get into the second part of the training programme.  The Royal College of Surgeons is introducing a similar programme this July, which again will be a year shorter with a single entry point without the need for a second interview several years down the line.  These programmes are not pyramidal.  They are almost vertical and we want to get away from a system where there is lack of clarity for doctors who start in a certain specialty about whether they will be able to complete that specialty.</p><p> They want to know about job prospects at trainee level and at the end of training when they want to enter the workforce.  The blueprint for that is the Fottrell report, which is government policy.  We will reach the peak number of graduates in 2014, which will be approximately 725.  The report was based on projections, a consultant-delivered service and an enhanced primary care and community-delivered service.  We need to ensure we provide within the training system the capacity to train 725 graduates and that is what we are trying to do.  Over the next few years to accommodate the increased number of doctors, we will need to convert some of the current service grade posts back into training posts in order that every doctor who graduates has clarity about the fact that he or she will be able to access training.</p><p> Communication is one of the things they highlighted.  They felt isolation and a great deal of work is going on to improve the communications between the trainees, the employer, the training bodies and the different stakeholders in their every day lives.  One of the things they highlighted was the need for trust and respect, which is an important message for all of us to take on board, and which is something that should be regarded as a basic right of any employee in any system, and we are listening to them.</p></speech>

Ultimately, the responsibility rests with the group CEO, the hospital CEO or the regional director of operations.  Even though the clinical director plays an important role in that, the ultimate accountability rests with them.  They are very much aware of what is required now in this regard.</p><p>  There is not a monetary sanction.  We will deal with this through the arrangements and the individual meetings with them but we hope not to be in that position.  However, we will have to take that in the context of the soon to be published smaller hospitals framework and the reconfiguration of hospitals.</p><p>  Deputy Regina Doherty asked about the amount we pay in overtime, particularly for unrostered overtime.  The total time we paid to NCHDs in 2012 for overtime, which is not broken down between rostered and unrostered, was &euro;165 million.  We are putting in place a national system and we are going to procurement for it.  Some hospitals have individual systems that cater for the categorisation between rostered and unrostered.

If I am a doctor working in Ballymuckridge and I am being taken advantage of off balance sheet by the person I am working for, where do I go?  Who is there to listen to me?  Who is there to help me to resolve that issue today?</p></speech>

One is quite entitled to bring that to the attention of the appropriate senior manager in the hospital.  We are not in the business of taking advantage of somebody off the books or in some other way.  Getting to working time directive compliance is a challenge but to suggest that we would not show due regard for our employees would not be accepted.  Clearly, there is a requirement on everybody and if there are issues or instances that doctors want to bring to the attention of management, they will be dealt with.</p></speech>

I set out the five phases of recruitment.  Recruitment will take place in South Africa because we have shortages in particular specialties but we are confident that we will have the numbers.</p></speech>

I have three e-mails from parents of NCHDs complaining that their son or daughter has to go away, notwithstanding the fact that some of the them want to travel.  However, in some cases they do not and they feel they have to go.</p></speech>

However, to cope with the Fottrell report numbers and to give graduates certainty, we will work hard to convert non-training posts back to training posts.  It will not be vertical but allowing for the normal attrition that happens at different stages going through a training process, the goal will be that every graduate has access to a training programme, which will, ultimately, result in a certificate of specialist training.</p></speech>

The conditions should have improved with regard to that.  Perhaps we might have a separate discussion with the representation on that.</p></speech>
